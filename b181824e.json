    "Issuing a message via video, the doctor who was falsely accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on women and faced legal as well as professional trials, as a result, said the past four years have been traumatic through no fault of his own. He said the prayers and good wishes from his supporters, relatives and friends kept him going. \u201cEvery up has it\u2019s down,\u201d the doctor said, adding that the support received kept his morale high and helped him to face the challenges.",
    "A decision of the Health Services Committee of the Public Services Commission recently ordered the Secretary to the Ministry of Health to reinstate Dr. Shihabdeen and reassigned him to the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital. The doctor had posted pictures of his first day back at work dressed in blue scrubs on social media.",
