    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is\u00a0yet to appoint a proper legal team that would preside legal cases over any future marine disasters that occur within the island nation\u2019s marine jurisdiction, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.",
    "Sri Lanka has witnessed two worst marine disasters within nine months since 2020 September: MT New Diamond, a very large crude carrier and X-press Pearl MV with large amounts of chemicals.",
    "Rajapakshe said Australian and Singaporean firms are aiding the Attorney General\u2019s Department in the X-press Pearl MV court proceedings and they are sufficient for the foreseeable future.",
    "\u201cWe have enough lawyers in the Department who have done the law of the sea, including some post-graduates,\u201d he told EconomyNext when asked if there any plans to establish a legal team to handle similar events in the future.",
    "Sri Lanka filed a case to seek $6.4 billion compensation from the owners of\u00a0 X-press Pearl MV early this month, after almost two years of the incident.",
    "The move came despite many local legal experts requesting to file the case within Sri Lanka. However, government sources said the decision to file the case in Singapore was due to concerns over enforcement of verdicts by local courts/",
    "Three cases came up yesterday and except for the captain, the others, the lawyers were present.",
    "Sri Lanka became a signatory to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, also known as the MARPOL Convention, which stipulates the implementation of regulations to prevent pollution from oil, large amounts of harmful liquids, harmful substances packed and transported through the ocean, sewage disposal by ships, waste disposed from ships and air pollution caused by ships.",
    "However, the island nation is yet to incorporate the required legislation to administer the MARPOL Convention.",
    "\u201cWe feel that there are some lacuna in the system. One aspect that we covered, the hydro-graphic bill, at the same time we are now studying to strengthen the MEPA law,\u201d he said referring to the Marine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA). (Colombo/May 13/2023)"
