    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will enact key points of its agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) into law upon parliamentary approval, followed by new anti-corruption legislation in May and a new counter-terror law by June, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "A truth and reconciliation commission is also on the cards, the president was quoted as saying at an event in Colombo on Sunday April 02.",
    "The government is looking to have all three ready by June 2023, he said.",
    "Wickremesinghe has also said he does not intend to go for an 18th IMF programme. The cash-strapped island nation is currently on its 17th IMF programme after the international lender\u2019s executive board approved an extended fund facility (EFF) of 2.9 billion US dollars on March 03.",
    "\u201cWe encourage everyone to take a stance on this matter. We propose to support the [IMF] programme, but understand that some may wish to remain neutral. In addition, the main points of the IMF agreement will be enacted into law, and any necessary changes will be presented to parliament. We aim to present the basic aspects of the agreement in May, with information about the programme being disseminated to rural sectors after the [Sinhala-Tamil New Year that falls on April 14],\u201d the president was quoted as saying.",
    "Sunday\u2019s event was held to brief Sri Lanka\u2019s academics and head of economic departments of state universities on the island nation\u2019s 17th IMF programme.",
    "According to the statement, Wickremesinghe had urged local universities to send ten of their most talented economics students to engage with government officials and provide their opinions on the IMF programme. He had also proposed that a group of students be awarded scholarships to attend reputed foreign universities.",
    "Wickremesinghe had also highlighted the need for automation in production and services in order for the country to remain competitive with countries like India and Bangladesh.",
    "The president had called for reforms in Sri Lanka\u2019s education system to realise this ambition.",
    "\u201cThe IMF agreement has been thoroughly reviewed, and those present are knowledgeable enough to provide further explanation. However, any proposed solutions must adhere to the framework established by the IMF. We have been given six months to work within this framework, and it is crucial that we do so. The majority, including farmers and tourism business owners, believe that this is necessary. While trade unions argue against privatisation, if one-third of the money spent on these loss-making institutions was directed towards universities and the education sector, there would be greater progress. Addressing salary issues could also be a part of this effort. Trade unions cannot dictate our policies. We cannot afford to fall behind Afghanistan again; reforms are necessary. Even the opposition acknowledges the need for reform in the country,\u201d Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying.",
    "There has been rising but still somewhat muted opposition towards Wickremesinghe\u2019s IMF-backed reform agenda, largely from Sri Lanka\u2019s influential trade unions and the more left-leaning parties of the opposition. The government has claimed the critics have so far failed to present a viable alternative.",
    "\u201cThe goal of our modernisation programme is to enhance production while maintaining competitiveness, which will require cooperation from all sectors. To this end, we are exploring the possibility of establishing an Agricultural Technical University by merging government research institutes and other institutions. Post-graduate courses could also be established if deemed necessary. This will strengthen the research process and facilitate the incorporation of technology. Let\u2019s unite all sectors and implement this programme together,\u201d the statement quoted Wickremesinghe as saying. (Colombo/Apr04/2023)"
