    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 If Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe is serious about consensus, he must seek the formation of a national government, the United National Freedom Alliance (UPFA) said.",
    "UPFA general secretary and former MP Thilanga Sumathipala told reporters at a press event on Thursday June 01 that, as long as Wickremesinghe was not looking out for the government or looking to save his own positions, he could potentially obtain the support of other parties on some matters of significance.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would oppose such a proposal,\u201d said Sumathipala.",
    "\u201cHowever, any areas that could not be agreed with would be opposed,\u201d he said.",
    "The UPFA, composed primarily of ex President Maithripala Sirisena\u2019s Sri Lanka Freedom Party (UPFA), once led a series of powerful ruling coalitions since the early 2000s until it became politically near-obsolete following the mass exodus of SLFP members to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna in the late 2010s.",
    "President Wickremesinghe has been calling for multiparty support for his reform agenda since he took over in July 2022, but so far, save for a handful of crossovers or hints of coming crossovers, the opposition has largely been giving him the cold shoulder.",
    "However, there has been some speculation that with Sri Lanka\u2019s macroeconomy stabilising since Wickremesinghe took over, more defections to the government from the opposition benches are on the cards, especially in the event an early presidential election is called. (Colombo/Jun02/2023)"
