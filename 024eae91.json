    "\"It's a very rare experience, when it comes to local viewership or the public because you generally see seomthing like Bonsai only in Japan or only through the media so now you have the opportunity of seeing the art of Bonsai locally in one place and also at the same time people who are interested in learning the art of it may visit and meet the experts themselves who have developed this living art, living Bonsai. This year our annual exhibition will open to the public from 10am \u2013 6pm, and I humbly invite all of you who are interested in this art to visit and indulge yourself in the beautiful art of Bonsai,\" said\u00a0Attorney Janaka Basuriya,\u00a0Secretary of the Sri Lanka Bonsai Association.",
    "The origin of Bonsai, the Japanese and East Asian art of growing and training miniature trees in containers,was from the traditional Chinese art form of Penjing. From the 6th century onward, Imperial embassy personnel and Buddhist students from Japan visited and returned from mainland China. They brought back many Chinese ideas and goods, including container plantings. Over time, these container plantings began to appear in Japanese writings and representative art. Following World war II, several trends made the Japanese tradition of bonsai increasingly accessible to Western and world audiences.",
