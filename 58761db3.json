    "\u201cOn the first question on queer rights, as our law now stands, homosexuality is an offense under the Penal Code, but it has not been enforced for the last five decades to my knowledge. Certainly, the government will or will not enforce that law. But now a group of parliamentarians is discussing, and most probably will take action to bring legislation to repeal this provision of the penal code. I know the discussions are going on and maybe at some stage they will bring the resolution, the law, to Parliament,\u201d he said.",
