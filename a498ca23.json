    "Asia Cup matches involving India could be played in Sri Lanka after the cricketing powerhouse refused to visit arch-rival and official host Pakistan, a board official told AFP.",
    "The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is due to make a formal announcement in the coming week after calls for a different venue for India\u00b4s games in the 50-over tournament in September, a Sri Lankan official said.",
    "Neighbours India and Pakistan have not met on either side\u00b4s soil in any version of the game since 2012, and only play each other in international tournaments on neutral grounds. The two cricketing powerhouses have fought three wars since being carved out of the subcontinent\u00b4s partition in 1947, and are bitter political rivals.",
    "\u201cIt is very likely that some of the matches will be in Sri Lanka,\u201d the board official said, asking not to be named.",
    "\u201cBut we have still not officially received confirmation.\u201d Sri Lanka\u00b4s board had expressed willingness to host some Asia Cup matches, despite an economic crisis which forced it to default on its $46 billion foreign debt in April last year.",
    "The official said it had the capacity to conduct an international tournament, even though the island was still emerging from the economic downturn.",
    "The Pakistan Cricket Board had threatened to boycott the World Cup in India, which is due to start in October, if the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) refused to play the Asia Cup in Pakistan a month earlier. The BCCI has since been looking to work out a plan to play the six-nation tournament at a neutral venue."
