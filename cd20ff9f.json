    "A Palestinian national who had invested in a hotel and restaurant in Hikkaduwa, was arrested and was languishing in the Galle remand prison for 14 days with the police not filing charges apparently due to vested, dubious interests, Daily Mirror learns.",
    "The investor requested anonymity fearing possible adverse repercussions from authorities. His crime -the loss of his passport.",
    "On 1 June the Galle Magistrate ordered his release on bail. According to Amith Weerasekera, the lawyer representing the investor, the Magistrate reprimanded the Police, asking them not to waste the time of Court by bringing accused before him without even filing charges.",
    "The investor had mislaid his passport at the time police had asked him to hand it over for inspection. The Palestine Embassy, once the problem was brought to their notice, identified the suspect as being a Palestinian citizen who entered the country on a valid passport with the intention of investing in Sri Lanka.",
    "A few days after his arrest the embassy provided the accused a fresh passport along with letters confirming he (the accused) had indeed lost his passport and the document which was to be presented in court was a valid document.",

The marks on over his body indicated the truth of his statement. It also had no toilet facilities, a single empty bottle served as urinal for the prisoners for each night.",

    "Large investors from Oman were here earlier this year, but the group left alleging corrupt authorities, -bureaucrats and officials- had openly demanded bribes and other kick-backs they had no intention of paying.",
