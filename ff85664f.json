    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is expecting to expand the cultivation of chili with high-yield, disease-resistant variants, with the aim of meeting entire domestic needs by 2025, officials said.",
    "Sri Lanka has an annual requirement of 75,000 metric tonnes for green chili, which is produced domestically.",
    "There is another dried chili requirement of 55,000 MT for which 48,000 MT is imported.",
    "The government\u2019s Mahailluppallama Agricultural Research Centre has introduced two new hybrid chili variants called MICH 1 and MICH 2.",
    "\u201cEarlier the farmers were not showing much preference to grow chili as it is a variety that quickly gets infected with diseases like fungi and viruses,\u201d Agriculture Ministry Media Secretary, Dharma Wanninayake said.",
    "\u201cThe two varieties are resistant to many diseases such as Leaf Curl Complex, which has affected the country\u2019s chili cultivations. The government will easily achieve the target and expectations for a high yield from these chili varieties.\u201d",
    "According to the Wanninayake, if the cultivation process continues properly, in less than five years the government objective can be achieved.",
    "\u201cOur objective for 2023 is to fulfill 20 percent of the requirement of 55,000 kilos, and the rest of 80 percent in the next three years,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has said the country hopes to achieve \u2018self-sufficiency in rice.\u201d",
    "\u201cTo phase out the imports, we launched this program last year, and a lot of money has been set aside for this project, which was happening with the assistance of the youth under the modernization project,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
    "However, countries that pursue self-sufficiency with import and taxes increase the risk of food insecurity. Sri Lanka saw high levels of child malnutrition during the self-sufficiency drive in the 1970s leading to the start of the Triposha program.",
    "Countries that are competitive and able to export foods on the other hand are able to provide cheap food for low-income families.",
    "If import taxes are used to protect farmers, domestic food prices will be higher than the rest of the world and the inability to export excess products may lead to high price volatility.",
    "According to the Global Food Security Index, Sri Lanka\u2019s food security score of 55.2 and ranked 79th place was below that of Singapore (28th), which imports 90 percent of its food, and also stable countries in the Middle East like UAE and Qatar, despite decades of self-sufficiency policies.
