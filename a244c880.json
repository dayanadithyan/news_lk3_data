  "original_body_lines": [
    "Transport, Highways, and Media Minister Bandula Gunawardane raised concerns on the resistance from bureaucrats towards the government's digitization process, which serves as a crucial tool in combating corruption across all levels of the public service.",
    "Making his remarks to Daily Mirror, the minister said that despite calling for Expression of Interest for a project to digitize the railway ticketing process, the relevant officials had been obstructing its implementation.",
    "Minister Gunawardane said that these officials cause unnecessary delays without providing valid or logical reasons. He emphasized that unless action is taken within three months, he would leave it to their discretion to manage the ministry. The minister firmly believes that his presence in the Cabinet serves no purpose if he is unable to execute important projects.",
    "Minister Gunawardane highlighted that the same obstructive behavior from officials has hindered the digitization of the Motor Traffic Department since 2017. This persistent resistance undermines efforts to modernize and streamline government services, impacting efficiency and transparency. (Kelum Bandara)"
