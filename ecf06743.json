    "India did not wait for other bilateral creditors but did \u201cwhat is right\u201d for Sri Lanka\u2019s economic recovery, visiting External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on Friday, following talks with Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Colombo.",
    "\u201cWe felt strongly that Sri Lanka\u2019s creditors must take proactive steps to facilitate its recovery. India decided not to wait for others but to do what we believe is right. We extended financing assurances to IMF to clear the way for Sri Lanka to move forward,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar said.",
    "On January 16, India sent written financing assurances to the IMF, becoming the first bilateral creditor of the island nation to officially support its crucial debt restructure programme after last year\u2019s economic meltdown. The Fund\u2019s provisional $2.9 billion package will be cleared only after Sri Lanka\u2019s official creditors \u2014 China, Japan and India \u2014 have provided adequate financing assurances.",
    "The decision, Mr. Jaishankar said, was a reassertion of India\u2019s belief in the principle of \u201cneighbourhood first\u201d, and \u201cnot leaving a partner to fend for themselves,\u201d which also drove the nearly-4-billion-dollar assistance extended last year, by way of credits and roll overs.",
    "India is \u201ca reliable neighbour, a trustworthy partner, one who is prepared to go the extra mile when Sri Lanka feels the need\u201d, he said and extended Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s invitation to Mr. Wickremesinghe to visit India at an \u201cearly date\u201d.",
    "Speaking at the joint media briefing, where President Wickremesinghe was also present, Sri Lanka\u2019s Foreign Minister Ali Sabry expressed \u201cprofound gratitude\u201d for India\u2019s \u201cenormous support\u201d last year that \u201chelped Sri Lanka regain some measure of economic and financial stability.\u201d",
    "Going forward, India will encourage greater investments in the Sri Lankan economy, especially in \u201ccore areas like energy, tourism and infrastructure,\u201d Minister Jaishankar said, pointing to energy security as one of Sri Lanka\u2019s \u201cmost serious challenges.\u201d",
    "\u201cA search for solutions must necessarily encompass the larger region. Only then will Sri Lanka get the full benefit of scale,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThis country has enormous renewable energy potential that can become a sustainable source of revenue. It has the capability as well for Trincomalee to emerge as an energy hub.\u201d",
    "The two countries have, \u201cin principle\u201d, agreed on a renewable energy framework. A bilateral agreement on raising the limit of the High Impact Community Development Project (HICDP) implemented in Sri Lanka with the support of the Government of India was signed during the External Affairs Minister\u2019s visit, a statement from the President\u2019s office said.",
    "Further, Mr. Jaishankar said he shared India\u2019s \u201cconsidered view that the full implementation of the 13th amendment and early conduct of provincial elections are critical\u201d in regard to political devolution. \u201cDurable efforts towards reconciliation are in the interests of all sections in Sri Lanka. I also spoke of the need to pay special attention to the requirements of the Indian origin Tamil community,\u201d he said.",
    "Apart from meeting with several Sri Lankan ministers, Mr. Jaishankar held discussions with senior politicians in government and opposition, including Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Tamil leaders from the north and east, as well as those representing the  Malaiya (hill country) Tamils."
