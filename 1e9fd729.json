    "\u201cMy name is also being mentioned especially on social media as a candidate for a Governor\u2019s post, but I do not like to talk about myself,\u201d he added.",
    "Asked about a remark made by UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara that all who leave the UNP have been destroyed politically, applies to his father late Minister Gamini Dissanayake as well, the former Minister said his father returned to the UNP and breathed his last on a UNP stage. \u201cThe conflict which my father had with late President Premadasa dragged on because of the action taken by the latter. My father however returned to the UNP and became the UNP Presidential candidate. He breathed his last on a UNP stage,\u201d Dissanayake said.",
