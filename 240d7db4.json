  "original_body_lines": [
    "State Finance Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday assured that eggs imported from India will be sold only to food-related industries at Rs. 30 each.",
    "Procured by the State Trading Corporation (STC), he emphasised that the reduced tax will only be implied to State-sector entities, suggesting that the reduced tax will not apply to private-sector industries.",
    "In a bid to address the acute shortage of eggs in the market and to bring down the soaring prices, the Cabinet of Ministers last month approved the importation of eggs from India.",
    "However, the All Ceylon Egg Producers Association has protested the Cabinet\u2019s decision to import eggs claiming that it would affect the domestic eggs industry.",
    "The egg producers had claimed that the import should have been done several months ago but right now the country is almost self-sufficient with locally produced eggs."
