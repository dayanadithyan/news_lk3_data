    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Consumer Affairs Authority, which drove companies towards bankruptcy and *is disrupting economic activities with price controls is party to the crisis facing a country, Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.",
    "Aggrieved parties may be able to go to the Supreme Court to seek redress, he said.",
    "\u201cIn one way, the Consumer Affairs Authority is a responsible party (wag auth-thara-karu-wek) in the decision-making process of the current economic crisis,\u201d Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana, who held the trade portfolio at one time said.",
    "Minister Gunawardana was responding to a question on how to stop the CAA from disrupting different sectors of the economy with its price controls, and whether they was a mechanism to make the agency accountable for the damage it caused to the economy and eventually consumers.",
    "In its most recent actions, the CAA slammed price controls on eggs as global maize prices rose and the central bank created forex shortages disrupting imports. Farmers then slaughtered layer chicken for meat as egg prices were not high enough to cover feed.",
    "With a collapse in demand for day old layer chicks, hatcheries then slaughtered parent stock.  Separately the CAA also banned the use of rice for chicken feed.",
    "\u201cThe CAA made gas companies sell at below the cost when they were importing at high prices,\u201d Minister Gunawardana said.",
    "\u201cBy trying to do what the CAA said, the gas companies came to the level of bankruptcy. It has also happened to cement.",
    "\u201cAt times when the CAA did not have the skills to decide the price of some goods on a reasonable or logical basis, these decisions have harmed various industries.",

    "Relatred Sri Lanka\u2019s egg price controls hit two generations of chicken",
    "There has to be a broad discussion on how to balance the needs of consumers and producers without causing harm, he said. The problem of chicken farmers have shown that while artificial shortages and monopoly actions have to be countered, there has to be a mechanism to prevent harm.",
    "\u201cI believe aggrieved parties have a right to go to the Supreme Court and complain,\u201d Minister Gunawardana said.",
    "In times of crisis when supplies fall, prices can go higher than costs, if there is demand, expanding margins and incentivizing producers, like farmers to grow more chicken, eventually driving prices down.",
    "Chicken meat prices which went up to around 1600 to 1700 rupees a kilo came down as the CAA did not disrupt price signals and farmers expanded production.",
    "Layer chicken however has a longer production cycle requiring more investments for feed until the flock reaches maturity. Sri Lanka is now importing eggs from abroad. Some egg farmers have since shifted to broiler production according to industry sources.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s poultry production costs are also higher than the rest of the world due to import protection given to maize farmers, pushing up feed prices and killing a potential export industry. (Colombo/Apri19/2023)"
