    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya believes that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) must be restructured but only as long as tender procedures are followed, a party spokesman said accusing the government of not being transparent in its dealings.",
    "SJB legislator Harshana Rajakaruna told reporters on Friday June 02 that deals are being made under the guise of SOE restructuring in the name of economic reforms.",
    "The MP claimed that 14 acres of the Colombo Port was handed over to a Chinese company with no tender process whatsoever.",
    "\u201cApparently, it has already been decided who should get Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC),\u201d he claimed.",
    "The MP did not present any evidence, documentary or otherwise, to back up the claims.",
    "\u201cThere is a concern about handing over profit-making entities to friends. The SJB will stand against this,\u201d said Rajakaruna.",
    "\u201cAs a party, we believe that SOEs must be restructured. But there should be transparency. There should be a tender process,\u201d he said.",
    "Critics of the SJB say the party has been stradling a position of supporting reforms needed for Sri Lanka to recover from its ongoing crisis while taking up populist positions of not \u201cselling national assets\u201d, a leftist euphemism for privatisation. Political analysts say that with the rise of the leftist National People\u2019s Power (NPP) in the wake of the 2022 mass protests, the more fiscally right-of-centre SJB has had to reconfigure its political identity.",
    "This is against a backdrop of rapid reforms proposed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s administration which has announced plans to restructure SOEs across sectors.",
    "Wickremesinghe himself has said that the state has no business doing business as its mandate is to provide services such as education and maintain law & order.",
    "In a televised address to the nation on Thursday June 01, Wickremesinghe said there are currently 430 public enterprises operating in 33 sectors of the economy. These companies employ six percent of the Sri Lankan population, he said, but many of them have garnered monopolistic positions in the market, hindering private investment. Price fixing, inefficient management, and poor entrepreneurship have weakened public finances, turning these institutions into national burdens that are dependent on the taxpayer, he said.",
    "\u201cNotably, entities like the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Ceylon Electricity Board, and SriLankan Air Lines have incurred significant operating losses, equivalent to 1.6 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021. It is unjust to burden the 22 million people of Sri Lanka with this debt. We must urgently undertake necessary reforms in our SOEs to ensure the turnaround and success of these enterprises.",
    "\u201cWe have already initiated the preparation of a restructuring plan for public enterprises. Additionally, we expect the chief officers of these enterprises to be committed to improving their performances. If they fail to meet the annual targets assigned to them, we will not hesitate to replace them with more suitable candidates,\u201d the president said.",
    "The following seven SOEs were reported to undergo a divestment of state-held shares, according to a statement in March 2023:",
    "Litro Gas Lanka Ltd., including Litro Gas Terminals (Pvt) Ltd., (LPG retailing)",
    "The State Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit of the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies was to oversee the process, a statement said.",
    "The SJB and other opposition parties have accused the government of a lack of transparency in the restructuring process.",
    "MP Rajakaruna said the SJB will not allow any underhand deals."
