    "Cargills Bank reported a profit before tax of LKR 206Mn for the financial year 2022, recovering from a loss before tax of LKR 369Mn in the previous year, driven by robust growth in operating income that offset erosions due to increased provisioning and operating costs.",
    "Total operating income rose 74% year-on-year to LKR 4.28Bn on account of growth in both Interest and Fee-based income in similar proportion. The Bank prudently managed its lending portfolio with the intention of preserving liquidity and maintaining asset quality, leading to a slight decline in the portfolio. However, the Bank was able to expand its net interest margins over the previous year, resulting in significant growth in interest income. Meanwhile robust performance in card operations, trade finance and remittances resulted in 75% year-on-year growth in fee-based income.",
