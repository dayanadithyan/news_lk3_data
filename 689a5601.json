    "Calls President\u2019s recent statement on LG polls as the height of absurdity",
    "Says periodic elections are important element to establishing there is democratic governance in SL",
    "Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran has accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Government of using diversionary tactics including the Local Government polls issue.",
    "Holding a press conference in Jaffna over the weekend, Sumanthiran said the President is even using the Local Government election to take the people\u2019s attention away from the issues they are facing due to the cost of living crisis and the imposition of unjust tax structures on them.",
    "\u201cWith regards to the election itself, our position is that periodic elections are an important element to establish there is democratic governance in the country. That can never be compromised by the postponement of elections which is an essential feature of democracy,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cIt is one way in which we can say our Government has a democracy,\u201d he added.",
    "Noting that the treasury released part of the funds required for polls and that the United National Party (UNP) led by Wickremesinghe paid deposits to contest in many electorates while also campaigning in these areas, Sumanthiran said the Minister of Finance and the leader of the UNP, said there are no elections."
