    "COLOMBO (News 1st) \u2013 Former Indian politician Atiq Ahmed, who was convicted of kidnapping, was shot dead along with his brother while talking to reporters on live TV in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. The incident occurred when a gun was pulled near Ahmed's head while he was under police escort.",
    "Three men posing as journalists surrendered after the shots were fired and were taken into custody. Earlier, Ahmed's teenage son was shot dead by the police. Ahmed and his brother were in police custody and were facing murder and assault charges. The incident highlights the ongoing issue of extra-judicial killings by police in Uttar Pradesh. Despite Ahmed's plea for protection, India's Supreme Court declined to hear his petition.",
    "In the past six years, more than 180 people facing various charges have been killed by police in Uttar Pradesh. Human rights activists have accused the police of carrying out extra-judicial killings, which the state government denies. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of prisoners in police custody and the need for a more transparent and accountable criminal justice system in India.",
