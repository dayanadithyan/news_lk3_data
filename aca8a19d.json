    "University of Oxford Professor Stefan Dercon (centre) speaks at the Verit\u00e9 Research seminar. Former World Bank Senior Director for Development Economics and Georgetown University Practice of Development Professor Shanta Devarajan and Verit\u00e9 Research Executive Director Nishan De Mel are also present",
    "In a seminar hosted by Verit\u00e9 Research last week, University of Oxford Professor Stefan Dercon argued that one of the conditions required for economic prosperity is for \u201celites\u201d of a country \u2013 not just political elites, but business leaders, civil society leaders, etc. \u2013 to be convinced that they should shift their focus from maximising their own wealth in the short-term to work toward collective goals of the nation (to \u201cgamble\u201d on the national development project).",
    "This event, titled \u2018Gambling on the Elite Bargain for Sri Lanka\u2019s Development\u2019, took place on 7 March, at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, with the attendance of many business leaders, academics, political leaders and intellectuals.",
    "Speakers at the event included former World Bank Senior Director for Development Economics and Georgetown University Practice of Development Professor Shanta Devarajan and Verit\u00e9 Research Executive Director Nishan De Mel.",
    "The event explored Dercon\u2019s recent book, \u2018Gambling on development: Why some countries win and others lose\u2019 and how it applies to Sri Lanka\u2019s context.",
    "Dercon identified an \u201celite bargain\u201d as a necessary precondition of the economic success of various countries including China, Indonesia and Bangladesh, who otherwise followed rather diverse pathways to economic development. The key feature of the \u201celite bargain\u201d is that it drives accountability to ensure an effective strategy for growth and development.",
    "Speaking on Dercon\u2019s theory in the context of Sri Lanka, Devarajan highlighted that the \u201celite bargain\u201d in Sri Lanka must consider some of the core demands of the Aragalaya, and occur in public interest \u2013 accountability from Government, empowering of the poor, and avoiding the elite capture of assets.",
    "He also highlighted that cooperation and consensus among Sri Lanka\u2019s elite groups are crucial, particularly in the context of structural changes such as reforming Samurdhi and devising an effective, targeted cash transfer program for the poor, expanding Sri Lanka\u2019s higher education sector and challenging the Paddy Lands Act to economically empower farmers in the country.\u00a0 In his remarks, De Mel emphasised that, in Sri Lanka\u2019s recent history, the existing bargain driven by the elites has failed the national development project in four ways and if not corrected, will create further risk for the country."
