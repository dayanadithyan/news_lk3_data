  "original_body_lines": [
    "Top cops claim transfers have been carried out with malicious intent",
    "Claims transfers are not in accordance with transfer procedures in Police Ordinance and are therefore illegal",
    "SDIG Ajith Rohana has accused Public Security Minister of ordering his transfer and attempting to safeguard one SDIG at the cost of others",
    "Southern Province Senior DIG Ajith Rohana and Central Province Senior DIG Priyantha Weerasooriya have written to the Sri Lanka National Police Commission (NPC) and are challenging the recent transfer orders issued to them.",
    "The duo and five other senior officers were abruptly transferred to other divisions yesterday. The two senior cops are challenging the transfers, claiming the transfer order issued by the Secretary to the Public Security Ministry is not in accordance with transfer procedures and is therefore illegal. Writing to the Commission, Rohana and Weerasooriya both requested the NPC Chairman Chandra Fernando to not approve the transfers and said they have been issued with malicious intent.",
    "In his letter, Rohana accused Public Security Minister\u00a0 Tiran Alles of ordering his transfer. He called the decision made by the Minister \u2018malicious, arbitrary and unreasonable\u2019. In the letter, Rohana revealed details about unfounded criticisms levelled against him by the Minister at recent meetings and said it was implied he would be transferred. The senior officer also requested the NPC to compare the statistics of Police work in the Southern Province headed by him to the Western Province to conduct their own analysis of these allegations levelled against by the Minister.",
    "He also accused the Minister of harassing other Senior DIGs to protect one Senior DIG. Rohana has also written to the Ministry Secretary, opposing the transfers and legally challenging her orders under provisions relating to transfers in the Police Ordinance.",
    "Meanwhile, Senior DIG Priyantha Weerasooriya in his letter to the NPC called his transfer malicious, illegal and unfair. Weerasooriya noted that the issuing of transfer orders by a Ministry Secretary without the prior approval of the NPC is demeaning to Police officers and also harms their work capacity.",
    "He highlighted that he received several transfers in a short span of time and that these were once again issued by the Ministry Secretary. He called on the NPC to not allow this irregular process to continue. The top cop stressed that these issues have led to disappointment and disillusionment among the Senior DIGs. However, the NPC has not yet made any decision regarding the requests to cancel the transfer orders."
