    "INSEE Cement Sri Lanka\u2019s CEO Jan Kunigk handing over a copy of the Sustainability Report 2020/2021 to the Secretary, Ministry of Environment Dr. Anil Jasinghe \u00a9 INSEESL/2023/T.G.P. Deepal Indika",
    "INSEE Cement Sri Lanka is forging ahead with a \u201cgreen\u201d ambition to fulfill its economic, environmental, and social responsibilities to the people of Sri Lanka and become one of the foremost sustainability advocates in the country by 2030.",
    "In its recently released Sustainability Report 2020/2021, INSEE Cement highlighted significant and tangible progress in the areas of climate and energy, strengthening the circular economy and protecting biodiversity and water. Additionally, the report includes concrete actions taken to ensure the occupational health and safety of its workforce and galvanize communities and other stakeholders, which are key aspects of INSEE Cement\u2019s 2030 sustainability ambition.",
    "Delivering the keynote address at an event to mark the report\u2019s launch, Secretary to the Ministry of Environment Dr. Anil Jasinghe highlighted the important role of corporates in climate action and appreciated the significant efforts INSEE Cement has accomplished. \u201cThe future of this country is in the hands of green development. This does not mean compromising on economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cIndustries must contribute to nationally driven efforts on green development. If not, we run the restrict of losing out our competitiveness in the global market. A very important aspect is ensuring good governance pragmatically and rationally.\u201d",
    "Speaking at the event, INSEE Cement\u2019s CEO Jan Kunigk described how INSEE confronted head-on the challenges of the pandemic period and put in place the necessary health and safety measures to continue sustainability and biodiversity conservation efforts. \u201cRather than allowing COVID-19 challenges to consume us, we focused on supporting vulnerable communities in areas we operate, while innovating and investing in staying the course in our sustainability ambition,\u201d he said.",
    "INSEE Cement\u2019s CEO also noted the important role of the company\u2019s waste management arm, INSEE Ecocycle in taking others along on the sustainability journey. \u201cFollowing the expansion of our Ecocycle operation in 2020, we now offer end-to-end solutions to customers, to support the systematic collection of fast-moving consumer goods waste and post-consumer waste and transform it into alternative energy and other valuable resources. So far, we have served over 1000 customers in co-processing and eliminated over 1,000,000 metric tons of industrial waste, which otherwise would have ended up in landfills.\u201d",
    "The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is a key partner in INSEE Cement\u2019s sustainability and biodiversity conservation efforts. IUCN Sri Lanka\u2019s Country Representative Dr. Shamen Vidanage highlighted the importance of such partnerships. \u201cWe provide technical knowledge, so INSEE Cement can venture on this sustainability and biodiversity conservation journey along the right path. As a result, we have science based initiatives field tested for many years and now emerged as best practices in ecosystem restoration, ecological monitoring and coral reef restoration. The commitment of corporate partners like INSEE Cement is imperative. If we don\u2019t take the right actions towards sustainability and environmental conservation today, we will face far greater challenges in the not-so-distant future.\u201d.\u201d",

    "INSEE\u2019s efforts to reduce CO2 emissions in its product profile have seen the Company go beyond the conventional product innovation strategies to adopt a more holistic approach to reduce the carbon footprint of its products. In 2021, this drive to innovate led to the development of Sri Lanka\u2019s \u201cgreenest\u201d cement, INSEE Sanstha Portland Composite Cement.",
