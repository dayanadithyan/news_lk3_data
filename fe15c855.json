    "The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka has decided to form a \u2018human chain\u2019 (\u2018Jana Pavura\u2019) as today (April 21) marks the fourth commemoration of the ghastly bombings on Easter Sunday 2019 which claimed the lives of hundreds and left a long-lasting void in the families and friends of terror attack victims.",
    "The \u2018human chain\u2019 is organized in support of the Catholic Church\u2019s quest to seek the long overdue truth behind the brutal carnage on April 21, 2019, and justice for the victims.",
    "The Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has invited all Sri Lankans to join hands with the \u2018human chain\u2019 today.",
    "The campaign, themed \u201cWe are Watching until Justice is Meted Out\u201d, was initiated at 8.00 a.m. this morning and it will be formed from St. Anthony\u2019s Church in Kochchikade to St. Sebastian\u2019s Church in Katuwapitiya along the Colombo-Negombo main road.",
    "A two-minute silence will be observed at 8.45 a.m. in memory of the victims of the brutal terror attack.",
    "Meanwhile, a march was organized from St. Sebastian\u2019s Church in Katuwapitiya to St. Anthony\u2019s Church in Kochchikade last night and a special church service was also held in parallel with the march.",
    "The country was left devastated on April 21, 2019, after a group of suicide attackers of the now-outlawed local Islamic extremist organization National Thowheed Jamaat (NTJ) carried out a series of coordinated bomb blasts at St. Anthony\u2019s Church in Kochchikade, St. Sebastian\u2019s Church in Katuwapitiya, Zion Church in Batticaloa, Cinnamon Grand, Kingsbury and Shangri-La hotels in Colombo and a guest house in Dehiwala, leaving more than 260 people including foreigners dead and at least 500 people injured.",
    "Sri Lanka declared a state of emergency immediately after the bombings and the probes launched into the incident led to the arrest of many who have had links to the suicide bombers.",
    "The Sri Lankan Catholic Church led by Cardinal Ranjith and the families of the victims have continuously raised concerns and doubts about the slow progress of the investigations into the attacks, accusing the government of sweeping the truth under the rug for political gains."
