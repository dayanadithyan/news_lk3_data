    "The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka has initiated a \u2018human chain\u2019 (\u2018Jana Pavura\u2019) as today (April 21) marks the fourth commemoration of the ghastly bombings on Easter Sunday 2019 which claimed the lives of hundreds, leaving a long-lasting devastating void in the families and friends of terror attack victims.",
    "The \u2018human chain\u2019 is organized in support of the Catholic Church\u2019s quest to seek the long overdue truth behind the brutal carnage on April 21, 2019 and justice for the victims.",
    "The Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has invited all Sri Lankans to join the campaign today.",
    "The \u2018human chain\u2019, themed \u201cWe are watching until justice is meted out\u201d, commenced at 8.00 a.m. this morning and it will line up from St. Sebastian\u2019s Church in Katuwapitiya to St. Anthony\u2019s Church in Kochchikade on the Colombo-Negombo main road.",
    "A two-minute silence will be observed in memory of the victims of the brutal terror attack.",
    "Meanwhile, a march was organized from St. Sebastian\u2019s Church in Katuwapitiya to St. Anthony\u2019s Church in Kochchikade last night and a special church service was also held in parallel with the march.",
    "The country was left devastated on the 21st of April in 2019 after a group of suicide attackers of the now-outlawed local Islamic extremist organization National Thowheed Jamaat (NTJ) carried out a series of blasts at St. Anthony\u2019s Church in Kochchikade, St. Sebastian\u2019s Church in Katuwapitiya, Zion Church in Batticaloa, Cinnamon Grand, Kingsbury and Shangri-La hotels in Colombo and a guest house in Dehiwala, leaving more than 260 people including foreigners dead and at least 500 people injured.",
    "Sri Lanka declared a state of emergency immediately after the bombings and the probes launched into the incident led to the arrest of many who have had links to the suicide bombers."
