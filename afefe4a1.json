    "Peiris was informed of tomorrow\u2019s AGM by the SLPP General Secretary last week",
    "MP claims any decisions taken at the AGM will be invalid, null and void",
    "Says he has reserved the right to resort to appropriate legal proceedings in this regard",
    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G. L . Peiris has informed the party that he intends to challenge the legality of its Annual General Meeting, which is scheduled to take place tomorrow.",
    "He informed the party he will take appropriate legal action in court on the basis that the decisions taken in the General Assembly are invalid, null and void. The AGM has been convened by the SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam.",
    "Peiris said the SLPP AGM is not constitutional and decisions taken at this meeting are null and void and have no legal effect.\u00a0 He has reserved the right to resort to appropriate legal proceedings in this regard. On 11 April, Kariyawasam is said to have informed Peiris in writing that the SLPP\u2019s Annual General Meeting for 2023 will take place at No. 1316, Nelum Mawatha, Battaramulla, starting from 10:00 a.m. on 22 April. In September 2022 the SLPP Chairman along with 13 other Government MPs decided to sit with the Opposition in Parliament as an independent group. The relationship between Peiris and the SLPP has been acrimonious since. In March the party announced that the Executive Committee of the SLPP had decided to remove Prof G. L. Peiris from his post as the Chairman of the party. However, Peiris claimed to have not been informed of such a decision and threatened to take legal action if any attempt was made to remove him from the post."
