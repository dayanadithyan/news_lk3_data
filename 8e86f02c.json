    "The Dutch companies are eager to explore investment opportunities in renewable energy, eco-labelling and sustainable agriculture, if Sri Lanka can showcase a corruption-free business environment, Ambassador to the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Sri Lanka Bonnie Horbach stated at a meeting with the leadership of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, during her visit to the Chamber recently.",
    "Ambassador Horbach highlighted the importance of engaging with the EU Green Deal and upcoming mandatory Responsible Business requirements most of the EU countries are now looking at. The Ambassador assured that the Dutch Government continues to implement existing projects in the areas of training and technology transfer especially in the agricultural sector including the poultry industry in Sri Lanka.",
    "Responding to Ambassador Horbach\u2019s interest in facilitating high level bilateral business engagements including organising of a business promotion mission to the Netherlands by the Dutch Embassy in 2023, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chairman Vish Govindasamy requested the Ambassador\u2019s support to enhance exports and tourism. The Chamber Chairman appreciated the support received by the dairy industry in Sri Lanka through various projects implemented by the Embassy of the Netherlands and requested similar assistance to identify opportunities for the agri sector including bilateral business engagements such as B2Bs and joint ventures in the Netherlands."
