    "The second round of the Investor Facilitation Coordinating Committee Meeting chaired by Investment Promotion State Minister Dilum Amunugama concluded recently at the Investor Facilitation Centre (IFC), where the State Minister stepped into iron-out concerns raised by investors pertaining to seeking approvals for investment projects.",
    "During the meeting, issues faced by four BOI companies operating in diverse sectors such as manufacturing (circuit manufacturing) and seafood processing, were tabled and taken into consideration.",
    "State Minister Amunugama directed the officials of pertinent line agencies to expedite the actions to swiftly resolve the pending issues of the investors.",
    "\u201cMeetings of this nature are opportune, which can enhance collaboration and synergy with investors, thereby boosting their confidence to explore new avenues of investment opportunities in Sri Lanka,\u201d State Minister Amunugama stated at the meeting.",
    "Meanwhile, the investors pointed out the significance of conducting review meetings of this nature to appraise stakeholder projects that are being implemented and to address the concerns of the investors.",
    "Speaking at the meeting, BOI Director General Ms Renuka M. Weerakone appreciated the presence of the officials of line agencies and their efforts to facilitate the investors in doing business in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cThe very reason behind the idea to establish the IFC is to fast-track approvals with respect to investment projects and offer investors a one-stop shop service while imparting greater transparency in the FDI proposals and removing administrative impediments. As such, the BOI as the catalyst and facilitator has made a giant leap forward in investor facilitation by setting up the IFC,\u201d Ms Weerakone stated.",
    "These facilitation meetings are regularly conducted to get definite timelines for resolving queries related to investment projects under the chairmanship of the Investment Promotion State Minister and with the attendance of BOI officials, relevant ministry and line agency officials, concerned investors, and other stakeholders. The first Investor Facilitation Coordinating Committee Meeting was held in January with the participation of relevant officials."
