    "The Department of Physics and Electronics of the University of Kelaniya, has created a revolutionary product, the \u201cSmart Remotely Controllable Ceiling Fan Regulator.\u201d",
    "This innovative device replaces conventional manual regulators, without requiring any alterations to the electrical wiring system.",
    "The \u201cSmart Remotely Controllable Ceiling Fan Regulator\u201d is a game-changing product, providing unparalleled convenience to users. This product was first developed by undergraduate student Kelum Perera during his Honours degree final year research project under the supervision of Professor Sudath Kalingamudali. Thereafter, Nuwangi Cooray modified the product using Bluetooth technology with a mobile application. This was followed by Dr. Kasun Piyumal, Supun Gunarathne, and Geethanjana Wanigasekara who further developed it for commercialisation.",
    "OREL Corporation Ltd., the leading manufacturer in the Sri Lankan electrical industry, recently entered into a patent license agreement to introduce this cutting-edge product into the market that has the potential to transform the ceiling fan regulator market and bring about a significant improvement in the quality of life for customers. OREL, with its advanced research and development facilities and robust business development capabilities, aims to spearhead the promotion of this ground-breaking product in both local and international markets. Orel has introduced this unique product to their product portfolio under Orange Electric Odessa range, which caters to the premium customer segment.",
    "The notable feature of this innovation is that it has a \u201csmart control\u201d feature which enables it to operate the regulator using the smartphone or tablet PC, connecting to ORELHOME App, via Bluetooth or WiFi. This wireless control feature offers unparalleled convenience, allowing the ceiling fan to be regulated from the comfort of a couch or bed.",
    "\u201cAt the Business Development Division of OREL, we believe that synergy and collaboration are the winning formulas to grow businesses in multiple folds, during trying circumstances. We are happy to nurture such innovations of the country and pave its path to commercialisation, which will in turn benefit not only our organisation and the university, but the entire country as whole\u201d stated OREL Corporation Director \u2013 Business Development Gamini Ranasinghe.",
    "\u201cWe are extremely happy to collaborate with a giant in the Sri Lankan electrical industry to commercialise this innovation and with its wider global presence and the greater brand equity of Orange Electric, we strongly believe our innovation will have a global reach. We have taken a generous step of formulating a department fund to support and nurture such innovations to commercialisation. When many innovations in the country have failed due to lack of a support system for commercialisation, our collaboration creates a greater inspiration for all budding inventors to innovate many in the future\u201d said University of Kelaniya Dean of the Science Faculty Prof. Sudath Kalindamudali.",
    "This venture represents the university\u2019s dedication to innovation and excellence, and Orel Corporation\u2019s mission of supporting local universities on creating inventions and solutions that address public needs. Orel Corporation Managing Director Kushan Kodituwakku added, \u201cInnovation is in the lifeblood of OREL and our teams constantly search for solutions for the future requirements of the mankind may it be in the spheres of artificial intelligence, sustainable energy, IoT etc. The license agreement signed with the university for the \u201cSmart Remotely Controllable Ceiling Fan Regulator\u201d is a testament to our commitment to this mission, and we are proud to be a part of this ground-breaking innovation that will revolutionise the ceiling fans market in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
