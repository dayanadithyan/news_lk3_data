    "The All-Island Fireworks Manufacturers Association (AIFMA) said the manufacturing of fireworks has dropped by 20 percent compared to previous years.",
    "AIFMA President Dinesh Fernando told the Daily Mirro that manufacturing has dropped as the required raw materials had not been received even by December last year.",
    "\"However, we received the raw materials by January this year and therefore we managed with the production and have already begun distributing our products countrywide,\" he said.",
    "\"There is a higher demand for fireworks items for this new year,\" he added.",
    "\"Therefore, this new year's season can be considered better when compared to the seasons after 2019. We were unable to maintain our production due to the Easter Sunday attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Fernando said.",
    "However, it was reported that the price of fireworks has considerably increased in the market. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
