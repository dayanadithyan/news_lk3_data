    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has requested President Ranil Wickremesinghe to have an expert committee review a proposed anti-terrorism bill that has drawn some criticism over its definition of terrorism among other concerns.",
    "SLPP general secretary and MP Sagara Kariyawasam told reporters on Tuesday April 11 that the party will under no circumstances support any bill that can restrict people\u2019s freedom of expression and their ability to democratically win their rights.",
    "\u201cWe are firmly of the opinion that there should be some limitations when defining terrorism in this bill. If the act allows for any action to be interpreted as an act of terrorism, it would not be suitable for a democratic society,\u201d said Kariyawasam.",
    "The MP claimed that not even Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe appeared to have confidence in the bill.",
    "\u201cAs a party we ask the president to review the bill, appoint an expert committee on it and work to bring a bill that isn\u2019t undemocratic,\u201d said Kariyawasam, adding that a government introducing new legislation should confidence in what they\u2019re proposing.",
    "The SLPP\u2019s request to the president comes against a backdrop of the party allegedly being divided on its continued support for President Wickremesinghe, at least according to opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Nalin Bandara.",
    "Bandara told reporters on Monday that a section of the SLPP has already decided to back Wickremesinghe at a future presidential election while another faction is still loyal to the Rajapaksa family that controls the party.",
    "Bandara\u2019s remark comes amidst intense speculation of an imminent split in his own party, the SJB, which according to some media reports is on the verge of seeing some defections to the government.",
    "Human Rights Watch recently criticised the proposed act, calling for its withdrawal. The act, if passed, would empower the authorities to systematically violate fundamental human rights, the international human rights watchdog said.",
    "Human Rights Watch calls for withdrawal of Sri Lanka\u2019s new anti-terror billSee more",
    "The new law has also drawn criticism from various other quarters including opposition parties and civil society. Human rights activists both local and international have repeatedly called for the repeal of the island nation\u2019s existing Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), which critics have called draconian. Successive governments have been accused of using the PTA to stifle dissent, and some activists have expressed fear that the new bill would be no different, though the new bill\u2019s backers contend that it is an improvement.",
    "The new act is intended to replace the PTA. (Colombo/Apr11/2023)"
