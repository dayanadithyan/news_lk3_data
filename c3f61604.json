    "Addressing a media briefing in Colombo, Ratnapriya noted that the participation of trade unions from the outset is essential to draft the relevant Bill containing the amendments.",
    "\u201cOur country\u2019s labour law is quite old. It needs to be revised,\u201d Ratnapriya said adding that despite making small changes, the labour law has not been revised in its entirety to suit the modern world.",
