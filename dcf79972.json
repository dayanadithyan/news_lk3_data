    "Sri Lanka has an immense potential to achieve economic growth and development. One of the key indicators of a country\u2019s economic prosperity is its per capita income. The goal of achieving a per capita income of $12,000 in Sri Lanka requires a concerted effort from multiple sectors over a period of time. Politicians must effectively communicate their plans and ideas to voters, while voters must educate themselves on the policies and plans put forth by different political parties and candidates, and hold them accountable for following through on their promises.",
    "In order to achieve this goal, Sri Lanka will require the participation and support of all its citizens, including policymakers, employers, educators, and workers. Dhammike Perera, Dr. Rohan Pallewatta, and Mrs. Shirmila Gonawela have all been vocal about the importance of this goal, but it is clear that more needs to be done to ensure that voters understand the plan and how it will benefit the country.",
    "Sri Lanka can ensure that its citizens are equipped with the necessary skills and qualifications to contribute to the country\u2019s economic growth is to develop a national skill inventory. Countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Singapore have all developed their own national skill inventories, which have helped to identify skills gaps, make informed policy decisions, and match job seekers with job openings. (www.O\u2019net.net) A national skill inventory is a database that tracks the skills and qualifications of a country\u2019s citizens. It can include information on occupations, industries, and education and training programs, as well as data on the supply and demand for various skills in the labour market.",
    "Some countries may not have a formal national skill inventory, while others may have multiple systems in place. Sri Lanka can benefit from a national skill inventory and a competency framework connected to the national primary and tertiary education system in several ways.",
    "Firstly, it can help bridge the gap between what is being taught in schools and universities and the skills and knowledge required by the labour market, improving alignment between education and industry needs.Secondly, it can help policymakers better understand which skills are in high demand and where there are skills gaps in the labour market, allowing for better targeting of education and training resources.",
    "Thirdly, it can establish common standards and qualifications for different jobs and occupations, increasing mobility and flexibility for workers. Finally, it can provide data on the performance and outcomes of education and training programs, enabling policymakers to evaluate their effectiveness and make improvements as needed. The Sri Lanka Labour Force Survey 2019 conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics revealed that the total number of employed persons in Sri Lanka was approximately 8.5 million. This includes both men and women and encompasses both urban and rural areas. The survey also revealed that the unemployment rate in Sri Lanka was 4.6%, indicating that there is room for improvement in terms of job creation.",
    "In terms of average income, data from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka indicates that the average monthly income of a Sri Lankan worker in 2020 was LKR 57,579 ($290). However, this varies greatly depending on the sector and industry in which the worker is employed. For example, the average monthly income of a worker in the manufacturing sector was LKR 40,814 ($205), while the average monthly income of a worker in the finance and insurance sector was LKR 117,393 ($590). In order to achieve a per capita income of $12,000, Sri Lanka will need to focus on creating high-quality jobs in high-growth industries. A new national skill inventory aiming at earning of 1000 $ a month.",
    "The emerging Gig economy can provide valuable data on the skills in demand by analysing the types of jobs and services that people are willing to pay for, and it can offer opportunities for flexible work arrangements, leading to more job opportunities and higher incomes for individuals in Sri Lanka. By developing a new national skill inventory based on the demands of the Gig economy, policymakers can help match people with the skills and abilities that are needed to earn an income of $1000 per month.",
    "This will require investment in infrastructure, education, and training, as well as a focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. It will also require cooperation and collaboration between the public and private sectors, as well as a commitment to creating a more equitable society for all Sri Lankans Increasing per capita income to $12,000 across all 25 districts of Sri Lanka is an ambitious goal that will require a coordinated effort across multiple sectors.",
    "Here are some steps that could be taken to achieve this goal:",
    "1. Develop a comprehensive national skill inventory and competency framework: A comprehensive understanding of the skills and qualifications of Sri Lankan workers is essential to identifying the areas where upskilling is most needed. A national skill inventory and competency framework can provide the necessary data to inform policies and programs that target the specific skills needed for higher-paying jobs.",
    "2. Expand access to education and training: Increasing the availability and accessibility of education and training programs is essential to upskilling the workforce. This can include expanding vocational training programs, providing more scholarships and grants for higher education, and investing in lifelong learning opportunities for workers at all skill levels.",
    "3. Foster innovation and entrepreneurship: Encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship can help create new industries and job opportunities, as well as increasing productivity and efficiency in existing ones. This can involve supporting start-ups and small businesses, providing incentives for research and development, and fostering an environment that encourages innovation.",
    "4. Address infrastructure gaps: Improving Sri Lanka\u2019s infrastructure, such as transportation networks and digital connectivity, can help connect workers to higher-paying jobs in other regions and countries. This can include investing in new highways and rail links, expanding access to high-speed internet, and developing new logistics and transportation hubs.",
    "5. Strengthen labour protections and social safety nets: Ensuring that workers are protected and supported can help increase productivity and encourage higher-paying jobs. This can include strengthening labour laws and regulations, providing access to health care and social services, and establishing minimum wage standards.",
    "6. Encourage foreign investment: Attracting foreign investment can help create new jobs and increase productivity, as well as opening up new markets for Sri Lankan exports. This can involve offering tax incentives and other benefits to foreign investors, streamlining bureaucratic processes, and investing in infrastructure and training programs that make Sri Lanka an attractive destination for foreign businesses.",
    "Different strategies may be needed to address the specific challenges faced by different regions and industries in Sri Lanka. However, by working together, policymakers, educators, employers, and workers can help increase per capita income and improve the economic prospects of all Sri Lankans.",
    "Another important consideration is the young adults of Sri Lanka who have been severely affected by the prolonged exams due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These individuals are the immediate future leaders of our nation, and they deserve better support. The government must explore options for merging the GCE Ordinary Level (OL) and Advanced Level (AL) exams to create a single exam for tertiary education qualification.",
    "To accomplish this, Sri Lanka could develop a certification system (certification of global employability \u2013 CGE) that evaluates both academic knowledge and job-ready skills through a combination of theoretical assessments, practical exams, and work-based learning experiences. The system should be appropriately named to reflect its purpose and emphasize the importance of both academic knowledge and job-ready skills.",
    "To successfully implement the proposed new system, a feasibility study should be conducted, a comprehensive education and job readiness curriculum should be developed, and the new exam should be implemented and evaluated for effectiveness. This will allow young adults in Sri Lanka to take one exam to qualify for tertiary education and pursue a suitable career that aligns with their life goals.",
    "The voter groups must come forward and request all political parties as to how they are going to increase per capita income and will they meet the challenge by 2030 at least. As a united family of Sri Lankans, it\u2019s imperative that we strive towards achieving the ambitious target of 12000 USD per capita.",
