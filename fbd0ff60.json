    "The crisis-hit island has secured financing assurances from all its major bilateral creditors, including India and China, and so had set the stage for the IMF to give its final approval for a $2.9 billion, four-year bailout package on March 20, the multilateral lender said on Tuesday.",

    "\u201cWe are trying to finalise this in about the next six months\u2019 time, so before the next (IMF) review will be completed,\u201d he said."
