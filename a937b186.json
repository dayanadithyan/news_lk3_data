    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 There has been no change in fuel demand in the country even though the quota was increased three weeks ago due to the New Year holidays, Sri Lanka Ministry of Power and Energy said.",
    "The quota that was increased in the first week of April for the New Year festive season has been decided to continue until further notice.",
    "\u201cEven though the quota was increased, it has been realized that the monthly demand has not gone up after analyzing the data of the past three weeks of April and daily output is also equal to the previous output,\u201d the Ministry said in a statement.",
    "\u201cThe misuse of the QR code has also gone down after the amount was increased.\u201d",
    "The Ministry added that, prior to increasing the fuel quota, 24 percent of petrol and 28 percent of diesel in stations were issued without a QR code, and it has been reduced to 14 percent and 15 percent respectively following the increment.",
    "Sri Lanka introduced the quota system in August last year to limit fuel consumption as it ran out of petrol and diesel due to foreign currency shortage. The government\u2019s declaration of sovereign debt default also deprived the state-run fuel retailer Ceypetco of receiving fuel on credit as many foreign banks refused to open corresponding Letter of Credit.",
    "However, the government had been expecting the tight situation to ease after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $3 billion loan last month. (Colombo/Apr 25/2023)"
