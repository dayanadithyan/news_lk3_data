    "The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 final between Chennai Super Kings and Gujarat Titans was shifted to the reserve day on Monday after rain forced play to be abandoned on Sunday.",
    "Not a single delivery was bowled due to heavy downpour and the organisers decided that the pitch condition was not conducive for the match. While there is not much prediction of rain on Monday, further hindrance to the match can result in various scenarios. While the main focus of the organisers will be to have a full game, rain delay can result in late start to proceedings or the match being decided in super over.",
    "In case of a rain delay, the match will start losing overs from 9:36 pm. From that time onwards, the match will keep getting shorter with the cut off time for a five-over match being 12:06 am (Tuesday).",
    "In case of further rain delay, the tournament can be decided by super over. The rules explained - \"For the Final, in the event that it is not possible to schedule a 5 over match to be completed by the end of the extra time on the reserve day, the teams will, if conditions permit, play a Super Over to determine the winner of the final.\"",
    "It is advantage Gujarat Titans if the final is completely abandoned. The defending champions will win the title because of their superior performance in the group stage in comparison to Chennai Super Kings. The rule states - \"In the event that it is not possible to start the Super Over or to then complete the Super Over without interruption, the team that finished highest in the league table after the 70 matches of the regular season shall be declared the winner of the relevant playoff match or final.\" (NDTV)"
