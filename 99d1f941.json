    "In honour of Unilever\u2019s 85th year of operating in Sri Lanka and in view of appreciating the unwavering support and contributions extended by its partners in 2022, Unilever Sri Lanka recently hosted an evening of fellowship under the theme \u2018Stronger Together\u2019, with its stakeholders across the value chain.",
    "The event reinforced the importance of partnerships and collaboration in rebuilding the economy and advancing social and environmental progress in Sri Lanka.",
    "The occasion, which took place at the Hilton Colombo, was graced by Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Secretary to the Prime Minister Anura Dissanayake, Ambassador of the Netherlands to Sri Lanka Bonnie Horbach, Ambassador of Italy to Sri Lanka Rita Giuliana Mannella, Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Chairman Dinesh Weerakkody, Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government Secretary Neel Bandara Hapuhinne, other dignitaries from the government and foreign missions, eminent business leaders in corporates, conglomerates, MNCs and SMEs, and partners in the end-to-end value chain of the FMCG sector, together with the Board and senior management of Unilever Sri Lanka.",
    "Addressing the audience, Unilever Sri Lanka Chairperson and Managing Director Hajar Alafifi said: \u201cPartnership is a word often taken for granted but it is this word that has enabled us to operate during times of trial. This is why we believe in the power of winning together.\u201d",
    "\u201cMany of us could have been extinct if some of us didn\u2019t play their role. In fact, we would not have been able to operate if not for our distributors, bankers, suppliers, logistics providers, retailers, media houses and the list goes long. Partnership is a closely woven web, for if the smallest partner cannot operate, our entire value chain will come to a standstill. This is why we believe in the power of winning together. It is up to us all, to come together as a force for good, as a force for positive change to make our nation great again. Because together we are stronger,\u201d she added."
