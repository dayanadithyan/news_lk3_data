Subsequently, P 483 set about towing the beleaguered craft with 02 crew members to the Port of Hambantota for much-needed repairs by the dark hours of 02nd March.",
    "Remaining true to its duty, MRCC Colombo at the Navy Headquarters coordinates and oversees maritime search and rescue (SAR) operations in its designated area of responsibility, in coordination with MRCCs in the region.
