    "Batsman Chris Lynn leads a long list of Australian players who will be up for auction for the upcoming Lanka Premier League (LPL) season, with West Indian T20 World Cup winner Carlos Braithwaite in the mix for a second season with the league.",
    "The LPL will move away from the Player Draft system it used for the first three seasons of the tournament, and will conduct a Player Auction, where each franchise will have a US 500,000 dollar purse to fill out their squads.",
    "Each franchise has already signed two local players and two overseas players and will use Wednesday\u2019s auction to purchase upto 20 players, with teams allowed to have a squad of between 20 to 24 players for the tournament.",
    "Lynn is joined by the likes of Ben McDermott, Jason Behrendorff, Mitchell Swepson and Andrew Tye in a list of more than Australian players who have registered for the draft.",
    "Braithwaite, who played for the Kandy Falcons last season, headlines the West Indians in the draft, which includes Johnson Charles and Evin Lewis, and a smattering of internationally capped players.",
    "As has been the case over the last three seasons, there is a heavy Pakistani presence in the player auction list, with players who have previously featured in the league hoping to be picked this season.",
    "Suresh Raina remains the sole Indian in the auction list, that also includes players from South Africa, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Ireland and New Zealand.",
    "A total of 360 player have been included in the draft, divided into 51 sets.",
    "\"After the players in the first 21 sets are auctioned, the players from the remaining 30 sets, and those who were not bought, will be considered for the accelerated draft round. Each franchise will nominate 10 players each \u2013 amongst those unsold and yet to be auctioned \u2013 and those 50 players will be up for auction in the accelerated draft, with the rest discarded,\" LPL Tournament Director Samantha Dodanwela told the Daily Mirror."
