    "Denying media reports that patient services at the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital have been hampered due to the malfunction of the PET scan, Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena stressed that the PET scan is currently functioning without any interruptions.",
    "Participating at the weekly post Cabinet news briefing at the Information Department, the Health DG said, \"The use of the PET scan has not been suspended. We are performing services manually.",
    "\"The media has carried misleading information on the PET scan at Apeksha hospital. However, there has been no sabotage when the CAT scan\u2019s power supply was affected. It is operated manually at the moment. Even at private hospitals and in India these scans are operated manually. There is no commission involved when spare parts are imported for the machine as suggested by the media. A CAT scan at the National Hospital in Colombo is also operated manually at the moment,\u201d Dr. Gunawardana said."
