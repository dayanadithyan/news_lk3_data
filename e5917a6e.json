    "SriLankan Airlines joined the Arabian Travel Mart (ATM) 2023, Middle East\u2019s leading international travel and tourism event, from 1 \u2013 4 May in Dubai, to boost tourism from the Middle East and North Africa. The ATM has been a mainstay on the SriLankan Airlines\u2019 calendar as the event affords unparalleled opportunities to network with travel trade luminaries and highlight the airline in the Middle East. The region is an important source market for high-net worth tourists and SriLankan promoted its flight services from the Middle East to Sri Lanka and beyond for leisure travel at ATM 2023.",
