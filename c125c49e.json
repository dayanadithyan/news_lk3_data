    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has launched a beach cleaning program to clear up the remaining debris from the X-Press Pearl ship, it\u2019s biggest marine disaster in history, to prevent further environmental damage, the President\u2019s media division said.",
    "The cleaning program was initiated at Crow Island beach in Mattakkuliya.",
    "On May 20, 2021, the Singapore-flagged container vessel MV X-Press Pearl caught fire, spilling chemicals and plastic pellets into the sea.",
    "The vessel had nitric acid, caustic soda, and other chemicals used for personal products such as perfume, and it also contained electric and electronic equipment. It had lithium in the containers, which is highly hazardous to the marine environment.",
    "Sagala Ratnayake, Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of the Presidential staff participating in the event, said the island\u2019s coast and beaches are the main attractions of the tourism industry in the country. It is everyone\u2019s responsibility to contribute to protecting the coast and environment for the next generation.",
    "The program is jointly implemented by the Marine Environment Protection Authority, Department of Coast Conservation, Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Central Environmental Authority, Environmental Police, Sri Lanka Navy, and Tudawe Brothers Private Limited.",
    "Meanwhile, Sri Lanka is awaiting the removal of the sunken wreck of MV X-Press Pearl, which sank off Colombo Port, to make a second environmental damage claim.",
    "China-based Shanghai Salvage was hired to remove the wreck in February 2021. It was initially expected to be removed within 120 days, but bad weather delayed the activity.",
    "Sri Lanka has received $40 million from insurers in an interim claim. (Colombo/Mar 12/2023)"
