    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has received fresh financial assurances from China on debt re-structuring on the parameters required by the International Monetary Fund, sources with knowledge of the matter said.",
    "China earlier sent a letter to Sri Lanka saying they are giving a moratorium till the end of the year but did not mention the parameters of an IMF debt sustainability analysis.",
    "The new letter received last week had the required parameters, official sources said.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe last week had a discussion with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva which was \u2018decisive\u2019, his office said in a statement last week.",
    "The IMF had also lobbied China to give revised financial assurances in line with gross financing ceilings set in a debt sustainability analysis.",
    "Sri Lanka is expected to submit a letter of intent with an updated memorandum of economic and financial policies to the IMF for Board approval, sources said.",
    "Sri Lanka defaulted on its debt after printing money until the central bank ran out of all \u00a0its reserves to operate too-low policy rates to keep the external sector in balance.",
    "Sri Lanka had completed all required prior actions mentioned in a staff level agreement struck with the IMF last year, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said last week after hiking policy rates 100 basis points.",
    "The rate hike came as rupee appreciated in deflationary monetary policy, amid high market rates and private sector de-leveraging, after a surrender rule that kept the rupee down was relaxed.",
    "IMF usually does not usually give any money until an impossible trinity regime central bank (soft-pegged or now flexible exchange rate) ends the money and exchange policy conflict that trigger forex shortages.",
    "If not, the IMF money will be busted up in \u2018reserves for imports\u2019, effectively reserves for refinanced private sector credit which drives unsustainable imports.",
    "Sri Lanka has gone to the IMF 16 times after triggering monetary instability with impossible trinity regimes, but this time the country depleted reserves and defaulted on its external debt. (Colombo/Mar07/2023)"
