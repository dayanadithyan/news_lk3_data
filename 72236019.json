  "original_body_lines": [
    "If the price of an egg is reduced to Rs. 35, the price of bakery products other than bread can also be reduced, the All Ceylon Bakery Owners' Association (ACBOA) said.",
    "ACBOA Chairman N.K. Jayawardana told the Daily Mirror that with the arrival of imported eggs from India, it is hoped that the problems in the egg market will be resolved within a week.",
    "\"The egg price in the local market should decrease within a week. If the egg price comes down, the price of bakery items could also be reduced, except for the price of bread.",
    "\"Bakeries and hotels are still buying eggs at Rs. 55 each. Most of the retail shops do not have eggs. There is an egg shortage in the market,\" he said.",
    "\"There are also claims that the bakery industry has never reduced prices due to any fuel price reductions in the country. Fuel price reductions do not affect bakery production. But we are hoping to pass the benefits on bakery production from the fuel price reductions to the people soon,\" said Jayawardana. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrmama)"
