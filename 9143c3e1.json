    "Headline inflation, as measured by the year-on-year (YoY) change in the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2021=100), decreased to 50.3 percent in March 2023, from 50.6 percent in February 2023.",
    "The decline in headline inflation is broadly in line with the disinflation path envisaged by the Central Bank in 2023.",
    "Food inflation (YoY) decreased to 47.6 percent in March 2023, from 54.4 percent in February 2023, whereas non-food inflation (YoY) increased to 51.7 percent in March 2023, from 48.8 percent in February 2023. The monthly change of the CCPI recorded at 2.92 percent in March 2023, due to the price increases observed in items of the non-food category, which was 3.71 percent.",
    "However, the food category recorded a monthly decline of 0.79 percent. Core inflation (YoY), which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, decreased to 39.1 percent in March 2023, from 43.6 percent in February 2023.\u00a0 Looking ahead, based on the available information, the anticipated declining trend of inflation is expected to continue through 2023. The Central Bank said the disinflation process would be supported by subdued demand conditions, owing to tight monetary and fiscal policy measures, softening of food and energy prices amidst the recent exchange rate appreciation and greater pass-through of lower global commodity prices, second round impacts of recent fuel price revisions and anticipated improvements in domestic supply conditions, along with the favourable statistical base effect."
