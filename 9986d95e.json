The Minister's comment attracted anger from Maldivians including politicians and influential figures.",

Make sure you have enough time,\u201d Shifau tweeted.\u00a0 Interestingly, during the three-day programme in Germany, Minister Fernando was photographed with the President of the Maldives Ibrahim Mohamad Solih, the Minister of Tourism and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Maldives.
