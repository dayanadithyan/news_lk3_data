  "original_body_lines": [
    "Cabinet approval was granted today to review the price of medicines every three months to reduce the maximum retail price (MRP) of 60 types of medicinal drugs by 16 percent with effect from 15 June.",
    "This proposal was presented to the Cabinet by Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella.",
    "The Health Ministry had previously given approval to raise the maximum retail prices of medicinal drugs by up to 97 percent in several cases, considering the depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar.",
    "However, as a result of the current economic stabilization programme followed by the government and the strengthening of the rupee, the Cabinet has approved the lowering of medicinal drug prices. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
