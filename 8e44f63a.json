  "original_body_lines": [
    "The  Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) formed in May 1976,  conducted a 33 year long armed struggle until May 2009 ,  to establish   a separate state in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. Although the LTTE known as  the \u201ctiger organization \u201d  was basically a guerilla outfit, it  adopted positional   warfare methods  for a lengthy period of time  by capturing and retaining territory like a conventional military. The tigers threw up  many \u201cunofficial\u201d military leaders who were designated  ranks and positions  simiuar to those in  the \u201cofficial\u201d armed forces.",
    "Among the many military leaders of the LTTE, two men made their mark in guerilla and  positional warfare and excelled as military commanders. One was Kandiah Balasegaram alias  Balraj who died  of illness in May 2008. The other was Veluppillai  Baheerathakumar  alias \u201cTheepan\u201d who died in battle  in April 2009. Both were posthumously  promoted as \u201cBrigadiers\u201d by the LTTE hierarchy. Balraj and Theepan held the posts of deputy military chief in the LTTE  and  earned much respect for their tactical skill in military combat.",
    "This column intends to focus on Theepan this week.The life and times of \u201cBrig\u201d Theepan are indeed interesting. A trip down memory lane with the aid of my earlier writings would be helpful in gaining insight about  the herpic saga of this  northern warrior.",
    "Velayuthapillai Baheerathakumar alias Theepan was from Kandawalai in the Kilinochchi district. He used to adopt the nom de guerre Sivatheeban and an alias Thavabalasingham at times .Theepan\u2019s family had its origins in Varani in the Thenmaratchy sector within the Jaffna peninsula.",
    "Baheerathakumar was a student at Chavakachcheri Hindu College in Sangathaanai. He was in the Bio group for his GCE A levels and obtained results that could have qualified him to enter Varsity as a Bio-Science student. But Baheerathakumar opted to be a militant instead of being an undergrad.",
    "Theepan was a cousin of Thileepan alias \u201cCurdles\u201d, former LTTE commander for Thenmaratchy region who was killed in the Kaithaddy explosion of Feb 14th 1987.Curdles also known as \u201cKerdy\u201d was also from Kandawalai where his father served as School principal for a long time.",
    "According to knowledgeable circles it was Curdles who recruited his younger cousin into the movement. Baheerathakumar joined the LTTE in early 1984.He underwent arms training and assumed the nom de guerre \u201cTheepan\u201d. His communication codename was \u201cTango Papa\u201d.",
    "The LTTE had then divided the Northern mainland known as Wanni into two regions for their purposes. Mannar district was one region while the districts of Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Mullaitheevu formed another unit.Gopalaswamy Mahendrarajah alias Mahathaya was the commander then for the greater Wanni LTTE division. Newly recruited Theepan hailing from Kandawalai ,was placed under Mahathaya\u2019s Wanni command.",
    "Mahathaya was  quick to recognize Theepan\u2019s potential. He took a liking to him and inducted Theepan into his bodyguard detail. 1987 saw some administrative changes within the LTTE resulting in Mahathaya relocating to Jaffna and becoming deputy-leader of the LTTE. The Wanni was re-divided into Vavuniya, Kilinochchi and Mullaitheevu districts . Jeyam, Suseelan and Paseelan were  made the respective district commanders.",
    "Theepan accompanied Mahathaya to Jaffna and functioned as his chief bodyguard. It was on July 29th 1987 that the Indo-Lanka accord was signed. Soon war broke out between the Indian army and the LTTE.",
    "One incident that took place during the early stages of the fighting was the capture of 18 Indian soldiers at Pandatheruppu by the LTTE. They were later released back to the Indian army.There was a ceremony to mark this \u201chand-over\u201d and a contingent of media persons were flown in without visas from Chennai to Palaly. Mahathaya personally handed over the 18 soldiers. Photographs taken on the occasion show a young Theepan standing dutifully behind Mahathaya.",
    "Later Mahathaya got back to the Wanni and stationed himself at Paalamottai in the Vavuniya district. Theepan too was at Paalamottai. But LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran  also relocated to the Wanni and gradually began running things his own way.",
    "Theepan was placed in charge of Kilinochchi as military commander. Despite the overwhelming presence of the Indian army, Theepan managed to evade capture by moving from place to place within the district.The LTTE under Theepan carried out many attacks against the Indian army in Kilinochchi district. District-wise, K\u2019nochchi had the second largest number of anti-IPKF operations. Only Mullaitheevu  district had more. The LTTE in M\u2019theevu  was  then led by Balraj.",
    "It was during the Indian army period that Theepan\u2019s younger brother also joined the LTTE. Like his elder sibling, he too rose rapidly from the ranks and was at one stage appointed as a regional  commander of the LTTE\u2019s Charles Anthony infantry division.Theepan\u2019s younger brother Velayuthapillai Sivakumar who used the nom de guerre \u201cKilman\u201d was sent to Trincomalee district as regional  commander in charge of the Charles Anthony division in 1993. He was killed in an accidental explosion there in 1994 and was posthumously elevated to \u201cLt. Col\u201d rank.",
    "Prabhakaran \u201cre-unified\u201d the Wanni command again in late 1988. He brought all three districts under one regional command. Balraj was made Wanni military commander and Maaran the political commissar. Theepan was appointed as Wanni deputy-military commander to Balraj.",
    "The Indian army left Lankan shores  totally in March 1990. War erupted between the govt forces  and the LTTE in June 1990. Under Balraj\u2019s leadership the LTTE conducted several successful operations against the Armed forces in the Wanni.Chief among them were the overrunning of Mankulam and Kokavil camps.",
    "Theepan served as an efficient deputy to Balraj. Both were of the same mould being courageous fighters who led from the Front.There was great affinity between both as comrades at arms.",
    "When Balraj died  of illness in May 2008, Theepan broke down while  delivering an eulogy.Theepan said of Balraj then \u201cEnnai Aruhil vaithirunthu Thalapathiaaha valarthedutha thalapathy,Avar En por Aasaan\u201d (he was the commander who kept me at his side and nurtured me as a commander. He was my teacher  of war).",
    "Balraj along with Theepan participated in the 1991 attack on Elephant Pass which ended in failure. It is said that the Wanni contingent led by both of them was successful in taking Kurinchatheevu area structures and adjacent buildings.But others tasked with different objectives were not so successful. 673 tiger cadres perished in the abortive attack.",
    "In 1992 , Balraj was appointed as commander of the newly raised Charles Anthony infantry division. Theepan his deputy succeeded Balraj as Wanni region commander.",
    "The Balraj-Theepan duo scored a significant success when the LTTE launched a successful attack on  Mannkindimalai (Janakapura) in the Manal Aaru/Weli Oya region. It was codenamed operation \u201cIthayabhoomi\u201d (heartland)",
    "Two major battles where Theepan proved his prowess were at Poonagary during \u201coperation Thavalai (Frog) and in the peninsula during \u201coperation Yarl Devi\u201d.",
    "The amphibious \u201cfrog\u201d operation of November 1993 was a combined effort in which cadres from different regions were mobilised. The sprawling army base at Poonagary and Naval base at Nagathevanthurai were simultaneously targeted.",
    "Bhanu had to target Nagathevanthurai navy base while Theepan had to demolish the army  camp in Poonagary. Bhanu discharged his duties efficiently and virtually demolished the navy camp.",
    "But the LTTE ran into difficulties at Poonagary. The plan was to target the main camp as well as the satellite mini- camps simultaneously. Thus Theepan and his cadres had to infiltrate deep into the base complex.",
    "Even as Theepan & co were crawling through the sprawling complex , another tiger team was detected at the periphery. As firing began, Theepan and his team had to run fast towards their target so as to retain some element of surprise at least.",
    "This they did and it was a panting Theepan and cadres who commenced the attack on the main camp. Though successful \u201coperation Frog\u201d was not an overwhelming tiger victory as the soldiers rallied and converged at the Kalmunai point area thus avoiding total annihilation.",
    "Another incident where Theepan made an impressive showing was \u201coperation Yarl Devi\u201d in September 1993 where soldiers marched northwards into the peninsula from Elephant Pass. Balraj and Theepan were in charge of countering the incursion.",
    "Balraj got injured on the first day of battle and thereafter it was Theepan\u2019s lot to take charge. This he did and beat back the army at Puloppalai after letting troops advance.",
    "Theepan\u2019s deputies in this operation were Navaneethan and Naresh .They were in charge of Mullaitheevu and Kilinochchi districts repectively under Theepan the overall Wanni commander.",
    "It is said that Theepan concealed cadres in fox holes within  sand dunes for hours and hours thus springing a lethal surprise in ambushing advancing soldiers.",
    "The LTTE seized two T-55 tanks during these battles. The tigers used these for many operations later including one where they buried a T-55 in the sand at Challai and fired upon an unsuspecting Dvora that had come close to the beach.The LTTE lost both T-55\u2032s in the Puthukkudiyiruppu fighting in 2009. One was destroyed at Northern Puthukkudiyiruppu and the other was re-captured in the recent fighting in Southern Puthukkudiyiruppu.",
    "The LTTE\u2019s deputy leader Mahathaya was arrested and executed on charges of treason in 1994.In the aftermath of that episode, Theepan was transferred to Jaffna from the Wanni.It was during this time that Chandrika Kumaratunga was elected and peace talks commenced in 1994.",
    "Talks broke down soon  and war erupted again. When \u201coperation Leap Forward\u201d took place, Theepan fought along with LTTE cadres in Jaffna to repel it. He was also part of tiger resistance to \u201coperation Thunderstrike\u201d in Jaffna.",
    "Then came \u201coperation Riviresa\u201d. Initially Balraj and Sornam were made joint commanders to counter it. But after a while Prabhakaran replaced both with Theepan and Bhanu.They were appointed as joint commanders after the Army had entered Jaffna municipal limits. Theepan\u2019s assignment was to delay the army and prevent the take-over of Jaffna before Great Heroes day of November 27th.",
    "Theepan led a small force, offering fierce resistance even as all the main routes to Jaffna were being  blocked by the army. It appeared that the tigers defending the town area under Theepan would be boxed in and trapped inside Jaffna town.",
    "But Theepan , managed to prevent the fall of Jaffna till Nov 27th and then withdrew with his cadres by wading through the Pannai lagoon waters for quite a distance until the sea tigers led by Soosai evacuated them safely.",
    "Former deputy defence minister Anuruddha Ratwatte hoisted the national flag at Durayappah stadium on Dec 5th 1995.",
    "The LTTE withdrew from Jaffna peninsula by April-May 1996. Immediately after this , Prabhakaran summoned Theepan and ordered him to undertake \u201crekke\u201d (reconnaissance) of the Mullaitheevu army camp and formulate an attack plan.This was done and M\u2019theevu was overrun on July 18th 1996. Over a 1000 soldiers were killed.With the LTTE relocating en masse to the Wanni the M\u2019theevu camp \u201cremoval\u201d became a military imperative.",
    "\u201cOperation Jayasikurui\u201d was launched by the army in 1997. The first phase saw the army taking Omanthai and Nedunkerny virtually without any resistance.Theepan was entrusted the defence of A-9 highway or Jaffna-Kandy road. He took up position in Puliyankulam.",
    "It was then that Theepan mounted his  famous \u201ctrench cum bund\u201d defences. This entailed the digging of deep trenches and construction of fortified bunds alongside. Theepan\u2019s deputy in the defence of Puliyankulam was Sathasivam Sathananthan alias \u201cVikkees.\u201d",
    "Vikkees was Theepan\u2019s right-hand man in the realm of strategic defence. He served for many years on the Muhamaalai front and was later brought to Thunukkai to safeguard that strategic location. Vikkees died while defending it. This was a major loss to Theepan.",
    "Another of Theepan\u2019s able deputies was Arivu.Lt. Col Arivu served as Theepan\u2019s chief military intelligence operative for many years. He was sent on a special assignment to Trincomalee and was killed there.",
    "Among Theepan\u2019s disciples the most efficient was reportedly Lawrence.He served for a long time on the Kilaly-Muhamaalai-Nagarkovil front and was later transferred by Theepan to the Navvi-Palamottai front. Later Lawrence was  active in defending the Puthukkudiyiruppu region and died there.",
    "Incidently both Lawrence and Arivu accompanied Theepan for a meeting with Lt. Gen Sarath Fonseka during the ceasefire. An old photograph shows Theepan. Lawrence and Arivu along with LTTE peace secretariat director Pulidevan in civils chatting to Fonseka who was then Northern military commander.",
    "During Jayasikurui, the Theepan-Vikkees duo managed to hold off the army at Puliyankulam.. Unable to break through the Puliyankulam defences , the army finally moved from Nedunkerny towards Kanagarayankulam and from there to Karuppattaimurippu along the old Kandy road axis.Puliyankulam had to be abandoned due to this strategic manouvre.",
    "Vinayagamoorthy Muraleetharan alias \u201cCol\u201d Karuna  then in the LTTE was appointed as Joint Wanni commander by Prabhakaran to withstand the \u201cJayasikurui\u201d offensive. The other joint commander partner was none other than Theepan. A large number of Eastern cadres fought in \u201cJayasikurui\u201d. Karuna\u2019s main function as joint commander was co-ordinating defences and laising between field commands . Ground based Frontline leadership was held by joint commander Theepan.He was the overall field commander",
    "Even as \u201cJayasikurui\u201d was continuing,  the LTTE attacked and seized Kilinochchi during February 1998. Theepan was tasked to infiltrate Karadipokku junction between Paranthan and Kilinochchi and prevent reinforcements reaching K\u2019nochchi. This Theepan did and the town was taken from the Southern side.",
    "\u201cJayasikurui\u201d was called off in 1998 and in 1999 the LTTE launched phase-three of \u201cOayaatha Alaigal\u201d or unceasing waves. From Oddusuddan to Omanthai the waves engulfed targets and military installations fell like dominoes.Theepan as joint Wanni commander deserved the lion\u2019s share in this tiger triumph.",
    "The zenith of unceasing waves was the seizure of Elephant Pass. The highlight of that offensive was Balraj\u2019s famous exploit of going by sea and landing behind enemy lines at Kudaarappu and then moving clandestinely  to Ithaavil on the A-9 and interdicting supplies till Elephant pass fell.",
    "Theepan\u2019s role in this was the rapid military drive along the peninsula\u2019s eastern coast from Sembiyanpatru right down to Vettrilaikerny-Kaddaikkaadu.Theepan and his forces attacked the Elephant pass complex from the rear and played an important part in its downfall.",
    "According to LTTE insiders , Balraj had been hesitant when Prabhakaran had explained what was required of Balraj.Landing on the east coast and moving to the centre in enemy territory and interdicting the main supply route was a formidable challenge. But when the tiger supremo told Balraj , what Theepan was required to do all doubts were removed for Balraj. Such was Balraj\u2019s confidence in Theepan that he would not be let down.",
    "Once Elephant pass fell and the LTTE gained territory inside the peninsula those positions assumed great strategic value. Theepan was appointed in charge of LTTE defences along the Kilaly-Muhamaalai-Nagar Kovil axis.",
    "Theepan was given the title \u201cNorthern point commander\u201d (Vadamunai Thalapathy) which virtually amounted to northern regional commander. His baptism of fire in this new assignment was when the armed forces launched \u201cAgni Kheela\u201d in 2001 on April 24th. Adopting deep defence tactics, Theepan foiled that attempt inflicting heavy losses on the armed forces.",
    "It must be noted that despite many attempts , the armed forces were unable to dislodge the tigers under Theepan from positions along the Muhamaalai axis. The old-fashioned \u201cTrench-bund\u201d defences withstood the 53 and 55 division onslaughts  several times.",
    "Finally it was when the 58 division took Paranthan and moved up to Elephant Pass south that the LTTE was forced to abandon positions inside the peninsula. The tiger defences in the peninsula were never overrun completely. They were only abandoned by the LTTE who were compelled to withdraw from en masse from the peninsula.Otherwise they would have been trapped inside.",
    "Even then with Soosai and Rathinam Amman\u2019s assistance, Theepan managed to evacuate his cadres safely to the mainland in a \u201cmini-Dunkirk\u201d . The tigers defending inside the peninsula were ferried across the Chundikulam lagoon from Kommaatty to Ooriyaan and by sea from Kattaikaadu to Challai.",
    "While being in overall charge of the Muhamaalai defences, Theepan was also delegated duties on the Kilinochchi front. With K\u2019nochchi assuming importance and prestige,Theepan was tasked by Prabakharan to protect the former de-facto administrative capital of the LTTE.",
    "Once again , Theepan commenced his defence of Kilinochchi and environs by rapidly constructing a 18 km bund in a \u201cL\u201d shape. The 57 division despite many attempts was unable to breach these defences effectively. Finally it was the 58 which turned the tide by taking Paranthan.",
    "Thereafter the retention of Kilinochchi became impossible. This was the situation later in the case of Muhamaalai-Elephant pass also. Despite the army moving in three directions towards Kilinochchi town , the tigers under Theepan held on to their positions till 2009 dawned. This was to prevent Kilinochchi being taken by December as announced by the then  Defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse.",
    "The war then moved on to the areas east of the A-9. Theepan and other senior tiger commanders fought fiercely to defend and retain territory. But it was too late. The overwhelming manpower and firepower of the armed forces was too much for the tigers. Relentlessly the military juggernaut rolled forward and tiger territory shrunk gradually.",
    "Prabhakaran was the LTTE military chief. After the demise of Balraj in 2008 May, Prabhakaran had not appointed a deputy military chief for some months. But Theepan was made deputy military commander in January 2009. Under his leadership several counter-offensives and counter-strikes were conducted. But the armed forces were on the upbeat and withstood all such moves without wilting.",
    "The end came for Theepan in April 2009  when he was holed up in Aananthapuram in Puthukkudiyiruppu to plan and begin a massive counter-offensive. Many top tiger commanders were also assembled there. But the LTTE got trapped when soldiers penetrated both flanks and linked up behind LTTE positions at Pachchaippulmottai. Thereafter a siege was mounted.",
    "While Bhanu broke out through the military cordon with Keerthi and Lawrence , Theepan refused saying he would not abandon his cadres. \u201cIf I come out it will be with our fighters only\u201d an intercept heard him say.",
    "He said that he wont desert or abandon his fighter cadres and seek safety. \u201cIf I come out I\u2019ll come with the cadres. Otherwise I\u2019ll die with them\u201d he told Bhanu and later informed intelligence chief Pottu Ammaan via radio.",
    "The military intercepting this communication were amazed at Theepan\u2019s sense of loyalty to his cadres and his readiness to die willingly. Subsequently Theepan\u2019s conduct came in for praise among several officers from the Army\u2019s upper echelons.",
    "After breaking out Bhanu participated in a major effort to break through the military cordon and rescue Theepan and other cadres. But they were unsuccessful. With several such attempts being repulsed the fate of those surrounded became sealed.",
    "Meanwhile Theepan\u2019s condition deteriorated as he had been injured twice on April 1st and on the 2nd.Some injuries were on his chest and there was internal bleeding also.Members of the LTTE\u2019s Thileepan medical unit affixed two tubes to get the blood out . Theepan succumbed to his injuries on April 4th.",
    "Thus ended the life of a courageous  tiger commander who led from the front and refused to abandon his cadres. Theepan was like an old-fahioned ship\u2019s captain opting to go down with his sinking vessel rather than abandoning his cadres.",
    "This consideration and affection for his cadres was a pronounced trait of Theepan.It is said that Theepan took a personal interest in their welfare and communicated with them easily. He also maintained links with their families and would visit each family of a departed cadre to console.",
    "Despite his tough military reputation, Theepan was a soft-spoken, polite man with a gentle disposition and demeanour. He was very popular with the people.",
    "Theepan did not get involved in the internal politics and intrigues within the LTTE.He accepted Prabhakaran\u2019s leadership and unquestioningly carried out to the best of his ability, the tasks assigned to him.",
    "Theepan was married to an ex-woman cadre from the LTTE. They have no children.",
    "This northern fighter s life was inter-twined with that of the LTTE\u2019s military fortunes. Theepan\u2019s death along with other senior tigers came at a time when the LTTE was  on the verge of total  military defeat. In a sense, Theepan\u2019s demise  at Aananthapuram in April  signalled  the beginning of the end for the LTTE in May 2009.(ENDS)",
