  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is attempting a collaborative force against \u201cundemocratic actions\u201d of the government with other opposition parties that include dissident factions of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) while reining in any defections from its own fold.",
    "SJB and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said in a statement on Monday April 24 that several groups within the opposition took the first step in working together as a \u201cgiant force\u201d against what it called the undemocratic actions of the government.",
    "A discussion was held at the parliament complex on Monday between the SJB and members of a number of other parties representing the opposition on the formation of a common programme against \u201carbitrary\u201d actions of the government in the face of the political, economic and social problems that confront the country, Premadasa said in a post published on his official Facebook page.",
    "Chaired by Premadasa, the meeting was attended by former chairman of the SLPP G L Peiris and other MPs who entered parliament as part of a two-thirds majority-winning SLPP coalition, namely Dullas Alahapperuma, Chandima Weerakkodi, Nalaka Godaheva, Channa Jayasumana, Udaya Gammanpila, Weerasumana Weerasinghe, Gevidu Cumarathunga and Dayasiri Jayasekara, all of whom were key players in the government headed by ousted president Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Premadasa opted to be Alahapperuma\u2019s running mate in a last-minute decision to back out of a race for the presidency with incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe who was elected by parliament with the backing of the SLPP.",
    "Some of the SLPP dissidents were silent in the face of, if not outright supportive of, what the SJB itself has called the destructive policies of the Rajapaksa administration that contributed to what became Sri Lanka\u2019s worst currency crisis since Independence. A not insignificant number of the dissident faction also remains ultranationalist in their outlook with regard to the island nation\u2019s ethnic question.",
    "Others at the discussion, according to Premadasa\u2019s statement, were Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Rauf Hakeem, Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) leader Mano Ganesan and All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) leader Gajendra Ponnambalam.",
    "The SJB was represented by MPs Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Lakshman Kiriella, Imthiaz Bakeer Markar and Harsha de Silva.",
    "Notable absentees were the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National People\u2019s Power (NPP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). According to at least one opinion poll, the NPP still holds a considerable lead against the SJB.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s NPP maintains lead over SJB; possible sign of UNP rise: surveySee more",
    "\u201cWe all have to move on from old ideas in order to work together, because this is a different Sri Lanka. For us to develop as a nation, we cannot be cornered from the international community,\u201d Premadasa said at Monday\u2019s discussion.",
    "\u201cIt is very clear, we need to become internationalists. We must win a comparative advantage, and develop it,\u201d he said.",
    "Premadasa, whose party is not ideologically opposed to International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed reforms and advocates for a social market economy, said Sri Lanka must strive to achieve its targets through domestic production without foregoing trade.",
    "\u201cWe must understand that we need to bring about value addition to the country, as opposed to value reduction, through international deals,\u201d he said.",
    "Monday\u2019s discussion was primarily focused on a controversial Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) proposed by the government to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).",
    "\u201cWe will defeat this extremist act that violates human rights, desecrates democracy and allows the president to name all 20 million of the country terrorists,\u201d said Premadasa.",
    "\u201cLet us all get together and discuss whether to introduce a new act to achieve human rights objectives of the country as well as democratic rights and national security, or whether to continue with the existing Public Security Ordinance,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile, the SJB\u2019s working committee has decided to appoint a disciplinary committee to take action against party members who issue statements that promote the government or are considered detrimental to the party.",
    "\u201cToday the Working Committee decided to appoint a strong disciplinary committee to take immediate disciplinary action against anyone who issues statements that damage the SJB or promote other parties or the government,\u201d SJB Thushara Indunil Amarasena speaking to reporters in Colombo Monday evening after a party meeting.",
    "The decision comes in the wake of speculation over the past few weeks that a number of high-profile SJB parliamentarians were planning to cross over to the government accepting an open invitation from President Ranil Wickremesinghe to support his government\u2019s International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed reforms.",
    "SJB Weligama organiser and former Urban Council Chairman Rehan Jayawickreme tweeted quoting party leader Premadasa that \u201cthe party will not tolerate further indiscipline and tough choice will be made irrelevant of who the individuals are.\u201d",
    "Leader of the SJB, Sajith Premadasa while making a statement at yesterdays Working Commitee emphasised that strict disciplinary action will be taken against any member that goes against collective decisions of the Party.",
    "These developments come amid continued speculation of crossovers and talks of a national government at the invitation of President Wickremesinghe.",
    "Rejecting these reports, SJB MP Nalin Bandara on April 10 that the SJB was in fact contemplating a grand alliance targeting upcoming elections with Premadasa as a common presidential candidate. Bandara said the United National Party (UNP), which President Wickremesinghe leads, is welcome to join the proposed alliance as the SJB currently holds 54 seats compared to the UNP\u2019s solitary seat in parliament.",
    "The SJB broke away from the UNP following the defeat of then UNP deputy leader Sajith Premadasa at the 2019 presidential election. The UNP, once Sri Lanka\u2019s single largest party, was reduced to one seat at the 2020 general election, with Wickremesinghe occupying that seat as a national list member.",
    "TPA leader Ganesan, who recently made an abortive attempt to bring the UNP and the SJB together, told EconomyNext on April 17 that his own party has yet to decide on a future course of action in the event of an open invitation from the president to form a national government.",
    "Sri Lanka opposition MP Mano Ganesan yet to decide on future course of actionSee more",
    "In a tweet posted Monday evening after the discussion with Premadasa, Ganesan said the meeting focused on the IMF and the ATA. He said the establishment of a joint committee was established, rather than a common alliance.",
    "Meeting of Opp leaders today chaired by @sajithpremadasa discussed #IMF & #ATA, for possible common stands agreed to jointly oppose ATA & discuss IMF further, established a joint commitee -not Common Political Alliance- to discuss an alternate balanced draft for ATA. #ManoGanesan pic.twitter.com/swDUEjFcD8"
