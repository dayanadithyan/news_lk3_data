    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s stocks fell after seven straight sessions on Monday as investors took a wait-and-see approach regarding the need for further clearance on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan after officials\u2019 comments, according to brokers.",

Analysts said that this did not heavily impact market sentiment and that investors were solely taking a wait-and-see approach until harder facts about the macro-economy surface.",
    "The loan from the IMF was originally expected in December of last year, but it is now expected in the second quarter. As creditors of the island nation, India and the Paris Club have given specific assurances to restructure the sovereign debt of Sri Lanka\u2019s external borrowing.",
    "Meanwhile, China has given a two-year moratorium and promised to restructure debt, but Sri Lanka has sought a more specific assurance in line with the IMF deal.",
    "China has not yet given such assurances and has instead called for relief from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the IMF, which are considered \u201csenior debt\u201d under current resolution frameworks and are insulated.",
    "\u201cAn analyst said that the Power and Energy Minister\u2019s comment on not removing the QR code affected the Lanka IOC shares.\u201d Net foreign outflows were 2.2 million rupees on Monday, while the market has bought a net of 3.03 billion worth of shares so far this year.",

    "The market saw a turnover of 1.2 billion rupees on Monday, lower than this year\u2019s daily average of 1.8 billion rupees and the 2022 average turnover of 2.9 billion rupees.",
    "The top losers were Hatton National Bank, John Keells Holdings, and Commercial Bank. (Colombo/Feb 27/2023)"
