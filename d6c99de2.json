It is very special because this year both countries are celebrating 75 years of independence. I am sure that our bilateral cooperation in different fields will only continue to grow and flourish in the coming years. I am happy to announce that we have appointed a new Honorary Consul of Israel to Sri Lanka, Mr. Dinesh Rodrigo, who will work hard to further deepen our ties. We are also looking for opportunities for trilateral collaboration with countries like India, who is our natural partner and close friend. Such collaborations have huge potential to create new avenues of cooperation in diverse fields, benefiting our peoples. I personally look forward to working closely with the Government of Sri Lanka to explore ways to strengthen our relations further.\u201d (Kelum Bandara)"
