    "So far, no document has been prepared on labour law reforms, Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said.",
    "While addressing a gathering yesterday, Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said the IMF or no other organization instructed to amend the labour laws and that the ministry is seeking public views related to the amendment of labour laws before going to the media and commenting on the revision of labour laws.",
    "\"Our main objective is to change the labour law, which is about 100 years old. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) or any other international organisation told us not to change the labour law of our country. As a country, we have been blaming each other for the past 75 years and we are not thinking about moving forward,\" the minister said.",
    "\"The number of institutions that pay EPF and ETF is about 80,000. This is very low. There are only about two million workers registered in EPF and ETF. There are only 280,000 tax paying institutions in the country. I mean, including those who pay PAYE taxes. Can a country move forward if even 10% of the country's institutions do not pay taxes? We are only accusing each other, but the measures required to solve the problems have not been taken,\" the minister said.",
    "The government has made policies with the goal that we should be a developed country at least by the year 2048, which is the centenary of independence. We have to develop our workforce according to changing times and changing technologies. If that is not possible, we will fail as a country.",
    "Therefore, many suggestions were made that the labour law should be prepared in our country in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the International Labour Organisation. We made this matter an open discussion. We have invited the trade unions, through the Labour Commissioner General to submit proposals and ideas for this. I have invited all the political parties in writing to submit their views and suggestions in this regard. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
