    "ECONOMYINEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s United National Party (UNP), the party led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, has hit out at opposition leader Sajith Premadasa for not supporting the government\u2019s reform initiatives.",
    "At a press conference in Colombo on Monday April 17, UNP general secretary and former MP Palitha Range Bandara chastised Premadasa for not extending the support of Premadasa\u2019s party, the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), to President Wickremesinghe\u2019s reform agenda.",
    "Referring to a statement from Premadasa in which he rubbished speculation of SJB crossovers to the government, Bandara claimed that the \u201ctruth\u201d that Premadasa was alluding to was that the people have realised that Sri Lanka has made notable progress under President Wickremesinghe compared to how things were a year ago.",
    "\u201cIf Sajith wants to talk about deal politics, we would like to ask him if his party got the support of [other parties allied with the SJB] through dealmaking,\u201d said Bandara.",
    "In his statement, Premadasa has flatly rejected media reports of crossovers, expressing his disgust at the reports which he said came from media outlets partial to the government.",
    "Noting that fuel prices have dropped, queues for essentials have disappeared and Sri Lanka\u2019s standing in the eyes of the world has improved, the MP said anyone not recognising these gains and supporting the government at this juncture was \u201ckuhakai\u201d (bitter and resentful).",
    "Bandara\u2019s remarks come in the wake of speculation that some SJB members were planning to cross over to the government, which many party seniors including Premadasa has loudly refuted.",
    "However, SJB MP Nalin Bandara hinted last week that some crossovers could be expected, although it won\u2019t be any kind of mass exodus.",
    "\u201cOne or two may leave. We won\u2019t say 100 percent that no one will leave. Some are looking to obtain ministries. It is surely no big deal for people who have been jumping this way or that since back then,\u201d the SJB MP said on April 10.",
    "He, in fact, invited Wickremesinghe\u2019s UNP to join a new SJB-led alliance that he said is on the cards.",
    "The SJB broke away from the UNP following the defeat of then UNP deputy leader Sajith Premadasa at the 2019 presidential election. The UNP, once Sri Lanka\u2019s single largest party, was reduced to one seat at the 2020 general election, with Wickremesinghe occupying that seat as a national list member.",
