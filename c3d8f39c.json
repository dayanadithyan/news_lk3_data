    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition party the Samagi Jana Balawegaya is opposed to the privatisation of strategically important state-owned enterprises (SOEs) but also advocates an end to state monopoly in sectors like power and energy through competition, the party said.",
    "SJB MP Eran Wickramaratne told reporters on Monday May 08 that his party does not support the sale or privatisation of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), both loss making SOEs, but supports the facilitation of private sector participation in these strategic sectors in a competitive market.",
    "\u201cThere is an opinion that only loss-making entities should be sold. We reject this notion entirely. It\u2019s not about loss or profit. Value and loss or profit are two different things. If an institute has some inherent value to it, the state must continue to hold ownership of that institute,\u201d said Wickramaratne.",
    "Though the CPC makes losses, as a strategic interest it should not be sold, the MP said, adding that the state must necessarily have a stake in national security, food security and energy security.",
    "\u201cThat is not to say the state should have a monopoly. But it must hold ownership. For example, the state should continue to own the CPC.",
    "\u201cOur foremost objective is to provide the best service at the lowest price to the consumer. Competition must be facilitated. The SJB is completely opposed to converting a state monopoly to a private monopoly,\u201d he said.",
    "The SJB will therefore not consent to selling the CPC or the CEB, said Wickramaratne.",
    "\u201cBut we know how to create competition and meet our prime objective on behalf of the consumer. This should be done transparently with regulation,\u201d he added.",
    "Meanwhile, the government of Sri Lanka is going ahead with its restructuring plans for both the CPC and the CEB, consequent to the crisis-hit country\u2019s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a 2.9 billion dollar extended fund facility (EFF).",
    "On Monday, Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara said the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) had made available its technical assistance in restructuring Sri Lanka\u2019s energy sector and developing a roadmap for reforming the CEB.",
    "The topic of SOE reforms post-IMF has been politically sensitive with various groups including sections of the opposition accusing the government of \u201cselling national assets\u201d. This has been a rallying cry of the leftist National People\u2019s Power, led by the Marxist-Leninist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which has historically opposed privatisation of most SOEs. The government of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, however, has defended their reform agenda as being necessary for the economy to recover and for Sri Lanka\u2019s long term development.",
    "The government is set to\u00a0 sign fuel retail agreements with China\u2019s state-owned petroleum corporation Sinopec and the US based RM Park-Shell in May with operations to commence sometime in June.",
    "In a related development, chairman of the power regulator Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Janaka Ratnayake has said the government plans to break the state-run CEB to 14 different companies.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s power sector has come under corruption allegations due to a model of having a single buyer for electricity leading to lobbying to pay artificially high tariffs without tender through standardised power purchase agreements as well as take-or-pay deals for LNG, according to critics.",
    "Sri Lanka CEB to be broken to 14 companies, new regulator says PUCSL chairSee more",
    "The SJB\u2019s critics, meanwhile, have said the party has been inconsistent with regard to its position on reforms. It has also been vague on its position on the ongoing IMF programme, particularly in the wake of the\u00a0 NPP gaining ground with its increasingly \u201cIMF-sceptic\u201d rhetoric.",
    "The SJB, which was among the first to call for a deal with the international lender at the onset of the island nation\u2019s worst currency crisis in decades, abstained from voting for the now-finalised agreement in a vote taken in parliament on April 28 this year.",
    "The party\u2019s own common minimum programme released in August last year said Sri Lanka must engage the IMF and restructure its debt.",
    "\u201cDeep, extensive economy-wide changes are needed to come out of the crisis: we must address our solvency issues through reforms that allow debt sustainability. Designing and implementing an IMF-assisted extended fund facility (EFF) programme would be the best place to start,\u201d the document said.",
    "A more recent version of this blueprint released at an SJB economic summit held in February this year, said Sri Lanka must continue to engage the IMF and expedite the debt restructuring process with creditor assurances.",
    "Presenting the document at the February event, SJB MP Harsha de Silva said that, unlike others (in a clear dig at the anti-IMF rival opposition party the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna), the SJB supports engaging with the IMF.",
    "While the SJB hasn\u2019t quite had a drastic departure from its original pro-IMF stance, the party has been increasingly vocal of late about the socioeconomic impact of the deal.",
    "SJB leader Sajith Premadasa earlier this year reportedly said a future SJB government would not be obligated to honour deals made by the incumbent government headed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. MP de Silva explained later that what his party leader had meant was that Sri Lanka must negotiate terms favourable to the country when dealing with the IMF.",
    "SJB MP Kabir Hashim speaking at an event in Monaragala on Sunday alluded to a unique vision his party possesses with regard to macroeconomic development that doesn\u2019t necessarily include the IMF.",
    "Hashim said that when Sri Lanka was heading towards its ongoing currency crisis early last year, the SJB had presented to the government a common minimum programme it could follow.",
    "\u201c[We said to the government], if you\u2019re talking to the IMF, talk to them according to our roadmap and negotiate with the IMF under our own conditions without agreeing to theirs. But this was not accepted,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said that the SJB is looking at Asian examples like Malaysia that were able to find a solution to their own economic woes without going to the IMF \u201cbecause they had developed economic strategies unique to them\u201d.",
