    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has seen a reduced number of tourists in May, a top Tourism authority official said, as the country\u2019s off-season has started after a better than expected four months.",
    "The daily average arrivals in May has dropped to 2,621 in the first 11 days compared to 3,677 in the four months through April 31, official data showed.",
    "\u201cIf you go through the statistics of the last 50 years, May is the lowest month in the arrivals as it is the beginning of the off-season\u201d, Priyantha Fernando, Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, told Economy Next.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry has witnessed better-than-expected growth on the arrivals from the start of 2023.",
    "Sri Lanka usually sees lower arrivals from May to October in the onset of monsoons amid frequent showers.",
    "\u201cThe lowest arrivals are recorded during the month of May, it\u2019s a shift of seasonality trend in the major generating markets. But yet we are doing what we have done in the past for the month because China is contributing,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOccupancy over the next few months will start picking up in the eastern provinces and a little bit in hill countries,\u201d Fernando said, adding that the peak Chinese arrivals fall within the off season for Sri Lanka.",
    "The arrivals jumped 27 percent to 441,177 in the first four months of this year.",
    "\u201cThe target that we have set for the month of May based on the analytical and statistical way, it is at around 60,000 and we will be exceeding that target\u201d, Fernando stated."
