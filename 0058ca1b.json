    "\u201cInstructions have been given to CPC and Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals to continue fuel deliveries on Saturday and Sunday this week to supply sufficient stocks to all fuel stations,\u201d Minister Wijesekera said in a TWITTER.COM MESSAGE",
    "\u201cTo reduce expenses on overtime, CPC and CPSTL have not been operating on Sundays and public holidays in the last 4 months,\u201d Wijesekera said.",
    "\u201cNon-placement of orders by fuel stations from last Saturday, anticipating a price reduction, not maintaining minimum stocks, immediate increase in demand by consumers after the price revision, and quota increase have created shortages in the fuel stations.\u201d",
    "The Minister in April 2023 said all fuel stations would be required to maintain a minimum of 50 percent of stock tank capacity.",
    "\u201cI have asked CPC to review and suspend the license of fuel stations that had not maintained minimum stocks.\u201d (Colombo/ June 02/ 2023)"
