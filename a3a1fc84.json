    "Those who are familiar with the fashion and beauty pageant setup, in Sri Lanka, would certainly remember Shashi Kaluarachchi.",
    "Three years ago, she was crowned Miss Super Model Globe Sri Lanka 2020 and then represented Sri Lanka at the Miss Super Model Globe International, held in India.",
    "Shashi won two titles at this big event; she was placed second in the finals (1st Runner-up) and took the title of Best National Costume.",
    "Very active in the modelling scene, in the not too distant past, Shashi went silent, after dazzling the audience at the Super Model Globe contest.",
    "Obviously, those who are aware of her talents were kept guessing, and many were wondering whether she had prematurely quit the fashion scene!",
    "Not quite so\u2026and I had a surprise call from Shashi to say that she is ready to do it again.",
    "The silence is due to the fact that she is now employed in Dubai and is concentrating on her office work.",
    "\u201cWhen I came to Dubai, I was new to this scene but now I do have some free time, coming my way, and I want to get back to what I love doing the most \u2013 modelling, fashion and beauty pageants,\u201d she said.",
    "Shashi indicated that she plans to participate in an upcoming beauty pageant, to be held in Dubai, and also do some fashion shoots, and modelling assignments.",
    "\u201cDubai is now buzzing with excitement and I want to be a part of that scene, as well,\u201d said Shashi, who had her early beginnings, as a model, at the Walk with Brian Kerkoven modelling academy.",
    "\u201cI owe my success to Brian. He made me what I\u2019m today \u2013 a top model.\u201d",
    "Shashi, who 5\u20197\u2033 tall, says she loves wearing the sari for all important occasions.",
    "\u201cThe sari is so elegant, so graceful, and, I believe, my height, and figure, does justice to a sari,\u201d",
    "Shashi has plans to visit Sri Lanka, in April, for a short vacation, adding that if the opportunity comes her way, she would love to do some photo shoots, and a walk on the ramp, as well.",
