P&S marked the opening of its 200th outlet in Nuwara Eliya, a picturesque hill station renowned for its breathtaking landscapes, making it the first and only quick-service restaurant chain in Sri Lanka to expand its network to include 200 locations, thus cementing its position as the largest chain of its kind in the island.",
    "With a legacy spanning over 120 years, P&S was founded in 1902, and since then, it has become a household name in Sri Lanka, providing millions of Sri Lankans with exceptional taste and high-quality products daily. To commemorate the significance of the 200th outlet, P&S Nuwara Eliya was inaugurated amidst a special ceremony attended by key stakeholders and senior management members.",

    "The timing of the opening of the Nuwara Eliya outlet could not have been more appropriate, as it coincided with the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, a significant holiday celebrated throughout Sri Lanka. The new outlet further expands the presence of the P&S brand as it continues to expand its network in the future. This milestone is not only significant for P&S but also for Sri Lanka\u2019s fast-food industry, demonstrating that the sector is thriving and growing, despite the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "P&S\u2019s new outlet in Nuwara Eliya is also noteworthy as it marks the first of its kind in the region, allowing P&S to serve Sri Lankans in seven of the island\u2019s nine provinces, which includes the Central, Southern, North Central, North Western, Sabaragamuwa, Uva and Western Provinces. The opening of the Nuwara Eliya outlet is a testament to the resilience of the P&S brand, which has been able to overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic and continue to expand its operations, creating new job opportunities and contributing to the local economy.",
