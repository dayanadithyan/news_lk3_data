    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 China has denied a claim by the Sri Lankan government that Beijing has expressed interest in importing 100,000 toque macaque monkeys from the island nation and said such media reports are disinformation.",
    "The monkey business has become a sensational topic after Sri Lanka\u2019s Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said a visiting Chinese delegation has submitted a business proposal and top officials from Department of National Zoological Gardens, Department of Wildlife Conservation, and Ministry of Agriculture had a preliminary discussion on the proposal.",
    "Minister Amaraweera said they have decided to submit a cabinet proposal to appoint a committee to recommend the proposal. His colleague, Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardena, however on Tuesday denied any such cabinet proposal.",
    "Many local environmental and animal rights groups voiced against the government\u2019s decision without verifying the Chinese proposal.",
    "Chinese Embassy in Colombo said in a press release that it has noticed \u201crecent disinformation on local and foreign media about Sri Lanka to export\u00a0\u201c100 thousands\u201d\u00a0of\u00a0\u201cendangered\u201d\u00a0toque macaque monkeys to a Chinese private company for\u00a0\u201cexperimental purpose\u201d, as well as detailed clarifications by the Minister of Agriculture and the Cabinet Spokesperson of Sri Lanka thereafter.",
    "The Embassy said it had also checked with relevant authorities in Beijing.",
    "\u201cThe Chinese National Forestry and Grassland Administration, the main government department supervising and managing the import and export of wild animals and plants, clearly clarified that it is\u00a0not aware of the request and has not received such application from any side,\u201d it said.",
    "\u201cThe Embassy would like to further stress that as a contracting party of\u00a0Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), China has already adopted its\u00a0Wildlife Protection Law\u00a0in 1988 with several amendments afterwards.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Chinese government always attaches great importance to wildlife protection and actively fulfills international obligations, which makes China one of top countries in the world in terms of wildlife protection legislation and law enforcement,\u201d it said.",
    "A government source who is aware of the talks between the Chinese parties and authorities said monkey export was a suggestion first came from the Sri Lankan side and then was informed to Minister Amaraweera that \u201cChinese party was interested\u201d.",
    "Minister Amaraweera later explained enormous crop damage caused by toque macaque monkeys in Sri Lanka and hit back at environmental organizations which had opposed the monkey export move.",
    "\u201cWe will catch these animals and hand them over to them (environmentalists). Instead of blabbering, they can look after those animals.\u201d the minister said. (Colombo/April19/2023)"
