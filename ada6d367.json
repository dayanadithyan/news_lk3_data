    "The new electricity tariffs, effective July 1, will be announced on June 30, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said.",
    "Addressing the media, he said measures have been taken to publish the PUCSL's response to the proposed tariff revision submitted by the CEB on June 1 to inform the public.",
    "Accordingly, comments and suggestions are invited from the public regarding the three percent fee reduction proposal presented by the CEB and the alternative proposal presented by the Commission.",
    "However, the PUCSL's proposed tariff revision will be announced on June 1, he said.",
    "\"The public can submit their comments and suggestions in writing till June 20. There will also be an opportunity to submit oral comments regarding the tariff revision. We invite all parties to actively participate in this fee-setting process,\" Ratnayake said.",
    "\"During the tariff hike implemented last February, poor consumers who consume less than 90 units were unfairly hiked. Fees were increased from 150 percent to 250 percent in these categories in violation of the provisions of the Act that the basis of reasonable cost charging and affordability should be subsidized. Due to both recent tariff revisions, the tariff has increased by 1,200 percent for the categories with consumption less than 30 units,\" he said.",
    "Consumers who consume less than 120 units in the domestic sector, religious places, and tourist hotels, who were unfairly affected by the baseless tariff revision implemented last February, should be given justice in this tariff revision, he added. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
