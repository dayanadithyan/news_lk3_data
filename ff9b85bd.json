We have been able to come up with 50- strategic interventions to revive the construction industry. If we all work together we can rapidly revive it. As Secretary to the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing, I pledge my fullest support for all such endeavours. This Build SL exhibition is not an isolated event but it will be a land mark event that generates thousands of business opportunities,\u201d he said.",
