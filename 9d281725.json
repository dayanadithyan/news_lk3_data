    "Bloomberg:Central banks globally must remain vigilant until inflation is firmly under control, according to International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.",
    "\u201cI want to be clear we are not yet seeing inflation going down to target fast enough,\u201d Georgieva told Bloomberg Television\u2019s Haslinda Amin on the sidelines of the Group of 20 finance chiefs\u2019 meetings in Bengaluru, India. \u201cCentral banks need to stay the course until we are comfortable that price stability is returning.\u201d",
    "As many central bankers begin to slow their policy tightening, inflation prints across the world remain sticky. With China reopening at a pace that\u2019s exceeded expectations, Georgieva remained hopeful that domestic consumption there remains a growth driver for the world with little risk for an additional inflation flare-up.",
    "In the US, the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 5.4% in January from a year earlier and the core metric was up 4.7%, both marking pickups after several months of declines. In Europe, underlying inflation is forecast to stay at a record 5.3% and in many parts of Asia, including India and Australia, core inflation has remained sticky. Authorities shouldn\u2019t let their guard down as price stability is essential for investors and for consumers to keep on spending, which are the foundations for economic growth, according to the IMF chief.",
    "While China\u2019s resurgence this year is a boon, Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine is \u201cstill casting a long shadow on the global economy,\u201d Georgieva said Saturday.",
    "\u201cWhen we have uncertainty, that impacts investors, it impacts the ability for economies to grow,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course the war is terrible for the people of Ukraine. It is terrible for the world economy.\u201d",
    "Apart from the prolonged war and lingering inflation, debt troubles besetting poorer nations like Zambia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan are adding to uncertainties, said Georgieva.",
    "\u201cI am concerned about emerging markets and developing economies that have very little fiscal space or none,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at the same time they have to service that big part of it, of which is dollar denominated, on top of higher interest rates.\u201d",
