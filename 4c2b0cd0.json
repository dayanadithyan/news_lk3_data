    "Speaking during the SLFP\u2019s May Day rally in Kandy today (May 01), he said that they as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party will \u201cno longer go behind\u201d anyone and that if anyone wants to \u201cthey have to come to us and form an alliance.\u201d",
    "He conceded that they had made a mistake ahead of the Local Government election as, \u201ca giant of a party such as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party had reached an agreement with a party that no one knows about to contest under their symbol.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut lucky for us all, it has come to appoint that that election will not be held,\u201d the SLFP leader said, adding that he believes it is actually a blessing in disguise."
