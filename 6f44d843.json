    "Staying true to its purpose of empowering women to be economically independent, Diva, a proudly Sri Lankan laundry care brand, recently organised several Avurudu pola, where female entrepreneurs who had undergone Diva\u2019s entrepreneurial skills development programme earlier were given the opportunity to sell their products directly to consumers. Hemas paved the way for Diva to carry out this project at its head office and factory premises leading up to the Sinhala & Tamil New Year celebrations.",
    "The Diva Dathata Diriya purpose initiative supports women with career advice and professional skills through the recently concluded Entrepreneurial Skills Development Programmes to take their homegrown brands to the next level and equips women with financial and digital literacy skills to manage their households and businesses.",
    "The project seeks to support female entreprenurs at the grassroots and to encourage more women into the workforce, ultimately benefitting the nation. This project is an extension of Diva\u2019s brand purpose \u2013 to empower women and make their lives easier so that they can fulfill their ambitions.",
    "During Diva\u2019s journey spanning over 20 years, Diva has been able to support Sri Lankans with superior laundry care solutions while positioning itself as a local household brand that understands the local consumers\u2019 evolving needs.",
