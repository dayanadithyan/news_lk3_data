    "In a concerted effort to ensure healthcare equity for all Sri Lankans, the country\u2019s foremost trusted private healthcare provider Hemas Hospitals introduced \u2018Upakara\u2019, an unmatched timely initiative which offers free monthly dialysis cycles to a selected number of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients from low-income backgrounds, through Hemas Hospitals.",
    "Hemas Hospitals\u2019 Upakara is a one-of-a-kind initiative, contributing to the health and wellbeing of individuals from underprivileged and less fortunate communities, who are suffering from CKD. While most individuals face difficulties with affording basic healthcare during the country\u2019s perilous economic situation, this facility will be considered a life-saving, monumental effort from a private healthcare provider, contributing on a national level.",
    "\u201cChronic Kidney Disease is one among the most prevalent non-communicable diseases in Sri Lanka. Statistically, 20-25 percent of diabetic patients and 18-20 percent of patients with hypertension are prone to CKD. Holistically, one in 10 Sri Lankans is estimated to have CKD, while the vast majority is unaware of the fact that they have it, resulting in most patients seeking healthcare support at its late-stages. This forces CKD patients to either opt for kidney transplants or regular dialysis treatments, both bearing an intense level of financial burden on patients and their loved ones. Given the volatile macro-economic environment in the country today, this financial burden is heavier than ever before,\u201d stated Dr. Lakith Peiris, Managing Director Hemas Hospitals.",
    "\u201cA statistically higher number of CKD patients from the underprivileged communities who are affected by fewer resources prompted us to address this issue by extending our support to these communities with essential infrastructure and services through Hemas Hospitals\u2019 Upakara initiative,\u201d he added.",
    "CKD is fast becoming a major public health concern, attracting increased global attention due to rapid spread of the disease, and its grave impact on patients and their quality of life. With a larger number of CKD patients reported from Sri Lanka each year, the national healthcare system often finds it difficult to cater to the full requirement of all patients requiring dialysis, affecting their health and wellbeing on a large scale.",
    "With the aim of ensuring good governance and community participation, Upakara will be overseen and operated by a governance committee inclusive of key opinion leaders within the hospital and communities.",
    "With a vision of \u2018Making Healthful Living Happen\u2019, Hemas Hospitals intends to support CKD patients in a manner that eases the great financial burden that falls on them every month and enhances their access to life-saving dialysis treatment. At a time in the country when macro-economic volatility has destabilized personal economies, Upakara will lend greatly to easing the financial pressure of healthcare on these chronic patients and enable them to re-establish a sense of wellbeing.",
    "\u201cTherefore, in such a dire context, we believe Upakara is an important step forward in assuring health and healthcare equity in Sri Lanka, and consider it our duty as a responsible healthcare provider to ensure that all Sri Lankans have access to the life-saving treatment they require regardless of their financial background. Upakara was therefore borne with this vision, and we consider ourselves privileged to launch this vital CSR programme as we continue to work to eliminate disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases in Sri Lanka,\u201d stated Dr. Peiris.",
