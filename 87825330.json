    "Power and Energy Minister claims in Parliament PUCSL Chief to be sworn in as National List MP; Ratnayake issues stinker saying Kanchana playing typical politics",
    "Two apparent nemesis Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera and Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) Chairman Janaka Ratnayake were at war again yesterday.",
    "Minister Wijesekera yesterday claimed that Ratnayake will be sworn in as a National List MP from a political party.",
    "\u201cThe PUCSL Chairman should not be taken seriously because he is engaged in politics,\u201d Wijesekera told Parliament in response to a question raised by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa.",
    "In a stinker, Ratnayake said the Minister\u2019s statement is the \u201cbest example of a typical Sri Lankan politician.\u201d",
    "\u201cThey (politicians) only work for people because they have a hidden agenda, so when I work for the people without such an intention, they can\u2019t believe it. Just because politicians work for people for a benefit, I don\u203at,\u00bb Ratnayake retorted.",
    "In his statement in Parliament, Minister Wijesekera acknowledged that the recent electricity tariff was raised based on the conditions recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the Treasury should not pay for any State-owned enterprises (SOEs).",
    "\u201cWe have nothing to hide,\u201d he said, adding that they have got proper approval from the PUCSL for the recent power tariff hike with only the PUCSL Chairman against the move, and all the other members of the commission approved it.",
    "Minister Wijesekera also said the Government will bring in a new Bill to restructure the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to Parliament within a month.",
    "\u201cWe hope the Opposition will support this bill, which would put an end to certain groups\u2019 improper behaviour within CEB. The primary cause of the CEB\u2019s losses is the use of terror tactics by some factions. Some individuals have pushed the CEB administrators to the limit in order to complete tasks, and these activities have really resulted in losses for the CEB,\u201d he added.",
    "He also revealed that the CEB has incurred a total loss of Rs. 167 billion in 2022, but was hopeful that it could be avoided with the boosted income from the recent tariff hike."
