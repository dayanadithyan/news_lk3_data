    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s inflation in the 12-months to April 2023 has plunged to 35.3 percent from 50.3 percent a month earlier according a revised Colombo Consumer Price Index calculated by the state statistics office.",
    "In addition to the base effect (the index jumped 9.6 percent in April last year as the currency collapsed in a bloat botched by a surrender rule) the index also fell absolutely from 195 to 192.3 percent during the month.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank started to run balance of payments surpluses from around September 2022 with a guidance pegged backed by deflationary open market operations essentially losing the ability to create new inflation.",
    "However, it may take more than a year for the price structure of the country, including rents, wages and other services to fully adjust to the currency collapse in March 2022.",
    "Since September the revised Colombo Consumer Price Index has grown from 189.3 points to 192.3. In March the currency appreciated and after a brief period of volatility the central bank has stopped appreciation around 320 to the US dollar.",
    "An appreciation of the currency reduces the price of traded goods and may have a knock on positive effect on overall prices. (Colombo/Apr29/2023)"
