    "Dialog Axiata PLC has partnered with Meta to launch text-only Facebook and Discover app to enable those who are under-connected due to affordability constraints to access a text version of Facebook and browse text on the internet without incurring data charges.",
    "The text-only version of Facebook allows users to stay connected with friends and family, share updates, and access important information through their mobile devices, even when they run out of data. However, users will not be able to view videos or pictures on this version. Dialog customers now have the option to toggle between the text-only mode and the full version of Facebook (data mode) on their Facebook app.",
    "With the Discover mobile web and Android app, Dialog customers can browse websites across the internet without a data balance. To ensure sustainability of this initiative, Discover supports only low-bandwidth traffic when using free data, where video, audio, images, and certain other types of data-intensive traffic are not supported.",
    "\u201cAt Dialog, we believe that access to the internet is essential for every Sri Lankan, and we believe this initiative would enable our 17 million subscribers to access basic internet services,\u201d said Dialog Axiata PLC Group Chief Executive Supun Weerasinghe.",
    "\u201cIn line with Dialog\u2019s commitment to bridge the digital divide and facilitate affordable and accessible internet services to all, we\u2019re pleased to offer our customers the ability to use Facebook and surf the web without having to worry about data charges on Discover, so they can stay connected and informed no matter where they are.\u201d",
    "Meta\u2019s Vice President for International Business Development and Operator Partnerships in the Asia Pacific region Paul Kim said: \u201cWe are pleased to partner with Dialog to help improve access to consistent and reliable connectivity for the people of Sri Lanka. This is a step forward as we work together to remove key barriers to connectivity.\u201d"
