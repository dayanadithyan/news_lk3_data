    "Setting a new benchmark in the construction and aluminium industries, Sri Lanka\u2019s leading manufacturer of high-quality architectural aluminium joinery systems, glazing and fa\u00e7ade products, Hayleys Unisyst, contributed to the completion of yet another construction marvel \u2012 the 447 Luna Tower, a luxurious apartment complex situated at the heart of Colombo.",
    "Hayleys Unisyst, the sub-contractor of the project, was entrusted to provide the entirety of the aluminium solutions requirement of the mega-scale structure.",
    "The apartment complex is the first high-rise building in Sri Lanka to include the largest continuous unitised aluminium curtain wall: an external fa\u00e7ade complete with an aluminium framed wall containing fills of glass, aluminium spandrel panels, and thin composite panels or concrete spandrel panels.",
    "In addition to installing the 3800 square metres of unitised curtain wall, Hayleys Unisyst supplied 6000 square metres of doors and windows and 530 square metres of frameless items for the apartment complex.",
    "Going beyond its project scope, the company ensured sustainability to be a key driver in the project by deploying a highly skilled construction waste management crew for in-progress site clearance of all waste material. This was in addition to the specialist management team appointed to ensure smooth project progress at each milestone of the project.",
    "\u201cGiven the current market disruptions, completing a project of this scale within the stipulated time frame seemed impossible initially. However, with the extensive experience of our in-house aluminium fabrication, construction, safety and quality assurance teams, we were able to complete the project on time.",
    "\u201cToday, we are delighted that amidst the current economic challenges, we were able to offer aluminium solutions of the best quality for our client. It is a privilege to have contributed to such an important landmark in the Colombo skyline, like the 447 Luna Tower,\u201d Hayleys Unisyst PLC and Advantis Group Executive Director Janitha Jayanetti highlighted."
