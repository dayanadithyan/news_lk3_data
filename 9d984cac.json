    "An Australian woman who spent 20 years in prison was pardoned and released Monday based on new scientific evidence that her four children died by natural causes as she had insisted.",
    "The pardon was seen as the quickest way of getting Kathleen Folbigg out of prison, and a final report from the second inquiry into her guilt could recommend the state Court of Appeals quash her convictions.",
    "Folbigg, now 55, was released from a prison in Grafton, New South Wales state, following an unconditional pardon by Gov. Margaret Beazley.",
    "Australian state governors are figureheads who act on instructions of governments. New South Wales Attorney-General Michael Daley said former justice Tom Bathurst had advised him last week there was reasonable doubt about Folbigg\u2019s guilt based on new scientific evidence that the deaths could have been from natural causes.",
    "\u201cThere is a reasonable doubt as to Ms. Folbigg\u2019s guilt of the manslaughter of her child Caleb, the infliction of grievous bodily harm on her child Patrick and the murder of her children Patrick, Sarah and Laura,\u201d Daley told reporters.",
    "\u201cI have reached a view that there is reasonable doubt as to the guilt of Ms. Folbigg of those offenses,\u201d Daley added.",
    "Bathurst has conducted the second inquiry into Folbigg\u2019s guilt, initiated by a petition that said it was \u201cbased on significant positive evidence of natural causes of death\u201d and signed by 90 scientists, medical practitioners and related professionals.",
    "Prosecutors acknowledged to his inquiry in April that there was reasonable doubt about her guilt.",
    "Folbigg was serving a 30-year prison sentence that was to expire in 2033. She would have become eligible for parole in 2028.",
    "The children died separately over a decade, at between 19 days and 19 months old.",
    "Her first child, Caleb, was born in 1989 and died 19 days later in what a jury determined to be the lesser crime of manslaughter. Her second child, Patrick, was 8 months old when he died in 1991. Two years later, Sarah died at 10 months. In 1999, Folbigg\u2019s fourth child, Laura, died at 19 months.",
    "Evidence discovered in 2018 that both daughters carried a rare CALM2 genetic variant was one of the reasons that the inquiry was called.",
    "Lawyer Sophie Callan said expert evidence in the fields of cardiology and genetics indicated that the CALM2-G114R genetic variant \u201cis a reasonably possible cause\u201d of the daughters\u2019 sudden deaths.",
    "Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart, was also a \u201creasonably possible cause\u201d of Laura\u2019s death, Callan said.",
    "For Patrick, Callan said there was \u201cpersuasive expert evidence that as a matter of reasonable possibility, an underlying neurogenetic disorder\u201d caused his sudden death.",
    "The scientific evidence created doubt that Folbigg killed the three children and undermined the argument made in Caleb\u2019s case that four child deaths were an improbable coincidence, Callan said.",
    "Prosecutors had told the jury at her trial that the similarities among the deaths made coincidence an unlikely explanation.",
    "Folbigg was the only one at home or awake when the young children died. She said she discovered three of the deaths during trips to the bathroom and one while checking on a child\u2019s wellbeing.",
    "Prosecutors also had told the jury that Folbigg\u2019s diaries contained admissions of guilt.",
    "Her former husband, Craig Folbigg, said in submissions to the inquiry that the implausibility that four children in one family would die of natural causes before the age of 2 was compelling grounds to continue treating the diary entries as admissions of his former wife\u2019s guilt.",
    "But Callan said psychologists and psychiatrists gave evidence that it would be \u201cunreliable to interpret the entries in this way.\u201d",
    "Folbigg had been suffering a major depressive disorder and \u201cmaternal grief\u201d when she made the entries, Callan said."
