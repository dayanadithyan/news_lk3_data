    "The local music scene is certainly brightening up, and, I\u2019m told, the lead up to the festive season will be full of good things, where entertainment is concerned.",
    "Right now, social media is chock-a-block with advertisements\u2026all relating to the nightclub scene, but the cost factor is something to think about, since some of the performers are seen \u2013 here, there and everywhere! The only difference seems to be the venue, and the name of the event.",
    "There is also every possibility that we may miss seeing some of the big names in action here.",
    "Quite a few have already decided to venture out, overseas, to oblige their fans in other parts of the world, and in the forefront is Sohan Weerasinghe, leader of the X-Periments.",
    "This versatile artiste has turned out to be a huge drawcard, in the Western world, and that\u2019s because of his ability to captivate an audience, not only as a singer and entertainer, but also with his charm and charisma. No wonder he is known as the ladies\u2019 man!",
    "He was in London, not too long ago, performing at some of the dances, organised by the old boys of Colombo\u2019s leading schools.",
    "He is now ready to jet off to America and Canada, next month, with Sarith Surith & The News, for six events, and the itinerary is as follows:",
    "Two months later, in October, it will be London calling, again, for Sohan.",
    "The occasion will be the prestigious Dinner Dance, organised by the Trinity College Kandy Old Boys\u2019 Association UK.",
    "It will be held at the Thistle Hotel, in London, on October 14th, with the band Solid providing the music.",
    "There is also talk that Sohan will be in London to usher in 2024!",
    "And, following in the footsteps of Sohan is Janaka Palapathwala who also has dates in Canada and the States.",
    "On Friday, 16th June, Janaka will be performing at the \u201cStarlight Night\u201d Concert and Dinner Dance at J&J Swagat Convention Centre, in Toronto, Canada.",
    "According to Harini and Aloma Yapa, Janaka, whose singing style resonates to the likes of Jim Reeves and Elvis, is returning to Toronto, after six years!",
    "\u201cIf you are a fan of the Golden Oldies, then be assured Janaka will keep you entertained with his biggest hits from the Golden Era. With this year being Jim Reaves 100th birthday, Janaka will be highlighting more of Mr. Reeves\u2019 most popular songs, along with other Golden Age legends, including Elvis Presley, Engelbert Humperdinck, Tom Jones, Neil Diamond and Johnny Cash,\u201d say Harini and Aloma.",
