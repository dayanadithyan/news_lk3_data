    "Decision made following a key meeting with representatives of recognised political parties",
    "ECSL says a decision on polls will be taken considering proposals and concerns raised by the parties during the discussion",
    "The Commission also said a new date will be announced following discussions with the legislature, executive and other stakeholders.",
    "The Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) has yet again postponed the postal vote for the Local Government election indefinitely. Accordingly, the ECSL announced that the vote scheduled to take place from 28 - 30 March and 3 April will therefore not go ahead as planned. The decision was made public following a key meeting held between the commission and secretaries of recognised political parties at the ECSL yesterday.",
    "Issuing a statement, the ECSL said members of the commission held a lengthy discussion with the representatives of the political parties where they put forward several proposals and suggestions for the consideration of the commission. The Commissioner General of Elections, Saman Sri Ratnayake said the ECSL will arrive at a decision regarding the polls after careful consideration of the proposals put forward.",
    "It has been predicted that the Local Government poll set for 25 April will also likely be delayed as the Treasury has failed to release the funds required despite repeated requests by the ECSL and the Government Printer as well as an interim order issued by the Supreme Court preventing the Treasury Secretary from withholding funds allocated for the elections. The printing of ballot papers continues to be on hold due to the lack of funds.\u00a0 The ECSL said some party secretaries proposed that a new date for the Local Government election should be decided as it is unlikely it can be held on 25 April under the current circumstance. They also deemed it best to declare a new election date after making sure all necessary facilities are available and the environment is conducive to conducting the election.",
    "However, it is reported that certain political parties during the meeting had opposed the postponement of polls under any circumstances due to the interim injunction issued by the court. Ratnayake also said a new date for the vote will be announced following discussions with the legislature, executive and other stakeholders."
