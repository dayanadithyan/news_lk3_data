  "original_body_lines": [
    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka requested the President to NOT table the Anti-Terrorism Bill in its current form, until a national dialogue is concluded, and its recommendations are published along with a clear plan.",
    "The Human Rights Commission in a letter to the President said that in order to address the Anti-Terrorism Bill, it is imperative to further explore the much-delayed peace and reconciliation process.",
    "It added that this peace and reconciliation process would not only be for the communities in the North and East who suffered directly under the ravages of 30-plus years of horrific civil war.",
    "This process would also be for those communities affected by the uprisings in the South in the 70s' and 80s'where many remain greatly affected by both the uprising and the State's response, it added.",
    "The HRCSL is of the firm view that establishing a National Dialogue that equally addresses the peace and reconciliation process will better define the contextual necessity for a bill comparable to the proposed Anti Terrorism Bill and more importantly, it will show the government's commitment to ensuring and building further peace and harmony amongst the nation's citizenry."
