  "original_body_lines": [
    "Electricity consumers should receive an immediate electricity tariff reduction of approximately 20% based on facts like the reduced electricity demand in Sri Lanka, reduced exchange rates and reduction of fuel prices, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said.",
    "He said according to the tariff requested by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) on January 5, they had estimated an electricity demand of 16,520 GWh for 2023 while expecting a revenue of Rs. 722 billion for CEB from energy sales.",
    "\u201cBut the PUCSL forecast the generation demand of 15,031.42 GWh for 2023. Our demand forecast has been proven by actual demand for January to April and the reduced demand forecast by CEB for the rest of the year.",
    "\"According to CEB\u2019s revised demand forecast, the total demand for 2023 will be 15,377 GWh, which is very close to the demand that we forecast early this year. That was the main rationale in our staff\u2019s tariff recommendation which limited a tariff increase of below 35%,\" Ratnayake said.",
    "\u201cGiven all these facts, the PUCSL demands an immediate reduction of 20% on electricity tariffs,\u201d he added. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
