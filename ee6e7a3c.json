    "Growing dissension between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will result in a snap general election within six months, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) spokesman and MP S.M. Marikkar said today.",
    "\u201cWe have noticed that there are disagreements between the President and the SLPP. This was evident even yesterday when some of the SLPP seniors boycotted the meeting with the President. They said they did not participate as the invitation was not made through SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam. We also see some SLPP members complaining that the President is trying for a one-man show. This will end up with political dramas,\u201d the MP said.",
    "\u201cThe Rajapaksa family may be interested in bringing MP Namal Rajapaksa to the forefront. They will make him crossover to the opposition with others and then pave the way for him to become the Leader of the Opposition.\u00a0 President Wickremesinghe will be isolated and will not have a parliamentary majority. This will compel him to hold a general election. A general election would become an eventuality within six months,\u201d the MP added.",
    "\u201cMark my words, as my prediction will come true,\u201d he also said.",
    "He also said President Wickremeisnghe will not be able to carry on without a team.",
    "\u201cThe President cannot go along with ministry secretaries for long,\u201d Marikkar said. (Yohan Perera)"
