    "Some political parties including Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will meet today to take a final stand on the proposed Central Bank Amendment Bill.",
    "Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella told the Daily Mirror that some opposition political parties, including TNA and the group led by MP Dallas Allahaperuma met at the Parliamentary complex to discuss the Central Bank Amendment Bill and other business matters in the House.",
    "\u201cWe discussed mainly matters about the Central Bank Amendment Bill. The issue lies here is that according to the Bill the Central Bank Governor and the Deputy Governors would be appointed by the President. This begs a question on the independence of the Central Bank. Therefore, we decided that there should be amendments to the Bill. However, we decided to meet today once again to make a final decision.",
    "Notably, Jathika Jana Balawegaya has not participated in the discussion.",
    "Moreover, the SJB called for the appointment of a permanent chairman to the Public finance committee. \u201cThe party was to meet Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abewardene to discuss the issue, but the meeting was postponed,\u201d Mr. Kiriella said.",
    "\u201cThe government has been appointing temporary chairpersons to the committee but we want a permanent head appointed from the opposition as per the standing orders. (Yohan Perera)"
