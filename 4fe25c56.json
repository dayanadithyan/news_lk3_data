    "Nations Trust Bank has embarked on a new initiative to promote its remittance services and encourage more remittance inflows to support Sri Lanka\u2019s financial stability and economic growth. The Bank\u2019s new initiative is designed to benefit both senders and recipients of funds from abroad.",
    "Under the tagline \u201cWe transfer more than money\u201d, Nations Trust Bank\u2019s remittance services act as a medium to connect Sri Lankans with their loved ones abroad. To this effect, the Bank has placed a sound importance on maintaining strong relationships with those who matter most, by facilitating a remittance service that helps facilitate connections with family and other loved ones.",
    "To incentivise and motivate senders and receivers to transact via Nations Trust Bank\u2019s official channels, customers who perform remittances via the Bank have the opportunity to win supermarket vouchers. Every remittance of a minimum value of Rs. 50,000/- or its equivalent in foreign currency will stand as one entry.",
    "In addition, the winner of the grand draw will stand the chance to win return air tickets, once the campaign period ends on 18th June 2023, allowing loved ones to visit their family living abroad or in Sri Lanka. As a result of Nations Trust Bank\u2019s partnership with Singer, the two entities have a combined presence of over 500 locations across the country, creating added convenience for customers to send and receive funds.",
