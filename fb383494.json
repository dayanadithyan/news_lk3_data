    "Claims Ratnayake adopted sympathetic attitude to ensure basic needs of people",
    "Stresses PUCSL must be allowed to work without undue intervention by politicians",
    "Says MPs will face difficulty to raise hand and vote to fire of Ratnayake, who served public interest",
    "Independent Parliamentarian Prof. G.L. Peiris affirmed yesterday that members of the Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) will vote against the Government\u2019s motion tomorrow (24) to remove the Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) Chairman Janaka Ratnayake.",
    "\u201cWe have decided to strongly oppose this motion,\u201d he asserted. Peiris claimed that FPC is standing up for a principle rather than a specific individual, adding that Ratnayake has carried out his duties while showing consideration for the fundamental requirements of the citizens. \u201cWe perceive this very clearly as a matter which goes beyond individuals and as a crucial element of public policy,\u201d Peiris said. \u201cIf the PUCSL was formed using public funds, it must be permitted to carry out its duties without undue intervention from political authorities,\u201d he noted.",
    "Prof. Peiris also noted that the current Chairman firmly disagreed with the power cuts imposed during the Advanced Level examination and argued that electricity rates might be slashed by 27% using scientific methodology.",
    "\u201cWe are not for a person, we are for a principle. Ratnayake has had the courage, the determination to stand for the interests of the people of our country. It is the responsibility of the public representatives in Parliament to stand up for such a courageous official,\u201d he stressed.",
    "He also said it will be exceedingly difficult for MPs to raise their hand and vote for the removal of Ratnayake, who has acted in the interest of the people and to justify their decision to the long-suffering public who are being asked to pay exorbitant electricity tariffs."
