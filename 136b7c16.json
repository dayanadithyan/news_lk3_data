    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the island nation\u2019s ruling party, never requested President Ranil Wickremesinghe to appoint SLPP leader Mahinda Rajapaksa prime minister, the party\u2019s general secretary said.",
    "SLPP legislator Sagara Kariyawasam told reporter on Monday May 15 that Rajapaksa would only take up such a position \u201cwith the blessings of the people\u201d and not behind their back.",
    "\u201cThis is a falsehood circulated by politicians who have run out of topics and are trying to cover their own political nakedness,\u201d said Kariyawasam.",
    "The Colombo rumour mill was on high gear Friday May 12 evening after security forces personnel were seen deployed in streets and suburbs. Speculation was rife that Rajapaksa was to be appointed prime minister in a surprise move.",
    "It later transpired that the deployment was based on a false alarm.",
    "\u201cMahinda Rajapaksa is the greatest leader this country has had since independence. He is a leader who ended a war that four presidents could not finish and stopped Sinhalese youth coming home in coffins and removed the cyanide capsule from the children in the north so they could study,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cTo use his own language, he is not afraid to take power on behalf of the people and he can relinquish power for the people,\u201d he added, insisting that the party would never have him installed in a position of power through the backdoor.",
    "\u201cIf we do, it will definitely be with the blessings of the people and not behind their back,\u201d he said. (Colombo/May15/2023)"
