    "Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa should reveal his stand on Pastor Jerome who is at the center of controversy since there are suspicions that he also had connections with the pastor, alleged former MP P. Harrison.",
    "Harrison who held a media briefing today questioned why the Leader of the Opposition is silent on the issue.",
    "\u201cPastor Jerome had made insulting statements about the Buddha. Many have come up with statements with regard to this pastor. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has called for a probe on the pastor. Statements made by this pastor could disturb religious and ethnic harmony. We wonder why the Leader of the Opposition is silent about this. We doubt whether he has some connections with the pastor,\u201d the former MP said.\u00a0\u00a0(Yohan Perera)"
