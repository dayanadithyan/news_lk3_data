    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is likely to see $7 billion inflows in multilateral and bilateral fundings within 48 months once the island nation unlocks the International Monetary Fund (IMF) deal for a $2.9 billion loan, State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said.",
    "Sri Lanka is on a recovery path from its unprecedented economic crisis with the island nation having secured essentials including fuel, cooking gas, and medicines.",
    "However, that recovery has been slow as the country\u2019s government revenue is far below its state spending due to a bloated state sector and heavy repayment schedule.",
    "The sovereign debt default declared by the authorities has helped the country to have a breathing space from repayment of staggering debts, but the country will have to start repaying such debts after the debt restructuring is finalized following the IMF loan.",
    "\u201cThere will be faster improvements in the economy where we are expecting around a little over $7 billion within the 48 months where we are in the (IMF) program,\u201d Semesinghe told EconomyNext in an interview.",
    "\u201cThat is only from the financial institutions and other bilateral negotiations we have done. However, we see a lot of investment prospects in Sri Lanka and investments will prosper. We can see a lot of people who are interested in investing in Sri Lanka are looking forward to opportunities.\u201d",
    "The sovereign default has shut the door for Sri Lanka from borrowing bilateral, multilateral, and commercial loans.",
    "The IMF Executive Board is expected to approve the $2.9 billion loan to Sri Lanka on March 20 as all the creditors including China have given assurances for debt restructuring assurances in line with the IMF parameters.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re confident that we will get the approvals. It\u2019s vital to us,\u201d the minister said.",
    "I think we must put our fiscal system in place. What we have communicated to the entire world is that we have put our house in order.\u201d",
    "\u201cSo, we have to march forward. We have passed the most difficult times. But even 2023 will be quite critical for us, because that will be the year which is based on recovery.\u201d",
    "But that recovery has not been easy for President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s government which\u00a0includes\u00a0unlikely nationalist-minded leftists to liberals.",
    "The government has already raised taxes, fuel, and electricity prices, and allowed the rupee to somewhat reflect market exchange rates despite many such moves that faced protests and labour agitations.",
    "\u201cFrom 2024 onwards, we will be on a good path. I think the short term pains that people are going through right now will come to an end,\u201d Semasinghe said. (Colombo/March15/2023)"
