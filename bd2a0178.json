    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Several farmers in Sri Lanka who have used best agricultural practices and fertilizer have got a yield of 11000 kilograms of paddy per hectare, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.",
    "\u201cThis is the first time such high yields have been reported,\u201d Amaraweera said. \u201cThey have used fertilizer  correctly and also practices they have found.\u201d",
    "Three farmers have reached a yield of around 11000 kilogram (aboutg 4400 kilos an acre) while another farmer has got a yield of 9,992 kilos, he said.",
    "\u201cWe hope to recognize these farmers with awards,\u201d Minister Amaraweera said. \u201cIf their practical experience is widely known, it is will help the country. Then others can also get higher yields.\u201d",
    "A rice research institute official said the farmers have been using YaraMila fertilizer. It is an NPK complex which trace amounts of other nutrients, which the company claims to release evenly.",
    "The fertilizer however is expensive. Sri Lanka\u2019s vegetable farmers have also started to use the fertilizer sometimes in combination with others including organic fertilizer according to anecdotal information. Farmers say they use much smaller volumes of the NPK complex.",
    "An research official said the yield also depended on the area and soil conditions. Some other farmers have also reported high yields using ordinary fertilizer in some areas, the official said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s yields are highest in the dry and arid zones where rice is grown under irrigated conditions in where there is little or no cloud cover.",
    "Yields in the wet zone in the Western province for example are lower. Before the fertilizer ban hit agriculture the in the 2019/2020 Maha season Hambantota in the arid zone recorded about 6,300 kilograms per hectare yield compared to 3,500 for Colombo.",
    "In the 2020/21 Maha season the average yield in Hambantota fell to 3900 kilograms and in Colombo to 3,500 kilos. (Colombo/Apr20/2023)"
