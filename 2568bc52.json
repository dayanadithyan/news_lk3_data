  "original_body_lines": [
    "Referring to Sri Lanka's worst-ever marine disaster associated with the Singapore-registered MV X-Press Pearl container vessel, Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) was not adhering to the instructions given by the Attorney General (AG).",
    "Addressing a news briefing today (12), Dr. Rajapakshe said there had been dissent or different points of view between the MEPA and the AG about which the AG had raised serious concerns.",
    "\u201cThis scenario could be one of the reasons why this case has been dragging on for so long without any productive results. Hence, I had to get involved in the matter in order to ensure the smooth coordination between the MEPA and the Attorney General,\u201d he pointed out.",
    "\u201cThe AG is the one who provides legal advice to the President. In that context, the MEPA cannot surpass the AG nor can it ignore his instructions. The MEPA is bound to obey the AG,\u201d the Minister underscored.",
    "Furthermore, he said the AG and MEPA are two crucial parties in this case that should work hand in hand to ensure justice is meted out to Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cThus, the MEPA should comply with the instruction forwarded by the AG,\u201d he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
