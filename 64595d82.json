    "The National Action Plan further focuses on providing targeted support for women who have been, and continue to be, directly harmed by conflict, violence and climate insecurity.",
    "In addition, it aims to strengthen the security of marginalized women and girls, and the economic empowerment of women through access to equal opportunities and resources.",
    "Commenting on Sri Lanka\u2019s progress, the Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Mizukoshi Hideaki stated: \u201cThe Government of Japan welcomes the timely adoption of this National Action Plan, which will help Sri Lanka\u2019s commitments to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Through these programmes, workplans have been jointly developed at the district level to address issues that affect the well-being of women and girls during times of crisis.\u201d",
