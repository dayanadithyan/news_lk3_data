    "What has a nation, which cannot guarantee uninterrupted power supply to students sitting the Advanced Level examination, where large swathes of the populace go hungry, where the sick do not have access to essential medicine with many hospitals announcing that they have run out of supplies, have to \u2018celebrate\u2019 on its \u201875th Independence Day\u2019?",
    "This is an important question to ask. Reportedly, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has declared that it is important to mark that day in a \u2018grand and proud manner\u2026for otherwise, the world will say that we are not capable of celebrating even our independence.\u2019 That claim is nonsensical in the first instance. From where do politicians acquire such grandiose notions, we may ask with force? Certainly \u2018the world\u2019 (whatever that may mean) will be less than bothered if Sri Lanka \u2018celebrates\u2019 an independence day or not.",
    "In fact, there is a marvellous irony here which the President seems to be deaf, dumb and blind to. A bankrupt country teetering on the brink of a complete financial meltdown, begging from all and sundry for handouts, whose legal systems and justice institutions have been mercilessly pilloried as irredeemably politicised, can scarcely afford to waste millions on a single day \u2018celebration\u2019 of independence. That will perchance make \u2018the world\u2019 laugh and not kindly at that. This is a truth that a child will recognise.",
    "Indeed, the day would have been better marked by solemn prayers from the North to the South, for repentance and reformation of its rulers and citizens. There cannot be a more fitting time than now for collective repentance in accordance with the abiding precepts of the four great religions observed by the people of this land, Buddhism, Hindusim, Christianity and Islam. Our \u2018rulers\u2019 should repent for multiple violations of the Constitution, for precipitating the country to economic ruin, for thousands of named and nameless Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim victims killed on this soil.",
    "Each of these actions has had \u2018cause and effect\u2019 in bringing Sri Lanka to this piteous state. On their part, the \u2018ruled\u2019 should repent in sackcloth and ashes for being led, much like asinine sheep to the loud beating of the majoritarian or \u2018minoritarian\u2019 (as it may be) drum by their leaders.",
    "To be clear, this indictment does not apply only to flag bearers of the Medamulana brand of toxic Sinhala Buddhist nationalism which poisoned the national heartbeat and held large segments of the majority, captive, for the better part of two decades.",
    "On the contrary, repentance is also needed by those of the Tamil minority, blinded by falsely seductive promises of the Wanni\u2019s Sun God as any form of dissent, including intellectuals and academics, was ruthlessly eliminated.",
    "Neither can Muslim \u2018thinkers\u2019 who closed their eyes as radical Wahhabism grew steadily underfoot in the country, fostered and encouraged by the East\u2019s political leaders for their vote banks, be absolved. Their refusal to condemn the Islamist monster growing in their midst, was also influenced by political considerations.",
    "Effectively that was a contributory factor enabling the gruesome politico-military nexus that precipitated the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks on churches and hotels, killing hundreds who were praying or celebrating.",
    "It is well and good to point the accusing finger at former President Maithripala Sirisena and his defence cum intelligence officials, presently facing massive fines directed to be paid by the apex court upon a holding that they had forsaken primary duties of safeguarding the security of the country.",
    "These worthies deserved all of, (if not more), the harsh reprimands rained on their heads by the Supreme Court. But these were not the only points of responsibility in issue, make no mistake. The legal and constitutional chain of command apart, we had a Prime Minister who was silent about being shut out of security council meetings and a Cabinet who was blissfully in the dark, both being more preoccupied with political power games. By that time, the much vaunted \u2018yahapalanaya\u2019 rainbow revolution of the coalition Sirisena-Wickremesinghe regime was in utter shambles.",
    "As it collapsed, the Gotabhaya Rajapaksa Presidency was ushered in on a wave of Sinhala triumphalism.",
    "A disastrous two and a half years later, massive protests (\u2018Aragalaya\u2019) against the Presidency forced him and his Cabinet out of office. The extraordinary eruption of public fury against ruling politicians last year, did not spare the mausoleum of the Medamulana political dynasty which was destroyed in the South. That anger has not lessened. Rather, this has just seeped undergound.",
    "Assuredly, the re-awakening of public anger on the backs of cruel burdens foisted upon the populace while the political class prospers, promises to be more ferocious than the last. Surveying events of the past seven years in retrospect, it is almost as if the gods were dictating a fit punishment for the hubris of sinful rulers and a deluded people, for all the blood spilt during decades.",

That dignity can be restored only when politicians are held accountable and punished, as inconvenient a truth as that may be. Let us add to that wish list, the crying need for a \u2018proud and dignified\u2019 judiciary and a  Constitution that reflects the will of the people, not the political interests of passing rulers of the day.",
    "Despite the relief that accompanied the 21st Amendment to the Constitution on the part of some, it has so far, proved the cynics right. The Constitutional Council is underwhelming in its composition (to be kind), the so-called \u2018independent commissions\u2019 are under heavy siege, the latest being the Human Rights Commission which has been, ridiculously, blamed by a Minister for \u2018threatening\u2019 his officials.",
    "Meanwhile, a recent Presidential predilection to \u2018summon\u2019 these commissions, one example being the Elections Commission, does not set a happy precedent.",
    "So on this 75th Independence Day, what do we \u2018celebrate\u2019? The \u2018independence\u2019 of political robber cabals to mercilessly rob the country?",
