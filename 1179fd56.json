    "Sri Lankans are no longer getting booster doses of Coronavirus vaccines and laboratory capacity is also declining. Heath experts are calling for a plan to prepare for another pandemic.",

    "\u201cThey have distributed the equipment of the airport Covid-19 pandemic laboratories into several places,\u201d former head of the Medical Research Institute during the start of the pandemic, Jayaruwan Bandara, said.",
