    "Considering the previous and recent fuel price revisions, the three-wheeler fares can be reduced by Rs. 1, but there is no mechanism in place to implement it, All-Island Three-Wheeler Drivers\u2019 Union (AITWDU) president Lalith Dharmasekera said.",
    "He told the media that the price of petrol was reduced by Rs. 22 through the previous and recent fuel price revisions.",
    "\"No mechanism to reduce taxi fares is in place even with the price reductions within a gap of two or three weeks. When the petrol price was reduced by Rs. 60, the three-wheeler fares were limited to Rs. 100 for the first kilometre\u00a0and Rs. 80 for the second. But it was not implemented,\" he said.",
    "Even though the Three Wheeler Drivers' Union wants to regulate the fares, the government and its officials do not want that, he added.",
    "Dharmasekera claimed that the current petrol available in the country is not up to the quality standard and has affected the maximum distance a three-wheeler can drive.",
    "\"Even though the petrol price was reduced, the prices of spare parts, lubricants, service and other accessories have not come down. While considering all aspects and the fuel wastage per kilometre, only one rupee can be reduced from the current three-wheeler taxi fare,\" Dharmasekera added. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
