  "original_body_lines": [
    "Questions have been raised over a number of individuals employed by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) at District and Provincial level, who simultaneously hold positions of officer-bearers at Provincial Cricket Associations, District Cricket Associations and Clubs which have voting rights at SLC elections.",
    "Some of the individuals include those from the Hambantota, Galle, Matara, Kandy, Monaragala and Matale District Cricket Associations.",
    "The individuals is question receive salaries which come through SLC, and it being a conflict of interest for office bearers of vote-entitled associations has been suggested.",
    "SLC, however, did not believe that the situation at hand posed any threat to the integrity of the voting process, with Secretary Mohan De Silva stating that they take adequate preventive measure to ensure that employees drawing salaries are not involved in the voting process and are not entertained at Annual General Meetings.",
    "However, it has been called into question whether SLC\u2019s constitution supports its staff members being able to hold office in other associations which possess voting rights and whether such an arrangement impairs the objectivity of the voting clubs and associations."
