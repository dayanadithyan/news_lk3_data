    "Sri Lankans over the years have seen much religious tension and also loads of violence. Even if the majority of people from all religions have not attained the supreme bliss of enlightenment they must be mature enough to understand when rulers are working from behind the scenes and instigating religions tensions for their survival and benefit.",
    "We are in an era where the third generation of people has either embraced another religion after marriage or have decided to become atheists. Hence there is a large section of society, which is open and Liberal minded. This could be one reason why there are forums where religions are used in platforms where jokes are cracked and people have a good time; not turning a gathering into a battlefield.",
    "One good thing about such gatherings is that the people there have the power of tolerance. On the day, when the stand-up female comedian was arrested at the airport a TV news presenter in a leading media station read the news and then wound up that part of the segment by thanking the Police. This television personality poses as a Buddhist and even conducts Buddhist discussions on Poya Days. The envy that the presenter has against those who can present an opposing view to his and his bias towards his established views can be seen in subtle form behind that smile of contentment.",
    "At least the media must be neutral. Media stations must be watchful and ensure that reporting is fair and most importantly doesn\u2019t add fuel to the fire. Social media is hyperactive and one feature about such users which is the lack of effort that\u2019s taken to verify incidents has been dangerous.",
    "We can remember the backlash that took place here on the island after the false news spread that the late Ven. Gangodawila Soma was poisoned in Russia when he went to receive an award. Several Churches were damaged even though lives were not lost.",
    "Then there was the \u2018Vanda Koththu\u2019 episode where a leading doctor in Kurunegala was at the receiving end; just because he happened to be a Muslim. All charges against him turned out to be false and the State even paid all his back wages and reinstated him in his job.",
    "So many Buddhist priests and Buddhist organizations were hot on the heels of this doctor and despite him being proved innocent his detractors never bothered to offer an apology. As Sri Lankans, the country\u2019s majority needs to learn to spread some love.",
    "We need to see more compassion and love for the other human being; the other, who has an opposing view and was also born in this country.",
    "We conveniently forget that Sri Lanka has had a history of seeing many bloody battles. There is a story that when the Buddha -during one of his three visits to the island -landed here at a time when two brothers from the royal family were going to fight each other for a jewel-studded chair.",
    "The Buddha had successfully defused the tension and made the two brothers embrace Buddhism.",
    "If a person, uncivilized at that, makes derogatory remarks against another religion let that person lose a chunk of his spirituality. He will pay for his sins. That paying off his sins shouldn\u2019t happen at the expense of your peace.",
    "We remember the Easter Sunday carnage and the terrorist stack on the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy. People practising both these religions were calm and remained true to the teachings of their respective religions during that testing time. But some religious devotees here on the island haven\u2019t been able to hold on to that peace in recent times.",
    "This could be because of the unseen hands at work; people who come to power with our vote and use the people\u2019s weakest point, which is intolerance for their advantage of survival.",
    "Pastor Jerome\u2019s statement that Buddhists need to learn about love must be given thought; what seems not very appropriate was the manner in which the pastor put his point across in a derogatory manner.",
    "We don\u2019t need to join the forums that these stand-up comedians organise to pick from them the quality of being unnerved when your religion is used to crack a joke. We can borrow from that mentality; akin to having the guts of a burglar. As most religious leaders remind us the bliss that peace brings us is all in the mind and not in a religious attire of place or worship.",
    "We need to change our mentality so that we can stay calm during troubled times when our religious ships are travelling through troubled waters!"
