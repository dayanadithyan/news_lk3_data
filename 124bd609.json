    "The group acquired Almas Equities last year (former Assetline Securities) and has successfully recommenced its operations and merged well with the industry to provide much-needed services to investors both overseas and locally. The company has provided new opportunities to many who are seeking career progression and as a result, a dynamic team is being formed and is expanding rapidly.
