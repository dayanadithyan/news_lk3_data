    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will dismantle and crush illegally imported vehicle parts seized over time to sell as scrap metal, an official from Sri Lanka Customs said.",
    "\u201cOnly parts that are not listed in the Customs Act will be dismantled. Parts such as engines, dashboards and car doors are generally crushed,\u201d Media Spokesperson of Sri Lanka\u2019s Customs Sudaththa Silva told EconomyNext.",
    "Most illegal spare parts that need a license are imported by mixing them with legal spare parts due to restrictions in clearing through customs.",
    "\u201cWhatever that can be sold will be sold and crushed. This facility is provided within the legal confines of the Customs,\u201d Silva stated.",
    "The scrap metal is crushed to prevent the Customs from bending its Ordinance, as selling scrap metal as a whole will promote smuggling and law-bending, said Silva.",
    "Sri Lanka Customs said in a separate statement that the measures are being taken to prevent road accidents that can occur as a result of illegal vehicle modifications.",
    "In 2022, the former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa in the original budget for 2023 imposed a tax for modification or alteration and the \u201clegal registrations\u201d illegal motor cars.",
    "The main objectives of converting vehicle spare parts into scrap metal are to promote road safety, boost state revenue, clear storage space and set out a message to the public that such imports will not be cleared by the Customs, but will be crushed instead. (Colombo/ Feb 21/2023)"
