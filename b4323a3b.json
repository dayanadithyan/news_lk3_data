    "Tikhanovskaya is believed by many to have won the 2020 election against longtime dictator Alexander Lukashenko, who is a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. She fled Belarus shortly after the election result was announced. She had earlier agreed to run for the presidency when her husband, who had been the opposition presidential candidate, was arrested. He has since been jailed for 18 years.",
