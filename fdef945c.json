    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will start licensing more farmers to use firearms to protect crops as more farmland is coming under attack from wild animals, State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon said.",
    "\u201cWe had to take this decision because of the high wastage of crops and because this has been a requirement by farmers for a long time because of the several grievances they face,\u201d Tennakoon told EconomyNext.",
    "At present, farmers with more than five acres of land have the right to protect their property with a firearm, but an expert team appointed by Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage has suggested extending the permit to farmers with two acres or above.",
    "Licenses for firearms for crop protection activities can be obtained from the District Secretariats, Minister Tennakoon said.",
    "\u201cFirearms will only be issued if the candidates and the users fulfill the requirements,\u201d Tennakoon said without elaborating.",
    "Large amounts of crops are being destroyed annually by various wild animals, he said.",
    "\u201cWe haven\u2019t issued circulars or licenses recently to use firearms for crop protection, but since crop damage is increasing, we considered tightening the law,\u201d Tennakoon said.",
    "\u201cAnimals such as monkeys, peacocks, grizzled giant squirrels, porcupines, wild boars, and toque macaques listed on the protected list have been removed,\u201d Minister of Agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera told a group of farmers in February 2023.",
    "Following a collapse of the rupee in 2022 after the central bank printed money for two years to suppress interest rates, large numbers of the population has been pushed into poverty and malnutrition.",
    "According UN\u2019s World Food Programme, 32 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s households are food-insecure, meaning food insecurity as a lack of consistent access to enough food for every person in a household to live an active, healthy life. This can be a temporary situation for a family or can last a long time.",
    "About 73 percent of households have resorted to \u2018negative food and livelihood-based coping strategies\u2019 relying on less preferred and cheaper foods, limiting portion size and reducing the number of meals per day. (Colombo/May18/2023)"
