    "*** Reasons for major spike multifaceted including recent economic crisis",
    "With the dengue outbreak raging in the country, health experts warn that Sri Lanka is heading to a hyper or major epidemic wreaking havoc.",
    "Speaking with the Daily Mirror, Dr LakKumar Fernando, WHO Technical Advisory group member on Dengue and other Arbovirus diseases for South East Asian region said \u201cThe epidemic we are experiencing can be the worst since 2017 and 2019. Nevertheless, if preventive measures are not in place, the current situation may end up in a more devastating state reaching the number of cases in 2017,\u201d he stressed.",
    "\u201cThus, it is imperative that people take early precautions to clean the surroundings and avoid mosquito bites.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, when asked about the reasons that could be attributed to the sudden spike in cases, Dr. Fernando said \u201cThe reasons could be multifaceted. One is the recent economic crisis which caused continued lapses in dengue preventive actions increasing breeding places with dominance of relatively new DEN-3 serotype, which is becoming the main dengue serotype found among majority of infections at present. In addition, the situation has also been triggered by the scattered showers.\u201d",
    "\u201cOver the last few years, the majority of dengue cases belonged to the DEN-2 against which the people\u2019s immunity was powerful. However, the immunity against the serotype 3 is lesser than the serotype 2 and that\u2019s why the cases have soared drastically,\u201d he explained.",
    "Dengue infections are caused by four closely related viruses named DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4. These four viruses are called serotypes because each has different interactions with the antibodies in the human blood serum.",
    "The largest dengue outbreak in Sri Lanka was reported in 2017 registering 186,101 cases, while the number of cases reported in 2019 is the second largest. However, Sri Lanka has already surpassed the number of cases logged in the years 2020 and 2021 with six more months to spare. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
