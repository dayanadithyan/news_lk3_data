    "Citizens of this country received yet another rude shock on Wednesday when the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) with the approval of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) increased electricity rates by 66%.",
    "People are frustrated with the rising costs of living, but they have limited chances of voicing disapproval because the government ruthlessly cracks down on protesters. There are also ample signals let out by the government that it wants people to be aggressive and have confrontations with the law enforcement authorities; the hidden agenda could be to postpone LG polls.",
    "There is so much working in the minds of the citizens now. One is whether they should vote for an untested political alliance like the National People\u2019s Power (NPP). There is much momentum gathering in the NPP\u2019s direction and opinion expressed that the vote base of the NPP is sure to rise like never before.",
    "But people have questions. Questions like the ones that people always wearing their thinking caps asked about Gotabaya Rajapaksa just prior to the 2019 presidential elections. One question they asked \u2018Gota\u2019 was whether he had a proven track record in doing business or running a profitable organization? The answer that people found out to that question was no.",
    "Now we have to ask that same question from the NPP. What are the answers we\u2019ll get for that same question? The answer could well be \u2018no\u2019. It must also be said that other than the time they had ministers in the Chandrika Bandaranaike Government in 2005 the JVP has been mostly protesting against existing regimes by fueling trade union action. One main accusation against them is that the \u2018Red\u2019 party has only known destructive ways and sadly nothing about agriculture and production. But that was in the past.",
    "The present ways and thinking of the JVP turned into NPP is that it is talking more about accommodating the ideas of entrepreneurs and also discouraging the use of chemical fertilizer. Going by media reports the business community has shown some signs of believing in the NPP.",
    "Critics point out that it is ridiculous to associate the present NPP with the JVP of the past, which drove terror into the minds of the public during the revolutions of 1971 and 1989. Like with most terror organizations the JVP has refined over the years and has in its ranks educated members of \u2018Sahodarayas\u2019 \u2013brothers as they are addressed within this organization-who have the potential to deliver in ministerial posts if chosen. This is because they too have earned their qualifications from the same state universities that have produced other lawmakers and career professionals who are serving other political parties and also private and state enterprises in top posts.",
    "However critics also have two little concerns about the alliance led by this third force if it assumes power. One is whether the NPP can instill in the public and especially employees of state organizations much needed discipline. We have seen during every May Day rally how the Reds clean up the streets they paraded on before all activities of the rally come to an end. Are the people of this country willing to change and embrace discipline? The other issue worrying some of us is the aggressive nature in which representatives of the NPP exhibit at television talk shows. Does this suggest that no one can approach them and settle disputes amicably in the event they assume power? The NPP has time and again pointed out at several forums that the country\u2019s lawmakers and state enterprises must eradicate waste. The NPP has as part of its vision for the country a plan to infuse new vigour and energy to the government sector, reduce income distribution inequality and undertake infrastructure development projects only after accessing their contribution to the economy.",
    "The JVP that leads the NPP has shed some of its most negative traits. However, their aggressive approach at rallies and when talking to audiences will remain. The blood red colour that the \u2018Sahodarayas\u2019 associated with is now largely associated with purple; the color used in the NPP alliance symbol. The days are warm again, but there is also a gentle breeze. It\u2019s hard to cultivate hope, but the optimists are trying hard!"
