  "original_body_lines": [
    "Issuing a circular to halt fumigation has caused a dengue epidemic situation, Academy of Health Professionals (AHP) president Ravi Kumudesh said today.",
    "Addressing the media today, he said the Health Ministry had issued a circular announcing the halting of fumigation until a dengue epidemic situation emerges.",
    "The AHP had warned that there has been a trend towards a dengue epidemic situation for three months. But the Ministry had issued a circular last year not to engage in fumigation activities unless there is an epidemic situation.",
    "When one patient is diagnosed with dengue, the number of mosquitoes that bite him determines how many other patients will be infected.",
    "Therefore, even if it is a single patient, the best action that can be taken to drive away the mosquitoes that bite the patient is to fumigate the patient's surrounding areas.",
    "Stopping that action through a circular before the epidemic emerges is the reason why the epidemic spread so fast. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
