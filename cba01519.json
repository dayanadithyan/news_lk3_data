    "Holders of Sri Lanka\u2019s international sovereign bonds face a 20% principal haircut in the country\u2019s debt restructuring as well as maturity extensions and a reduction in coupons, according to a Barclays report.",
    "Investors\u2019 focus has shifted to the restructuring of Sri Lanka\u2019s $13.4 billion sovereign dollar bonds after Colombo got final sign-off on a $3 billion programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) earlier this week, a financial lifeline in its bid to recover from its worst economic crisis in more than seven decades.",
    "Barclays estimates investors holding the country\u2019s sovereign bonds could see a recovery value - the percentage they recoup on their investment - in the mid-40s while exit yields could range from 12% to 15%.",
    "An inclusion of instruments such as GDP-warrants which link payout to a country\u2019s economic performance in the debt restructuring could potentially improve the recovery value to the mid-50s.",
    "\u201cBoard approval of the IMF facility paves the way for bondholder talks and start of a debt-restructuring process,\u201d Avanti Save at Barclays wrote in the note to clients. The island nation of 22 million people defaulted on its external debt with private creditors last year, and still needs to negotiate a debt restructuring with bilateral creditors such as India, China and the Paris Club.",
    "Analysts at investment firm Tellimer put together \u201cthree baseline restructuring scenarios\u201d with six-year maturity extension for all of them and nominal haircuts raging between 15% to 30%, with higher coupons corresponding to lower haircuts.",
    "Each scenario \u201cresults in public debt falling to around 111% of GDP this year and below 95% by 2032,\u201d the firm added, in line with the IMF\u2019s debt to GDP targets.",
    "\u201cEach of the three baseline scenarios also implies roughly equal net present value relief of 23-28% at the IMF\u2019s preferred 5% discount rate,\u201d the Tellimer report added.",
    "The firm added that it\u2019s using higher exit yields -ranging from 12% to 14%- to calculate the debt restructuring scenarios amid a sharp rise in risk-free rates over the past couple of years combined with a rise in emerging market spreads in recent weeks.",
    "Barclays also noted that the IMF\u2019s restructuring scenario assumed that certain domestic debts will be reprofiled.",
    "The IMF itself said in the programme published this week that Sri Lanka\u2019s authorities are \u201cweighing different options\u201d on how to treat local currency debt under local law.",
    "However, the nation\u2019s state finance minister Shehan Semasinghe told Reuters that it was \u201ctoo premature\u201d to comment on a domestic debt overhaul as a final decision on whether such a restructuring would take place had not been taken.",
    "The country\u2019s international bonds have been trading at deeply distressed levels for months, with most between 37 to 39 cents in the dollar, according to Tradeweb data."
