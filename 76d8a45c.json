    "Moral grandstanding over stupidity is a trait we had best shed in 2023 and beyond",
    "So, three years in, the bell has rung, and the lies are rife, and they have destabilised the world overall, and many of the composite worlds that constitute that world.",
    "The Covidian mafia and \u201cvaccine\u201d fanatics chasing each Omicron \u201cscariant\u201d they can rustle up may never apologise. But proclamations of renewed \u201cmasquerade\u201d hysteria in India and whatnot aside (India\u2019s recent \u201cwave\u201d has already flattened after the silly hue and cry), the implication that there is any basis for the public health charlatans to be dispensing \u201cjudgments\u201d at all is beyond staggering.",
    "We all lost friends, some relatives too. Not to COVID of course. The only people who really lost someone there, painfully of course still, were over 75, or with multiple comorbidities.",
    "People \u201clost\u201d relationships galore, thanks to government\u2019s wanton invasion into our private lives, media-fed lockdown panic and then all the rancour over the untested \u201cgene therapy\u201d posing as \u201cvaccines\u201d (those mRNA shots).",
    "A cousin of mine loved to tell my mother, \u201cI\u2019m a doctor\u2026\u201d before his Covidian homily. I suggested she remind him, that therefore he should be able to read\u2026simple data and results. His sheer membership in a medical cult was of no interest.",
    "How many people were told they were being selfish and stupid and didn\u2019t understand \u201cthe science?\u201d And then they wouldn\u2019t let eminent scientists speak or be published!",
    "Of course, \u201cthey\u201d all understood \u201cvaccines\u201d and we didn\u2019t, even though we were all accused of clearly risking their lives by being a walking bio hazard it was asserted and incidentally our own, doubtless out of spite, or fear of needles, or actually fear of untested, uncorroborated gibberish.",
    "Then experimental biotechnology was somehow more important than our being able to conduct business or keep jobs, and we needn\u2019t be able to congregate in movie theatres or sporting events or restaurants or planes, decimating all those related industries too over the \u201chazard\u201d equivalent of a median influenza strain.",
    "Of course, schisms took place. In many countries, families stopped talking to each other. \u201cUnmasked\u201d you couldn\u2019t be seen at family gatherings, even though smoke particles (larger than their pathogenic counterparts) readily went through the masks, you had to \u201csport\u201d them anyway.",
    "Here in Lanka, leaders who were applying proverbial sledgehammers to the economy, were swooned over for their ability to have the most oppressive (initially) shutdowns, 24/7, and we touted our fabled \u201cresilience.\u201d Of course, there is remarkable resilience here, but it should be reserved for unavoidable disasters, not those we merrily exacerbate by not applying prudence and critical assessment.",
    "And we need to revisit all this, because the dominoes of sanity and logic and prudence fell so readily, and we dare not build our recovery on such quicksand or our future on such shifting sands.",
    "Moral grandstanding over stupidity is a trait we had best shed in 2023 and beyond. Today\u2019s challenges, striking poses over ethnic chauvinism, the tugs of economic illiteracy, and bureaucratic turpitude as a way to define our national character have to be transcended and we must rediscover what our culture is actually calling us to and what it is capable of. Hint: far more and far better!",
    "2021 we hit peak stupidity. By the second half a remarkable number of people still thought the mRNAs worked. Why? It was beyond obvious they had failed, not just to those who had not taken the hypnotic induction, but even to the \u201cvaccine\u201d companies and governments, who were pushing more and more unrelated \u201cboosters\u201d while twisting and mangling the word \u201cvaccine\u201d as well as the concept of \u201cimmunity\u201d beyond recognition.",
    "However, now in May 2023, two further years on, the debris and wreckage has continued to pile up. The mRNA addicted countries have had multiple C-19 waves despite the widespread \u201cvaccination\u201d of adults over 65: Canada, South Korea, Australia (where a dizzying 99% of people over 70 were \u201cvaccinated\u201d by beginning of 2022), all had more deaths in 2022 than ever before, including \u201cvaccine\u201d free 2020!",
    "There are philosophical and ethical issues here galore. By what right do you get to destroy people and undo basic civil liberties over a madly hyped respiratory virus? This would have been unhinged even if C-19 was far more dangerous than it actually was. However, we now know, the mRNA \u2018jabs\u2019 were far from the touted panaceas they were rolled out as.",
    "And so, today, if you find someone still aloft their high horse, unwilling to dismount, you are in the presence of the dangerous lure of a popular narrative. And even if you think C-19 is done, there are new popular narratives being minted, and clearly our paradigmatic immune systems need substantial rebuilding and repair, our penchant for gullibility is a tad too evident.",
    "In the face of whatever is the \u201cmass appeal\u201d of the day, people\u2019s better sense buckles, too many are revealed as cowards. The recent version as itemised was cowering away in apartments and behind masks and ludicrous face shields, mulishly following useless rules and rituals. And when the \u201cmiracle\u201d shot landed, they leapt forward, with the crackpot abandon of a true fanatic.",
    "And today, the inability to admit the truth blaring at them, the incorrigibility of their ignorance is what is damning. Instead of pretending it didn\u2019t happen, instead of \u201cpretending\u201d we weren\u2019t complicit in global meltdown and national disgrace, instead of making \u201callowances\u201d for being pawns, perhaps we need to now demand and expect better, at least of ourselves and those we commune with and collaborate with.",
    "And much of the danger here then is we get alienated from the particularity of suffering, on the national stage or indeed in global corridors. Let us tune into, a broader, historical perspective.",
    "Professor Emma Smith of Oxford delightfully reminds us, in this period where we are just transitioning from social distancing, lockdowns or outright curfews, that truly there is nothing new under the sun.",
    "The great playwright, William Shakespeare, the greatest scrivener of the English language, spent much of his life, writing in plague-induced quarantine.",
    "The plague hit in 1564 just after his birth, theatres were shuttered again in 1592-3 for another epidemic (he wrote beautiful erotica during this period, truly, in the form of \u201cVenus and Adonis\u201d as well as \u201cThe Rape of Lucrece\u201d which Professor Smith describes aptly as \u201cqueasily voyeuristic\u201d).",
    "\u201cMeasure for Measure\u201d was likely penned when plague in 1603-4 prevented coronation celebrations for the new king James I, 1 in 5 Londoners succumbed to the disease (again offering perspective in terms of lethality and even contagiousness).",
    "Summer of 1606 saw yet another outbreak, and as \u201cKing Lear\u201d was presented during the Christmas holidays of that year, St. Stephen\u2019s Day specifically, the Bard was doubtless chiselling away at his masterpiece under some movement restrictions.",
    "Shakespeare though does not ever showcase the plague as an explicit topic in any of his plays, and here too we need to take guidance, not to be so besotted with \u201cthings COVID\u201d or the \u201ccrisis du jour\u201d that we can\u2019t see straight about anything else.",
    "Lear unloads some plague-rich language calling one of his daughters and her husband, \u201ca plague-sore or embossed carbuncle/In my corrupted blood.\u201d Inflamed lymph glands were a feared symptom of the disease.",
    "However, the real \u201cplague\u201d of the plague is that it converts everything into ill-defined statistics... how many infected, how many deaths, rates of new cases -- often hiding the humanity, the specificity, the particularity of the suffering, the personal and economic turmoil.",
    "And this is what Shakespeare so vividly painted in his gorgeous plays and poetry. Shakespeare rendered the tragic suffering he often portrayed as highly specific, showcasing the glory and folly of our human uniqueness.",
    "And beyond our infatuation with ourselves and \u201csafety in statistics,\u201d perhaps with Shakespeare we too can remember that other lives, other narratives, other griefs, have meaning too...and we can rally to their side.",
    "We don\u2019t offer love and support to \u201cstatistics\u201d but to \u201cpeople.\u201d",
    "Pandemics remind us in a positive sense, if we let them as Shakespeare\u2019s contemporary Thomas Dekker wrote, \u201cServant and master, foul and fair/One livery wear, and fellows are.\u201d We are all united.",
    "Matthias Desmet who coined the controversial concept of \u201cMass Formation\u201d (largely controversial for being a self-evidently compelling description of modern derangement), reports on a controversial news item in Belgium: nine teachers of a Belgian sports school were suspended because they exchanged homophobic, sexist and racist messages in a private WhatsApp group. The diagnosis and characterisation of their comments issued from some fount of probity doubtless.",
    "\u2018Whistleblowers\u2019 had complained to the school\u2019s management that they shared such messages about colleagues and students. The teachers were immediately preventively suspended and an investigation into inappropriate behaviour was launched.",
    "One may be a tad curious. I don\u2019t really know how sexist and how racist those teachers truly are. Desmet assures us, \u201cIf the headlines are to be believed, they are quite some monsters.\u201d",
    "Nevertheless, even if you simply bandy words as once they were traded, with verve and idiosyncrasy, with idiom and national spin, then, as per today\u2019s dispensers of \u201cvirtue\u201d in the mass media, many of us are also far-right ideologues of anti-government extremism. Translated, this just means that someone dared to question the lack of infallibility of our political \u201cmasters.\u201d",
    "But what might give real pause is that I\u2019m not entirely sure whether what those teachers say in a private WhatsApp group should actually be made the subject of scrutiny by anyone. How are their private larcenies of language or thought a matter for public pillorying? People say quite a lot in private. And we all erupt at times and then blush at our extreme reactions but would hope not to be judged by them. As Desmet writes so hauntingly, \u201cAnd in the depths of our minds, we may all be God, but we\u2019re all a little bit scum, too.\u201d",
    "\u201cA little bit?\u201d That\u2019s generous. We are all sinners. And only those who can face that, have a shot at the \u201csaintly\u201d side of the ledger. \u201cSin\u201d frankly was simply defined as \u201cmissing the mark.\u201d Yes, who doesn\u2019t? And frequently. And we can\u2019t transform, as I have written before, what we won\u2019t face.",
    "In our moments of confusion, we sometimes even dream, in the depths of our minds, of spying on others in their private lives and punishing them for the things they do in the depths of their minds. But when we actually act on this, it becomes the stuff of nightmares.",
    "For too many today, instead of grappling with our demons, we simply want to medicate them into submission. To ensure we learn nothing from them, we aim to smother and subjugate all those energies from which human dreams and creativity also emerge.",
    "If we define \u201cfilth\u201d and call it simply brain biochemistry, then \u201cBig (P)Harma\u201d can continue on its merry pill peddling way. We still have to wait a bit for the right pill, but we doubtless already have something in the pharmacy that can give them a nudge in the right direction.",
    "If you stayed with the fascinating byways of the Belgian press, you would then read the police had visited (I kid you not) some of those teachers to confiscate their mobile phones. Apparently, the public prosecutor\u2019s office had also launched an investigation.",
    "In a \u201ccoarse\u201d way, that makes perfect sense of course. Once you have decided as a society that someone is an outright danger to the New Morality based on what he says in a private WhatsApp group, and you somehow are entitled to occupy the seat of aesthetic and moral judgment even on private exchanges, then surely the judiciary and police cannot stay behind.",
    "And lest you think this is exaggeration, here is what happened to a medical and scientific professional who had the temerity to \u201clike\u201d a factually accurate tweet too much.",
    "The President of Thomas Jefferson University was publicly castigated and criticised for his \u201ccareless use\u201d of his Twitter account to \u201clike\u201d tweets by Alex Berenson where Berenson questions the efficacy of the \u201cvaccines\u201d completely justifiably on the data and facts.",
    "By the way, said President, Tykocinski is a Yale-educated molecular immunologist! He has worked at the university for 16 years. The tweet he \u201cliked\u201d was Berenson\u2019s characterisation of the mRNA vaccines to have been what we \u201crationally\u201d might have expected, \u201cAnother in a long line of overhyped, rushed, profit driven Big Pharma flops with weak long-term efficacy and a lousy side effect profile\u2026\u201d",
    "Tykocinski had to apologise indicating that he did not know \u201cliking\u201d a Tweet was endorsing it! Oh, how craven we have to become. A feckless reporter initiated this witch hunt, to go after a 70-year-old professional with an unblemished academic record for the crime of liking accurate tweets that went against the \u201cvalues\u201d of the employer. If we all accept this, \u201cacademic freedom\u201d becomes yet another casualty of the age.",
    "\u201cNeither Shakespeare, not Swift, nor Wellington saw war as we have seen it. Shakespeare blamed great men, saying \u2018Could great men thunder as Jove himself does, Jove would ne\u2019er be quiet; for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder: nothing but thunder.\u2019 Of course, he could not even in fevered fantasies have contemplated such wanton, widescale destruction from the literal twitch of a finger. An angry ape endowed with powers of destruction that Jove never pretended to, would have beggared even the Bard\u2019s powers of expression.\u201d",
    "Well neither Arthur Miller, nor Lawrence and Lee, nor Chayefsky, could have anticipated the erosion of our conscience, and the corrosion of our perspicacity, rendering us so absurdly susceptible to being terrorised by lunatic fringe alarmists, nihilists with medical badges, and so called \u201cleaders\u201d who swoon at the inducements of authoritarianism. Who could have painted our mass servility so comprehensively? Here we are, an entire society wishing to flee from accountability, readily willing to audition as lemmings.",
    "Our immunity to gaining insight from a variety of sources, to our venerating distraction, commercial gewgaws and the aesthetic degradation of kitsch, all compound and provide a toxic cocktail that leaves us amenable to manipulation, salivating on cue, reflexively distracted and thereby indifferent to any call to ripen into self-aware personhood.",
    "Hence, we went along with being locked inside with pathetic gullibility and making a virtue of our being terrorised and paralysed. And our moral ennui is recast as \u201csaving granny\u201d or \u201cprotecting the world\u201d, as long as those who are disposable bring me my dinner, my cosmetics, my pharmaceutical supply and any other trinkets or amusements which allow me to \u201cpad\u201d my cell.",
    "Back in Shaw\u2019s era, khaki clad officers flocked to theatres, bewildered by the dramatic, looking for diversion and antics and tomfoolery, artists imitating cocks crowing and pigs squeaking, Shaw tells us,",
    "\u201cTo the theatre ultimately it will not matter. Whatever Bastilles fall, the theatre will stand\u2026Prime Ministers and Commanders-in-Chief have passed from a brief glory as Solons and Caesars into failure and obscurity as closely on one another\u2019s heels as the descendants of Banquo. But Euripides, and Aristophanes, Shakespeare and Moliere, Goethe and Ibsen, remain fixed in their everlasting seats.\u201d",
    "Well, that amphitheatre of greatness is cobwebbed today, replaced by Disney and other cartoonish distractions. Those giants who drew our portrait, and catalysed us beyond our chagrin, who amused us, bemused us, edified us, enlarged us, inspired and challenged us, reign in some alternate universe where we truly did take the road less travelled.",
    "Where we did not sell our faculties and wits for deadening diversions that rendered us too insensate to intuit what was happening, too feeble to think, too shallow to feel, too lazy to extend ourselves beyond our comfort zones, too callow to summon the courage we needed. Yes, they are in their everlasting seats. But we run the risk of lurching away, almost comically obtuse, travesties of ourselves.",
    "So RFK is running for President in the US, and CJ Hopkins, searingly caustic as ever, wants him to cut loose, to say clearly what he wishes to do, namely \u201cto end the corrupt merger of state and corporate power that is threatening now to impose a new kind of corporate feudalism in our country\u2026\u201d",
    "So, perhaps we have to stop being \u201cpolite\u201d and telling the truth for mainstream consumption. Perhaps we have to let loose about the reality that was \u201cdecommissioned\u201d by the hucksters and the pathologised totalitarianism it was replaced by.",
    "Remember this is garbage. There was no apocalyptic virus (remember it had a survival rate of 99.7% around the world) that nearly wiped out our planet, and we were therefore not \u201csaved\u201d by mass house arrest, enforced conformity rituals, cancellation of rights, censorship of dissent, manic jabbing of children and vast swathes of society never at risk, having societies plunged into hunger and industries and businesses into ruin to bail out our financial masters whose \u201csystem\u201d was melting down once more on a flimsy pretext\u2026",
    "And let\u2019s be grateful, ever so grateful, that in Sri Lanka there are real existential crises to confront and navigate, painful and challenging as they are. A budget to balance, an investment landscape to make fertile, exports to add value to, tourists to welcome to value added niches, children to meaningfully educate, a society to remake. And hopefully there is a trance we have awoken from. But we do need to keep jolting ourselves awake and be resources for each other in that project.",
    "And we need grownups back, not toddlers. People with vision and accountability and the capacity to execute above all. We need generalists occupying positions of leadership, who can tap specialists, and then together exhume the skeletons of past incompetence, give them a proper burial by learning from them, and then embrace the future with fresh wits and renewed vitality.",
