    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera has suspended 40 fuel stations for breaching the government\u2019s QR code rule while the latest technology will be implemented to ensure the fuel stocks.",
    "Sri Lanka is recovering from one of its worst fuel crises in history. Motorists were forced to wait days in congested queues for pump fuel in mid last year soon after the island nation declared sovereign debt default, which deprived it of its external borrowing.",
    "The QR code system was introduced in August last year to limit fuel to vehicles aiming to supply most vehicles with lesser quantity. However, some fuel stations have supplied fuel more than the weekly limited quantity and some have supplied even without QR code, officials say.",
    "\u201cDecisions were taken to suspend 40 fuel stations that have continuously not adhered to QR quotas,\u201d Minister Wijesekera told in his twitter platform.",
    "The loss-making state-run fuel retailer Ceylon Petroleum Corporation ran out of stocks as it did not have US dollars to import fuel last year. Since then it has been implementing a tight stocking process to ensure continuous sully.",
    "The Minister said all fuel stations would be required to maintain a minimum 50% of stock tank capacity.",
    "\u201cGPS tracking systems will be fixed to all CPC owned Fuel tankers by 15th April & all private tankers will be followed.\u201d",
    "Fuel shortage last year along with many other shortages led to a political crisis and resulted in strong protest ousting former leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa. (Colombo/April06/2023)"
