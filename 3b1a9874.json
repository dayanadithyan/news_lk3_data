    "The project also will recruit 20 new riders to pilot the deployment of E-bikes for delivery services in a timely, cost-saving, and environmentally safer manner. This one grant activity, within a larger group of grants, will assist in catalyzing the development of EV charging stations in the country.",
    "\u201cThe United States and the American people are proud of our enduring and robust 75-year partnership with the people of Sri Lanka,\u201d said USAID Mission Director Gabriel Grau.",
