    "When a central bank buys dollars it creates new rupees. If the holders of the new rupees spend the money especially on imports, the agency has to sell back the dollars and take back the liquidity to keep the exchange rate stable.",

    "When private credit is strong, such central banks will re-inject money to maintain its policy rate and trigger more demand for dollars, rapidly running down reserves and triggering a full blown currency crisis.",
    "Intermediate regimes are found in all countries that suffer monetary instability and go to the IMF.",
    "Because intermediate regimes are not changed to consistent credible regimes, like a hard peg or a clean float with a low inflation target, they keep going to the IMF again and again.",
    "Several of them, which got market access in recent years with exceptionally low US interest rates, have now defaulted. (Colombo/Mar15/2023)"
