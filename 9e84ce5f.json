  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will present its deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) once agreement has been reached, after which the legislature can either accept it or propose an alternative, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "\u201cOnce the IMF agreement is reached, the agreement would be tabled in Parliament. I request the House to accept it or give an alternative,\u201d he said in a special statement made to parliament on Tuesday March 07.",
    "Wickremesinghe announced that Sri Lanka had signed a letter of intent on the IMF deal to be submitted to the international lender\u2019s executive board for its approval. He also said the government has received a second letter from Beijing the same night, assuring the crisis-hit nation of assistance in debt restructuring.",
    "\u201cWe expect Board Approval in the third or fourth week of March,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is largely in support of what will be the island nation\u2019s 17th IMF programme, with some disagreements over its conditions on tax collection and cost-reflective utility and other tariffs.",
    "Among other opposition parties, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) has not expressed any opposition to the agreement. Members of the leftist National People\u2019s Power (NPP), however, has articulated positions of ideological opposition to the IMF and other Western-led institutions but its leaders have not publicly committed to a decidedly anti-IMF stance.
