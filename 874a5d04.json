    "Sri Lanka has kicked off negotiations with India for a fresh US $ 1 billion equivalent Indian rupee (INR) currency swap facility to facilitate bilateral trade.",
    "\u201c\u2026 the negotiations are also underway to secure an Indian rupee swap from RBI. The amount is still uncertain; it could be up to the equivalent of US $ 1 billion. That\u2019s still being worked out. This is expected to facilitate Sri Lanka-India trade,\u201d former Central Bank Governor and senior economist Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy told an expert panel discussion organised by the Centre for Banking Studies of the Central\u00a0Bank, yesterday.",
    "Meanwhile, the government has also begun negotiations with Indian authorities to extend the repayment of the US $ 1 billion credit line received last year and debt under the Asian Clearing Union by five years.",
    "\u201c\u2026 we are trying to settle that money over a five-year period. It\u2019s still at early levels of negotiations,\u201d he added.",
    "However, Dr. Coomaraswamy noted that Sri Lanka is unlikely to receive a such long extension for the US $ 400 million multi-currency swap facility, which has already been extended.",
    "Commenting on the possible inflows from China, which is by far the country\u2019s largest bilateral creditor, he noted that the government mainly expects foreign direct investments from China for the Chinese-funded mega projects such as Colombo Port City.",
    "He stressed the relationship with both India and China would be critical for the economic recovery of Sri Lanka.",
    "With the International Monetary Fund programme in place, Dr. Coomaraswamy was upbeat that foreign investor sentiment would turn positive and it would in turn bring in new FDI and inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange and government\u00a0securities market. (Nishel Fernando)"
