    "Batik Air (formerly known as Malindo Air) announces that all bookings are open for its new reinstated services between Colombo and Kuala Lumpur. Daily flights to Kuala Lumpur are now in operation. They are offering a special all-inclusive Economy Class Return Fare from Colombo to Kuala Lumpur and from Kuala Lumpur to Colombo at LKR 78,500.",
    "They will be mounting some of their new flight services on their brand new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and all their fares are inclusive of 20-kg baggage allowance. Passengers will have the option to pre-purchase and also purchase meals on-board. Malindo Air, a Malaysian-based regional airline, was officially rebranded as Batik Air when the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) granted a new Air Operators Certificate (AOC) to Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd to do business as Batik Air (dba Batik Air) with effect from 28 April 2022. The rebranding exercise is in line with the Lion Group\u2019s goal to establish a common identity for the full service airlines within the group. With the approval in place, it allows Batik Air to conduct improved business for seamless transfers, leveraging Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as a transit hub for the Lion Group of airlines.",
