    "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya ( SJB) yesterday alleged that the Jathika Jana Balawegaya ( JJB) had entered into an agreement with the government to postpone the local government elections by a year.",
    "The allegation was made by SJB MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha during a media briefing.",
    "\"We heard the JJB Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake saying that his party would give a period of one year for the government to hold the local government election. One wonders whether this would mean that JJB has entered into an agreement with the government to postpone the local polls,\" Jayamaha said.",
    "\" It is only SJB that has done its utmost to avoid the postponement of the local polls. JJB held only one protest against the postponement of the election,\" he added.",
    "The SJB expressed fears that the election commission would refrain from announcing the new date of the local polls today. It was assured by the polls chief that he will announce the new date for the local polls today ( March 3), but we fear that it would not be done,\" Jayamaha said.(Yohan Perera)"
