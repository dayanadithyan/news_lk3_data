    "The criminal duo was repatriated to the island from Madagascar this morning (March 15).",
    "The CID dispatched a team, comprising an Assistant Superintendent of Police and an Inspector of Police of the CID and two Special Task Force personnel, to Madagascar earlier this week to repatriate Sri Lankan drug kingpin \u201cHarak Kata\u201d and his infamous accomplice \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d who were arrested while on a visit to the Indian Ocean island off the southeastern coast of Africa.",
    "After being extradited from Madagascar, the criminal duo was brought to India\u2019s Mumbai International Airport via Kenya\u2019s Nairobi and was supposed to be repatriated to Sri Lanka on Tuesday (March 14). The CID team was forced to defer the repatriation by one day due to a flight delay.",
    "Escorted by the CID team and two defence officials from Madagascar, \u201cHarak Kata\u201d and \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) from Mumbai, at around 7.10 a.m. this morning.",
    "After being held at the airport for nearly 30 minutes, the duo was produced before the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) of Colombo, before being escorted under tight security to the CID headquarters in Colombo for onward investigations.",
    "It was reported that the security had been beefed up near the Katunayake airport premises ahead of the arrival of the notorious criminal duo.",
    "On March 08, the defence officials in Madagascar officially informed the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka of the arrest of 08 suspects including \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d, \u201cHarak Kata\u201d, a Malagasy woman who claims to be his wife and her father.",

The INTERPOL had previously issued Red Notices against \u201cHarak Kata\u201d and \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d.",
    "During his stay in Madagascar, \u201cHarak Kata\u201d had posed as a wealthy businessman while \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d and the others pretended to be his bodyguards.",
    "The extradition process was coordinated by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission in Madagascar.",

The Dubai Police had released \u201cHarak Kata\u201d on October 03, 2022, as they were unable to complete the legal matters pertaining to his deportation.",
    "\u201cHarak Kata\u201d had been wanted by Sri Lanka Police for his involvement in five murders, 06 robberies and transnational drug trafficking. He has reportedly smuggled in nearly 670kg of heroin to Sri Lanka via sea routes.",
    "Meanwhile, \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d is accused of orchestrating at least 09 murders and fatally injuring four others.",
    "Against this backdrop, the mother of \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d filed a writ application before the Court of Appeal, raising deep concerns about the potential threats to her son\u2019s life. She has sought interim orders directing the CID to ensure her son\u2019s safety.\u00a0When the writ application was called before the Appeals Court, the Deputy Solicitor General who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General requested the judge bench to dismiss the petition at first instance, without taking it up for hearing."
