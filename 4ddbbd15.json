    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition party the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), which was among the first to call for a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the onset of the island nation\u2019s worst currency crisis in decades, abstained from voting for the now-finalised agreement.",
    "SJB legislator Harsha de Silva speaking in parliament said on the third and final day of a debate on Sri Lanka\u2019s 17th IMF programme that debating the deal was futile as it had already been signed.",
    "SJB MPs, save for A H M Fowzie, staged a walkout before the vote was taken Friday April 28 evening. Fowzie, a former minister who recently returned to parliament, voted in favour of the agreement that saw Sri Lanka gain access to a 2.9 billion dollar extended fund facility over a period of four years.",
    "Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), too, made a surprise decision to abstain from the vote, days after party chairman and former president Maithirpala Sirisena said his party would be voting for the deal. However, the SLFP was represented by MP Duminda Dissanyake, who reportedly cast his vote in favour.",
    "The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) was also absent during the vote.",
    "A number of ruling party party members who now sit in the opposition also voted with the government.",
    "A total of 120 MPs voted in favour of the agreement while only 20 voted against. The National People\u2019s Power (NPP) led by the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) voted against the deal, as did a number of MPs who broke ranks with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).
