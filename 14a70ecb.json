  "original_title": "Sri Lankan Govt Approves $442 Million Wind Power Project of India\u2019s Adani Green Energy; Board of Investment says two wind power Plants to be set up in Mannar and Poonagari in the Northern Province likely to  Create 2000 Jobs and Generate 350 MW of Power",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Crisis-hit Sri Lanka has approved a $442-million wind power project of Adani Green Energy, barely a month since the Indian multinational conglomerate\u2019s stocks plummeted following U.S.-based short-seller Hindenburg\u2019s damaging report on the Group.",
    "\u201cAdani, a leading Indian company\u201d received the project approval \u201cto start two wind power plants in Mannar and Pooneryn areas of [northern] Sri Lanka,\u201d the Board of Investment (BOI) of Sri Lanka said on Wednesday. The project would likely create 2,000 jobs, and in two years, generate about 350 MW of power, the Board said in a statement.",
    "The BOI\u2019s approval effectively takes the Adani Group\u2019s total investments in the island nation over the $1 billion-mark. It has already committed to pumping in $700 million at a strategic port terminal in Colombo, and work on the West Container Terminal began in November 2022.",
    "Sri Lankan authorities are yet to make any public remark on whether the Group\u2019s crashing stocks, following the Hindenburg allegations, would impact its ambitious projects in the investment-starved island nation. While the recent report accused Adani companies of \u201cbrazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades\u201d, the Group has denied any wrongdoing.",
    "When contacted, Sri Lanka\u2019s State Minister of Investment Promotion Dilum Amunugama said the fall in the Adani Group\u2019s stocks \u201cwill not affect a company like them\u201d. \u201cAs far as our government and our Ministry is concerned, we are keen on investments and will ensure they are in order. That is why we approved this project,\u201d he told The Hindu on Thursday.",
    "Earlier, Sri Lanka\u2019s Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera held a \u201cprogress review\u201d meeting with the visiting officials of the Adani Group on the renewable energy projects.",
    "Last year, the Adani Group\u2019s projects triggered controversy in Sri Lanka, with government critics raising questions over transparency and due process in clearing the projects. The Opposition accused the Group of making a \u201cbackdoor entry\u201d into the country\u2019s energy sector, and within months, Sri Lanka amended its energy laws to eliminate competitive bidding in the energy sector.",
    "In a separate development at the time, a former Ceylon Electricity Board chairman resigned after his controversial remarks to a parliamentary panel \u2014 he subsequently withdrew them \u2014 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had \u201cpressured\u201d then Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to clear an Adani Group project in the island nation. Mr. Rajapaksa \u201cvehemently denied\u201d the claim.",
    "Meanwhile, the signing of the renewable energy project comes amid a renewed push by India and Sri Lanka to link their energy grids, an idea that the neighbouring countries first mooted over a decade ago. Currently, Sri Lanka generates power totalling some 4,200 MW a year, and the annual demand for energy is estimated to increase by about 5% over the next two decades.",
    "Authorities have said they aim to add about 2,800 MW renewable energy into the national grid over the next three years."
