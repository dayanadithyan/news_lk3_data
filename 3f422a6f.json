    "The Sri Lanka Veterinary Association (SLVA) yesterday emphasised strict adherence to protocols for imported eggs and commends the Department of Animal Production and Health (DAPH) for its efforts to safeguard the health of citizens, before releasing the imported eggs from India to the local market.",
    "As previously reported, the SLVA expressed concerns over the recent importation of one million table eggs from India by the government. However, after close monitoring of the situation, the SLVA acknowledged the government\u2019s adherence to established procedures and guidelines before releasing any imported eggs to the market, safeguarding both the poultry industry and public health of citizens.",
    "\u201cThe SLVA appreciates the Director General and DAPH for ensuring the quality of the imported eggs and their adherence to the provisions given by Animals Disease Act 59 of 1992 and the protocols of the World Organisation for Animal Health and International Trade. It is crucial that all parties involved in the importation of eggs follow protocols and guidelines to avoid potential public health risks associated with the consumption of imported eggs,\u201d stated SLVA President Dr. Dilan Satharasinghe.",
    "The SLVA stressed on the importance of sample testing to ensure that the imported eggs are free from Avian Influenza and Salmonellosis.\u00a0 \u00a0Hence, the SLVA said the egg samples must be sent to the Veterinary Research Institute and Medical Research Institute for testing, before releasing them to the market. Since egg is an animal-origin product, it is crucial to prevent the spread of foodborne diseases to the public."
