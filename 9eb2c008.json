    "Parliamentarian Patali Champika Ranawaka says he will launch a new political party next month. He claimed the new party\u2019s aim was to rid the country of its current bankrupt state. According to the MP, the new political party will be named the Eksath Janaraja Peramuna - \u2018United Republic Front\u2019 and launched in May.",
    "\u201cPreparations to form the party are currently underway,\u201d he said. Ranawaka said a new political movement based on skill and talent is in fact the need of the hour in the current economic situation to save the country from bankruptcy. Ranawaka made this revelation while addressing the media at an event held in Badulla over the weekend.",
    "Ranawaka, elected to Parliament from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) ticket in 2020 parted ways with the main opposition party in June last year to function as an independent MP in Parliament. He is currently leading the 43 Brigade, a civic movement set up by him in 2021.",
    "\u201cIn May a new political party will be formed because a new political movement based on skill is necessary to save the country from bankruptcy. Politics based on family bandysm must be stopped. We must also stop the form of politics in Sri Lanka where votes can be won by utilising ill-gotten gains. Instead of outdated socialism and capitalism, we need a political ideology that takes the country forward based on a new pragmatism. We will launch that in May and it will be called the United Republic Front,\u201d he said."
