    "Amitabh Bachchan, one of India's most famous actors, recently announced that he sustained an injury on set while filming an action scene for his upcoming movie \"Project K\" in the southern city of Hyderabad. He stated that he tore a muscle and cartilage in his ribs, which has caused painful movement and breathing.",
    "The veteran actor is currently resting at home in Mumbai and will take several weeks to recover fully. As a result, Bachchan announced that he will be unable to meet his fans, who gather outside his home in Mumbai's Juhu suburb every week. He regularly meets with his well-wishers, but this week he has requested that they not come and to pass on the message to others who may be intending to visit.",
    "Bachchan has acted in approximately 200 movies during his career spanning over five decades and is idolized by millions across the globe. He previously suffered a life-threatening injury on set in 1982, and many of his fans went on a hunger strike to pray for his recovery. One fan even walked 482 kilometers (300 miles) backwards to show his support for Bachchan.",
