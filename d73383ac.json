    "COLOMBO (News 1st); MP Ali Sabri Raheem who was detained by Sri Lanka Customs for illegally carrying gold and mobile phones was released, and he visited parliament.",
    "The MP who previously extended his support to the government, voted against the resolution moved by the government.",
    "Speaking EXCLUSIVELY to News 1st that MP said that he saw nothing wrong with Janaka Ratnayake, the Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, but he voted against the resolution as the government did not step into clear him with regard to his detention by Sri Lanka Customs.",
    "\"I faced an incident recently. I did nothing wrong. The goods were in the possession of an associate. He was detained, but they told the media that it was me. I told President's Secretary Saman Ekanayake, and the Prime Minister. They said they will look into it, but justice was not served. I did nothing wrong, but I came out after paying a fine of Rs. 7.5 Million. Therefore, I voted against the government,\" he explained.",
    "\"The President's Secretary. I spoke to him and explained that I did not carry the goods, and it was one of my associates. He packed the bag, and he put the goods in both our bags. He committed the offense and I was at fault. If such injustice takes place when I am with the government, and if they don't help me, there is no point in being with the government. That is why I voted against the government,\" he further told News 1st's parliament correspondent.",
