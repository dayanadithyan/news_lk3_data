  "original_body_lines": [
    "British Deputy Prime Minister and justice minister Dominic Raab resigned on Friday, following an independent investigation into formal complaints of bullying.",
    "In a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak published on Twitter, Raab said the inquiry had set a dangerous precedent, but that he would remain supportive of the government.",
    "\u201cI called for the inquiry and undertook to resign, if it made any finding of bullying whatsoever. I believe it is important to keep my word,\u201d Raab said.",
    "However, he added: \u201cIn setting the threshold for bullying so low, this inquiry has set a dangerous precedent. It will encourage spurious complaints against Ministers, and have a chilling effect on those driving change on behalf of your government - and ultimately the British people.\u201d",
    "Raab\u2019s resignation means a third senior minister has departed over their personal conduct since Sunak entered Downing Street in October promising a government of integrity."
