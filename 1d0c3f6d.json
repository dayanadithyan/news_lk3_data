    "Some 25,000 military and 1,000 police personnel have vacated their posts within the past two years, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said today.",
    "Speaking during the adjournment debate on the IMF report, he told Parliament that about 1,000 police personnel have vacated the posts within the last year while some 200 policemen have left the posts during the first two months of this year.",
    "He said they left because of the orders given to them to carry out wrong acts.",
    "\"We never experienced so many soldiers vacating posts even during the time of the war. We request them not to use the clubs which were given to them. If any soldier or policeman was removed for not using the clubs given to them to be used against protesters, be bold enough to go home. We will reinstate you with arrears once we come to power,\" he assured.",
    "The MP said the government is engaged in cowardice acts to suppress protesters and university students and said legal action would be taken against the officials involved in suppressing protesters. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
