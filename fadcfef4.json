    "The best form of commemorating the introduction of Dhamma and the compassionate beneficent, Arhat Mihindu thera, would be to resolve to re-establish inter-ethnic, the inter-religious harmony that we have been yearning to achieve over the decades",
    "King Devanampiya Tissa was on a hunting expedition on Mihintale, the mountainous area. Chasing wild animals on Poson full moon day; his famous form of delight, and seeing a deer cruising, he was approaching the grazing animal when he overheard someone calling him by his name, \u201cTissa, Tissa\u201d",
    "Testing the IQ of the King, following a series of questions, Arhat Mihindu finally asked, \u201c\u2026 and are there, besides other mango trees and those trees which are not mango trees, yet other trees?\u201d",
    "This interesting dialogue between the king and the Arhant Thera is recorded in the Mahavamsa and many other chronicles.\u00a0 Contemporary scholars believe that this series of questions is similar to a modern IQ test.\u00a0 If so, this could be the first or one of the earliest recorded IQ tests in known history.",
    "The observance of pure and pristine Dhamma is fast fading away, or being overshadowed by the performance of new socio-cultural myths and pooja systems introduced by defying monks. Offering hundreds of thousands of various flowers and conducting processions with elephants, erecting pandals, and illuminating vast areas wasting precious electricity is not true Buddhism that Arhant Mahinda thera introduced in 236 BCE. We need more learned Theras to preach pure Dhamma discourses the way Arahant Mihindu Thera did.",
    "\u201cMihintale \u2026the perfect sanctuary for the sons of Gautama Buddha that they could find all through the length and breadth of Ceylon.\u201d \u2013 said, H C P Bell, the first Archaeological Commissioner of Ceylon from 1890 to 1912. The sanctuary then had no electricity, and no \u2018elephantine\u2019 peraheras either. Only the Dhamma in its pure form enlightened minds.",
    "On this Poson Day, in the absence of artificial bulbs flashing in all corners, the sanctuary will brighten up with the radiant Poson Full Moon. The Chief Incumbent of this historic Rajamaha Vihara Dr. Walawahengunuwewe Dhammarathana Thera, the outspoken, strictly no-politics, bhikkhu was agitated that the cash-strapped treasury in this bankrupt nation parted with \u201cjust 3.1 million\u201d for commemorating the arrival of Arhat Mihindu thera. However, the few hundred thousand rupees the great monk collected on his pindapatha voyage is sufficient to educate the pilgrims on the finer details of pristine Dhamma on this Poson day.",
    "My first visit to the sacred place was in 1952. I reminisce the tranquil grove that calmed the mind and comforted the soul of an eight-year-old, when we \u2018camped\u2019 on small flat meadows of the hilly site along with thousands of pilgrims. Spending a peaceful night under the shade of trees listening to soothing music created by the breeze was a novel experience. A lively sylvan glow was radiated by the Poson moon, as it arose calmly bathing and illuminating the entire vicinity of architectural exploits, mainly visible in Kanthaka chetiya, Alms Hall, Ancient Stairway of 1840 steps, Kalu Diya pokuna, and the Hospital. By midnight, the Poson moon\u2019s reflected rays made the glorious gardens a miraculous dwelling.\u00a0 While I relished the stunning views of rock where Buddhism blossomed 23 centuries ago and the beautiful scenic setting of well-lit Anuradhapura town far away and below, \u2018the call, \u201cTissa\u2026, Tissa\u201d\u2014 that surprised the King as to who in the kingdom dared to call him by his first name, and Arhat Mihindu thera\u2019s response, \u201cSamanamayan Mahaa Raaja \u2026 ,\u201d carried by the swift breeze through the thickets echoed in my ear drums. A ray of light radiated from the pinnacle of the mountain, as I felt a very strong sense of their presence on Missaka Pabbatha rock.",
    "The consecrated surroundings laid up for the leisure of thousands of pilgrims, sans flashing artificial electric beams on that Poson night seven decades ago reminds me of the illustrious arahants, Elders Moggallana, Revatha, and Anuruddha moving into the moon-kissed Gosingha Saala gardens where Arhant Sariputta and Arhant Kassapa were engaged in a Dhamma dialogue on one splendid evening, as retold in Maha Kassapa biography.",
    "As per recent surveys, Anuradhapura, one of the worst affected districts, the number of children under the age of five years suffering from severe malnutrition is increasing at an alarming rate. Thousands of families are undergoing untold misery due to adult breadwinners suffering from chronic kidney disease.\u00a0 The majority of poor families are unable to afford a single balanced meal a day: and are not aware that their children are suffering from malnutrition. The government is wasting poor tax payer\u2019s money on numerous unnecessary extravaganzas; even the 3.1 million given for Mihintale could have gone to fund a programme to alleviate poverty in the district.",
    "At the time of Mihindu-Devanammpiyatissa, Buddhist monks never did party politics like today. Even though various preachers recite day and night over numerous TV and FM channels, neither any encouraging improvement nor change can be seen in our society today. Great teachings of the Buddha have been adorned and interpreted into their own personal dogmas.",
    "Most of our politicians never understand the hardships of people are going through, for they never experienced the hunger or suffering of these unfortunate citizens experience. They think only about how to defraud and misappropriate public funds. A good majority of them are intoxicated with power. Instead of holding commemorative functions to celebrate the arrival of Buddhism, the upright Nayake thera should preach pure dhamma to hundreds of thousands who visit Anuradhapura and Mihintale for Poson to make them understand the benefit of wholesome karma and the repercussions of unwholesome karma. Arhat Mihindu thera arrived at a time they worship gods of nature, tree spirits, supernatural beings and, a cult of astrology. With the introduction of Dhamma, Monasteries became hubs of national cultures and monks became teachers of people and counselors to kings. King and people looked after the monks\u2019 welfare and monks used their influence over the masses to support the kings; there was a mutual understanding that was never explicitly stated.",
    "Mahinda Maha Thera genuinely supported the establishment and safeguarding of the Buddha\u2019s word in Sri Lanka. King Devanampiyatissa converted and was a very pious and devoted leader who governed our country without hatred and prejudice. In the present, most of the values have been dramatically lost because people embraced and obsessively follow \u201cParty Politics\u201d and also \u201ccults\u201d formed by monks, which dangerously and appallingly changed the atmosphere in our society.\u00a0 Values of human life are dishonored. Resentment and animosity are lively and visible. The Dhamma or Dharmarajjyaya has dangerously become a state of injustice. Corruption and injustice are the driving forces in our society. However, still it is not too late to re-establish the Dharmadveepa, a way to lead our society\u2014be united as a multicultural, multilingual nation, harmonious and prosperous.",
    "The best form of commemorating the introduction of Dhamma and the compassionate beneficent, Arhat Mihindu thera, would be to resolve to re-establish inter-ethnic, the inter-religious harmony that we have been yearning to achieve over the decades. Work towards temperance and an anti-tobacco nation that is free of crime and corruption."
