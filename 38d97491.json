    "Sri Lanka\u2019s leading apparel manufacturer, Brandix Apparel Limited, refurbished and handed over the blood bank at the District General Hospital in Negombo. The programme was part of the Group\u2019s ongoing efforts to boost healthcare services around the island, and was managed by Brandix Essentials, Katunayake.",
    "Director of the National Blood Transfusion Service, Dr. Lakshman Edirisinghe, welcomed this initiative by the company and described it as a timely and much-needed intervention for people in the Gampaha district. Brandix is also the single largest corporate donor of blood to the National Blood Transfusion Service of Sri Lanka at present.",
    "\u201cThis is a valuable service to the nation from Brandix. The District General Hospital in Negombo is a crucial facility as it serves people from the Gampaha district, which is a centre for economic activity in the country. We had identified this location within the hospital to establish a new blood bank but struggled due to limited resources within the state sector. Brandix came forward and helped set up this facility which is vital to save lives, and this contribution will strengthen healthcare services in this region immensely,\u201d Dr. Edirisinghe said.",
    "Previously, blood transfusion, storage and donation activities within the District Hospital were scattered across the facility presenting numerous difficulties. Brandix\u2019s intervention ensures all functions of the Blood Bank are now under one roof with all necessary modern facilities, affording greater convenience and ease to donors, patients and staff at the hospital.",
    "Lalith Bandara, CEO of Brandix Essentials, stated: \u201cThe development of the Blood Bank at the Negombo District Hospital comes as part of our commitment to empower communities and enhance healthcare services for all Sri Lankans. Brandix is vested in the Gampaha district, and we will continue to serve the people of the area and transform lives by building a thriving and healthy community.\u201d",
    "Understanding the importance of a sustained and consistent supply of blood to the National Blood Transfusion Service, Brandix has conducted blood donation drives for over 15 years. Today, this solely employee-driven initiative spans the Brandix network across Sri Lanka, in 23 locations engaging more than 35,000 employees who donate blood with the vision of supporting the life of another.",
