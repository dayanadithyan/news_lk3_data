    "Former President Maithripala Sirisena said the six months given to him to pay the fine of Rs. 100 million over the Easter Sunday attack ruling was running out and appealed to his friends and well-wishers to give him whatever amount possible to pay the fine.",
    "Speaking at a gathering in Baddegama, he said the Supreme Court imposed a fine of Rs. 100 million in connection with the Easter Sunday attacks and that three months had already gone and only three more months left to pay the fine.",
    "He said he had neither looted nor bombed but he had to pay the fine just because some officials in his Government had overlooked their responsibilities.",
    "\u201cThe Supreme Court ruling clearly says that no one had informed me of the intelligence information over the Easter Sunday attacks,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI was ordered to pay Rs. 100 million, I neither looted nor bombed. Nowadays, I am collecting the money from my friends and well-wishers. If possible, give me whatever amount you can as three months have already passed from the 6 months\u2019 time given to me to pay the fine\u201d he added.",
    "Former President said he was unaware what would happen, if he failed to pay the fine on time as he was not a legal expert.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I will be imprisoned or whether I have to be subject to any other court decision if I fail to pay the fine,\u201d he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
