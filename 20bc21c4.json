    "England cricketer Sam Billings has revealed he underwent two operations to remove a malignant melanoma on his chest as he warned his fellow players about the risks of skin cancer.",
    "Wicketkeeper Billings, 31, said his England team-mates were left shocked by his \u2018gory and bloody\u2019 six-inch scar and stitches when he removed his shirt in the changing rooms during last year\u2019s white-ball tour of Australia.",
    "He admits he was fortunate to have the skin cancer diagnosed during a routine screening at his county, Kent, before it developed into anything worse.",
    "Billings recovered to play a full winter of cricket but is urging players at all levels of the game to make sure they apply suncream when they take the field.",
    "On that moment in the England dressing room, he told the Daily Telegraph: \u2018I had completely forgotten it was there! But I still had my stitches in and it was pretty gory, still bloody and healing. I think the boys were pretty shocked.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve been that classic Brit abroad. As a 22-year-old with fairer hair in Australia thinking it was worth going a bit red to end up brown.",
    "\u2018And at home you see it all the time, it gets to 12 degrees and sunny, all the tops come off. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be the guy who got skin damage. I hope people see my story and think twice.\u2019",
    "Billings almost skipped the skin cancer screening at Kent because there was a queue and he was running late for a meeting. It was only the intervention of the club\u2019s head physio Dan George that persuaded the captain to hang around.",
    "It revealed a mole on his upper chest that needed to be removed. Billings was told he had a melanoma that was 0.6mm deep, with the threshold of 0.7mm being when things can really get serious, and was immediately refereed for an operation.",
    "\u2018I could see inside my own chest, which wasn\u2019t very nice,\u2019 he said. \u2018At one point the anaesthetic didn\u2019t work well so I was in huge pain.",
    "\u2018I never realised how much your chest affects everything else. Just moving my arm was extremely painful. Mentally it was definitely more challenging than physically.\u2019",
    "In partnership with the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association and Lifejacket Skin Protection, Billings has warned club cricketers not to get sunburnt when they play.",
    "\u2018We treat it [applying suncream] like a bit of a chore because the education around it isn\u2019t as good as in countries like Australia,\u2019 he added.",
    "Billings isn\u2019t the first top-level sportsman to reveal they have suffered from skin cancer.",
    "The Germany and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer revealed last year he required three operations to remove a tumour from his face.",
    "Tennis star Angelique Kerber has also suffered from the sun-induced skin condition hyperpigmentation.",
    "The lifelong condition, which can be easily treated, is caused by exposure to the sun and leads to spots or patches that look brown, black, grey, red or pink on the skin. (Daily Mail)"
