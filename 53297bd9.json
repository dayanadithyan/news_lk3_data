  "original_body_lines": [
    "Education Minister Susil Premajayantha, the Leader of the House, has proposed that the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) should conduct a special investigation into the importation of organic fertilizer from China and Nano Nitrogen from India.",
    "It is estimated that Sri Lanka has suffered losses of over Rs. 8 billion as a result of this alleged scam.",
    "The proposal was made in response to queries raised by the opposition regarding the lack of a probe into the matter. Opposition Leader Mr. Premadasa emphasized that the blame for this situation lies solely with Sri Lankan individuals involved in the importation, rather than China and India. Sri Lanka has reportedly lost Rs 2.5 billion from the importation, with payment made for the consignment, but the country has not received an adequate supply of organic fertilizer.",
    "Concerns were raised about the absence of audit reports on these questionable transactions.",
    "Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapaksa acknowledged that a thorough investigation and the subsequent identification of responsible parties cannot be accomplished overnight.",
    "The government\u2019s proposal to assign COPE the task of conducting a special investigation indicates its commitment to addressing the issue and holding those responsible accountable.",
    "By engaging COPE, an independent body tasked with examining the operations and financial management of state-owned enterprises, the government aims to ensure a transparent and\u00a0unbiased inquiry into the alleged importation scam. (YOHAN PERERA)"
