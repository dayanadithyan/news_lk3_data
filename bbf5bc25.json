    "Sri Lanka\u2019s new tax regime has both its defenders and detractors. Critics who are opposed to progressive taxation said it serves as a disincentive to industry and capital which can be invested in business. They argue that a flat rate of taxation is implemented where everyone is taxed at the same rate.",
    "Others, however, contend that the new taxes only affect some 10-12 percent of the population and, given the country\u2019s economic situation, is necessary, if not vital.",
    "Critics of the protesting workers argue that most of the workers earn high salaries that most ordinary people can only dream of, and though there may be some cases where breadwinners could be taxed more equitably, overall, Sri Lanka\u2019s tax rates remain low and are not unfair.
