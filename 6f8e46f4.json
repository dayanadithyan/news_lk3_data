    "Says despite claims, AKD has failed to catch a single thief to date",
    "Accuses AKD and Premadasa of repeating lies about past corruption and tricking the public to obtain their vote",
    "Claims SLPP has worked for the people and they will vote for the party in a future election",
    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena has accused Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and National People\u2019s Party (NPP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake of attempting to trick the public in order to clinch power.",
    "Abeygunawardena told the media that Premadasa and Dissanayake are both claiming they will take action against thieves and funds have been stolen at every rally they have been attending recently. The SLPP politician said the Good Governance Government claimed the same and ruled for five years thereafter.\u00a0 \u201cDissanayake led the committee appointed to catch these alleged thieves. But show us one thief he has caught since then,\u201d he said, adding that the duo are repeating the same lies in a bid to gain votes and come into power by tricking the people.",
    "Abeygunawardena invited the rival political duo to present their plans for the country instead of merely claiming they will provide relief. \u201cTell us what your plan is and how one can live without working?\u201d he asked, while taking a dig at the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the main party of the NPP.",
    "\u201cWe know their history. Do not attempt to trick the people by playing the same records,\u201d the SLPP Leader said. He claimed the SLPP has worked for the people, especially the villages and therefore has no qualms about facing a vote. He expressed his confidence in an SLPP win if the elections are held on 9 March as expected.",
    "AKD swears to defeat President Wickremesinghe democratically and peacefully prior to polls"
