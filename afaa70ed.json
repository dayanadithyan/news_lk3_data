    "It is said that complaints have been received of private and Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses, government vehicles and police vehicles that emit excessive smoke.",
    "The DMT Director General told the media that during the last week of every month, the private buses at Bastian Mawatha, Pettah are subject to inspection for emissions. From the inspection conducted last month, more than 40% of the buses failed smoke test.",
    "The failed vehicles must be directed to the Werahera head office within 14 days to carry out the relevant inspections and rectify faults. If not, the revenue licences of such vehicles will be forfeited.",
    "While addressing the media, the project director of the DMR Emissions Division officially announced the special WhatsApp number.",
    "He said the number of vehicles emitting smoke have increased following observations made in the last few years.",
    "\"The initial notice will be issued by the Werahera office for the emission test-failing vehicles for not calling over at the office. Then the second reminder will be issued if they did not honour the reminder, action will be taken to block the revenue licences in a manner that they cannot get them through the normal channel,\" the project director said.
