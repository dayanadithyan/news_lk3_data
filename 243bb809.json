    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s parliament has voted to remove the chairman of the Public Utilities Commission Chairman Janaka Ratnayake, Speaker Mahinda Abeywardena said.",
    "Out of 225 members 123 voted to remove him while 77 voted against.",
    "This is the first time a head of an independent government commission was sacked by the parliament.",
    "Wijesekara told parliament during a debate proceeding a vote to remove Ratnayake as chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) that the official had acted obstinately without the concurrence of fellow commission members.",
    "Five charges were levelled against the PUCSL chief by the minister, the first two which were based on a February 10 verdict by the Court of Appeal rejecting an application filed by Ratnayake against an electricity tariff hike.",
    "\u201cMy gut feeling is that I will be removed as a Chairman tomorrow,\u201d Ratnayake told reporters a day earlier.",
    "\u201cIf I can change the country, I will definitely join politics, because my intention is to serve the people and what is right.\u201d",
    "Opposition legislators slammed the decision saying it undermined independent commissions.",
    "Ratnayake had blocked delayed a tariff hike in early 2023, resulting in losses to the Ceylon Electricity Board, he claimed. The PUCSL also had not enabled tariff hikes for nine years, requiring its governing law to be changed, Wijesekera said.",
    "\u201cWe understand that Janaka Ratnayake and his family have not been able to come to the gallery at parliament and that is to be deplored,\u201d Wickremeratne told parliament. \u201cEven if a person is convicted in a court of law, the person can be present there.\u201d",
    "Wickremeratne said Sri Lanka\u2019s parliament had a bizarre record over independent commissions, undermining good governance.",
    "\u201cThe Sri Lankan parliament has a bizarre record on some of these issues,\u201d Wickremeratne said. \u201cWe have members in these chambers who voted for independent commissions in the 17th amendment. Then the same people in the 18th amendment voted to abolish the independent commissions.",
    "\u201cOnce again we bring a 19th amendment and we bring in independent commissions. Then in the 20th amendment, we bring another amendment in an authoritarian system putting all the power in one individual.",
    "\u201cAnd then we bring a 21st amendment reintroducing the independent commissions. This is he record of the Sri Lankan parliament and dome of the MPs who have been voting on this. \u201d",
    "\u201cToday, we plan to undermine an independent commission by removing a chairman of an independent commission.\u201d",
    "Such practices, where democracy (majoritarianism) undermines liberties and freedoms of citizens is called constitutional authoritarianism, political analysts say.",
    "Sri Lanka inherited a law making parliament from British rule as a transplanted political system without a history or tradition in liberal thinking. (Colombo/May24/2023)"
