    "Eva, the leading sanitary napkin brand of Sri Lanka since 1987, has launched a sanitary napkin donation drive aimed at supporting 100,000 economically challenged schoolgirls across Sri Lanka. The initiative, which started on Women\u2019s Day, is part of Eva\u2019s commitment to end period poverty among schoolgirls and ensure that no girl misses school due to lack of access to menstrual hygiene products.",
    "The first donation of Eva\u2019s Sanitary pads was made to three deserving schools in Colombo. The sanitary napkin donation drive will continue throughout the months of March and April and will cover schools in rural areas where girls need support, to continue their education without hindrance and missing school days. Every time a young schoolgirl misses school due to their menstrual cycle, they take one step behind in achieving their dreams. Eva has pledged to put an end to this by supporting them, by providing EVA Sanitary Pad packs to school children, those from areas and communities which are economically challenged and looking for less cost options. Eva sanitary napkins, ensuring that their menstruation does not hinder their education.",
    "Shanthi Bhagirathan, Group Director of the Capital Maharaja Group, said, \u201cEvery girl should have access to quality menstrual hygiene products and should not have to miss school due to their menstruation. Eva is committed to ensure that no girl is left behind, and donation drives such as this are only the beginning of a long road ahead. We will remain committed to our cause and pledge to do everything we can to end period poverty in Sri Lanka. And our efforts towards the young school going girls encouraged to have equal opportunity for education and to realise their dreams.\u201d",
