    "Commenting on the launch, Indika Rajapaksha \u2013 Chief Operating Officer at Colorup said, \u201cIt\u2019s a great achievement for us to be able to bring this revolutionary new roofing product to the market. The unique \u2018S\u2019 shape of our Roofing tiles provides numerous benefits and addresses many challenges that consumers and builders face when tiling roofs. They are also lightweight, compared to alternative roofing tiles in the market, while also being very strong, and able to withstand any weather condition. We look forward to continuing to innovate and provide consumers and Sri Lanka\u2019s construction industry with world-class products fit for modern architecture.\u201d",
    "Colorup roof tiles also feature a solar-resistant layer, making them last longer, while also being waterproof and non-absorbent, ensuring no excess weight is retained on the roof in wet weather. The tiles also come with a 5-year guarantee on the color coating, and their unique \u201cS\u201d shape allows for efficient interlocking, ensuring no movement due to animal activity and strong winds, while also preventing leaks.",
    "Fire resistant too, Colorup roof tiles provide the lowest weight, and highest strength and safety, at the best value. In addition to each tile weighing less, it reduces rafter requirements, further helping to minimize costs on the roof structure. Packaged in easy to handle 5-tiles packs, Colorup roofing tiles are also easy to transport and store with minimal risk of damage.",
