    "Tourist arrivals to the island nation continue to slow down with the number of weekly international travellers entering Sri Lanka dropping further. According to provisional data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), the second week of May welcomed a total of 17,699 visitors, which are the lowest weekly arrivals recorded so far for this year.",
    "A brief analysis of tourist arrivals of previous years (pre-Covid and Easter Sunday attack) showed that May typically records the lowest influx of international visitors in a calendar year. In the first week of May, Sri Lanka welcomed 18, 401 visitors, which was a significant drop when compared with the 31,719 arrivals recorded in the fourth week of April.",
