    "If required liquidity up to 500 billion will be injected overnight at 5.25 percent.",
    "Under Powell the concept of \u2018excess reserves\u2019 was removed and excess liquidity is now called \u2018reserve balances\u2019. The Fed will pay banks 5.15 percent for reserve balance.",
    "After more than a decade of excess liquidity and sharply lower interest rates during the Covid pandemic which had fired the current inflation bout, US banks were hit by mark to market losses from bonds bought during pandemic rate lows.",
    "\u201cConditions in that sector have broadly improved since early March, and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient,\u201d Powell said.",

    "The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5 to 5-1/4 percent. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.",

The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee\u2019s goals. The Committee\u2019s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.",
