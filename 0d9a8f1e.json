    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress member and former Chairman of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Prof. G.L. Peiris on Friday filed legal action before the Colombo District Court against the SLPP AGM held on 22 April this year.",
    "Peiris has requested the court to declare the meeting of the SLPP AGM or \u2018Maha Sabhawa\u2019 as unlawful and the decisions made at the meeting are without any legal effect. The MP has named SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam, SLLP National Organiser Basil Rajapaksa and several others as respondents.",
    "On 11 April, Kariyawasam informed Peiris in writing that the SLPP\u2019s Annual General Meeting for 2023 will take place at No. 1316, Nelum Mawatha, Battaramulla, starting from 10:00 a.m. on 22 April.",
    "After receiving the communique Peiris said he warned General Secretary of the SLPP Sagara Kariyawasam in writing that he would initiate legal action if it does in fact go ahead. \u201cHowever, they held the meeting on the day,\u201d Peiris noted.",
    "According to him, several key decisions were made during the meeting and a new group of office bearers were also appointed. \u201cMost importantly even the accounts of the party were approved at this so-called Maha Sabhawa,\u201d he said.",
    "In September 2022, the SLPP Chairman along with 13 other Government MPs decided to sit with the Opposition in Parliament as an independent group. The relationship between Peiris and the SLPP has been acrimonious since.",
    "In March the party announced that the Executive Committee of the SLPP had decided to remove Prof. G.L. Peiris from his post as the Chairman of the party. Accordingly, at the AGM the SLPP appointed Prof. Uthurawala Dhammarathana Thera as party chairman, replacing Peiris. However, Peiris has also sworn to challenge the Thera\u2019s appointment as well on the basis that the \u2018Maha Sabhawa\u2019 of the party has not been duly constituted."
