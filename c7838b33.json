    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court has determined that a private member\u2019s bill seeking the decriminalisation of homosexuality is not inconsistent with the constitution, Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said.",
    "\u201cThe Supreme Court is of the opinion that the bill as a whole or as any provision thereof is not inconsistent with the constitution,\u201d the Speaker announced Tuesday May 09 morning.",
    "The apex court\u2019s determination was issued following a petition filed challenging the bill.",
    "LGBTQ+ rights activists in Sri Lanka have for years been calling for amendments to Sections 365 and 365A of the country\u2019s Penal Code that prohibit \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature\u201d and \u201cgross indecency between persons\u201d. Rights groups including Human Rights Watch have said this legislation has been \u201ccommonly understood in Sri Lanka to criminalise same-sex relations between consenting adults, including in private spaces.\u201d",
    "Human Rights Watch has documented that other laws, including a vaguely worded Vagrancy Law and a penal code provision banning \u201ccheating by personation,\u201d are also used to target transgender and gender non-conforming people for arrest.",
    "\u201cPolice have carried out many such arrests with violence. Among the 61 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people interviewed for a 2016 Human Rights Watch report, 16 had experienced physical or sexual assault, including rape, by the police,\u201d an HRW report published in October 2020 said.
