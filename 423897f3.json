    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL)\u00a0 has raised serious concern over a remark by Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe BASL President Saliya Peiris calling the latter a political lawyer.",
    "\u201cThe fact that a senior member of the legal profession in Sri Lanka has been subject to personal attacks for representing clients, more so being called a \u2018political lawyer\u2019 by the Head of State under the cover of the protection of immunity and privilege is a matter of serious concern,\u201d the BASL said in a statement on Tuesday February 28, urging the president and MPs to exercise self-restraint.",
    "President Wickremesinghe in a speech made in parliament on February 23 about the now-postponed local government elections criticised the national election commission, an independent body for having President\u2019s Counsel Saliya Peiris represent it in a Supreme Court hearing on the conduct of the polls.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019re obtaining the services of a lawyer, get someone who is not affiliated with any political party,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "Peiris, he claimed, is a lawyer who has maintained that his government has no mandate nor authority.",
    "\u201cIt would\u2019ve been better to get a lawyer from the SJB or the JVP,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka president claims local polls not delayed, points to lack of consensusSee more",
    "Expressing grave concern on the president\u2019s remark, the BASL said it is a basic right of any individual or corporate body to retain an attorney-at-law of their choice to represent their interests in legal proceedings and the members of the Bar have a duty to assist their clients before courts and other tribunals.",
    "\u201cThis is a right of any person before the law, a professional duty of attorneys-at-law and a vital function to preserving the Rule of Law and the proper functioning of the legal system,\u201d it said.",
    "Quoting Article 16 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers adopted by the United Nations, the BASL said: \u201cGovernments shall ensure that lawyers (a) are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference; \u2026\u201d",
    "It is a cause for concern that thepPresident should comment on ongoing proceedings before the Supreme Court just a few hours before the case was to be taken up, the BASL said",
    "\u201cThe BASL calls upon the President and Members of Parliament to \u2018exercise self-restraint\u2019 and to desist from making statements which will erode the confidence of the public in the legal system and undermine the independence of the judiciary both of which would ultimately lead to a serious erosion of the Rule of Law.\u201d (Colombo/Feb28/2023)"
