    "While condemning Parliamentarian Ali Sabri Rahim using his parliamentary privileges, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said privileges given to members of parliament to arrive without inspection from the VIP terminals of the airport should be removed.",
    "Addressing a meeting in Hambantota recently, he said that amounts to theft and fraud. If a proposal is brought to abolish Ali Sabri Rahim's position as a Member of Parliament, I will support it, he said.",
    "\"In my opinion, parliamentary privileges like this should be removed. Parliamentarians can also come through a normal passenger terminal and be checked like normal passengers. It doesn't matter if the privileges given by VIP terminals for foreign state visitors for positions like president and prime minister are applied. However, MPs do not need such privileges,\" Minister Amaraweera said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
