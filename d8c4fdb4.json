The hotel industry has contributed significant amounts of revenue as tourism outcomes have become favorable. The crisis-hit island nation is looking at several avenues to generate dollars.",

    "Sri Lanka has tried to run the country by denying monetary stability through a combination of flexible inflation targeting and output gap targeting (printing money to boost growth) for several years, running into a series of currency crises and depreciating the currency, running up foreign debt as long as ratings were favorable.
