    "Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) are targeting the months of July and August to conduct the fourth season of the Lanka Premier League (LPL), with the intent of that period becoming the permanent window for the tournament moving forward.",
    "The first three editions of the franchise-based tournament were repeatedly postponed from their originally scheduled dates and conducted towards the end of the year in each of the seasons.",
    "The tournament will not see a previously expected expansion however, LPL Tournament Director Samantha Dodanwela said speaking exclusively to the Daily Mirror.",
    "\u201cHaving a sixth team will mean the number of days in the tournament will need to be increased, and logistically it will be tough to plan out given the current calendar. We are planning to have the LPL soon after the Pakistan tour, but given that the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) is also starting towards the end of August, we are a little restricted for this window,\u201d Dodanwela said.",
    "A sixth franchise still remains within the long-term plans of the league, Dodanwela reiterated.",
    "In the lead up to the Cricket World Cup in October-November this year, Sri Lanka are also scheduled to host Ireland for a Test and two ODIs in April, although that is yet to be confirmed.",
    "The Asia Cup is also slated to be held in August, with SLC hoping to win the hosting rights for the tournament."
