  "original_body_lines": [
    "With the 100 mm heavy rains in the Western and Southern Provinces, there is a considerable increase in the water levels of the Kalu Ganga, Kelani Ganga, Gin Ganga and Nilwala Ganga, but there are no alerts for floods, Irrigation (Hydrology) Director S.P.C. Sugeeshwara said.",
    "But the water levels in the downstream areas of these rivers are currently increasing.",
    "However, sufficient rain has fallen in the catchment areas of these rivers. If more rain falls today and tomorrow, exceeding 100mm in the catchment areas, there is a possibility of flood situations.",
    "Therefore, the people using rivers should be vigilant for possible floods from the rain received today. Those who live in and use the downstream areas are requested to be vigilant when using streams connected to main rivers. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
