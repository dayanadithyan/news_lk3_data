    "Major investments in replanting of rubber and tea to continue in 2023",
    "Agalawatte Plantations PLC (APL) has reported impressive revenue and profit growth in the first quarter of 2023, consolidating on the remarkable turnaround achieved subsequent to the acquisition of a majority stake in the company by the Damro Group.",
    "Revenue grew by 49.7% to Rs. 1.489 billion for the three months ending 31 March, with revenue from tea doubling to Rs. 796.2 million over the first quarter of 2022, and revenue from oil palm up 57.5% to Rs. 305.1 million. Rubber contributed Rs. 216.9 million to the company\u2019s top line in the quarter reviewed.",
    "Stable tea prices and an increased oil palm crop enabled APL to post pre-tax profit of Rs. 417.2 million for the three months, reflecting growth of 44.6%. Total assets grew by 21.2% since end 2022 to Rs. 6.448 billion as at 31 March, and the company\u2019s net assets value per share improved by 23.5% to Rs. 26.09.",
    "Agalawatte Plantations Managing Director/CEO Nalaka Gunathilake described the growth achieved in the first quarter of 2023 as extremely encouraging in the context of the company\u2019s achievement of net profit of Rs. 1.76 billion for the year ended 31 December 2022, the highest profit in its history.",
    "Once debt-ridden and at risk of liquidation, Agalawatte Plantations became part of the Damro Group in 2017 when the latter acquired the majority stake in the company and infused Rs. 3.2 billion for the payment of unsettled dues and statutory obligations. Timely investments in replanting, factory modernisation, redefining strategic focus and leadership transformed the company into the strong corporate it is today, Gunathilake said. Good management practices together with agricultural inputs and professional human resources management policies too played pivotal role in this turnaround.",
    "APL produces around 2 million kilograms of latex annually and the company has facilities to manufacture Latex Crepe, Ribbed Smoked Sheets (RSS) and Centrifuged latex depending on the demand in the market. The company\u2019s tea production is around 2 million kilograms per year and this volume is expected to increase with the availability of chemical fertiliser and agrochemicals in the country. APL also produces more than 11 million kilograms of oil palm crop annually, generating substantial returns for the company.",
    "With the company\u2019s acquisition by Damro Group a strategic management decision was taken to prioritise replanting across all estates under APL management. An extent of over 2,600 acres of aged and uneconomical rubber land has since been replanted with high yielding clones to ensure company\u2019s productivity and sustainability in the years ahead.",
    "The company disclosed that a further extent of over 1,000 acres is to be replanted in 2023 and land preparation and preliminary work in these areas has already commenced. In order to support the company\u2019s ambitious rubber replanting programme, Agalawatte Plantations has its own network of rubber nurseries and has established 400,000 seedlings in six regional nurseries to supply healthy and vigorous plants.",
    "Between 2017-2022, an extent of over 263 acres of tea has also been replanted and the preliminary work on another 150 acres has been commenced in 2023. Five tea nurseries with 900,000 plants will supply the requirement of high yielding vigorous tea plants for the replanting programme.",
    "APL said it is gearing up for a new phase of growth in the tea plantations by obtaining system and quality management certifications. The company has obtained the Rain Forest Alliance (RA) certification for its upcountry tea estates while all tea manufacturing facilities have obtained the ISO 22000 Food Safety Management System certification."
