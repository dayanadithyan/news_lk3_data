The European Green Deal is considered to be a lifeline out of the COVID-19 pandemic. One-third of the \u20ac1.8 trillion investments from the NextGeneration EU Recovery Plan, and EU\u2019s seven-year budget will finance the European Green Deal.",
    "The European Union also welcomed Sri Lanka\u2019s ambitious Climate Prosperity Plan (CPP), which aims to attract foreign investment in the country\u2019s transition to a greener economy. The CPP includes a roadmap for climate adaptation and the achievement of net negative carbon emissions by 2050.",

The country has already seen the effects of climate change, with more frequent floods and droughts, as well as damage to its infrastructure and agriculture."
