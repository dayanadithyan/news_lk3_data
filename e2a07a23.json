    "Stating that it was a pleasurable moment to declare that \u2018Thamizh Desiya Thalaivar\u2019 (Tamil Nationalist Leader) Prabakaran was hale and healthy, he said that this announcement should put an end to the \u2018rumours\u2019 about his death.",

    "The LTTE had never allowed the countries which opposed India to set foot on their land nor did it have any relationship with these countries. It did not take help from then, he said.
