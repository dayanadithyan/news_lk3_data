    "It was highly unlikely that the Local Government election would be conducted on April 25 as announced by the Elections Commissions, the People's Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFEREL) said.",
    "Its Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi told the media that the government was even ignoring the court decisions, which was regrettable.",
    "\"We never expected that the government would deprive people of their franchise. The government has come to a stage where even court decisions are disregarded. The balance among three pillars of democracy namely the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary are in complete disarray now,\" he said.",
    "Hettiarachchi said the executive was plotting to delay the LG polls earlier and that the legislature is also now acting to delay the polls by challenging the court decision hiding behind parliamentary privileges. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
