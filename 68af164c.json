    "Hints at a major political shift in the country after 25 April",
    "Claims Govt. is attempting to form a National Govt. to justify its arbitrary acts",
    "Says crossing over to the Govt. will mark the political end of those who do so",
    "Assures no members of the Freedom People\u2019s Congress will join the Govt.",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress member Prof. Charitha Herath says the Government has launched yet another attempt to form a National Government to gain a seal of legitimacy in the eyes of the people. Noting that several key topics such as the IMF agreement, the new Central Bank Act and the Anti-Terrorism Act are to be taken up in parliament after 25 April, Herath said these will invariably lead the country\u2019s politics down a different path.",
    "\u201cThis Government has no mandate and was formed in an unjustifiable manner. The Government is acting in an arbitrary manner and 25 April will mark the beginning of its dictatorial acts against the country\u2019s people,\u201d he said. According to him, the Government is now attempting to form a national Government only to justify its arbitrary acts and gain a seal of legitimacy. The MP made these comments at a press conference held yesterday.",
    "\u201cIf anyone hopes to legitimise Ranil Wickramasinghe\u2019s Government by supporting him to form a National Government they will be giving a seal of approval to the Government\u2019s arbitrary acts against the country\u2019s people and justifying them,\u201d the MP said. \u201cHe already has a majority and there are those who applaud his words. Why does he need a National Government at this juncture,\u201d he asked.\u00a0 Herath said Wickremesinghe is aware his actions will soon give rise to a crisis in the country and therefore needs the backing and seal of approval from other parties. He accused Wickremesinghe of attempting to fish parliamentarians from various political parties including the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.",
    "\u201cIt will be the end of those MPs. We call on them to not support the Government in this matter, he said. The MP said no member of the Freedom People\u2019s Congress will crossover to the Government."
