    "WNPS Monthly Lecture -The dilemma of wildlife welfare and ethics in the present era",
    "Over the years, human welfare and development have been pursued at the expense of everything around us. Human interference has caused massive shifts within our entire ecosystem and led to changes in animal behaviour and health while driving the destruction of biodiversity and the speed of climate change at an ever-accelerating pace.",
    "Almost every day, the broadcast, print, and social media carry reports of forests being destroyed, wildlife being killed, and rivers and oceans being polluted to the detriment of the aquatic fauna and flora that inhabit these habitats. Each of these actions cause ripple effects that cascade across the environment and society \u2013 and as humans, we have long been both the instigators and the victims of our own activities.",
    "Habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and humanwildlife conflict Impacting the Leopard population Image credit Ranganath Kirindage",
    "As at the end of April, the deaths of 143 wild elephants have been recorded; already threatening to surpass the record number that was killed in 2022. While the loss of a single elephant is devastating to the surrounding ecosystem, their role as a key tourist attraction also equates to the loss of valuable foreign exchange that is essential towards the survival and continuity of our island nation.",
    "Everything is connected. That is why environmental conservation is and has always been, primarily about the welfare of humans. In destroying the natural balance of nature, it is the people and communities who will eventually face its consequences, commencing from the depletion of water resources to poor air quality, and the inevitable deterioration of health.",

    "Yet our country remains in dire need of development, particularly in the wake of an economic crisis unlike any other experienced throughout its independent history. Development is a pre-requisite for Sri Lanka \u2013 however, we must ask ourselves if our progress should be at the cost of our precious resources and the environment, which are depleting at a rapid rate. Can a balance be found: one which takes into account the existing habitat and wildlife of a proposed development project, and ensures their continued preservation even as socioeconomic progress is achieved?",
    "Join us as we explore the two opposing concepts of development and conservation and the solutions that would enable us to achieve a balanced, sustainable future for both people and the planet.",
    "Tharanga Thoradeniya is a Professor at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, of the Faculty of Medicine, at the University of Colombo.
