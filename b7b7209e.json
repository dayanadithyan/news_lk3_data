    "ECONOMYNEXT Sri Lanka\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Department of Agrarian Development are running out of experts and the scheme allowing state workers to go on leave for foreign employment has been restricted, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.",
    "Sri Lanka opened a scheme where state workers can take leave and work abroad during the currency and economic crisis with no loss of seniority.",
    "\u201cWe can\u2019t send them when we have enough vacancies here in the departments,\u201d Minister of Agriculture, Wildlife & Forest Resources Conservation, Mahinda Amaraweera said.",
    "\u201cThere is a huge shortage of the experts in the agriculture sector.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka hired tens of thousands of unemployed graduates in to the state service since 2005 and also under \u2018revenue based fiscal consolidation\u2019 where spending based consolidation\u2019 was discouraged, leading to an expansion of an already bloated state.",
    "However the Ministry of Agriculture has not recruited a new staff for required categories 10 years, according to Minister Amaraweera.",
    "\u201cIn Kilinochchi, department of agriculture, there should be 17 officers we only have 2, he said.",
    "\u201cSo imagine if those two also migrate what will happen? We can\u2019t send them since there is a huge shortage, where the departments will possibly even fail to carry on as well as struggle due to migration of essential workers.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s agriculture sector is an area which needs modern techniques and knowledge to upgrade productivity.",

    "Under the Ministries decision the key staff members will be restricted from traveling out until the vacancies are filled.",
    "\u201cA lot in the staff has migrated so far and now we have stopped it,\u201d Amaraweeera said.",
    "Sri Lanka has frozen public sector hiring to contain spending in 2023 and reduce the already high tax burden and borrowings.",
