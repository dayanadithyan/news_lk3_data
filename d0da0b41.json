    "Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) refuted media reports suggesting its cricketers could potentially be banned from future Indian Premier League (IPL) player auctions as a consequence of not being made available for the opening matches of this year's IPL.",
    "Three of the four Sri Lankan cricketers contracted to play in the IPL this year, all-rounder Wanindu Hasaranga, spinner Maheesh Theekshana and fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana, are currently in New Zealand with the national team for the limited overs series, and as a result will miss the opening week of the tournament.",
    "The IPL begins this Friday (31), while Sri Lanka's last match against New Zealand, the third T20I, is on April 8.",
    "While certain Indian media outlets reported that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was unhappy with the Sri Lankan players missing the opening week of the tournament, SLC dismissed suggestions they would face repercussions.",
    "\"We have issued the players with no objection certificates to go for the IPL after the New Zealand tour, and the BCCI have accepted it. They have not expressed any sort of displeasure in the players being unavailable for the opening few matches,\" an SLC official told the Daily Mirror.",
    "The only Sri Lankan player who would be available for the entirety of the IPL is Bhanuka Rajapaksa, who is not a part of the national team.",
    "SLC also confirmed the dates of its own franchise league tournament, the Lanka Premier League, which will begin on July 31 and end on August 22.\u00a0By Shehan Daniel"
