    "The proposed new Broadcasting Regulatory Commission is a move to tame the media institutions, former JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa said today.",
    "He told a news conference that the people and all media institutions should come forward against this anti-democratic and crooked attempt to violate media freedom.",
    "He said the new commission was proposed to regulate the content of the programmes that are broadcast on radio and telecast on television.",
    "\"There was a discussion in the society about regulating the media. But the government is trying to achieve political objectives by hiding behind this discussion. This Broadcasting Regulatory Commission consists of five members appointed by the President. The Commission is authorized to decide on renewing or suspending the permit of the radio or television channels,\" he said.",
    "Dr. Jayatissa said owners of media institutions would be forced to show their allegiance to the government to ensure that they could renew their license for the following year.(Ajith Siriwardana)"
