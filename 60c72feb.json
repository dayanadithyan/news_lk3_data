    "\u201cOne must understand that youth has lost confidence in politicians in recent times after the financial crisis hit the nation. It was only incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe who responded to former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa who called the opposition to take over the government. The President was able to stop the queues and bring about stability. We call upon the youth to play their role for the sake of the nation and cooperate in bringing financial stability to the nation,\u201d Sagala Ratnayake said.",
    "Mr. Ratnayake added that Sri Lanka will be able to be like developed countries, where fuel prices are adjusted daily. \u201cSri Lanka will be a developed nation by 2040,\u201d he said. (Yohan Perera)"
