    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has praised lawmakers who refused to 'sit down and be quiet'.",
    "Harris Tweeted on Tuesday: \"When the Tennessee 3 were told to sit down and be quiet, they chose courage. They stood up and fought for our democracy and commonsense gun safety laws. Our nation is fortunate to have leaders like them\".",
    "Harris was referring to three members of the state house of representatives in the state of Tennessee, who recently championed the cause of gun control following a mass shooting at an elementary school, and refused to back down in the face of criticism by other lawmakers.",
    "Two of the three were then voted out of office by the same lawmakers, which resulted in a public outcry. But the issue is likely to end up in court. Both of them were immediately sent right back to the house of representatives by unanimous votes by their respective districts, as temporary representatives.",
