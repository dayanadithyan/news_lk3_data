    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank is projecting higher economic growth for the next five years with output recovering to 5.0 percent by 2027 compared to 3.1 percent by the International Monetary Fund.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s economy is projected to contract 2.0 percent in 2023 and expand 3.3 percent in 2024, in projections released in the central bank\u2019s annual report.",
    "Growth will recover to 4.-0 percent by 2025, 4.4 percent by 2026 and 5.0 percent by 2027.",
    "The IMF is projecting -3.0 percent contraction in 2023 and a recovery to 1.3 percent by 2024.",
    "Growth will be 2.6 percent in 2025, 3.0 percent in 2026 and 3.1 percent 2027 and 2028.",
    "A higher growth will have positive effects on debt levels and government revenues.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s growth slowed, especially after the end of a 30-year war amid aggressive monetary policy and currency collapses under \u2018flexible inflation targeting and output gap targeting, according to critics.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank by operating money and exchange policies simultaneously, (trying to collect reserves while printing money for a policy rate), had denied monetary stability to people and businesses for decades triggering exchange controls and trade restrictions, critics say.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s economy contracted 7.8 percent in 2022 after the worst bout of monetary printing by the central bank in its history, to suppress interest rates in the previous two years and target an output gap (Keynesian stimulus), which ended in default.",
    "Suppressing interest rates by liquidity injections began in the 1920s as previously fringe ideology became mainstream policy in the US and UK, triggering international external disequilibrium in the ensuring years and ending a liberal economic order based on sound money.",
    "In the 1930s in particular, saw gold pegs collapse and an epidemic of tit-for-tat protectionism. The 1931 devaluation of the pound drew praise from Keynes. Regular devaluations and also IMF programs followed after it was set up.",
    "Systematized by Cambridge and Harvard academics, Keynesian style stimulus (output gap targeting then described as IS-LM) revived after the US Fed\u2019s housing bubble broke and is expected to be legalized in a new monetary law backed by the IMF.",
    "In the existing law, though output gap targeting was practiced under flexible inflation targeting, the central bank was expected to only provide stability, not growth by printing money through open market operations and other means to suppress short term rates. (Colombo/April27/2023)"
