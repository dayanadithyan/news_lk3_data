    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition parties are contemplating legal action against a proposed Broadcasting Regulatory Commission Act that they claim will erode media freedom in the country, an allegation the government rejects.",
    "Main opposition Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) legislator Tissa Attanayake told reporters that a number of parties in the opposition have agreed to take the matter to the courts.",
    "A collective of parties in the opposition have discussed the matter and agreed that legal action must be taken, he said, speaking at a press conference.",
    "Former government minister G L Peiris who now sits in the opposition told reporters that government claims that it is merely a set of proposals is incorrect.",
    "\u201cIf we allow this bill to be enacted, it will be the death of media freedom,\u201d he said.",
    "The leftist National People\u2019s Power (NPP), meanwhile, said the proposed regulatory commission will have five members, all of whom are effectively appointed by the president.",
    "\u201cThe media will be mandated to only report the truth. Who will decide what is truth and what is falsehood? The commission,\u201d NPP MP Vijitha Herath said at a press briefing.",
    "Reportedly the five ex-officio members of the Commission will be the secretary to the ministry, the Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC), and three other members who shall possess a degree in law, science, business management, technology, communication, engineering, public administration or mass media from a recognised university, appointed by the president with the approval of the Constitutional Council.",
    "The objectives of the commission reportedly include issuing and renewing license for broadcasting service providers, determining the conditions for issuing such license, determining the number of licenses that could be obtained by a single person or broadcasting entity, and suspending or cancelling any license issued for broadcasting service \u201cwith reasons\u201d.",
    "Formulating codes of practice applicable to the different types of license and advising the minister regarding plans, programmes and activities in order to regulate the broadcasting entities or persons will also be among the Commission\u2019s objectives.",
    "The Frontline Socialist Party (FSP)\u2019s Pubudu Jagoda told reporters that the bill, if enacted, would \u201ccompletely violate\u201d Article 14 of Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution which guarantees freedom of expression to all.",
    "The ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) rejects the allegations. SLPP legislator Rohitha Abeygunawardena said there must be some legislation on the misuse of media freedom.",
    "\u201cThere are some websites and other media that engage in character assassination and destroy people. We have seen people open a YouTube channel and engage in all manner of garbage just to make money,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI think there should be new laws regarding such things. But ethical media will be protected, and if there is any challenge posed to the media, the SLPP will stand up for the media,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jun05/2023)"
