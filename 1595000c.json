    "Women\u2019s exclusion from the digital world has shaved $ 1 trillion from the gross domestic product of low- and middle-income countries in the last decade\u2014a loss that will grow to $ 1.5 trillion by 2025 without action. Reversing this trend will require tackling the problem of online violence, which a study of 51 countries revealed 38% of women had personally experienced.",
    "The theme for International Women\u2019s Day, 8 March 2023 (IWD 2023) is, \u201cDigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality\u201d. This theme is aligned with the priority theme for the upcoming 67th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW-67), \u201cInnovation and technological change, and education in the digital age for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls\u201d.",
    "The United Nations Observance of IWD recognises and celebrates the women and girls who are championing the advancement of transformative technology and digital education. IWD 2023 will explore the impact of the digital gender gap on widening economic and social inequalities. The event will also spotlight the importance of protecting the rights of women and girls in digital spaces and addressing online and ICT-facilitated gender-based violence.",
    "Bringing women and other marginalised groups into technology results in more creative solutions and has greater potential for innovations that meet women\u2019s needs and promote gender equality. Their lack of inclusion, by contrast, comes with massive costs: as per UN Women\u2019s Gender Snapshot 2022 report, women\u2019s exclusion from the digital world has shaved $ 1 trillion from the gross domestic product of low- and middle-income countries in the last decade\u2014a loss that will grow to $ 1.5 trillion by 2025 without action. Reversing this trend will require tackling the problem of online violence, which a study of 51 countries revealed 38% of women had personally experienced.",
    "A gender-responsive approach to innovation, technology and digital education can increase the awareness of women and girls regarding their rights and civic engagement. Advancements in digital technology offer immense opportunities to address development and humanitarian challenges, and to achieve the 2030 Agenda\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals.",
    "Unfortunately, the opportunities of the digital revolution also present a risk of perpetuating existing patterns of gender inequality. Growing inequalities are becoming increasingly evident in the context of digital skills and access to technologies, with women being left behind as the result of this digital gender divide. The need for inclusive and transformative technology and digital education is therefore crucial for a sustainable future.",
    "The United Nations Observance of International Women\u2019s Day under the theme, \u201cDigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality\u201d, will be marked by a high-level event on Wednesday, 8 March 2023, 10:00 \u2013 11:30 a.m. EST. The event will bring together technologists, innovators, entrepreneurs, and gender equality activists to provide an opportunity to highlight the role of all stakeholders in improving access to digital tools and be followed by a high-level panel discussion and musical performances."
