  "original_body_lines": [
    "\u20181990 Suwaseriya\u2019 founder MP Harsha de Silva has appealed to the public to \u2018adopt\u2019 an ambulance, owing to the recent turbulence in the country\u2019s economy.",
    "Taking to Twitter, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP explained that due to the current economic situation, the Treasury is unable to fully fund its operations, which may lead to the Suwaseriya service being unsustainable in 2023.",
    "Thus, in a bid to save the project, the Board and management of Suwaseriya have floated a project, requesting corporates and individuals to \u201cAdopt an Ambulance\u201d at a cost of Rs. 5 million.",
    "\u201cThis donation to the Government of Sri Lanka for 1990 Suwaseriya will be fully tax deductible. Try to get this in before the 31 March end of tax year deadline\u201d, MP de Silva tweeted."
