    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 After more than 20 years of negotiations, over 100 member states of the United Nations on Saturday (4th) finally agreed upon the text of the historic High Seas Treaty, the world's first international treaty aimed at protecting the millions of species that inhabit the world's oceans.",
    "Conference Chairperson Rena Lee brought the proceedings in New York to a close on Saturday night. The text will now be sent to individual nations for signature and ratification by their respective legislatures.",
    "The treaty will transform 30% of the world's combined land and sea area into protected areas by the year 2030. At present only 1% of the seas are protected. The oceans also reduce the level of global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide and produce half of the world's oxygen.",
    "At present, countries own the oceans up to 200 miles (360km) from their coastlines, known as Exclusive Economic Zones. Beyond that, no country has ownership or jurisdiction.",
