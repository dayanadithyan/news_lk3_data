    "Conference Chairperson Rena Lee brought the proceedings in New York to a close on Saturday night. The text will now be sent to individual nations for signature and ratification by their respective legislatures.",
    "The treaty will transform 30% of the world's combined land and sea area into protected areas by the year 2030. At present only 1% of the seas are protected. The oceans also reduce the level of global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide and produce half of the world's oxygen.",
