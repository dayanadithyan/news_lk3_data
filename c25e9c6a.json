    "Transgender women will no longer be allowed to compete in female track and field events regardless of their levels of testosterone, World Athletics President Sebastian Coe says.",
    "No female transgender athlete who had gone through male puberty would be permitted to compete in female world ranking competitions from March 31, Coe said.",
    "Speaking after a meeting of the global track and field federation\u2019s decision-making body on Thursday, Coe said World Athletics had consulted with stakeholders, including 40 national federations, the International Olympic Committee and trans groups about the issue of transgender athletes.",
    "\u201cThe majority of those consulted stated that transgender athletes should not be competing in the female category,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cMany believe there is insufficient evidence that transwomen do not retain advantage over biological women and want more evidence that any physical advantages have been ameliorated before they are willing to consider an option for inclusion into the female category.\u201d",
    "He added: \u201cThe judgement we took \u2026 was, I believe, in the best interests of our sport.\u201d",
    "Coe said a working group headed by a transgender person would be created to further monitor scientific developments.",
    "\u201cWe continue to take the view that we must maintain fairness for female athletes above all other considerations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be guided in this by the science around physical performance and male advantage, which will inevitably develop over the coming years. As more evidence becomes available, we will review our position, but we believe the integrity of the female category in athletics is paramount.\u201d",
    "World Athletics said it became apparent that there is \u201clittle support within the sport\u201d for an option that was presented to stakeholders that required transgender athletes to maintain their testosterone levels below 2.5 nanomoles per litre of blood for 24 months to be eligible to compete internationally in the female category."
