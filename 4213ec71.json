    "A dedicated search and rescue operation mounted this morning by the Sri Lanka Navy led to the rescue of six fishermen aboard a local multi-day fishing trawler in distress off Beruwala.",
    "Reportedly, the fishing trawler was at risk of sinking due to the seeping of sea water following adverse weather conditions, whilst it was at sea about eight nautical miles (about 15km) off the Beruwala Lighthouse. The successful rescue mission was handled by the Sri Lanka Coast Guard Craft CG 208.",
    "Upon an alert to the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) Colombo in the Navy Headquarters, through the owner of the multi-day fishing trawler (IMUL A-438-CHW), the Navy rushed CG 208 to the scene. Having rescued those desperate fishermen from the sinking trawler, they were brought ashore by now.",
    "The Sri Lanka Navy is on constant alert to provide relief to the maritime and fishing community in distress within the Search and Rescue Region of Sri Lanka, coordinated by MRCC Colombo, the Navy said."
