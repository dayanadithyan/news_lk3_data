    "Even though the country has the right president, the MPs, ministers, and other politicians have once again started engaging in fraud and corruption as they have done in previous governments, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) chairman Gemunu Wijerathne said.",
    "He told the media that several politicians have been involved with the issuing of temporary expressway route permits during the past few days.",
    "\"Nearly 35 expressway route permits had been issued with certain connections of politicians,\" he charged.",
    "With the issue of these temporary expressway route permits, the government incurs a loss of Rs. 3,000 million.",
    "Every politician involved in the issuing of these temporary expressway route permits commits fraud. Currently, 100 buses are operating on the expressway with these temporary route permits, Wijerathne said.",
    "\"Route permits must be issued following a tender procedure,\" he said, adding that reportedly nearly 10 buses were operating on the expressway with route permits obtained through the tender procedure. The remaining buses are operating while using temporary route permits,\" he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
