    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is confident of meeting its debt resturing objectives and no longer intends to borrow for infrastructure projects that don\u2019t promise returns, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said, adding that the country has learnt its lesson.",
    "In an interview with Singapore-based Channel News Asia, Minister Sabry Sri Lanka is optimistic (\u201cfingers crossed\u201d) that the South Asian nation, still recovering from its worst currency crisis in decades, is on track to completing its debt restructuring programme before the country is due for a review by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in September.",
    "\u201cWe have made a lot of progress. Prior actions except some minor ones were taken before the extended fund facility (EFF) was approved.\u00a0 We have introduced cost-reflective pricing in many areas. State-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms are on the cards. Tax reforms have come into play. There is a sense of stability in the country. We have eliminated all sorts of queues and shortages,\u201d he said.",
    "The minister was emphatic that any debt restructuring effort should feature equal treatment for all of Sri Lanka\u2019s creditors. Whether it\u2019s debt relief or some other form of restructuring, the same standard must apply universally, he said.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re confident that just like we managed to secure debt restructuring assurances from our friend and creditors, we should be able to restructure it,\u201d said Sabry.",
    "The minister was also asked about a proposed 392 million US dollar investment by Chinese state-owned firm China Merchants Group (CMG) to construct a logistics complex in Sri Lanka, which would see total Chinese investment in the country reach 2 billion dollars. This will be Sri Lanka\u2019s first major investment since it defaulted on its debt obligations in April 2022.",
    "Asked if the project would leave Sri Lanka more indebted to Beijing, Sabry said: \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with that. Most of these investments are debt free. We\u2019re not taking any debt. These are investments, 70 percent of which comes from Beijing and 20 percent from the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), and 10 percent from a Sri Lankan company,\u201d he said.",
    "The minister added that the Chinese-built Colombo Port City itself was an investment.",
    "Critics, however, have expressed concern that the Port City would prove to be another white elephant.",
    "\u201cNot a single rupee or dollar was borrowed on that. It\u2019s an investment,\u201d the minister insisted.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of investment we\u2019re looking for. In the short to medium term, we\u2019re not going to borrow any longer to invest in infrastructure projects which are not conducive to returns and [present] no possibility to repay. We\u2019re very careful. We have learnt our lesson,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re a friendly country. We\u2019re open to doing business with the east, south and west. That is how we are,\u201d he added. (Colombo/May03/2023)"
