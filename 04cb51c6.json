    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 With growing uncertainty over the timely conduct of local government elections, Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has upped the ante in its turf war with rival opposition party National People\u2019s Power (NPP) by attacking the latter\u2019s Marxist-Leninist roots.",
    "SJB and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa fired the first salvo on Friday February 17 by digging up a webpage of the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the primary constituent of the NPP, which expounds on its ideology.",
    "\u201cThe JVP\u2019s proposal to eliminate private property ownership is deeply concerning, and I firmly believe such extreme measures would do more harm than good. Instead of leading to the liberation of individuals, it will suppress individual freedoms and hinder economic growth,\u201d Premadasa tweeted Friday evening.",
    "\u201cAs a society, we must strive for social justice and equality while ensuring that our policies promote our country\u2019s and people\u2019s prosperity,\u201d he said.",
    "The opposition leader was referring to a section titled \u2018programme of the proletarian socialist revolution\u2019 in a larger text on the JVP\u2019s programme.",
    "The proletariat which triumphs in a socialist revolution is not faced with a limited task as in the case of the capitalist class which comes to power in a bourgeois democratic revolution. A bourgeois democratic revolution comes to an end when the capitalist class is empowered. But the proletarian revolution starts when the proletariat is given political power. The proletariat in power has to create a new economy and socialist production system while the exploitation of classes, the existence of classes, and the ownership of private property has to be eliminated.",
    "This is the era of proletarian socialist revolution where the means of production is converted to social property. The production of commodities is evicted by direct social production led by the mass of class-conscious proletariat voluntarily assembled. The socialist revolution in Sri Lanka will eliminate the private ownership of property and abolish the basis of class division in society, thus putting an end to the process of exploitation of man by man, and thereby man finally liberated.",
    "It is unclear when the web page was last modified, but it has been a while since the JVP last spoke of a proletariat revolution. Two violent JVP insurrections were brutally suppressed by a Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)-led government in 1971 and a powerful United National Party (UNP) government \u2013 led by SJB leader\u2019s late father President Ranasinghe Premadasa \u2013 in the late 1980s. After a ban was lifted on the JVP, the party entered mainstream democratic politics in 1994, having seemingly given up violence.",
    "While we @sjbsrilanka promises to strengthen property rights and safeguard economic freedom, the JVP which drives the NPP #TrojanHorse says what they will do \u201cThe socialist revolution in Sri Lanka will eliminate the private ownership of property\u2026\u201d The decision is yours #SriLanka pic.twitter.com/FgYThTxcwU",
    "The economist turned MP accidentally defended the rival UNP, which the SJB broke off of in 2020.",
    "\u201cWell the [the UNP] nor the [SJB] has never expropriated private property. Can\u2019t say the same about 1959 1971 SLFP nationalisation and 2011 SLPP expropriation,\u201d he tweeted in response to a follower.",
    "In Marxist theory, there is a distinction between private property and personal property, though in this case, the SJB would contend that there is hardly a difference. Possessions and items intended for personal use such as clothes and vehicles that are obtained \u201cfairly\u201d and the owner has the right to own exclusively count as personal property, while private property constitutes land, factories, infrastructure, etc that generates capital for the owner and necessarily deprives those who work using that property of the value of their work other than in the form of wages.",
    "In the run up to Sri Lanka\u2019s local government elections scheduled for March 09 but is increasingly looking like it may be delayed by months, the NPP has made considerable gains on the propaganda front, banking on popular anti-establishment, anti-mainstream party sentiment that has reached an all-time high post-Aragalaya, the mass protests that unseated Gotabaya Rajapaksa, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most powerful leaders.",
    "The NPP also appears to have abandoned much of its leftist ideology in a bid to woo Sri Lanka\u2019s middle class, tapping into their economic frustrations fueled by, among other things, a steep hike in personal income tax. The party has also backpedalled on its hardline positions\u00a0vis-\u00e0-vis privatised higher education and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "The SJB, meanwhile, whose economic vision has much in common with arch rival, UNP leader and President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s reform agenda has had to straddle an awkward and increasingly uncomfortable fence between populist rhetoric and meaningful change. (Colombo/Feb18/2023)"
