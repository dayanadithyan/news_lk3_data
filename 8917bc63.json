    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013  The head of Sri Lanka\u2019s power regulators has filed a fundamental rights case at the Supreme court against the recent 66 percent electricity tariff hike, the top official said in an email statement.",
    "Janaka Ratnayaka, the chairman of Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) said the \u201cpurported approval given by the Commission\u201d was an unlawful decision of three out of the five members and not a decision of the commission.",
    "The loss-making state-owned Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) implemented a 66 percent increase in the electricity tariff following a protracted conflict between the CEB and the PUCSL head Ratnayaka. The PUCSL informed the CEB that it had approved the tariff hike.",
    "The PUCSL originally gave approval only for a 35 percent increase in the tariff after a public hearing with highly consuming households being charged heavily.",
    "The CEB move has mainly burdened lower unit consuming users, the official CEB data showed.",
    "\u201cThe second basis of the challenge is that the PUCSL is duty- bound to ensure that the interests of all citizens are met when approving a tariff and the, latest tariff hike disproportionately affects those within the lower usage of the bracket making it difficult for the lower income families to consume electricity for their basic necessities\u201d",
    "Three PUCSL commissioners backed the 66 percent tariff hike while Ratnayaka was abroad.",
    "After the decisions, Ratnayake vowed to take legal actions against the three commission members and the tariff hike decision.",
    "Ratnayake through a personal statement said he had challenged the process by which the PUCSL had purportedly approved the tariff hike against the PUCSL act.",
    "The new move comes after the CEB increased the tariff by over 70 percent last year.",
    "A user who consumes 30 units will have to pay 1,300 rupees under the latest tariff hike from 360 rupees, while those who consume 60 units will have to pay 2,960 rupees instead of earlier 900 rupees. (Colombo/ March10/2023)"
