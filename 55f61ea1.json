    "The pilot programme of converting 200 four-stroke petrol three-wheelers to electric (e-Tuk Tuk) was launched at the Werahera branch of the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT).",
    "The event was launched by Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana, DMT Werahera branch Commissioner, Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Ms Azusa Kubota, Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority Chairman Ranjith Sepala and several other officials.",
    "Addressing the event, DMT Commissioner General Nishantha Anuruddha Weerasinghe said more than 1.5 million three-wheelers were already registered at the DMT and the government had to bear the fuel cost of USD 5 billion.",
    "\"Even though two-stroke petrol three-wheelers were banned from import, a large number of three-wheelers are on the road, still operating. Using two-stroke three-wheelers causes heavy damage to the environment,\" he said.",
    "Addressing the event Minister Gunawardana said the local manufacturers would be able to improve the local manufacturing of e-Tuk Tuks and battery manufacturing. The minister also said that experiments are underway to implement a mechanism to charge e-Tuk Tuk batteries using solar, he said.",
    "The programme was launched with the collaboration of the Transport Ministry, the Power and Energy Ministry, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the National Transport Commission and the DMT to enhance mobility.",
    "The project was launched in Makumbura and Pettah in line with the main ceremony at Wearahera.",
    "The project is planning to convert 500,000 three-wheelers to e-Tuk Tuk over five years.",
    "4-stroke petrol three-wheelers under registration of less than 10 years are eligible for the conversion. The initial cost of the conversion would be Rs.1.2 million and several additional charges.",
    "After the conversion, the electric tuk-tuk will drive 80 km to 100 km on a single charge with three passengers. The conversion will save at least Rs. 26,000 per month for the owner. A 7kWh battery and 3kW motor will be installed. The estimated monthly cost for electric charging (100km per day) will be Rs.13,000.",
    "A contact number 074 333 9687 (Call or WhatsApp) was announced by the DMT at the event for further details. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
