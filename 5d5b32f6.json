    "Ada Derana\u2019s \u2018Ukussa\u2019 yesterday (25 April) uncovered a medical racket in Kottawa, in which a doctor was found guilty of administering \u2018Glutathione\u2019, a vaccine banned in Sri Lanka, for \u2018skin whitening\u2019 treatments.",
    "The doctor in question is believed to have administered the \u2018Glutathione\u2019 vaccine as part of an unsafe skin whitening treatment.",
    "Nearly two years ago, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) called for the ban of products containing Glutathione, a molecule commonly used in treatments for side effects suffered by cancer patients, citing that the drug itself caused severely concerning side effects.",
    "Accordingly, upon further questioning of the doctor following his arrest, he had revealed that he does not, in fact, possess any knowledge on vaccines and their administration.",
    "Investigations carried out at the arrestee\u2019s residence also led to the discovery of a stash of \u2018Glutathione\u2019 vials, both used and unused.",
    "The doctor was arrested by Food and Drug Inspectors who were summoned to the site by the \u2018Ukussa\u2019 team upon confirmation of the racket."
