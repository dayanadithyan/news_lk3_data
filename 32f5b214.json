    "If you have dry skin, do not take long showers, or baths. Staying in the water for a longer time can dry it out more. You should also use warm, instead of hot, water, when you wash. Hot water can strip your skin of the fatty substances that give it hydration. As soon as you finish cleansing yourself, apply a body lotion, all over your body, to moisturize. Don\u2019t wash yourself more than once a day",
    "Applying a daily moisturizer can do wonders for dry skin, and there are products in your kitchen you can use which are natural and effective. Try coconut oil, olive oil, almond oil, or sunflower seed oil",
    "Olive oil and brown sugar have amazing properties for the skin. Both of these substances deeply hydrate. Olive oil is also a known wound-healer, while sugar contains glycolic acid, which allows it to have anti-aging. You can make a natural scrub, using these ingredients which can be as good as the best anti-wrinkle creams.",
    "*\u00a0 Mix one tablespoon of brown sugar with a teaspoon of olive oil.",
    "*\u00a0 Blend them, and spread the mixture on your face, and neck, using a circular motion, for a few minutes.",
    "*\u00a0 Then leave it to sit for another couple of minutes, and wash it off with warm water.",
    "Taking care of your lips is important. Lips can also get dry and chapped, which is why you need to keep them hydrated, daily. If you\u2019re looking for a natural balm, try sugar and lemon, or honey, sugar, and butter.",
