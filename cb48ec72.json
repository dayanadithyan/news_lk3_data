    "Following is the text of a letter addressed to the IGP Mr. C.D. Wickramaratne by the Secretary to the Automobile Association of Ceylon (AAC) Mr. Devapriya Hettiarachchi.",
    "Automobile Association of Ceylon (AAC) is the oldest and the largest motoring organization in Sri Lanka established in 1904. We are affiliated to the Federation Internationale De L\u2019Automobile (FIA) which is the World\u2019s largest Mobility and Tourism Organization in Geneva, Switzerland.",
    "As you know, we are the voice of the motorists and our motto is \u201cPartner in Motoring\u201d.",
    "At present we are indulging in Road Safety Projects under the UN Decade of Action 2021/2030, but, from year 2010, under the UN Decade of Action, we have carried out Road Safety Projects annually with the Assistance of FIA, in order to reduce Road fatalities and Injuries in the country.",
    "There are 15 members in the Executive Committee, including the President and two Vice Presidents, but we have, traditionally, the Head of Police, Surveyor General Department, Road Development Authority, Commissioner of the Colombo Municipal Council and various other Government Institutions, as Ex officio Members of the Executive Committee of the Association. These members are usually invited for the AAC Executive Committee Monthly Meetings as and when they are required to provide expertized knowledge in their field on the respective subjects.",
    "Currently, it has been brought to the notice of the Executive Committee that the subject of the Beggar Menace at the Traffic Lights in the Colombo City Limits has gone from bad to worse resulting in untold difficulties being faced by not only the motorists but also all road users including children. It was reported that these Beggars are a nuisance at the Traffic Lights where they irritate the motorists by banging on the car windscreen or the glasses while creating a traffic congestion. Furthermore, some of the Beggars fall on the bonnet of the vehicle pretending that the motorist had knocked him down and create a scene. We therefore, wish to draw your attention that these unruly behaviors of the Beggars undoubtably has direct effect on the image and culture of the country.",
    "We reiterate that this subject had been taken up with the Police Representatives who attend the monthly meetings of the Executive Committee for well over five years and we find that there had been no effective measures taken to eradicate this troublesome public nuisance.",
    "It was, therefore, decided that we will take this matter to a forum with your representative and draw up a suitable programme which could bring an effective and constructive solution to the beggar menace at the traffic lights, especially within the Colombo City Limits (Zone 1-15).",
    "We are confident that you will give us the necessary support and your expertise on this subject and make the Colombo roads safe for all road users.",
    "We shall let you know the date and time of the meeting for this purpose in due course.",
    "Your kind cooperation in this matter will be greatly appreciated.",
