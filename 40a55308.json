    "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what your risk asset is, at this point people are pulling the plug on across different instruments here,\u201d Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York, told Reuters.",
    "\u201cNobody wants to go home with a big position on anything today\u2026 you have nowhere to hide really.\u201d",

    "Bolade Agboola, oil and gas sector analyst at Meristem Securities Limited, had told TheCable that the advantage of the global oil price remaining above Nigeria\u2019s benchmark is that the federal government will earn more revenue to finance its budget."
