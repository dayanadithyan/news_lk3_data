    "The Election Commission had to postpone the polls due to lack of funding by the government.",
    "The Election Commission has yet to announce the LG poll date for the third time after the March 9 election was postponed to April 25. However, Election Commission officials have said the April 25 schedule is unlikely because no ballot paper has been printed and postal voting has not been conducted yet.",
