  "original_body_lines": [
    "A Harrogate barrister has been announced as the youngest ever black and minority ethnic crown court judge in the UK.",
    "Sri Lankan origin Ayesha Smart, 34, can now sit as a Recorder in crown courts across the north east of England.",
    "As well as being the youngest non-white person to take up the role, she will be the third youngest person from any background to be selected.",
    "The process of becoming a judge is complex, involving two sets of exams, a role play exercise and an interview \u2013 and the final approval has to be given by the King.",
    "\u201cEverybody says it takes several goes at the process to get through, so I thought I would give it a go and at least I know what it\u2019s like.",
    "\u201cI anticipated I might be one of the youngest ones in the exams, so I assumed I wouldn\u2019t get anywhere. It was a bit of a nice surprise when I got it!\u201d",
    "Ayesha, who lives near Killinghall, attended Ashville College when she moved to Nidderdale with her family in 2014.",
    "She went on to study A levels in biology, chemistry and maths, as well as music which she sat early, at St Aidan\u2019s and St John Fisher Associated Sixth Form, before completing an undergraduate degree in medical sciences at the University of Leeds.",
    "Her first professional job was as a pathologist at Harrogate District Hospital, but she decided to turn to the law and completed a conversion course in Leeds.",
    "Quickly securing a pupilage place to complete her training, she was called to the bar in 2014, and has since been working in crown courts around Yorkshire.",
    "Her appointment as Recorder, confirmed on Wednesday this week, means she will undertake an induction before sitting in the role for at least 30 days a year.",
    "Ayesha says she is not nervous about the appointment, adding:",
    "\u201cI come from a science background before I went into law. For me, analysing things and coming to a decision is the bit I find easier.",
    "\u201cFor the induction course, we get packed up in a group of other Recorders. Having to do it all in front of them will be slightly nerve-wracking!",
    "To begin with, Ayesha will continue to work as a barrister part-time. She can then decide whether to continue the dual role or move to be a full-time judge.",
    "She hopes she will help the justice service to tackle a huge backlog of cases that has built up in recent years. She added:",
    "\u201cOne of the two-day trials I\u2019m working on, the earliest date we could get for the trial was next October. That\u2019s how backlogged everything is at the moment.",
    "\u201cIf one of my trials [as a barrister] collapses and I end up with a bunch of dates free, they may say, \u2018we\u2019ve got some cases you can hear\u2019.\u201d",
    "And that is not the only way in which Ayesha hopes to make a difference.",
    "As a pioneering BAME woman, she is aware that her presence will be noticed by the people in front of her.",
    "\u201cThe bar, as a profession, is all old, white, posh people. At least with people like me coming through, it\u2019s a bit more representative of society.",
    "\u201cSo many defendants aren\u2019t white. If they see people more like them, it just helps in giving a better perception of fairness.",
    "\u201cHaving somebody slightly younger probably helps as well \u2013 a more modern way of thinking rather than an old-fashioned approach to everything.",
    "\u201cThe drug sentencing guidelines, they\u2019ve had to put a reminder to judges that Blacks and Asians typically get a harsher sentence and ask them to remember that.",
    "\u201cHaving someone who appreciates cultural differences and biases, you are a bit more alive to making sure people are treated equally.\u201d(The Stray Ferret)"
