    "SJB mayoral candidate Mujibur Rahman accuses the President and the SLPP of continuing their efforts in obstructing elections",
    "Says President\u2019s actions prove that the executive presidential system is harmful to Sri Lanka and its democracy",
    "Calls on all opposition parties and trade unions to come together to form a broad front to fight for elections against the \u2018Wickremesinghe - Rajapaksa\u2019 Govt.",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya Colombo mayoral candidate Mujibur Rahman says it is evident that President Ranil Wickremesinghe is withholding the funds and assistance required by the Election Commission of Sri Lanka to hold the local Government elections scheduled to be held on 25 April. Holding a press conference at the Opposition Leader\u2019s office in Colombo yesterday Rahman said that even though a new date for elections has now been announced, both the President and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) appear to be obstructing its preparations.",
    "\u201cGovernment Ministers are openly claiming that a vote will not be held. This is a major threat to the country\u2019s democracy,\u201d he said. Rahman said the President\u2019s actions only prove that the executive presidential system is harmful to Sri Lanka and its democracy. \u201cHis actions in interfering with independent commissions, not providing funds allocated and approved by Parliament and obstructing the MPs as well as their statements in Parliament proves he has undermined the Parliament,\u201d Rahman noted.",
    "The Colombo mayoral candidate accused the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance of avoiding discussions with the ECSL and their requests for funds, \u201cHowever in turn he has merely responded that he must obtain approval from the President. This proves the President is withholding the financial support and other assistance needed to conduct polls,\u201d he said. According to Rahman, the President is manoeuvring the entire state machinery to obstruct the holding of elections and is setting a dangerous precedent. \u201cThis is not a good sign for the future of the country\u2019s democracy and politics,\u201d he added.",
    "Commenting on the Government\u2019s alleged acts of suppression, Rahman said it only showcases before the world that there is no political stability in Sri Lanka. \u201cPolitical stability is important as economic stability can only be achieved through it. However, the Government is disinterested in ensuring political stability as its plan is to continue its acts of suppression through violence,\u201d he added.",
    "Rahman said the SJB will form a broad alliance to fight for elections. \u201cWe will have to set aside our policies and initiate a broad alliance against the Wickremesinghe - Rajapaksa Government to protect the people\u2019s right to franchise. It is time all opposition parties and trade unions come together as one front,\u201d Rahman said."
