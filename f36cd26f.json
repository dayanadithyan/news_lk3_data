    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara says his party has succeeded in securing local Government elections for the people of Sri Lanka despite the Government\u2019s many attempts to delay it. \u201cThe SJB was able to go to courts on several occasions and obtain a court order. The court has now prevented the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance from withholding funds for the polls and instead ordered the release of the necessary funds. It also ordered funds be released to the Government Printer,\u201d he noted. He said the SJB placed its trust in the country\u2019s legal system and was proven right. He extended his gratitude to the courts and Upul Jayasuriya PC for his efforts in submitting the petition.",
    "Madduma Bandara said the SJB led the fight for polls and was supported by all parties in the opposition except for one. Pointing to the various efforts of the Government to delay the polls, Madduma Bandara said the party has now managed to win this victory by going to the courts. He accused the Government of lying when it said it had no funds for polls and said instead it has attempted to delay the elections as it is afraid of facing the people\u2019s opinion. \u201cThis is a tremendous victory for the country\u2019s democracy,\u201d he said.",
    "He said the Election Commission was facing difficulties in announcing a date due to the Government\u2019s failure to provide the funds for the election. \u201cNow we have managed to get a court order. We ask the Election Commission to therefore make a decision without further delay and protect the democratic rights of the country\u2019s people,\u201d he said. Madduma Bandara said this is a good sign and a good beginning for the victory of the SJB. He also assured the SJB will continue to fight for the rights of the people."
