  "original_body_lines": [
    "pH monitoring to ensure impeccable quality and adherence to global standards",
    "Secures Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) certifications",
    "Anticipates significant increase in foreign export earnings, leveraging sustainable solutions to new export markets",
    "Holds leadership in Bangladesh, with rapid growth in India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Philippines",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s largest water-based pigment emulsion manufacturer, Haycolour Ltd., a subsidiary of Hayleys Aventura, has successfully secured two major environmental certifications, as part of a broader effort to leverage industry-leading expertise in sustainable manufacturing and innovation to capture new export opportunities.",
    "According to Hayleys Aventura Managing Director Wasaba Jayasekera, the new certifications, Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) and Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC), are expected to provide a boost in foreign earnings, primarily through the capture of new and expanded export market opportunities. They will also enable Haycolour to bring more sustainable solutions to the world, while also consolidating their position as an emerging leader in sustainable colour solutions across South and South-East Asia.",
    "\u201cMaximisation of Sri Lanka\u2019s export opportunities is an urgent national priority. By investing in stronger Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards, and demonstrating the credibility of our efforts with such stringent global standards, we are working to demonstrate Haycolour\u2019s commitment to sustainable manufacturing, and create value for our global customers, who are placing increasingly greater value on sustainable colour solutions.\u201d",
    "Leading the charge in Bangladesh, Haycolour is now spreading its wings across Asia, with rapid growth in India, Pakistan, Malaysia, and the Philippines \u2013 leveraging sustainability to strengthen position as a visionary industry leader.",
    "While sustainable fashion, ethical clothing, fair production are frequently used terms with many meanings, the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) the world-leading textile processing standard for organic fibres, has a clearly defined set of criteria and is transparent. It maintains that an entity adheres to ecological and social criteria, with the entire textile supply chain subsequently subjected to independent certification \u2013 providing a credible assurance to end consumers across the world.",
    "Similarly, ZDHC is a leading worldwide environmental compliance initiative that encourages widespread implementation of sustainable chemistry, driving innovations and best practices in textile, apparel and footwear industries to protect consumers, workers and the environment.",
    "The two new certifications add to Haycolour\u2019s growing list of internationally-recognised sustainable and quality related certifications including Reach, FDA, EN 71 and CE compliances, for the glove and other industries.",
    "\u201cWe have also upgraded our equipment to be more modern and environmentally friendly which has helped us explore new business verticals. By prioritising ESG, we believe we can undertake bigger projects that support our country\u2019s economic growth,\u201d Jayasekera stated."
