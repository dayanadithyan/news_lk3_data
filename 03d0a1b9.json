    "Soon after the UN Independent Expert on Foreign Debt, Other International Financial Obligations and Human Rights, Attiya Waris, Professor of Fiscal Law and Policy, took over her duties in August 2021, she wrote to the IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva seeking information on the IMF\u2019s operations relevant to her mandate. She felt that in order to resolve the \u201cexistential challenges\u201d faced by the international community, it needed coordination of the UN specialised agencies for effective global governance.",
    "Replying to her letter of November 2021 in February last year, Georgieva effectively set out the limits of the IMF\u2019s possible cooperation in terms of the UN expert\u2019s suggestions, clarifying clearly and very usefully in the process, its raison d\u2019etre which she specifically said was not to be a \u201cdevelopmental organization\u201d.",
    "This was stated in the context of a specific remark made by the Expert on Foreign Debt regarding accountability of the IMF staff. Waris was concerned that the IMF, like all others dealing with such challenges, \u201cinevitably operates on the basis of imperfect knowledge and in dynamic and complex environments.\u201d She felt that this suggested that as in all other international organisations \u201cdespite their best efforts, IMF staff\u2026may sometimes err.\u201d",
    "In such cases, she wrote that \u201cit raises concerns about the limited IMF accountability to those who may be adversely affected by its operations.\u201d She suggested that the IMF should appoint an official \u201csuch as an independent ombudsperson\u201d to investigate such complaints received from persons who believe that they have been harmed by IMF staff not sticking to their own policies and procedures.",
    "Georgieva\u2019s reply clarifies that the IMF has a \u201climited technical mandate\u201d and \u201cits purposes are all economic in nature\u201d. She further states that its focus is on the promotion of \u201cmacroeconomic stability, economic growth, free international economic exchange and assisting members in addressing their balance of payments problems.\u201d This is set out as the \u201couter limit of the IMF\u2019s legal mandate\u201d according to their Articles of Agreement.",
    "She says in her reply that while the IMF is guided by a number of human rights concerns in its work including with regard to climate change, poverty reduction, social spending, gender parity and corruption, its mandate doesn\u2019t extend to creating a mechanism to \u201caddress claims from non-state actors\u201d as the \u201cIMF is not a developmental agency, but rather makes its resources available only to governments of its members for their balance of payments support and does not finance individual projects\u201d.",
    "The IMF is clear that while it \u201crecognizes and respects\u201d and even \u201csupports\u201d human rights, in the words of the Managing Director, they do so \u201cby helping member countries create an economic and institutional environment in which human rights can flourish\u201d.",
    "A 2005 publication named \u2018Accountability of the International Monetary Fund\u2019 edited by Barry Carin and Angela Wood of the Centre for Global Studies, University of Victoria, Canada, had brought up the same issues posed to the IMF by UN Experts in 2021. The situation of accountability has remained the same and the issues remarkably unchanged and relevant, certainly in the case of Sri Lanka.",
    "In its preface, under the heading \u2018The Role of National Parliaments\u2019, its conclusions are eerily familiar of Sri Lanka in 2023:",
    "\u201cParliamentary engagement with the IMF will remain limited unless both the IMF and national governments at least permit, if not facilitate or require, parliaments to get involved. Although parliaments ought to be among the key stakeholders included in the Poverty Reduction Strategy process, the IMF\u2019s Articles of Agreement limit its negotiating remit to the finance ministry and central bank governors. There is an obvious role for the IMF to play in informing, explaining and communicating information about economic policy to parliaments. However, currently there is much skepticism among parliamentarians about the impartiality of the Fund\u2019s efforts in this regard.\u201d",
    "In Chapter 3, under the heading \u2018Power and Responsibility\u2019, it says:",
    "\u201cCritics hold the IMF accountable for policy choices because of its financial leverage, and because under the guise of its superior \u2018technical know-how\u2019 it is able to impose policies on weaker governments \u2026 against their wishes and often those of their citizens too. The perception is that the IMF continues to impose inappropriate or politically unacceptable policies because the Executive Board and the management and staff bear none of the burden of failed policy or the political consequences of imposing policies against the electorate\u2019s will.\u201d",
    "\u201cGovernments are held to account at the ballot box, and dismissals (or resignations) of ministers and other senior staff are regularly meted out as a means of dealing with policy failings and public dissatisfaction. However, the IMF\u2019s political leaders and senior managers do not face these political checks and balances. Nor has civil society recourse to national legal systems since, being an international institution, the IMF has legal immunity.\u201d",
    "It makes the valid point that if IMF programs were successful, there would be no calls for accountability. However, there are still calls for accountability because certain groups feel they are \u201cadversely affected\u201d by their policy prescriptions. The publication explains that:",
    "\u201cThe problem for these groups is that IMF programs are determined outside national processes, which means it is not clear whether the government or the IMF is setting policy and, therefore, who is accountable. Moreover, it means that society\u2019s views are often not taken into consideration in the policy setting process. This lack of transparency means that both governments and the IMF can avoid taking responsibility for decisions taken.\u201d",
    "Someone has to take responsibility. Here\u2019s what the IMF thinks, according to the publication:",
    "\u201cThe IMF is able to distance itself from taking responsibility for the consequences of its policy advice by claiming government \u2018ownership\u2019 of policies. Ownership implies that a government accepts the need for and willingly implements necessary reforms. It also implies that a government takes the decision to implement the policies specified in IMF program documents. This implies that the government is accountable for any misjudgment of policy; the IMF is simply an advisor in the background.\u201d",
    "Although this is not the end of the story and there\u2019s still on-going discussions on the IMF\u2019s accountability for its policy prescriptions, it\u2019s best to know where the buck stops at least until the issue is decided satisfactorily.",
    "Did our Government do its best in agreeing to the IMF programs? Or did they act as weak states do?",
    "\u201cTypically, governments with good analytical capacity are in a better position to advocate their own policies and negotiate with the IMF, and therefore may have greater ownership. Conversely, where capacity is limited, the IMF\u2019s advice is more influential...This capacity is often in short supply in the poorest countries, thus even when new processes are intended to facilitate government ownership the IMF remains extremely influential.\u201d",
    "When it\u2019s time to feel the pain however, it will be neither the IMF nor the politicians who will suffer, but the vast majority who weren\u2019t consulted.",
    "Holding the Government accountable is hardly possible for a people who are being denied democratic elections, which is the only way to let politicians know if they have gone too far.",
    "The tragedy of debt crises is neither that simple nor is it anywhere close to being resolved although efforts are underway to ensure that structural causes are addressed. This is beset with difficulties because such efforts aim to change nothing less than the world order itself. Independent experts of the United Nations such as those on Foreign Debt and other International Obligations, the Right to Development, On Poverty, on World Order etc. have made many interventions and are in correspondence with global financial organisations as well as member states to effect changes.",
    "The Report of the previous UN Independent Expert on Foreign Debt on \u201cInternational debt architecture reform and human rights\u201d (A/76/167) presented at the76th session of the General Assembly makes several observations relevant to Sri Lanka:",
    "Existing debt architecture is characterized by growing creditor litigation, both in frequency and in terms of outstanding amount under litigation, mostly by funds that speculate on countries in debt distress by purchasing deeply discounted debts then suing debtors for full repayment. By 2010, debt restructuring was accompanied by litigation in more than 50 per cent of restructurings, with exorbitant profits ranging from 300 to 2,000 per cent.",
    "After years of IMF and World Bank-mandated fiscal consolidation, countries that benefited from the initiatives are finding themselves once again in new debt traps.",
    "A core criticism of the existing debt architecture is the central role of the IMF, an institution that bears great influence on countries\u2019 policy space, stipulating macro targets on fiscal balances to a perennially growing array of issues that include privatization of public assets, liberalization of trade and product markets and a host of market reforms that constrain the ability of States effectively to address their human rights obligations. These conditionalities are not necessarily negotiated with States, let alone with their populations, and the previous Independent Expert highlighted the responsibility for complicity of international financial institutions in human rights violations in the context of retrogressive economic reforms (see A/74/178).",
    "The report makes several observations under the heading \u201cReform needed to resolve debt crises\u201d which include:",
    "Democratic process: \u201c\u2026The international debt architecture must be inclusive of developing countries in co-developing just and equitable solutions. As the President of Argentina was quoted as saying, there cannot be a global recovery when there are countries excluded from the solutions\u2026.\u201d",
    "Austerity avoidance: \u201c\u2026Procyclical policy to combat debt crisis is retrogressive; crises should not be dealt with by fiscal tightening. The former Independent Expert has argued that, according to international law standards, international financial institutions may be held responsible for complicity in the imposition of economic reforms that violate human rights\u2026\u201d",
    "Multilateral framework for debt restructuring: \u201c\u2026The United Nations should play a leading role in guiding and implementing the reform to establish an equitable, durable, commonly acceptable resolution to sovereign debt crises. A multilateral framework would reduce the presence of moral hazards during crisis resolution\u2026a multilateral framework would help to neutralize the unequal balance of power and the bias in the international debt architecture\u2026\u201d",
    "Addressing illicit financial flows: \u201c\u2026without transformative steps towards a redesigned international financial architecture that addresses illicit financial flows, the shortcomings of financing for development cannot be overcome\u2026.\u201d",
    "In a newspaper report it is alleged by the Commercial and Industrial Workers\u2019 Union on behalf of the unions, civil society organisations, and professionals\u2019 collective, that the Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe \u201cdisregarded and trivialized the extent of illicit financial flows through trade mis-invoicing in instigating Sri Lanka\u2019s ongoing foreign exchange and fiscal crisis.\u201d",
    "They allege that at the Parliamentary Committee on Public Finance (COPF) meeting on 23 January, responding to questions raised by Parliamentarians on their statement at the COPF meeting, Dr. Weerasinghe allegedly said:",
    "\u201cObviously, people who do under-invoicing or over-invoicing happen to basically evade taxes. If you have taxation, you declare a low value and pay low taxes and then they keep the money. They probably keep it out or bring it here \u2013 that\u2019s their business. We don\u2019t know\u2026The other thing is, I don\u2019t believe this number. The reason is if exporters are doing business here, they can\u2019t keep that amount of money abroad.\u201d",
    "The Collective queries: \u201cWhy has the Government failed to move an inch on the observations and recommendations of institutions such as the IMF on illicit financial outflows? Why is the Government burying its head in the sand while its friends, the business elite, loot money out of this country and deny our country much-needed foreign exchange?\u201d",
    "Considering the new glow around the IMF at present, this is a good question and one that the IMF itself should ask the Government."
