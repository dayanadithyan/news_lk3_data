    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 Sri Lanka is likely to be rocked by severe strike actions in many crucial sectors nationwide which will bring the country to a standstill, as the public buckles under the financial strain of multiple price hikes and heavy taxation.",
    "The Professionals Trade Union Collective and several other trade unions representing government and semi-government sectors have planned to launch trade union actions from Monday, March 13. More than 40 trade unions including health, education, water, electricity, nurses, teachers, government and semi-government sectors have expressed their support.",
    "Trade unions said one of the main reasons for the trade union action is the failure to provide solutions to the burdens caused by the unfair tax policy, while salaries have not been increased and the economic crisis continues.",
    "Through the protests, the trade unions will also highlight several other matters including skyrocketing interest rates and issues related to salaries and increments.",
    "Dr. Haritha Aluthge, Secretary of the GMOA said: \u201cThe GMOA will commence the trade union action in four provinces from 8am tomorrow, including the Western Province, Southern Province, Central Province and Eastern Province. If a solution is provided tomorrow there is no need to move to the next phase. If not, we will have to launch the trade union action in the other five provinces from 8am on Tuesday. If a solution is not provided on Tuesday, an indefinite strike will be launched across the island at 8am on Wednesday.\u201d",
    "Senior Lecturer Charudaththa Ilangasinghe, Spokesperson of the Federation of University Teachers' Associations, declared: \u201cThe IMF has no understanding of the social issues that arise from this tax policy. It has not been studied. In such a situation, what will happen to the people of this country after the government puts this on the IMF? Who is responsible for the people of this country? This is a very serious situation. If there is no response by the 15th of March, we will continue these strikes.\u201d",
    "The Joint Trade Union Alliance of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board also expressed their support for the trade union action.",
    "Upali Ratnayake, Secretary of the Joint Trade Union Alliance of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, said: \u201cOn the 13th our employees including executive officials and professionals will withdraw from services. On the 14th all employees of the Water Board will withdraw from services for four hours. All services at offices and consumer services will not be fulfilled. Taking to account the inconvenience caused to the public, services will continue only at water pumping stations and water purification centres to ensure an undisrupted supply of water. We will join the island wide trade union action from 9am to 4pm on the 15th. On that day the water board will not carry out any services, apart from water pumping and water purification.\u201d",
    "The All Ceylon Nurses' Union said nursing services will also engage in a strike on the 15th of March.",
    "H.M.S.B. Mediwatta, General Secretary, All Ceylon Nurses' Union: said: \u201cSpecial institutions such as maternity hospitals, cancer hospitals and childrens hospitals will not be part of the trade union action. Nursing staff of all other hospitals will join.\u201d",
    "Mahinda Jayasinghe, General Secretary, Ceylon Teacher Services Union, declared: \u201cThe Teacher-Principals Trade Union Alliance will launch the trade union action on the 15th based on eight demands including common issues and our own concerns.\u201d",
    "Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers' Union, said: \u201cOne of the main demands is to provide a solution to reduce the cost for parents to obtain stationery. We made a request to the Education Minister. What steps will be taken? This is our initial strike. If the education system is not fixed, if the problems of teachers and principals are not resolved, if the teacher transfer process is not made stringent, then we will definitely move on to further measures.\u201d",
    "Nimal Mudunkotuwa, General Secretary of the Principals' Grade Association, said: \u201cThere are around 11,200 principals at present, and all trade unions have unanimously decided that none of them will report to work on that day. All teachers are of the same stance. Our first request is not to put your child at risk by sending them to school on that day. We are informing parents that school will not operate on that day so keep your child at home. It was decided to hold term exams on the 15th of March in some areas. The Principals' Grade Association informed all Provincial Education Directors to postpone the exam paper scheduled for the 15th.\u201d",
    "Trade unions of government instituions will also join the action on the 15th of March.",
    "P. K. Ranukge, Chairman, All Ceylon Samurdhi Managers' Association, noted: \u201cAt a time when there is a shortage of officials in the Samurdhi Department across Sri Lanka, this government has neglected the recruitment and promotion procedure. We can see that the government is leading the Samurdhi Department to a natural end and it is clear the government is also further burdening the poor people.\u201d",
    "Chandana Sooriyarachchi of Trade Union Coordination Center, said: \u201cOn the 15th the entire process of government institutions will be disrupted. If you try to visit the Divisional Secretariat, the District Secretariat, the Samurdhi Bank, the hospital, the Immigration Department, the Motor Traffic Department, and other Ministries on the 15th for any work, don't waste yout time. The whole country is workIng together to make this trade union action a success.\u201d",
    "Dhammika Munasinghe, Secretary, Joint Development Officers' Center, said: \u201cThese trade unions are joining this struggle representing your issues as well. So if you are planning to go to any government institution on the 15th of March for any work, refrain from doing so. The district secretariat, the divisional secretariat, regional education offices, ministries and departments will be closed on that day.\u201d",
    "Chinthaka Bandara, Convenor, Government and Semi-Government Trade Union Collective, said: \u201cThe postal sector of 26,000 postal workers fully support this. At 4pm on the 14th all employees at the Central Mail Exchange in Colombo will join the strike. Post offices and nearly 3,410 sub-post offices in the island will join the strike from midnight on the 14th till midnight on the 15th. No post office or public service will be provided across the island during these 24 hours.\u201d",
    "Ven. Tampitiye Sugathananda Thero, General Secretary, Joint Health Workers Union, said: \u201cThe Ranil Rajapaksa government over the past took various measures to attempt to oppress and stop these strikes. But the working class of this country has shown that this fight cannot be stopped through oppression.\u201d",
    "Ajith Thilakarathne, Joint Convener of the Government and Semi-Government Trade Union Collective, noted: \u201cRanil Wickremesinghe's side continues to engage in oppression. We are telling the police and the tri-forces not to carry out orders that are issued illegally against trade unions and student unions.\u201d",
