    "Claiming that Saradiel\u2019s son is not Saradiel, Parliamentarian Diana Gamage said today Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa would not be able to perform just as his father.",
    "She told Parliament that former president Ranasinghe Premadasa sought IMF assistance and served the people.",
    "\"Former President Premadasa sought IMF assistance and served the people and the country with IMF funds. But, you keep in mind that Saradiel is Saradiel. Saradiel's son is not Saradiel and Saradiel's father is also not Saradiyel. So, I don't think you can perform just as your father,\" she said.",
    "She added that the Opposition Leader should stop criticising the President and the Rajapaksas.",
    "\"If the Samagi Jana Balawegaya is opposed to seeking IMF assistance, please give an alternative to the country,\" she said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
