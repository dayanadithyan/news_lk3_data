    "The 2023 Asia Cup that is scheduled to take place later this year is set to move from Pakistan to Sri Lanka, a report in The Indian Express said on Monday.",
    "The likelihood of the tournament being shifted from Pakistan had increased recently, with BCCI secretary Jay Shah even stating that they refused to send the Indian team to Pakistan over lack of government clearance.",
    "According to the report, Pakistan\u2019s participation in the event is unclear, with reports saying that Pakistan could even boycott the event, scheduled to be held from September 2-17.",
    "Following BCCI\u2019s refusal to travel to Pakistan citing lack of government clearance, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had proposal for a hybrid model to host the tournament. In such a model, India would have played their matches in Dubai.",
    "That proposal, however, hardly received any backing with the tournament\u2019s official broadcasters even being concerned with it. The report also claims that Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have supported this idea of moving the tournament out of Pakistan and a decision on it is expected to be taken at the end of this month.",
    "The report goes onto add that Oman had also offered to host the Asia Cup, but Sri Lanka had been considered an option keeping the conditions. It would be peak summer in September in the UAE, and the teams reportedly had reservations on playing a 50-over tournament in the Gulf region a month prior to the event.",
    "\u201cNajam Sethi (PCB chairman) was in Dubai today to procure support but to his horror there were no takers for his proposal of Pakistan playing its games in Karachi or Lahore and India playing in UAE. Sri Lanka was always with BCCI and now even Bangladesh Cricket Board seemed opposed to the idea,\u201d an ACC source told PTI.",
    "\u201cACC has always maintained that in principle the \u2018hybrid model\u2019 is unacceptable and the budgetary sanctions can never be passed.\u201d \u201cAlso it\u2019s not about Pakistan hosting its own matches. It also means that if India and Pakistan are in same group, the third team will be travelling to and fro between Dubai and a city in Pakistan,\u201d the source added.",
    "What added fuel to the fire is PCB\u2019s recent decision to host Pakistan Super League\u2019s matches in UAE due to escalated costs of security arrangements.",
    "\u201cAlso logistically, the broadcasters wouldn\u2019t want to send separate units in two countries. Sri Lanka, just like UAE doesn\u2019t require inter-city flights whether you play at the Khettarama (Premadasa Stadium), SSC or Galle or Kandy,\u201d he added.",
    "However the ACC chairman Jay Shah will need to convene an Executive Body meeting to make the decision official. In the prevailing situation, whether Pakistan participates in the event or decides against coming to India for the World Cup remains to be seen.",
    "\u201cEven ICC won\u2019t agree to Pakistan playing its matches outside India (during World Cup). So let\u2019s see what PCB decides,\u201d the source added.",
    "Sri Lanka are the defending champions of the Asia Cup, having clinched the title in 2022, when it was played in the T20 format."
