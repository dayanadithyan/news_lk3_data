    "Sri Lanka\u2019s SME scale exporters can access UAE markets directly without going through middlemen, chairman- HNC SHIPPING LLC, United Arab Emirates, Deshamanya Pradeep Nanayakkara said.",
    "\u201cThey can sell their export produce without a broker to the UAE. Such export items are: king coconut, cassava, papaya, avocados, mangoes, vegetables and many more, Nanayakkara told The Island Financial Review.",
    "Nanayakkara added: \u201cThe biggest problem faced by growers is the lack of a proper price for their produce. It is worthless to come to the streets and blame the government and demand a price for their harvest. The solution is to find an export market, as in the case of growers of other countries, which can generate a huge income.",
    "\u201cMany fruits like pineapple, watermelon, mango, narang and varaka should be processed, packaged and exported in a dehydrate method. There is a huge demand for this segment.",
    "\u201cIn addition value- added cinnamon, vanilla, and honeydew can be sold at a very high price. Attractive packages too could be used to attract the high- end super markets.",
    "\u201cAnother merchandise that is in great demand is coir. It can be exported in the form of cubes and people here also grow tea as a home plant.",
    "\u201cI must also say that this market is not created suddenly. But the growers and small and medium businessmen of our country have not focused on generating additional foreign exchange.",
    "\u201cWe can also provide these merchandise to hotels and restaurants. Lack of knowledge on the part of Sri Lankan SME exporters has placed the island nation behind competitive countries but at least now SME exporters must wake up and look at the UAE market.\u201d",
