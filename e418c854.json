    "A group of petitioners including Elle Gunawansa Thera yesterday filed a fundamental rights petition",
    "before the Supreme Court requesting an order be issued directing the IGP to arrest self-proclaimed Christian Pastor Jerome Fernando over his allegedly derogatory comments against other religions in the country.",
    "The petition by the group led by Elle Gunawansa Thera has requested the Supreme Court to issue an order to the IGP and other respondents to apprehend the pastor immediately and to initiate legal proceedings against him for the \u2018offensive\u2019 remarks made by him during a sermon recently.\u00a0 Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa on Wednesday said Fernando may be arrested on his return to Sri Lanka from Singapore based on the travel ban issued on him by the courts. An overseas travel ban was issued against the Pastor by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court on 16 May based on a request made by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).",
    "Fernando, however, left the island on 14 May. He is currently in Singapore and is also set to visit Malaysia over the next few days for events promoting his Church. In an Instagram post, Fernando had indicated that he would be returning to the island on Sunday in order to host a service titled \u2018Mega Church Day\u2019 at his Miracle Dome church in Katunayake.",
    "Jerome Fernando found himself in hot water this week after during a sermon he made controversial remarks about other religions, especially Buddhism and the Lord Buddha causing an uproar among Buddhists in the country. The Catholic Church, All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, and other religious groups have slammed Fernando.",
    "The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) has commenced an investigation into Jerome Fernando on the orders of President Ranil Wickremesinghe after the matter was taken up at a national security council meeting held on Monday.",
    "Several Buddhist organisations and groups including the New Buddhist Front and the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya have also filed police complaints against him."
