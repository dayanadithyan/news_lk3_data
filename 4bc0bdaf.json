    "6 April marks Ashraff Associates\u2019 11th anniversary. A milestone for a boutique agency that has made its mark in Sri Lanka as a creative force that prides itself with its ability to \u2018Think Different\u2019, delivering integrated communication solutions at the highest global standards of creative excellence.",
    "The agency has served a plethora of brands over the past decade covering sectors that range from (but are not limited to) hospitality, building and construction, apparel, finance, real estate and more; thereby contributing immensely to the agency\u2019s versatility at understanding domestic and international markets alike and creating innovative solution based strategic pathways for the brands in their care.",
    "\u201cWe enjoy challenges,\u201d said Ashraff Associates MD/ECD Aman Ashraff. \u201cThe last few years have been surreal. From the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019 to COVID-19 rampaging the world in 2021/22, Sri Lanka has faced an onslaught of economic hardships that led to many organisations having to make difficult decisions. By the grace of Almighty God, we have been able to weather the storm and arrive intact, stronger than before and ready to face what lies ahead with renewed spirit,\u201d he added.",
    "The agency also prides itself in being dynamic terra firma for young professionals to receive on-the-job training and find their footing within the spheres of advertising. A graduate from the University of Northumbria (UK), Michelle Ronaly is one of the newest members of the agency team. On the experience of working at the agency she stated: \u201cMaking the decision to join Ashraff Associates was a wise one,\u201d she says: \u201cbecause I was forced to face and resolve challenges I had never encountered before and use my initiative on some amazing projects.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis has helped me recognise the importance of being aware of what happens around me, particularly in relation to emerging brands and the value of cultivating enduring relationships with my clients. To work at Ashraff Associates is to work with passion, attention to detail and above all, creative freedom,\u201d Ronaly added."
