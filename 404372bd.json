    "The case was called before the Colombo High Court judge Navaratne Marasinghe this morning.",
    "There, the Bribery Commission handed over the revised indictments against the defendants before the open court.",
    "Later, the attorneys representing the defendants mentioned that the Bribery Commission has not provided all the documents that should be handed over to them.",
