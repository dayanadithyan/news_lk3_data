    "The incumbent Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) office-bearers are set to be re-appointed for another term when SLC conducts its Annual General Meeting tomorrow.",
    "Barring any late drama, Shammi Silva will return as President, Jayantha Dharmadasa and Ravin Wickramaratne as Vice Presidents, with Mohan de Silva to continue as Secretary, with no opposing nominations to challenge a re-election.",
    "Their re-appointment comes in the backdrop of an International Cricket Council (ICC) investigation into political interference by the Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe, after SLC officials complained to the ICC.",
    "The ICC appointed a three-member committee to carry out this investigation, comprising of Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Secretary Jay Shah, the ICC\u2019s Deputy Chairman Imran Khwaja and Bangladesh Cricket Board President Nazmul Hassan, with Khwaja visiting the island last week to meet SLC officials and the Sports Minister.",
    "The ICC Deputy Chairman is reported to have asked both parties\u2014SLC and the Sports Minister\u2014to work together to create a roadmap for necessary reform, highlighting the ICC\u2019s opposition to political interference into the administration of the sport.",
    "\u201cThe ICC did brief us again (after meeting both SLC and the Minister), stating that our grievances have been conveyed to the Minister,\u201d SLC Secretary de Silva told the Daily Mirror.",
    "\u201cThe Minister was informed that our grievances must be addressed. And while we are open to working with him in formulating a roadmap for reform at SLC, it is important that some of the issues that are delaying our impending work are resolved.\u201d",
    "\u201cSome of the previous ministers have been understanding of these issues and been supportive of us, but ever since the new National Sports Council (NSC) was appointed under Minister Ranasinghe, we have been facing challenges,\u201d de Silva added.",
    "The Minister has raised concerns about the lavish spending by SLC in sending its officials to the United Arab Emirates for the Asia Cup and Australia for the T20 World Cup last year.",
    "Concerns were also raised about the national cricket selection committee, with the Arjuna Ranatunga-led NSC not ratifying SLC\u2019s nominations for the panel, stating that more qualified options were available.",
    "The relationship between SLC and the Minister further soured when the latter brought in a gazette that limited the terms of office and placed age limits at sports associations, which appeared specifically targeting incumbent SLC officials.",
    "SLC were among a handful of sports associations that successfully petitioned the Court of Appeal to issue a stay order against the implementation of the gazette.\u00a0(SMD)"
