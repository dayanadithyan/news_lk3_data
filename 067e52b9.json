    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s banks have sought clarity on a proposed domestic debt restructure questioning whether there was non-voluntary element in the plan and also called for transparent discussions with all banks.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Central Bank and Treasury officials have said there will be voluntary debt \u2018optimization\u2019 for domestic debt holders.",
    "Banks said they are seeking clarity on what is meant by voluntary debt optimization, and whether there is a non-voluntary element which applied to state banks and pension funds.",
    "\u201cThe management of this process including priorities of the GoSL through their agents, the IMF expectations and all public debt holders is admittedly difficult given the diversity of interests,\u201d a statement from Sri Lanka Banks\u2019 Association said.",
    "\u201cHowever, the lack of transparency in the negotiations with the SLBA member bank consortium is unhelpful.\u201d",
    "Banks also sought disclosure on sovereign bond restructure terms, what IMF\u2019s views are on the duration of the IMF program and where the proposed domestic debt optimization \u201cwould resemble the experience of some other countries who have taken this route before us.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka has projected higher growth than the IMF for the next few years, which would in theory reduce the need to re-structure debt compared to the more \u2018pessimistic\u2019 forecasts of the Washington based lender.",
    "Sri Lanka has to restructure debt under an International Monetary Fund program after prolonged money printing to suppress interest rates and to close a supposed output gap (Keynesian stimulus) backed up by tax cuts under flexible inflation targeting led to external sovereign default.",
    "Several countries with reserve collecting (pegged) central banks which pursued similar monetary policy without tax cuts have also defaulted.",
    "\u201cIt must be borne in mind always that the banking sector will have to play an active role in Sri Lanka\u2019s economic revival process,\u201d the statement said.",
    "\u201cThe sector Capital Adequacy Ratios (CAR) and Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR) are presently within the regulatory requirements. This position must not be depleted through any action including a debt restructuring that threatens the stability of banks and erodes public confidence.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka Banks\u2019 Association (Guarantee) Limited (SLBA) Media Release on GoSL Debt Restructuring Process",
    "The Sri Lanka Banks\u2019 Association (SLBA) represents all of the licensed banks in Sri Lanka and underpins all sectors of the economy. The banking sector is the main mechanism through which the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) implements monetary policy influencing the financial markets. Stability of the banking system is critical for the national interest.",
    "GoSL Public Debt Restructuring and Concerns of the Banking Sector",
    "\u201cHaving run an unsustainable macroeconomic model in tandem with the longstanding deficits in the budget balance and the external current account, the economy had fully exhausted its buffers by early 2022 as it was straddled by a myriad of vulnerabilities that emanated from both global and domestic sources\u201d. CBSL Annual Report 2022",
    "In this background, the country\u2019s debt repayment burden was declared unsustainable in April 2022 and proceedings were initiated to seek International Monetary Fund (IMF) help via financing the acute balance of payments deficit. In this process, it is necessary to arrive at a consensus with creditors that repayment relief will be afforded to Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) by their debt holders to enable repayment to commence within sensible repayment capacity limits that do not result in social strife and political disruption.",
    "The management of this process including priorities of the GoSL through their agents, the IMF expectations and all public debt holders is admittedly difficult given the diversity of interests. However, the lack of transparency in the negotiations with the SLBA member bank consortium is unhelpful.",
    "The banks believe that all stakeholders involved in structuring the restoration of Sri Lanka\u2019s Balance of Payments to a sustainable equilibrium must necessarily take a careful look at the resulting outcomes \u2013 impact to the banking sector capital and liquidity in a potential Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR) and minimise the risk to the sector. A further escalation of the situation we are in must be avoided.",
    "It must be borne in mind always that the banking sector will have to play an active role in Sri Lanka\u2019s economic revival process. The sector Capital Adequacy Ratios (CAR) and Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR) are presently within the regulatory requirements. This position must not be depleted through any action including a debt restructuring that threatens the stability of banks and erodes public confidence.",
    "Banks have asked for clarity on what is meant by \u201cvoluntary\u201d debt optimization, is there a non-voluntary element and to whom does this apply (limited to the larger Treasury Bills / Treasury -Bond holders such as the superannuation and pension funds and state-owned Banks), more disclosure on proposed Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) and International Sovereign Bond (ISB) re-structuring terms, what is the IMF\u2019s view of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth prospects over the duration of the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and whether proposed DDO  would resemble the experience of some other countries who have taken this route before us.",
    "Banks have consistently supported the GoSL and CBSL\u2019s efforts over the years through severe economic hardship that led to both public anxiety and political upheaval reflected in crises especially in recent times with debt repayment moratoriums, rescheduling of viable businesses and necessary recovery arrangements on generally disadvantageous terms predicated by the many incidents of inclement weather, post Easter Sunday 2019 attacks, Covid-19 pandemic, political, and social unrest. Credit impairments have hit an all-time high hitherto unseen. Taking further impairment costs on top of these strains on Capital and Liquidity is not sustainable specially with the tax deductibility of these necessary costs of being in business being uncertain.",
    "The banks reiterate that maintaining stability of the banking system is paramount at this time when extremely difficult decisions are being made."
