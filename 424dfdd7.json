    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka's Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera told reporters on Monday (17) that China had made a request for Sri Lanka's toque macaque monkeys.",
    "Amaraweera said that the decision to export toque macaque monkeys was made in order to control the monkey population in the country, in accordance to international standards.",
    "The Minister said that three rounds of discussions took place, and a cabinet memorandum will be prepared in due course to seek approval for the exports.",
    "He said a committee consisting of officers from the relevant ministries will decide whether the toque macaque monkeys will be delivered to China, or not.",

    "These organization point out that there are only 18 zoos in China that could accommodate toque macaque monkeys and according to the proposed scheme one zoo would have to accommodate approximately 5000 toque macaque monkeys.",
    "They stress that, therefore, the claim that these monkeys are exported to be placed at zoos in China is unacceptable.",
    "The organization question the ethical nature of this proposed program, and request that a proper study be conducted with the participation of qualified researchers and scientists.",
