    "Relatives were still recovering the charred bodies and limbs of victims killed in a military airstrike on a village in central Myanmar Wednesday, a day after one of the deadliest attacks since the junta seized power in a coup two years ago.",
    "An eyewitness, who hid in a tunnel during the attack, described a scene of horror as he approached the site of the military airstrike \u2013 of children dying, women screaming, and bodies heaped on the ground.",
    "At least 133 people, including women and children, were killed after Myanmar\u2019s military junta bombed Kanbalu township in the central Sagaing region on Tuesday, the human rights minister of the ousted shadow National Unity Government Aung Myo Min told CNN.",
    "First responders and medical teams haven\u2019t been able to return to the site of the attack because military planes have continued flying over the town, though there have been no further strikes, said Aung Myo Min.",
    "At least 20 children were killed in the strike and 50 people injured, according to the Kyunhla activist group, which was at the scene.",
    "About 300 people had gathered in Pazigyi Village early on Tuesday morning to celebrate the opening of a local administration office, an eyewitness told CNN on the condition of anonymity because he fears retribution.",
    "Families had traveled from nearby villages for the event, where tea and food was offered and which coincided with the start of the Thingyan New Year celebrations.",
    "Like much of Sagaing, the area is not under the control of the military junta. The new town office was being opened under the authority of the shadow National Unity Government (NUG), for the people, as part of the anti-junta resistance.",
    "\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any warning,\u201d the eyewitness said. \u201cMost of the villagers were inside the event, so they didn\u2019t notice the jet.\u201d",
    "Just before 8 a.m., a junta aircraft bombed the village where the ceremony was being held, the eyewitness and local media reported. An Mi35 helicopter then circled and fired on the village minutes later, the eyewitness told CNN.",
    "\u201cWhen I arrived at the scene we tried to search for people still alive,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything was terrible. People were dying (as they were being transported) on motorbikes. Children and women. Some lost their heads, limbs, hands. I saw flesh on the road.\u201d",
    "The eyewitness said he saw dozens of bodies after the attack, including children as young as five. He said he lost four family members in the strike, and a young child from his village was among the dead.",
    "\u201cI saw lots of people coming onto the scene to search for their kids, crying and screaming,\u201d he said.",
    "At around 5:30 p.m. the junta jets returned and shot the same place they had bombed that morning, he said.",
    "CNN cannot independently verify the incident but the eyewitness\u2019s account matches reports in local media and from the NUG.",
    "Videos and images from the aftermath, shown to CNN from witnesses and a local activist group, also show bodies, some burned and in pieces, as well as destroyed buildings, vehicles and debris.",
    "Myanmar\u2019s junta spokesman Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun confirmed the airstrike on Pazigyi Village and said if civilian casualties occurred it was because they were forced to help \u201cterrorists.\u201d",
    "The junta has designated the NUG and resistance groups known as the People\u2019s Defense Force in the country as terrorists.",
    "\u201cAt 8 a.m\u2026. NUG (National Unity Government) and PDF (People\u2019s Defense Force) conducted an opening ceremony of the public administration office at Pazigyi village,\u201d Zaw Min Tun said on the military\u2019s Myawaddy TV channel.",
    "\u201cWe had launched the attack on them. We were informed that PDF were killed at that event under the attack. They are opposing our government.\u201d",
    "The strike was condemned internationally, with one top UN official saying global indifference to the situation in Myanmar contributed to the attack.",
    "\u201cThe Myanmar military\u2019s attacks against innocent people, including today\u2019s airstrike in Sagaing, is enabled by world indifference and those supplying them with weapons,\u201d said Tom Andrews, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar.",
    "\u201cHow many Myanmar children need to die before world leaders take strong, coordinated action to stop this carnage?\u201d",
    "The US Department of State said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the airstrikes and called on the regime to \u201ccease the horrific violence.\u201d",
    "\u201cThese violent attacks further underscore the regime\u2019s disregard for human life and its responsibility for the dire political and humanitarian crisis in Burma following the February 2021 coup,\u201d it said, using an alternative name for Myanmar.",
    "It\u2019s been just over two years since the military seized power, ousting the democratically elected government and jailing its leader Aung San Suu Kyi.",
    "In order to crush resistance, the junta regularly carries out airstrikes and ground attacks on what it calls \u201cterrorist\u201d targets.",
    "The attacks have killed civilians, including children, and targeted schools, clinics, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure.",
    "Whole villages have been burned by junta soldiers and thousands of people have been displaced in the attacks, according to local monitoring groups.",
    "Battles between the military and resistance groups unfold daily across Myanmar.",
    "These rebel groups, some of whom have aligned with some of the country\u2019s long-established ethnic militias, effectively control parts of the country out of the junta\u2019s reach.",
    "Resistance groups and humanitarian organizations have repeatedly accused Myanmar\u2019s military of carrying out mass killings, air strikes and war crimes against civilians in the regions where fighting has raged, charges the junta repeatedly denies \u2013 despite a growing body of evidence.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re losing control of the country. They\u2019re losing ground. Things are much more unstable on the ground than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d the UN\u2019s Andrews told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cAs a result of that, they\u2019re using air power more and more and, of course, as they do so, more and more civilians are being killed.\u201d",
    "On Monday, junta airstrikes hit a town in western Chin state\u2019s Falam Township, killing nine people when bombs dropped on a school, according to local media Myanmar Now and The Irrawaddy.",
    "Last week, 8,000 refugees in southern Karen state fled across the border to Thailand, escaping fighting in Myawaddy township, according to a statement from Thailand\u2019s Tak provincial office public relations department, posted to Facebook.",
    "In March, at least 22 people, including three monks, were killed at a monastery in southern Shan state. And a military airstrike on a school in Sagaing in September killed at least 13 people, including seven children.",
    "The eyewitness to Tuesday\u2019s attack said the \u201csituation in Myanmar is worse now.\u201d",
    "\u201cPeople are dying like dogs or cows. We don\u2019t have any weapons to compare with what the military has. We need the help of the international community,\u201d he said."
