    "Bloomberg: Pakistan\u2019s and Sri Lanka\u2019s decades-high borrowing costs will be on spotlight Tuesday as elevated inflation persists and debt troubles linger.",
    "Monetary conditions in Pakistan and Sri Lanka are already the tightest in decades \u2014 25 years and 21 years respectively \u2014 to rein in Asia\u2019s fastest inflation rates stoked by debt crises and funding woes. Latest prints showing stubborn price pressures may spur more tightening.",
    "Thirty-four of 37 economists in a Bloomberg survey expect a hike ranging from 100-300 basis points for Pakistan, while three forecast a hold in the target rate as of Monday. State Bank of Pakistan is expected to announce the decision around 4pm local time.",
    "In Sri Lanka, seven of eight economists expect the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to keep the standing lending facility rate at 16.5 percent at 4:45 pm in Colombo after a surprise increase last month, with Citigroup Inc. predicting another 100-basis-point hike.",
    "\u201cWith fiscal policy still a little too loose in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, higher interest rates will shoulder the burden of countering inflation and establishing at least one leg of policy credibility,\u201d said Hasnain Malik, a strategist at Tellimer in Dubai who expects further increases in both. \u201cGlobal fuel and food prices have come down but this may not be evident yet in Pakistan and Sri Lanka,\u201d said Hasnain who declined to provide specific estimates on the hikes.",
    "While some relief may be in sight for Sri Lanka after securing a $3 billion International Monetary Fund loan program last month, the road to turning the troubled economy around remains rocky as debt issues hang. Pakistan is teetering on a debt default as the IMF bailout is in limbo.",
    "In approving Sri Lanka\u2019s loan, the IMF said it wants to see headline inflation slow to the 4-6 percent band by early 2025 and that the central bank must be ready to adjust its policy stance as needed.",
    "While price gains eased in March, they remained about 50 percent, putting CBSL Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe\u2019s forecast for the gauge to cool to \u201cmid-single digits\u201d by year-end at risk. The central bank, at its March meeting noted \u201csome differences between the CBSL and IMF staff on the inflation outlook.\u201d The bailout, said Weerasinghe, will help lower the premium the market demands when lending to the government as Sri Lanka can use part of the IMF loan for state spending.",
    "Still, the IMF will probably want to see a \u201cnarrowing of the gap\u201d between policy and market interest rates, according to Johanna Chua, chief economist at Citigroup Global Markets, who expects another one percentage hike on Tuesday. Sri Lanka\u2019s three-month government bill yield hovers at about 26% against the 16.5 percent benchmark rate.",
    "How Sri Lanka\u2019s debt restructuring will turn out is a wait-and-see. While it\u2019s set to unveil a restructuring strategy by end-April and President Ranil Wickremesinghe expects debt talks to be concluded before the IMF\u2019s first program review in the coming months, there are ongoing issues on the extent of local creditor involvement in the exercise.",
    "Pakistan\u2019s IMF loan program is yet to materialize months after it raised taxes and energy prices and allowed the currency to depreciate to meet the Fund\u2019s conditions. The nation has missed multiple deadlines to resume its $6.5 billion bailout.",
    "Pakistan is waiting on IMF aid to avoid default. The lender has required tax increases and energy-price hikes that are fueling inflation \u2013 and necessitating higher rates that will further crimp growth. More rate hikes won\u2019t directly reduce the upward price pressure generated by the government\u2019s austerity measures, but they should help contain inflation by suppressing second-round impacts from higher food and energy prices, according to Ankur Shukla and Abhishek Gupta, economists at Bloomberg.",
    "Pakistan\u2019s inflation quickened by a record last month, beating the median estimate and setting the stage for another jumbo increase on Tuesday.",
    "While foreign exchange reserves have risen to $4.24 billion after China committed $2 billion in loans but it still covers only about one month of imports. Pakistan needs to repay about $3 billion of debt by June. The Washington-based lender has asked Pakistan to seek commitments from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates before it revives the bailout, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar told the parliament last week.",
    "\u201cPolicymakers will also be keen to impress the IMF, by displaying their commitment towards containing inflation, in order to secure a much-needed funding to mitigate the risk of default and raise the dangerously low level of foreign-exchange reserves,\u201d said Shivaan Tandon of Capital Economics, which expects a 200-basis-point hike Tuesday.",

    "Higher income groups need to take more of the burden to protect the poor and vulnerable \u2013 World Bank",
