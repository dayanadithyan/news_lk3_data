    "Asks Govt. to give candidates temporary relief from loan repayments",
    "Urges President to take a decision on the candidates within the week and provide necessary relief",
    "Says President must adhere to the precedent set regarding State sector employees when the Elpitiya local council elections were postponed in 2018",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress leader Dullas Alahapperuma has written to President Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking relief for over 3000 State sector employees who submitted nominations to contest at the Local Government polls on 21st January after obtaining seven weeks of unpaid leave for the purpose.",
    "The MP noted that the continuous delays in conducting polls have now left these candidates representing 48 recognised political parties including the United National Party (UNP) led by Wickremesinghe to face serious difficulties.",
    "\u201cIt is certain that it was their desire to set the example of devoting themselves to public service for a period of seven weeks without pay, whichever party they represented,\u201d he said adding that however, the decision to hold elections on 25th April is once again in limbo.",
    "\u201cIt is unnecessary to remind you as the Minister of Finance that the amount deposited in the treasury by these candidates is close to Rs. 10.5 million. But the loss of even the basic salary for many months while paying loan instalments to various financial institutions including housing loans is a devastating tragedy in their service history,\u201d he said.",
    "Alahapperuma called on the President to go by the precedent set regarding State sector employees when the Elpitiya local council elections were postponed in 2018. He asked the President to reach a decision on the candidates within this week.",
    "Alahapperuma proposed that as the first phase of providing relief to the candidates employed by the State, they should be given a temporary respite from repaying loan instalments. The MP said the candidates undoubtedly deserve respect and gratitude from the State for their commitment to democracy and not humiliation or disrespect."
