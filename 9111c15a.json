    "It is unfortunate that there is no one to take responsibility for the Easter Sunday attack though four years have gone since the mayhem, a prominent Buddhist monk said yesterday.",
    "Speaking during a ceremony held to mark the 4th anniversary of the Easter Sunday attack Sangha Nayaka of Southern Province Venerable Omalpe Sobitha Thera said the failure to find\u00a0out those who are responsible for the Easter Sunday attack is a violation of Buddhist Principles.\u201cbuddha preached that it is the responsibility of the rulers to see that justice is meted\u00a0out to them,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka is the only country in the globe where rulers steal public funds openly, \u201ca prominent Buddhist monk said yesterday. Episodes with regard to the Xpress Pearl incident had proved\u00a0that rulers of this country steal public funds openly.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is also the only country where rulers are lethargic when it comes to meting out justice. This is evident when one considers how rulers dealt with the probes on Easter Sunday\u00a0attacks,\u201d he said.",
    "Moulavi Abdul Rahman Hashim in his speech alleged that some devotees who were going to participate in Ifthar prayers at Galle face were prevented while even Catholics who were\u00a0marching from Negombo to Colombo were prevented from singing hymns.",
    "\u201cIt looks like the authorities seem to think that people living in this country including Buddhists, Muslims and\u00a0Hindus are violent people. It seems that this is why they are trying to bring in draconian laws to suppress rights,\u201d he added. (Yohan Perera)"
