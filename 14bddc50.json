    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s President Ranil Wickremesinghe is to meet China\u2019s Finance Minister at a meeting of Group of 20 country in India on Friday as the International Monetary Fund is making a last ditch attempt to get Asian nation to conform to debt re-structuring framework.",
    "\u201cDuring the meeting it is expected to look into how to restructure the debt of countries whose economies have collapsed,\u201d President Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying at a meeting in the hill city of Kandy.",
    "\u201cThere, I hope to discuss the debt restructuring method of Sri Lanka with the Chinese Finance Minister. As per their stand, we have two or three options to implement.\u201d",
    "Among options the IMF has is to take China\u2019s \u201clight assurance\u201d and proceed with executive board approval.",
    "Another is to put in a \u201cmost favoured creditor clause\u201d to the debt re-structuring deals of India and Paris Club to make sure that they get the same treatment in case China is given better terms.",
    "China has given Sri Lanka a two year debt moratorium so the that there is no official arrears to the country at the moment and agreed to discuss further re-structuring within the period.",
    "But the IMF wants specific commitment to re-structure debt along the parametres of a debt-sustainability analysis which sets ceilings on annual debt roll-overs and new borrowings called the gross financing need, which China has not given.",
    "Several countries with intermediate monetary regimes whose currencies collapse due to artificially low policy rate rates including Ghana, Zambia and Surinam had defaulted with Chinese debt and private commercial debt as Latin America had done earlier.",
    "A so-called \u2018debt round table\u2019 with the Western lenders including the US, IMF, World Bank, China and India is expected to take place in Bangalore on February 25, after virtual meeting held last Friday.",
    "China meanwhile had called for multilateral agencies like the World Bank, IMF and Asian Development \u2013 which as senior creditors do not usually give debt relief \u2013 to re-structure their own loans.",
    "\u201cThe Export-Import Bank of China has already provided Sri Lanka with a letter to express support for its debt sustainability,\u201d  Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said this week.",
    "\u201cThe letter says that the Bank is going to provide an extension on the debt service due in 2022 and 2023, which means Sri Lanka will not have to repay the principal and interest due of the Bank\u2019s loans during the above-mentioned period, so as to help relieve Sri Lanka\u2019s short-term debt repayment pressure.",
    "\u201cMeanwhile, the Bank would like to have friendly consultation with Sri Lanka regarding medium- and long-term debt treatment in this window period; and the Bank will make best efforts to contribute to the debt sustainability of Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cThe Bank also noted that it will support Sri Lanka in its loan application to the IMF; in the meantime, the Bank will continuously call on commercial creditors (including the International Sovereign Bondholders) to provide debt treatment in an equally comparable manner, and encourage multilateral creditors to do their utmost to make corresponding contributions.\u201d",
    "Private creditors have also expressed dis-satisfaction at \u2018pessimistic\u2019 forecasts in IMF, Debt Sustainability Analyses.",
    "President Wickremesinghe said on Sri Lanka had now completed 15 actions required by the IMF to start its 2.9 billion dollar loan, including a steep hike in electricity prices from February 15.",
    "IMF bailout countries with intermediate regime central banks (so-called flexible exchange rates) have to make never ending energy price hike after each currency collapse.",
    "\u201cAll 15 tasks assigned to us have been completed,\u201d Wickremesinghe said. \u201cNow is the up to the International Monetary Fund.\u201d",
    "Countries with intermediate regime central banks or soft-pegs with high domestic inflation targets (usually 5 percent or higher) keep going to the IMF again and again with currency crises. (Colombo/Feb22/2023)"
