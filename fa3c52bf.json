    "Accordingly, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has accepted the task of conducting a corporate social responsibility (CSR) program and has already spent Rs. 220 million to carry out development programs.",
    "However, Rs. 6.6 million had to be spent on the repairs carried out to the Galle Face Green due to damages caused during the 'Aragalaya' period.",
    "There have been complaints that though the Galle Face Green areas were meant for the public to spend their leisure hours peacefully, the grounds had been used to conduct musical shows, rallies etc. and the gathering of large numbers of people had damaged the beauty of green.",
    "Therefore, a Cabinet decision was taken not to permit the above activities at the Galle Face Green. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
