    "The Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) today said that the daily payment assigned for examiners to check the 2022 GCE Advanced Level (A/L) must increase to Rs.3,000.",
    "CTU Secretary Joseph Stalin said today that the daily payment of Rs 2,000 sanctioned for checking the answer scripts is not enough.",
    "However, the minister had agreed to increase the daily payment for correcting examination answer scripts to Rs.3,000 through a cabinet paper, he said.",
    "But the daily allowance was limited to Rs.2,000. Therefore, the ministry should pay more attention towards the exams of the children, and it will cause a delay in releasing results for the total examination system, Stalin said.",
    "\"Teachers are in favour of continuing with the examination activities. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic and the time when the issue was created by the government, teachers used to contribute without any charges,\" he said.",
    "It is relevant to provide the daily charges approved by the minister, and it will help ease the issue with releasing examination results, Stalin said.",
    "Even the examinations department knows that the announced payments are not enough. Therefore, the government should intervene in the issue, he added.",
    "However, the examination department has again called for applications to recruit examiners to check the answer scripts of the A/L examination.",
    "Accordingly, the examination department said that the examiners will be recruited online until March 8.",
    "The department further stated that if the commencement of the evaluation process is delayed, the release of A/L results would also be delayed. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
