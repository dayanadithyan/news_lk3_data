    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka signed an agreement with RM Parks Inc., in collaboration with Shell for a long-term contract for the importation, storage, distribution, & sale of petroleum products in Sri Lanka.",
    "The signing of the agreement took place following the recommendations of the Cabinet Appointed Special Committee.",
    "The President's Media Division said that the Contract Agreement was signed a short while ago at the President's Office in Colombo.",
    "On the 22nd of May 2023, a contract agreement was signed with Sinopec, a leading international petroleum company.",

This development brings hope for a more stable and reliable fuel supply, boosting the country\u2019s energy sector and providing assurance to consumers.",
    "In response to the on-going foreign exchange crisis in Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Power and Energy has taken this decisive action to ensure an uninterrupted fuel supply to consumers. With the inability to provide sufficient foreign exchange for fuel shipments, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) faced significant challenges.",
    "To tackle this issue, the Ministry explored various strategies and one of them involved inviting Expression of Interests (EOIs) from reputable petroleum companies established in producing countries.
