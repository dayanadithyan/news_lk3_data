    "MP Indunil who raised a question said egg prices have gone up due to prices of other substitute foods such as meat, fish, dried fish and canned fish gone up and added that in order to reduce high demand for eggs, prices of substitute foods should be reduced.",
    "Minister Nalin Fernando said egg prices have not been reduced whereas the raw materials used for egg production have gone down during the last seven to eight months and added that eggs have to be imported to meet the shortage in the market.",
    "\"Prices of most goods have been reduced for the last seven to eight months. Only the egg prices have not been reduced whereas the cost of raw materials have gone down,\" he said.",

    "The Minister said some people had claimed that imported eggs have been tested on army personnel and refuting the allegation said no egg has been imported so far and said legal action would be taken against those who spread such rumours.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
