    "The Royal-Thomian or the Battle of the Blues, the world\u2019s second oldest uninterrupted cricket battle, will unveil for the 144th consecutive year this week. The encounter pits the boys bearing the crests of the Elephant and Palm Tree against those bearing the Cross and Dove.",
    "The Royal-Thomian is in many ways greater and more epic than the three matches that can be most favorably compared to it: St Peters \u2013 Prince Alfred in Australia, Eton \u2013 Harrow in Britain, and the Ashes. This is particularly so in the annals of schoolboy cricket in Sri Lanka. Indeed, the history of Sri Lankan cricket cannot be written without the Battle of the Blues.",
    "Chandana Panditharathna once observed, \u201cThe magic of the match has been retained through colonialism, world wars, independence, nationalism and yes, even terrorism.\u201d Recently the tradition continued despite the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis.",
    "How did it all begin? An old boy of Westminster College and a graduate of the University of Cambridge came to the Colombo Academy in 1876 as a mathematics tutor. Soon he was appointed as Boarding Master at the school. This well experienced person sacrificed his time and expended his energy to develop cricket there. Having achieved his aim, he wrote a letter to the Sub Warden of S. Thomas\u2019 College, suggesting an inter-collegiate encounter.",
    "This talented tutor and cricketer, who initiated the big tradition, was Ashley Walker. He would later be called the Father of Ceylonese cricket.Though the first official encounter between the two schools was held in 1880, clashes between representatives of the two institutions had been held earlier.",
    "The match between the Colombo Academy and the College of St. Thomas the Apostle, Mutwal was known as \u201cAcademy vs. College Match\u201d those days. After playing several matches at the Slave Island Green, in 1879 the first fully recorded fixture was held at Galle Face.",
    "The Colombo Academy was then captained by Ashley Walker and the College of St. Thomas the Apostle was captained by Reverend S. J. Meyrick. Archibald Campbell of the Academy and the Reverend W. Falkner of the College also played as masters.",
    "The two teams travelled by canoes through the Beira Lake with their gear. The Principal of Colombo Academy, John Barnabas Cull, declared a half day holiday. On that occasion, the Academy won the toss and elected to bat. The openers were de Silva and Van Cuylenburg. The Academy emerged as the winner, grabbing all six stumps.",
    "The first official encounter took place in 1880 with only students. The Academy Team was captained by J. W. Silva and the College Team by F. W. McDonell. The Academy managed to retain victory with a 62-run lead. Since then, it has been a journey of success, a journey of friendly rivalry.",
    "After giving birth to the island\u2019s oldest cricket encounter, Walker proposed an encounter between the Ceylonese and local British officials, an episode that Nicholas Brookes has referred to in his book, \u201cAn Island\u2019s Eleven.\u201d 10 out of the 11 in the Team he founded came from either Royal or S. Thomas\u2019. One can even consider this as the island\u2019s first national cricket team.",
    "Malinda Seneviratne once observed that \u201cthe Royal-Thomian was not just a big match. It was THE BIG MATCH.\u201d In 1979, this historical tradition celebrated its centenary. The Royal Team played under the captaincy of Ranjan Madugalle (who captained the Sri Lanka Team) and the S. Thomas\u2019 Team played under the captaincy of Johan Peiris. It was after this that permission to hold the encounter for three days was granted, by the then President J. R. Jayewardene.",
    "After Galle Face Green, the encounter was hosted in eventual succession at the Nomads Cricket Club in Victoria Park, the Colombo Oval, the Nondescript Cricket Club, and the Sinhalese Sports Club. Traditionally, the match has been played on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.",
    "The encounter has produced some of the country\u2019s most prestigious personalities. The first Premier of Ceylon, D. S. Senanayake, captained the S. Thomas\u2019 team in 1901 and 1902. The Senanayake Challenge Shield, as it came to be called then, was first played in 1928. In addition, the first Executive President of Sri Lanka, J. R. Jayewardene, played for Royal in 1925.",
    "The Big Match season is one of the most anticipated periods in the Sri Lankan school calendar. The season consists of the Battle of the Blues, the Mini Battle, the Royal College Prefects vs S. Thomas\u2019 College Prefects Match, the Teachers vs Prefects Match, the Cycle Parade, and others.",
    "Of these the Cycle Parade occupies a special place among Royalists. Although there isn\u2019t much information about its origins, there are reports that it was well established even in 1939. Back then it was only a \u201cCycle\u201d Parade. Later, after the 1970s, it became a grand procession.",
    "This blue-ribbon event in the school cricket calendar, the Great Inter-Collegiate Match, is ready to celebrate its 144th milepost. As Mervyn Casie Chetty once wrote, \u201cIn yearly friendly tussle \u2013 With rival tough and keen \u2013 The teams strain never and muscle \u2013 But fight the issue clean.\u201d What one can look forward to in this encounter is celebration \u2013 not of victory, but of friendly rivalry.",
