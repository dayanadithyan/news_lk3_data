    "Recalls Harisson left Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2019 when he lost power",
    "SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara says no SJB member will leave along with Harrison",
    "Former Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Mujibur Rahman yesterday suggested that party Vice President P. Harrison left the party to join President Ranil Wickremesinghe in search of greener pastures.",
    "\u201cThere is talk of new governors being appointed. He has now suddenly decided to extend his support to Ranil Wickremesinghe. Perhaps he hopes he will be appointed as a governor,\u201d Rahman said.",
    "Rahman noted that Harrison abandoned Wickremesinghe when he lost power in 2019. \u201cNow how can he sing praises of the same Ranil when he is President?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe do not understand this. But what we do understand is that he has joined to either obtain a position as a governor, a chairman or a director of a Government agency,\u201d he added.",
    "Meanwhile, commenting on Harrison\u2019s defection, SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara opined that one cannot be successful in politics by crossing over.",
    "On Sunday Harrison announced his decision to resign from all posts in the party to rejoin his former political party, the United National Party (UNP) and extend his unconditional support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. He also revealed that many other SJB members will also follow suit shortly.",
    "He claimed he was unsatisfied with SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa\u2019s leadership and was therefore leaving the party. Madduma Bandara said when Harrison joined the SJB in 2019 he made similar remarks about UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cNo pradeshiya sabha members of the SJB will leave the party with Harrison as claimed. All grassroots-level public representatives and supporters are with the SJB,\u201d he said. Madduma Bandara opined that Harrison was committing political suicide by rejoining the UNP. \u201cHe has made an incorrect decision,\u201d he noted."
