  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka rupee currency hit the international headlines after it became the World\u2019s best performing currency last week for a short period after gaining around 15 percent within just seven trading sessions. However, since then it has fallen gradually amid speculations.",
    "The rupee, which fell over 50 percent last year to 360 against the US dollar from around 200, was one of the world\u2019s worst performing currencies in 2022.",
    "Here are the facts about the rupee\u2019s surprise rise and then fall including the outlook for this year:",
    "The rupee started to appreciate from its usual 360 level against the US dollar on February 28 after an announcement from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank\u2019s financial arm, that it will provide Sri Lanka with a $400 million cross-currency swap facility to help fund essential imports through three private banks. However, the facility will be spread throughout one year at a rate of $100 million per quarter.",
    "That along with the increasing signs of Sri Lanka getting the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board\u2019s approval for a $2.9 billion loan made dollar holders worry over possible sharp appreciation of the currency. Many expect the rupee to rise soon after the IMF approves the loan on Monday (20).",
    "Market analysts say many Sri Lankans including exporters have been holding onto dollars expecting the rupee to depreciate after the government relaxes import ban which is now in place and starts to repay foreign loans after the debt restructuring process is over following the IMF deal. However, with the rupee\u2019s suddenly rising, analysts say these dollar holders \u201cgot panicked\u201d and started to sell their holdings just to avoid huge loss in the event of a sustained sharp appreciation.",
    "The dollar liquidity in the market since February 28 had been significantly high because the central bank relaxed a 15 percent surrendering rule for banks. This means commercial banks selling 15 percent of exporter dollar proceeds was not mandatory anymore. As a result of sharp appreciation fears, exporters started to sell the US currency and that led to the rupee appreciation.",
    "The central bank also widened its range of dollar trade from 2.50 rupees to 10 rupees during this time, signalling somewhat market determined rate within a large trading band.",
    "Importers stopped buying dollars as they adopted a wait and see approach until they saw the bottom of the currency while the market saw panic selling from exporters.",
    "Another decision that prompted exporters to sell their dollars was the central bank\u2019s surprise decision to increase the policy interest rates by 100 basis points on April 3.",
    "Some exporters are used to managing their local expenses through rupee borrowing while holding into dollars. But the central bank\u2019s latest tight monetary policy move compelled these exporters to sell their dollars because the rupee borrowing is expensive now.",
    "This is in addition to the central bank\u2019s decision to debunk a fixed peg it had maintained for a long time and operate an ad hoc peg from March 7 with the monetary authority intervening in foreign exchange markets from time to time without a pre-announced rate.",
    "There were some research reports calling foreign investors to invest in Sri Lanka\u2019s government bonds as well.",
    "And the rupee appreciated to around 315 per dollar on March 9 from 360 within seven trading sessions, making it the best performing currency in the world, Bloomberg reported.",
    "The main beneficiary of this surprise appreciation was the central bank which bought more than $500 million to build the country\u2019s depleted reserves.",
    "Analysts say the rupee could have appreciated to 275 against dollar if not for the central bank\u2019s buying.",
    "Since the rupee appreciated to 312 rupees a dollar on March 9, the sentiments changed due to some comments from a rating agency and analysts.",
    "Fitch Ratings in a report said the rupee appreciation was temporary and the currency will retreat back to 390 rupees a dollar.",
    "Along with that many local analysts also said the appreciation was due to the absence of foreign debt repayment and import ban.",
    "Sri Lanka does not have to repay any bilateral or commercial foreign loans as it has declared sovereign debt default in April last year. Monthly imports have almost halved due to strict import ban on which the European Union has raised concerns citing they are against the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.",
    "Many exporters and dollar holders stopped converting the US currency after the Fitch and analysts\u2019 comments on the rupee.",
    "As a result, the rupee started to depreciate again and traded around 338 levels on Friday (17).",
    "Analysts say the rupee\u2019s recent appreciation is temporary and the central bank can hardly sustain it at the appreciated level.",
    "However, many currency dealers in the treasuries of private banks see the rupee stabilizing between 350-370 in the second quarter of this year in the absence of significant increase in imports and foreign debt repayments.",
    "\u201cThere is going to be a sharp increase in foreign remittances this month and April due to Sinhala and Tamil new year as well as Ramzan festival coming in the same month. That will help the currency to stabilize at a level close to the current level,\u201d a senior dealer said, asking not to be named.",
    "\u201cBut import ban must continue for that. If imports start to pick, then the rupee will definitely depreciate.\u201d",
    "Analysts also say the timing of foreign loan repayments after the debt restructuring process and the conditions of debt restructuring will also have an impact on the value of the currency against the dollar.",
    "However, they say the debt restructuring process will take some time and foreign debt repayment will start only after lengthy restructuring negotiation. (Colombo/March17/2023)"
