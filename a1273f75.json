    "We have never had any outstanding all-girl bands, in the local scene, except, perhaps\u2026yes The Planets, and that was decades ago!",
    "The Planets did make a name for themselves, and they did create quite a lot of excitement, when they went into action.",
    "Of course, abroad, we had several top all-girl bands \u2013 outfits like the Spice Girls, Bangles, Destiny\u2019s Child, and The Supremes.",
    "Let\u2019s hope we would have something to shout about\u2026with the band Manthra \u2013 an all-girl outfit that came together last year (2022).",
    "Manthra is made up of Hiruni Fernando (leader/bass guitar), Gayathma Liyanage (lead guitar), Amaya Jayarathne (drums), Imeshini Piyumika (keyboards), and Arundathi Hewawitharana (vocals).",
    "Amaya Arundathi and Imeshini are studying at the University of Visual and Performing Arts, while Gayathma is studying Architecture at NIMB, and Hiruni is the Western Music teacher at St. Lawrence\u2019s Convent, and the pianist at Galadari Hotel, having studied piano and classical guitar at West London University.",
    "They have already displayed their talents at various venues, events, weddings, and on TV, as well (Vanithabimana Sirasa TV and Charna TV Art Beat).",
    "Additionally, the band showcased their talent at the talent show held at the Esoft Metro Campus.",
    "The plus factor, where this all-girl outfit is concerned, is that their repertoire is made up rock, pop, and Sinhala songs.",
    "Explaining as to how they came up with the name Manthra, founder member Hiruni said that Manthra means a word, or sound, repeated to aid concentration in meditation, and that the name was suggested by one of the band members.",
    "She also went on to say that putting together a female band is not an easy task, in the scene here.",
    "\u201cWe faced many difficulties in finding members. Some joined and then left, after a short while. Unlike a male band, where there are many male musicians in Sri Lanka, there are only a few female musicians. And then, there are some parents who don\u2019t like their daughters getting involved in music.\u201d",
    "With talented musicians in their line-up, the future certainly looks bright for Manthra who are now keen to project themselves, in an awesome way, in the scene here, and abroad, as well.",
    "\u201cWe are keen to do stage shows and we are also planning to create our own songs,\u201d said Hiruni.",
    "Yes, we need an all-girl group to add variety to our scene that is now turning out to be a kind of \u2018repeating groove,\u2019 where we see, and hear, almost the same thing\u2026over and over again!",
