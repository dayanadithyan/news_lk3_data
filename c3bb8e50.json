    "Amidst talks about a snap presidential election, former Election Commission\u2019s Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday that, in his opinion, such an election could be conducted only during the latter part of next year.",
    "According to the Constitution, the President can, at any time after the expiration of four years from the commencement of his first term of office, declare a presidential election to seek a fresh mandate. This has fueled speculation that a presidential election will be conducted later this year after the completion of four years of the current presidential term.",
    "However, Mr. Deshapriya said the current president had been elected by Parliament only to serve the unexpired term of the ongoing presidential term after the resignation of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "Making his remarks to Daily Mirror, Mr. Deshapriya said, \u201cAfter resignation of the elected president, the succeeding president has to serve the rest of the period. He cannot go for a snap election according to my view. Still, there is another argument put forward by some legal luminaries that even the succeeding president has such authority to declare a presidential election after four years. The Supreme Court has to be moved to get the correct interpretation.\u201d the current president had been elected by Parliament only to serve the unexpired term of the ongoing presidential term after the resignation of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.(Kelum Bandara)"
