    "PTA is an outdated law. We welcome govt. and President\u2019s announcement that they are going to overhaul and repeal the old PTA",
    "As the largest shareholder in the IMF, the US wants to continue to support Sri Lanka in its reform path.",
    "We hope the new Anti-Terrorism Act meets international standards and norms and really addresses the needs of the Sri Lankan people",
    "US Ambassador Julie J. Chung speaks to Daily Mirror in her first interview with the print media about the current status of bilateral ties and the way forward after the arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "Q So, Ambassador, the United States of America helped Sri Lanka to get this IMF arrangement approved. In addition to that the US helped Sri Lanka through its development arm USAID to recover from this economic crisis. So what will be the future of our bilateral relationship?",
    "I\u2019m proud to say this year we\u2019re commemorating the 75-year anniversary of the Sri Lankan-US relationship, and it\u2019s really a strong, enduring partnership. This year\u2019s theme is people, progress and partnership. So in that light, we were very happy to support Sri Lanka during the past year, particularly during the hardships and providing over $270 million in assistance. It included everything from fertilizer to paddy farmers, school lunch programs, supporting small and medium enterprises, and SMEs owned by women as well as vocational training. We want to see Sri Lanka prosper and stabilize throughout this very difficult challenging period. So we want to show that we are standing side by side with the Sri Lankan people during this time.",
    "The IMF was a big piece of that, of course, as Sri Lanka decided to go to the IMF. We welcomed that decision because IMF has the right tools and resources to help a country recover. And we were happy to see the countries, the major bilateral lenders give their financing assurances. There\u2019s more work to be done, but I think as the largest shareholder in the IMF we want to continue to support Sri Lanka in its reform path.",
    "Q The first tranche has been released to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has shown signs of recovery. But it\u2019s too early for us to celebrate, there is a long way for us to go. We have to do debt restructuring and implementation of reforms. In what ways will the U.S. support Sri Lanka in the future?",
    "IMF was the first step but not the only step of course. There are many, many ways that the US will continue to support Sri Lanka. And going beyond the IMF immediate program, Sri Lanka has gone through IMF programs in the past, this is really an opportunity for the Sri Lankan government to look at what structural reforms it can really implement for lasting economic health. What kind of issues can it improve in transparency, in anti-corruption measures? So we are continuing to help in terms of public financial management, and capacity building, as well as supporting through SMEs training, and hopefully additional financing from the Development Finance Corporation to energize the SME sectors and bring investors back into Sri Lanka.",
    "Q How can Sri Lanka reciprocate this assistance? How do you expect Sri Lanka to reciprocate?",
    "We are assisting because Sri Lanka is a good friend of the United States. We ask for nothing in return. We want to see a stable, democratic, prosperous Sri Lanka. I think seeing a strong partner, seeing a friend in need, we wanted to help fulfil that need. We want to continue to be strong partners together.",
    "Sri Lanka has gone through IMF programs in the past, this is really an opportunity for the Govt to look at what structural reforms it can really implement",
    "We welcomed that decision because IMF has the right tools and resources to help",
    "Q As the Ambassador, what are you planning to do to promote tourism and investments in Sri Lanka?",
    "Let me tell you, I\u2019ve travelled around Sri Lanka in the past year here. I took my parents to Yala and saw their first safari and my first leopard. That was amazing. I hiked Sigiriya and Pidurangala. There\u2019s of course much more to see. But as I experience the beauty of Sri Lanka, I have told my friends and guests to also come. The United States is the fifth largest country to bring tourism into Sri Lanka and we hope that continues to attract more tourists into Sri Lanka. And in other ways. Through USAID\u2019s program, we have a vocational training program called \u2018YouLead\u2019 that helps young people in the tourism sector get the right training to strengthen tourism services.",
    "We\u2019re also helping the Pekoe Trail which is near the tea plantation area, working with the EU and the Sri Lankan Tourism Authority to build up that trail which will attract more tourists to come and enjoy the rich diversity of the hill country.",
    "Q There are some positive signs we see at the moment, at the same time the Sri Lankan political situation is fluid. How important is it for Sri Lanka to have political stability to achieve these targets?",
    "Economic stability and political stability go hand in hand. Economic reforms, political reforms and good governance are so interconnected. So, Sri Lanka continues its steps towards economic reforms, improving fiscal transparency, and addressing corruption through its new anti-corruption bill which has now been tabled. You have to keep in mind the good governance aspect as well. And you want to focus on that. For instance there are new discussions about the new ATA (Anti-Terrorism Act) which should be replacing the PTA (Prevention of Terrorism Act). That\u2019s an outdated law, and we welcome the government\u2019s and the president\u2019s announcement that they are going to overhaul and repeal the old PTA. We really hope that there are robust and genuine consultations, with all the stakeholders as they revise this law. This will have so much impact. It\u2019s such an important law.",
    "This is a pivotal moment in Sri Lanka\u2019s history. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity. So we hope that the government takes time to consider all these different inputs from the different stakeholders and ensure that the new ATA meets international standards and norms and really addresses the needs of the Sri Lankan people.",
    "Q How important is it for Sri Lanka to have Local Government elections, that have already been postponed? Your perspective?",
    "Sri Lanka has a long history of free and fair elections, and elections are a critical component of a well-functioning democracy. So we believe that elections are really important for any democracy, such as Sri Lanka.",
    "Q In recent times a top U.S. Defense official visited Sri Lanka. This has fueled a lot of speculation on whether the U.S. is going to put up a military base here. So the CIA Director General came here. That kind of misinformation and disinformation is going on. What happened actually?",
    "We have several visitors coming to Sri Lanka all the time. We want to engage on a broad range of issues.",
    "We recently also delivered the third Coast Guard cutter in recent months, which has really helped Sri Lanka combat human trafficking, and drug smuggling, in all those different ways.",
    "In terms of the military base, I have said this repeatedly, we have no intention of building a military base.",
    "Q So at the same time, does the US have any intention of reviving the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)?",
    "We have no intention of reviving or reassessing the SOFA Agreement.",
    "Q The U.S. has its Indo-Pacific strategy. It calls for a free and open Indo-Pacific region. China and Russia have evolved their strategy in this regard. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka should stay away from any conflict, between different powers. What have you got to say about this? How acceptable is the Sri Lankan position to the U.S.?",
    "Sri Lanka is such an important country in the Indo-Pacific region. We want to see a stable, prosperous, democratic Indo-Pacific. That means countries that think about their sovereignty, think about a rules-based international order, and freedom of navigation in the open seas. These are all issues and values that are important not only to the United States and Sri Lanka but to all countries in the region.",
    "Just recently the United States partnered with KDU (Kotalawala Defence University) on a book called the shared values of an Indo-Pacific Region and there are many ways that we can partner with Sri Lanka in this effort and really work together to foster these Indo-Pacific values.",
    "Q On the implementation of the UNHRC (United Nations Human Rights Council) resolution. Sri Lanka is going to take another step that is going to introduce a piece of legislation to establish a truth and reconciliation commission. What is your view? What have you got to say about this?",
    "The United States works very closely with our other core group partners in the UN Human Rights Council. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing the proposals of the TRC that the government has talked about after this visit to South Africa. I think what\u2019s important is to show genuine and concrete steps towards reconciliation, whether achieved through the TRC, whether it\u2019s to solidify and strengthen the existing mechanisms and institutions like the OMP.",
    "I think an inclusive society that addresses its past and talks about transitional justice and accountability, are all important for a country\u2019s stability and its future. So we hope that there are concrete steps that address the rights and the concerns of the Sri Lankan people.",
    "We know that there have been several steps recently including the release of many PTA detainees. Also, the release of land in the north, the President has implemented. And the gathering of all national parties that the president has also convened. These are good steps. Good initial steps. Again, we hope that there will be additional concrete measures that show the commitment to long-lasting reconciliation.",
    "Ambassador Chung: I think that\u2019s something the Sri Lankan government needs to do in consultation with all the stakeholders in civil society and business and academia. But I have travelled around Sri Lanka and met with some of the mothers of the missing. And they explain their concerns about not having answers now years after the disappearance of their family members.",
    "I think there can be more done to strengthen and find the right resources and capacities for institutions like the OMP (Office of Missing Persons). There are many other measures that the government can address as talking to the people of the various provinces, and people of all ethnic and religious backgrounds.",
    "You have this rich diversity, but to bring everybody in and to make sure people feel included and a part of the future of Sri Lanka, is one of the ways to address the past.",
    "Ambassador Chung: Yeah, again, this is the 75th anniversary, so it\u2019s a very important year for us to mark. And I\u2019m so proud of the ways that we\u2019re partnering with Sri Lanka in terms of the people-to-people.",
    "We just celebrated the Fulbright 70th anniversary. It sent thousands of people in both directions for educational purposes.",
    "I also see a lot of potential in the Diaspora in the United States. Recently I met a young woman who created a Sri Lankan museum outside of Sri Lanka in New York.",
    "Now she\u2019s coming back and exploring more ways to make those connections real. Also a young Sri Lankan-American man who came back and wanted to start a startup, accelerator program, to help startup businesses get the capital they need.",
    "So there are Diaspora that have the resources, the know-how, the passion, and the interest to come and be the bridges between our two countries. So I believe there\u2019s much potential in making sure those connections expand."
