    "The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) recently opened a Packaging and Testing Centre (PTC) at the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI).",
    "The Centre facilitates testing and consultation on packaging materials for the food and spice sectors, aimed at further strengthening Sri Lanka\u2019s export markets. Chief Guest at the opening was Plantation and Industries Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana.",
    "Managed by the ITI, the PTC is supported by UNIDO and funded by the European Union (EU).",
    "Speaking at the opening EU Ambassador\u00a0 to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Denis Chaibi said: \u201cThe business women and men that I regularly meet in Sri Lanka often confide that one of their main challenges is to find a reliable supplier of quality packaging. A\u00a0 package is not only a marketing tool, it is a business card that tells a lot about a company\u2019s environmental, social and corporate standards. I am therefore keen to open the Packaging Testing Centre today, which will help exporters bring much needed forex to Sri Lanka. The EU finds different ways to support Sri Lankans.\u201d",
    "PTC is being opened to provide services in 12 physical and mechanical tests, for a wide range of packaging materials to satisfy regulatory requirements. UNIDO supported the acquisition of 19 high-tech instruments along with the training of personnel on the instruments by an international expert, used to conduct testing on the performance of packaging materials according to international testing protocols. The materials utilised in packaging will be evaluated on mechanical properties, chemical analysis, environmental impact, and comparison of materials against others. Gaining confidence among food business operators, services from PTC, will be delivered as per applicable regulatory requirements, both locally and abroad.",

    "UNIDO International Senior Technical Specialist Dr. Jairo Villamil-Diaz said: \u201cPackaging is defined as \u2018ensuring safe delivery of a product to its final consumer in very good condition and at a minimum affordable cost\u2019. Globally, packaging is of great importance to both manufacturer and consumer as it prevents spoiling and tampering, protects from outside contamination, and extends shelf life.\u201d",
    "UNIDO supported Sri Lanka in building the capacity of several trade-supported institutions and conformity assessment bodies (CABs) under the framework of the EU Sri Lanka Trade Related Assistance project in 2016-2021. The PTC stands as one of the beneficiaries. Currently, UNIDO together with FAO is implementing another EU funded project titled BESPA-FOOD \u2018Mainstreaming Standard-based best practices for Agri-Food Sector Development\u2019 that aims to contribute to a more productive, sustainable, diversified, climate-resilient, market-oriented, and inclusive agriculture production in Sri Lanka."
