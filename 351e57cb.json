    "I am aware that not having elections is an unpopular view but as time passes a few of us are beginning to wonder whether it is really going to change anything except to tell the Government what it already knows",
    "I really think our forces should keep their tummies from expanding. They are supposed to look fit surely? Especially so, when they are wielding batons against hungry people.",
    "Then there is the noise factor. Loud speakers blare away without hindrance. Complaints to the Police do no good and yet I hear there is some sort of rule in place that does not allow noise harassment. The electricity consumption of all these tamashas must be fantastically high. Who authorizes them anyway?",
    "I have ongoing grouses. Talking to friends, I realize that many of us share common complaints to which we would like to give voice. Here they are, although not necessarily in order of importance.",
    "1. I am aware that not having elections is an unpopular view but as time passes a few of us are beginning to wonder whether it is really going to change anything except to tell the Government what it already knows. It knows it is probably the most disliked and contemptible government we have ever had since the sorry downslide of our 75 years of Independence. But as elections will not remove this Parliament immediately, are we wise in making the demand for them to be held at this time of penury? Read Ranga Jayasuriya\u2019s article in the Daily Mirror of February 22 for a sensible analysis.",
    "2. When we had power cuts, we would like to know why a few areas never had any power cuts at all? I do not think it was based on the importance of any one person. My weekly masseuse never had a power cut and she does not live near anyone of importance either. So WHY the favoritism?",
    "3. Also, could the team in charge of cutting power, stick to being accurate regarding timing? These cuts are always between 15 to 30 minutes late which completely messes up our routines. They are equally tardy in turning the power on. We see no reason for this lack of punctuality. Especially because our young Minister, Kanchana Wijesekera is seen as being hardworking and dependable.",
    "4. We have a large Police force. Has anyone ever noticed that the policemen are quite tubby? I really think our forces should keep their tummies from expanding. They are supposed to look fit surely? Especially so, when they are wielding batons against hungry people.",
    "When we had power cuts, we would like to know why a few areas never had any power cuts at all? I do not think it was based on the importance of any\u00a0one person.",
    "5. Then there is the noise factor. Loud speakers blare away without hindrance. There is a public area, a mile or so from my home. Every Sunday there is either a school Sports Meet, a political function, a carnival, a cricket match or even a religious function. I can hear the announcements and the proceedings as if they were right next to me.\u00a0 Complaints to the Police do no good and yet I hear there is some sort of rule in place that does not allow noise harassment. The electricity consumption of all these tamashas must be fantastically high. Who authorizes them anyway?",
    "6. Public figures can be downright criminal in some of their actions. Why are they not brought to book? Believe me, public frustration is beginning to simmer. Mine has passed boiling level long ago!",
    "7. Education is in an appalling state and we are bankrupt. Why are we trying to usher in all sorts of new methods that put a strain on the economy without any real improvement in our teachers? Also what about English? Do we STILL imagine we will get anywhere globally unless we begin speaking in a world language and not the one spoken by a few million people? WHY is chauvinism allowed to dominate sensible thinking?",
    "8. I watch a Danish political movie titled \u2018Borgen\u2019. It is about a woman Prime Minister of Denmark and was one of the most popular TV series a few years ago. It should be made compulsory watching for every parliamentarian. EVERY action of the Danish PM is made public. She can never try a cover up because of absolute national transparency. For instance my questions today would have to be answered to my satisfaction.",
    "9. I am furious that our useless parliamentarians (most of them, not all of them) have so many privileges that do not deserve. Can someone please tell us why all the expenditure on them is not reduced (preferable totally canceled) now that we are bankrupt?",
    "Once started I can go on forever, but I realize the futility of asking, or expecting honest and acceptable answers from anyone. However, there is some compensation. At least I am allowed to air my grouses."
