    "Lakshman Kiriella says Govt. agreed to IMF conditions of upholding country\u2019s rule of law but has violated it",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Lakshman Kiriella says the Government will head into trouble with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the postponement of polls. The MP speaking at a press conference in Colombo yesterday said the Government has assured the IMF it would uphold the Rule of Law in the country.",
    "\u201cIt is one of the main conditions in the agreement signed between the IMF and the Government. It also said we must protect human rights and work with the civil society. The IMF extended us their support subject to these conditions,\u201d he said. The MP said not adhering to these conditions and delaying polls will lead to issues with obtaining further support from the IMF.\u00a0 \u201cThe Government delayed Local Government elections just days after receiving aid from the IMF. Our constitution or the electoral laws do not allow it. It was an entirely arbitrary decision of the Government. We then went to Courts and an interim order was given to the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance to release the necessary funds for the polls but the Government disregarded it. Instead they took steps to call the Judges who delivered the order before the privileges committee of the Parliament,\u201d Kiriella said. \u201cEven media institutions have been brought before the privileges committee in a bid to intimidate them,\u201d he added.",
    "The MP said it was the Government that was sabotaging the IMF deal and not the opposition as claimed by them. \u201cThey are constantly berating us claiming we are sabotaging the IMF agreement but in fact it is the Government that is doing it themselves,\u201d he said. Kiriella said Government actions have already led to various issues with the IMF. \u201cThis is why a group of IMF officials will be visiting Sri Lanka in June,\u201d he noted. According to Kiriella the IMF has stressed it will monitor the situation relating to the conditions mentioned and the Rule of Law in Sri Lanka. \u201cJust because we received funds we cannot violate these conditions. Issues with the IMF will be inevitable if we continue to delaying of polls,\u201d he added."
