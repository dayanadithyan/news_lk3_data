    "The Cabinet of Ministers cleared a proposal by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Investment Promotion Minister to expand the general wastewater treatment plant at the Horana Export Processing Zone (EPZ).",
    "\u201cThe project will be implemented using Rs. 1,100 million from the funds approved by the Board of Directors of the Board of Investment (BOI),\u201d Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.",
    "The current general wastewater treatment facility at the Horana EPZ does not have enough containment capacity and as a result, the public faces restrictions when releasing wastewater to the adjacent canals.",
    "Against this backdrop, the BOI was requested by the Local Government Institutions to accelerate the construction of the facility with a capacity of 2,000 cubic meters per day under the expansion project of the general wastewater refinery in the Horana EPZ."
