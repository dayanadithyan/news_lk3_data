    "The anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive will take longer than expected for planning and preparation say Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\u00a0The expected attack could be decisive in the war, and it will be an opportunity to regain lost territory. It will also test Ukraine's war machine, in a bid to prove that the weapons, financial aid and equipment it has received from NATO and the West can result in significant battlefield gains.",
    "\"With what we already have we can go forward, and, I think, be successful,\" Zelenskyy said in an interview, \"But we'd lose a lot of people. I think that's unacceptable. So we need to wait. We still need a bit more time.\"",
    "When and where the Ukrainian counter-offensive will happen is unknown.",
