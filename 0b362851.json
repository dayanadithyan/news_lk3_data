    "The country has no intelligent politicians to hear our proposals for the betterment of the economy, Vehicle Importers' Association of Lanka (VIAL) President Indika Sampath Merinchige said.",
    "Addressing the media, he said the VIAL has better proposals for the importation of vehicles into the country.",
    "\"We can get help from Japan. But it is unfortunate that the country does not have intelligent politicians to hear our proposals.",
    "\"Nearly 600 vehicles, including cars and vans, have been stuck at the port for two and a half years. We made several requests to the government to release them. The vehicles in the port are worth billions, but the government does not want to take that profit,\" he said.",
    "\"Vehicles will not be imported again until the dollar crisis is restored. The country does not need to bring brand new vehicles, but we can import vehicles while also creating profits to the government.",
    "\"However, the existing local vehicle prices are fluctuating due to economic disparities,\" added Merinchige. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
