    "Economically and socially, Sri Lanka is in deep trouble and the crisis deepened with yesterday\u2019s general strike by more than 40 trade unions including doctors, university professors, engineers, bank staff and other professionals. They have warned that if cost of living is not brought under control or taxes imposed are not reduced, they will launch an \u201cAragalaya\u201d or public revolt next week. In such a desperate situation, it is difficult to figure out one key issue that brought us to where we are, but an independent analysis will show that it is racial discrimination.",
    "After independence in 1948, a major controversy arose over G.G. Ponnambalam\u2019s 50-50 proposal followed by SWRD Bandaranaike\u2019s \u2018Sinhala Only\u2019 Act, his repentance and assassination by a Buddhist monk after his district council\u2019s proposal was rejected. In 1965 the United National Party (UNP) leader Dudley Senanayake formed a National Government with the Federal Party also joining. The Party\u2019s frontliner M. Thiruchelvam was given the key portfolio as Minister of Local Government and he drafted another District Council Bill. But this was leaked to the media by a Sinhala extremist minister and this led to trouble and tension. This and other reasons including the cut in the rice ration, the Dudley Senanayake government was defeated and Sirimavo Bandaranaike\u2019s Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) swept to victory in 1970 General Election. Among other issues, the Government introduced the district quota system for university admission whereby a Jaffna district student who got four A\u2019s in the Advanced Level examination, was left out and preference was given to a Monaragala student who got only two A\u2019s.",
    "Many independent analysts believe this was the main cause of the youth revolt in the north and east. Eventually, it led to the setting up of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and other guerrilla groups, which were supported by India. After the \u201cBlack July\u201d and the racial riots in 1983, the civil war erupted, hundreds of thousands were killed or injured in the 25-year war and millions were displaced with the economic damage being incalculable. The war ended in 2009, but Sri Lanka is still facing serious charges of war crimes and racial discrimination with an inquiry being held by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).",
    "On March 21, the United Nations declared the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination with the theme being \u201cVoices for action against racism.\u201d The main aim is to highlight the importance of strengthening meaningful and safe public participation and representation in all areas of decision-making to prevent and combat racial discrimination; reaffirming the importance of full respect for the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and of protecting civic space; and recognizing the contribution of individuals and organizations that stand up against racial discrimination and the challenges they face.",
    "According to the UN, this simple message can be a powerful tool to encourage people everywhere to strengthen and consolidate their voices against racism, to mobilize against all forms and manifestations of racial discrimination and injustice, and to ensure a safe environment for those who speak up. It lends itself towards telling personal interest stories and can feature people and populations from across the world. This theme draws also inspiration on the High Commissioner\u2019s report on racial justice and the Agenda Towards Transformative Change for Racial Justice and Equality.",
    "This international day is observed annually on the day the police in Sharpeville, South Africa, opened fire and killed 69 people at a peaceful demonstration against apartheid \u201cpass laws\u201d in 1960.",
    "In 1979, the General Assembly adopted a programme of activities to be undertaken during the second half of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination. On that occasion, the General Assembly decided that a week of solidarity with the people struggling against racism and racial discrimination, beginning on March 21, would be organised annually in all States.",
    "Since then, the apartheid rule in South Africa has been dismantled. Racist laws and practices have been abolished in many countries, and we have built an international framework for fighting racism, guided by the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The Convention is now nearing universal ratification, yet still, in all regions, too many individuals, communities and societies suffer from the injustice and stigma that racism brings.",
    "As one of the world\u2019s greatest statesmen Nelson Mandel has said, \u201cNo one is born hating another person because of the color of his or her skin, background, or religion. If the people can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite. Racism is a blight on the human conscience. The idea that any people can be inferior to another, to the point where those who consider themselves superior define and treat the rest as subhuman, denies the humanity even of those who elevate themselves to the status of Gods.\u201d"
