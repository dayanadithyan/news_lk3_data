    "\u2018Burkholderia Cepacia\u2019, the bacteria which was found in the eye drop that caused complications to several eye patients, was not detected in the pre-shipment samples sent by the Indian supplier, said Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena.",
    "Dr. Gunawardena told Daily Mirror that \u201cIf any issues were identified with the samples, we would have cancelled the order. This bacteria was not detected in the pre-shipment samples.\u201d",
    "\u201cNevertheless, it is not practical to test every sample and thus the clearance was given for the order. Unfortunately, the bacteria has been found in several samples, which caused complications,\u201d he said.",

    "The official also said that the batch was imported under a normal procurement and not under the Indian Credit Line.",
    "\u2018Burkholderia cepacia\u2019 is an aerobic gram-negative bacillus found in various aquatic environments. Initial investigations have revealed that patients who have undergone cataract surgery last month, contracted Endophthalmitis, a complication related to a bacterial infection.",
