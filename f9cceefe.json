    "Cargills wants to project itself as a right model for the nation",
    "Ranjit Page, Deputy Chairman & CEO at Cargills Ceylon PLC said Saturday that the new and ongoing investments made by his conglomerate are mainly aimed at increasing the confidence of the young people about a positive future for them.",
    "\u201cI am sad to see when young people are leaving the country and as a corporate, we feel it\u2019s our duty by the nation to make investments that support the young people to think about Sri Lanka as a country where a good future lies ahead for them. If we don\u2019t do that we will be failing in our duty. Our trusted Cargills Brand is now 178-years-old and Sri Lanka offered us the opportunity to grow it to the position where it is today, and therefore, we have to take ownership of the responsibility to help the country move forward with a hopeful young people,\u201d he said.",
    "Page made these remarks to The Island Financial Review at an event where he opened the fourth Cargills Square in Katubedda, a destination complex where visitors can shop, dine and watch a movie; all under one roof. The three Cargills Squares previously opened are operating in Jaffna, Gampaha and Dematagoda.",
    "The deputy chairman said that plans are afoot to build the fourth Cargills Square in Bandarawela in two months.",
    "Responding to a query he said,\u201d \u201cThe Square at Katubedda alone has cost Rs. 1.5 billion. I think that we have to make investments of this nature and create an environment conducive to youth aspirations. This Square is not designed for old people like me,\u201d he said laughing.",
    "On a more serious note he said,\u201d Individually as a corporate if we don\u2019t take ownership of the challenges and don\u2019t invest, then we are failing in our duty. That way we can\u2019t project ourselves as a right model for the nation. If we don\u2019t build an environment to create confidence in the youth, who would? If we don\u2019t pick up the tab and plow money into projects like this, who would? We are not asking for tax relief when we invest. We pay taxes, provide jobs and strive to create space for the youth to feel optimistic about their future.\u201d",
    "\u201cPeople, conveniences and entertainment should be centralized in the provinces across the country and not just in Colombo. Cargills Squares are built on that concept. We continue to believe in the future of Sri Lanka. Cargills commenced its journey in 1983 after July riots. And when the country faced other turbulent events, Cargills PLC navigated through them with determination. We never looked back.\u201d",
    "\u201cAs a company we have to fulfill our role for the youth of this country and facilitate and empower them to do their bit to make Sri Lanka a better place to live. Sri Lanka will always be there although we won\u2019t be in it. As long as Sri Lanka is there, Cargills brand will continue its journey together with Sri Lanka. It\u2019s a journey of Sri Lanka and not of Cargills. But Cargills will continue to serve as a right model for the nation. Our collaboration with the farmers and the dairy sector is a good case in point in this regard,\u201d",
    "Responding to a query on the policy framework on doing business in the country, he said,\u201d The policy framework is changing slowly. There is much more to be done. I think as a nation we have understood that we can\u2019t live on free things. Corporates and individuals who have to pay taxes have to pay taxes. However, I am sad to see that taxes are having an impact on the daily wage earners and low-income individuals. So they must be looked after through appropriate mechanisms\u201d, he noted.",
