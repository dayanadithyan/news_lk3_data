    "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a type of scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body. An MRI scan can be used to examine almost any part of the body, including the brain and spinal cord, bones and joints, breasts, heart and blood vessels and internal organs. The results of an MRI scan can be used to help diagnose conditions, plan treatments and assess how effective previous treatment has been. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
