    "The family is the foundation of society and the country. Therefore, the family needs to grow in love, peace and joy, faith and hope, humility and meekness, faithfulness and self-control. This needs to flavoured by the spirit of forgiveness because we know that to err is human, to forgive divine. Therefore, when we forgive seven times or seventy times seven, we become that much more divine.",
    "The United Nations on May 15 will mark the International Day of Families with the theme being demographic trends and families. In a statement the UN says in late last year, the world\u2019s population had reached eight billion people. Characterized by the United Nations Secretary-General as a \u2018milestone in human development\u2019 this landmark event illustrates major advancements in health extending human lifespans. Population growth is to continue albeit at a decreasing rate. It is projected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 in 2100 rising concerns about the prospects of sustainable urbanization and management of climate change.",
    "According to the UN, demographic change is one of the most important megatrends impacting our world and the life and well-being of families worldwide. Demographic trends are mostly shaped by fertility and mortality patterns. Declining fertility rates result in benefits for families as they are more able to invest in their children\u2019s health and education which in turns helps with poverty reduction and better socio-economic development.",
    "The UN says that research indicates that decreasing fertility also increases women\u2019s labour participation. On the other hand, fertility declines results in smaller families, which are less likely to cope with care and other household obligations. As such in time of unemployment or illness, families have fewer members to rely on. Moreover, low fertility rates may undermine labour forces and social structures triggering drastic responses with hard to predict consequences for issues raging from social security to gender equality.",
    "The 2023 International Day of Families observance is to raise awareness of the impact of demographic trends on families. The event will include: Launch of the Background Paper on \u201cThe Impact of Demographic Trends on Families\u201d; Presentation of the World Social Report 2023 \u201cLeaving No One Behind in an Ageing World\u201d; presentation on intergenerational equity and solidarity; an overview of recommendations of policies in response to demographic trends Presentation of civil society initiatives for IYF+30 and interactive discussion with audience participation.",
    "During the 1980\u2019s, the UN began focusing attention on issues related to the family. In 1983, based on the recommendations of the Economic and Social Council, the Commission for Social Development in its resolution on the Role of the family in the development process requested the Secretary-General to enhance awareness among decision makers and the people of the problems and needs of the family, and of effective ways of meeting those needs.",
    "In its resolution adopted on May 29, 1985, the Council invited the General Assembly to consider the possibility of including in the provisional agenda of its forty-first session an item entitled \u201cFamilies in the development process\u201d, with a view to consider a request to the Secretary-General to initiate a process of development of global awareness of the issues involved, directed towards Governments, inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations and public opinion.",
    "Later, based on the recommendations of the Commission for Social Development, formulated in its 30th round of sessions, The Assembly invited all States to make their views known concerning the possible proclamation of an international year of the family and to offer their comments and proposals.",
    "The Council also requested the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its 43rd session a comprehensive report, based on the comments and proposals of Member States on the possible proclamation of such a year and other ways and means to improve the position and well-being of the family and intensify international co-operation as part of global efforts to advance social progress and development.",
    "The global life expectancy at birth reached 72.8 years in 2019, an improvement of about 9 years since 1990. By 2030 nearly 12% of the world population will be 65 years of age or older. By 2050, an average longevity globally is to reach around 77.2 years of age. Globally, more than 23% of individuals, equating to more than 1 billion people, live in slums in urban areas. Estimates show that growth of 1% in an urban population increases the incidence of slums by 5.3% in Asia and 2.3% in Africa. An estimated 2% of the global population is homeless and an additional 20% live in inadequate housing.",
    "Abdul Kalam, an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007, has said, \u201cIf a country is to be corruption- free and become a nation of beautiful minds, I strongly feel there are three key societal members who can make a difference. They are the father, the mother and the teacher.\u201d"
