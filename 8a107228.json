    "Government MPs should resign and create an opportunity for the people to elect a new government, Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said today.",
    "\u201cThose who rule\u00a0the country today have created a sorry state of affairs where the nation is concerned and therefore, the MPs and the Ministers who represent the government should resign from their posts if they have a backbone and pave the way for the people to elect a new administration,\u201d Cardinal Ranjith said at a press conference.",
    "Further, the Cardinal called for action against MPs whom he alleged are engaged in belittling the authority of judiciary.",
    "\u201cNo one has the authority to interfere in the decision of the Supreme Court. It is clear that the judgment given on March 3, 2023 by the Supreme Court binds on the President, government and Parliament in equal measure. So, they need to follow the decision faithfully. Else they would be belittling the authority of the Supreme Court and undermine the basis of democracy,\u201d the Cardinal said.",
    "\u201cIt was reported that two Members of Parliament have spoken concerning the judgment given by the Supreme Court over the local government elections. The MPs have called this decision, a violation of their parliamentary privileges by Courts. This matter is to be viewed with great\u00a0concern. This request by the two MPs is not in keeping with the dignity and freedom of Supreme Court and any interference with courts on the basis of parliamentary privileges is unacceptable. I appeal that action be taken against these MPs to ensure that freedom of judiciary is maintained. (Yohan Perera)"
