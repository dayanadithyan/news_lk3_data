    "Daraz Sri Lanka Managing Director Rakhil Fernando has been appointed as Chief Corporate Affairs Officer of the Daraz Group, headquartered in Singapore, with effect from 1 June 2023.",
    "The announcement follows the successful completion of Rakhil\u2019s tenure as the Managing Director of Daraz Sri Lanka. Throughout his leadership, the organisation saw tremendous expansion, and the brand successfully established itself as a well-known entity among Sri Lankans. In his new role, Rakhil will report to the Daraz Group headquarters in Singapore, overseeing the strategic management of corporate affairs, and will lead efforts to further strengthen the organisation\u203as regional and global presence. His appointment also highlights Daraz\u2019s commitment to elevating in-country talent and offering Sri Lanka an opportunity to champion the e-commerce industry globally.",
    "Founded in 2015, Daraz is South Asia\u2019s leading e-commerce platform in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Myanmar. It empowers more than 200,000 active sellers with world-class marketplace technology to reach the fast-growing consumer class in a region of 500 million people.",
    "During his tenure as the Managing Director, Rakhil spearheaded numerous initiatives that strengthened and revolutionised the brand\u2019s presence and operations in the country. These included the incubation and launch of Sri Lanka\u2019s first buy-now-pay-later mobile application, KOKO Pay, the remarkable growth of Daraz Express, the company\u203as logistics arm, and the country\u2019s first in-depth study on the e-commerce landscape with SLASSCOM.",
    "Under his dynamic leadership, Daraz Sri Lanka experienced unprecedented growth, achieving record-breaking sales figures, expanding its customer base significantly and growing from a team of just 400 members to an organisation with a young and dynamic workforce of approximately 2000 staff. Daraz\u2019s Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) increased fivefold since 2019, seller registrations grew by 150% and customers grew by over 250% since 2019. As part of his strategic vision to offer better choices and greater value to online shoppers, Rakhil also oversaw the growth of Daraz\u2019s product assortment which currently includes more than 5 million products and is a significant increase from 150,000 four years ago.",
    "Rakhil\u2019s strategic vision and creative approaches saw Daraz Sri Lanka grow from a start-up to a household name throughout the island. He led the charge with innovative branding and marketing campaigns, such as Sri Lanka\u2019s first drone show in 2022, the annual 11.11 mega sale, as well as successful partnerships with high-profile conglomerates including Reckitt, Nestl\u00e9, and Dialog Axiata, which further bolstered the performance and positioning of the online marketplace.",
    "Rakhil\u2019s extensive experience in the e-commerce industry, coupled with his profound understanding of market dynamics, makes him an invaluable asset to Daraz Group."
