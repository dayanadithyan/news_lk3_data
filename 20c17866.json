    "The Cabinet of Ministers has approved a pilot project to introduce solar-powered electric buses.",
    "The move is aimed at reducing the cost of importing fossil fuels amidst the energy crisis.",
    "The pilot projects are planned in Colombo and Gampaha districts initially. The project will be implemented through a public-private partnership (PPP), with a formal feasibility study to be conducted before its commencement.",
    "\u201cWe can no longer spend $ 5-6 billion to import fossil fuel and run this economy. Any local or foreign investors can join on a BOO (build, own, operate) or BOT (build, own, transfer) basis,\u201d Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.",
    "The operation of battery-powered electric buses by the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) is expected to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported fossil fuels and pave the way for a more sustainable future. The proposal to this effect submitted by Transport and Highways Minister Bandula Gunawardane was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday."
