    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 Former First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, was released without charge on Sunday, pending further investigation, after police arrested her hours earlier in connection with an investigation into the Scottish National Parrty's finances, UK media reported. The arrest of the highly popular Mrs. Sturgeon has sent shockwaves throughout Scotland's political landscape.",
    "Mrs. Sturgeon was the first woman to serve as First Minister of Scotland, and was also the longest-serving First Minister until her surprise resignation last February.",
    "Scotland has an independent parliament and Cabinet, but is bound by the laws and policies of the United Kingdom and the UK parliament. The First Minister is the head of the Cabinet.",
    "The investigation is over an alleged irregularity over a sum amounting to 600,000 Pounds Sterling that was utilised during a campaign for a referendum on Scottish independence that was led by the party. The UK government blocked the referendum.",
    "Mrs. Sturgeon, 52, was the latest of several Scottish National Party officials who were arrested and released without charge. In April her husband who was earlier the Chief Executive of the party, was arrested, as was the Treasurer of the party, but were released without being charged with any offense. Police have also searched Mrs. Sturgeon's house and the headquarters of the Scottish National Party.",
