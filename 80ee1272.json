  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Railway Department and the Road Development Authority (RDA) have been instructed to prepare an integrated plan as soon as possible to speed up train traffic on the Kelani Valley railway line, Prime Minister, Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said while addressing a special meeting with Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana and Colombo district parliamentarian Yadamini Gunawardena at the parliament complex recently.",
    "Minister Gunawardena said a train arriving at Colombo Fort from Avissawella crosses the main road at four locations between Avissawella and Kosgama.",
    "Therefore, the Prime Minister questioned whether it would be possible to reduce traffic congestion and save time by stopping the passage through this main road, and for that, whether it is not possible to locate the railway track on one side and the highway on the other.",
    "Parliamentarian Yadamini Gunawardena said if another railway line is connected to the Kelani Valley line, then the train journey of three hours can be reduced to one hour and hence fuel too can be saved.",
    "He also emphasized that the development of the Kelani Valley railway line, which is a long-delayed development project, should be carried out with the utmost dedication. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
