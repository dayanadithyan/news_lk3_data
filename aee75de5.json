    "The country\u2019s population of retirees and demographic shift of experienced workers see a negative transformation with the current economic state of the country.",
    "Capazity Ltd. has come forward to challenge the problem and eliminate ageism in the workplace with their newly launched digital platform \u2018Capazity\u2019 which is a one of a kind initiative aimed to create an impact through a range of services and solutions which will exclusively cater to senior citizens in Sri Lanka.",
    "The venture has been founded jointly by three personalities specialised in different areas with years of corporate and social enterprise experience. Namely award-winning business leader Dr. Nirmal De Silva, technology expert innovation specialist Sanjeew Perera, and marketing expert skills trainer Ramzeena Morseth Lye.",
    "Addressing the media personalities at the official press meet, Capazity Co-Founder Dr. Nirmal De Silva said that the purpose of this organisation is to empower Sri Lankan senior citizens, both economically and socially.",
    "The stereotype idea about retirement to enjoy their golden years doesn\u2019t match the reality with the current situation in the country and the majority of the senior citizens still thrive to reinvigorate the workforce with their experience and productivity.",
    "He points out that the rapidly ageing population has been creating a number of challenges in the country. And recent studies prove that Sri Lanka\u2019s population is ageing faster compared to countries in the South Asian and Southeast Asian region.",
    "He highlighted that at the present 13% of the population in Sri Lanka are senior citizens above 60 years of age and according to the data this is expected to be increased to 27% in the next seven years.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s something that has to be looked into and requires urgent attention from the national focus since the retirement of experienced workers from the corporate world faces several challenges which need to be addressed earlier to make a positive impact,\u201d he added.",
    "Speaking about Capazity\u2019s mission, he said as a company they are aiming to mainly address good health, wellbeing, access to quality education, decent work, economic growth, industry, innovation, infrastructure, reduced inequalities and to bring social impact through the process. The initiative was considered as their collective responsibility for society and it was not a mere choice.",
    "Capazity also focused on improvements in terms of healthcare and psychological wellbeing that need to be made. The living cost in Sri Lanka has also had a significant impact on the savings and income of senior citizens.",
    "Keeping these in mind, Capazity has decided to initially offer three sets of solutions that will aid senior citizens and improve their quality of life. Capazity Impact \u2013 a range of services and solutions to individuals as well as companies, which will up skill senior citizens to remain competitive in their careers.",
    "Capazity Benefits \u2013 a simple and user-friendly online platform to connect senior citizens with a variety of merchants so that they can avail themselves of special offers, discounts and value-added services.",
    "Capazity Care \u2013 focuses on providing care for senior citizens. Paid care facilities will be available through a range of cluster-based locations with world-class independent and assisted living services to senior citizens in a welcoming, vibrant and future driven environment keeping social engagement and an active lifestyle in mind.",
    "He also mentioned that Capazity has partnered with some of the local universities and international research entities and hopes to introduce more than 100 skill development programs through this platform exclusively to senior citizens.",
    "Capazity Co-Founder and Impact Champion Sanjeew Perera also remonstrated the functions of the newly launched digital platform. He said that they are hoping to introduce a mobile application very soon which will require a one-time registration fee for lifetime use with amazing offers for senior citizens from Capazity official partners. The application will be available for both android and iPhone users.",
    "He highlights that they will be introducing an SMS code system for feature phone users as well. The Capazity has designed the platform in a way which will be easy to use for senior citizens, he added.",
    "PMF Finance PLC Chairman Chandula Abeywickrema shared his views on being partnered with an initiative that works effort-fully to change the perspective of the society\u2019s attitudes towards older people that have been contributing to the economy for ages. The retirement rate of the most experienced workers increases and the loss of this collaborative dynamic can be seen as a factor that reduces productivity. Having more experienced people in the workforce will be an economic gain to the country.",
    "The initiative has already attracted the initial round of investment through an Australian based investor.",
    "He also said that the senior citizens are known as the most deserving community in any country.",
    "They have contributed tremendously towards the economy and society. \u201cIndividuals who retire from their careers; I personally felt the \u2018retired\u2019 term was underrated and instead I would like to mention them as people who stopped working, are still thriving to uplift and make a difference to the community and their living irrespective of their age and they still continue to contribute to the economy in many ways,\u201d he said."
