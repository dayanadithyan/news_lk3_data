  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 High-income earning public servants in higher education, medical, banking, ports and other sectors has threatened to intensify ongoing trade union action against Sri Lanka\u2019s IMF-backed progressive tax regime, warning of a total shutdown if the matter is not resolved by March 15.",
    "Media spokesman of the Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) Charudaththa Illangasinghe told reporters on Thursday March 09 that a decisive moment has come in their campaign.",
    "\u201cThere can be no more waiting or biding of time. A decision has to be taken by March 15 or there will be no more water supply, no electricity and no ships coming in. Universities will remain closed,\u201d he said.",
    "Illangasinghe urged the government to introduce a fairer taxation system, adding that the unions are still open to discussion.",
    "\u201cThis is the first switch that we switched off,\u201d he said, referring to recent protests organised against the tax policy.",
    "\u201cWe will turn a new switch off every day and on the 15th it\u2019ll be time to turn the main switch off,\u201d he added, warning the government not to be caught off guard or caught unawares and claim that people were inconvenienced by the trade union action.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t blame our doctors, our banks, our port. The government must take responsibility,\u201d said Illangasinghe.",
    "Chairman Ceylon Blank Employees Union Channa Dissanayake said his union, which is a collective of 18 bank unions along with four unions from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) are taking part in the campaign.",
    "\u201cMany private banks have also joined. We have come together as a banking system and taken a decision to intensify our trade union actions towards any decision including a strike during the week that starts on March 13,\u201d said Dissanayake.",
    "\u201cWhen professionals are unfairly taxed like this, it\u2019s not just the professionals themselves but all strata below them are affected. This could also lead to an economic depression in the country,\u201d he claimed.",
    "Trade unions and professional associations in Sri Lanka representing high income earners in the public and private sectors have been protesting a recent hike in personal income taxes that sees the cash-strapped government collect from anyone earning over 100,000 rupees a month.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s new tax regime has both its defenders and detractors. Critics who are opposed to progressive taxation said it serves as a disincentive to industry and capital which can be invested in business. They argue that a flat rate of taxation is implemented where everyone is taxed at the same rate.",
    "Others, however, contend that the new taxes only affect some 10-12 percent of the population and, given the country\u2019s economic situation, is necessary, if not vital.",
    "Critics of the protesting workers argue that most of the workers earn high salaries that most ordinary people can only dream of, and though there may be some cases where breadwinners could be taxed more equitably, overall, Sri Lanka\u2019s tax rates remain low and are not unfair. (Colombo/Mar09/2023)"
