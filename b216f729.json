    "The release further notes although the intial date for the Local Government Elections was set for the 9th of March 2023, unexpected and unavoidable circumstances including the inability to print ballots led to the postponement of the original date, hence the National Election Commission has deemed it more suitable for the election to be held on the 25th of April and District Returning Officers have been informed accordingly.",
