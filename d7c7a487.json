    "India\u2019s Apollo Proton Cancer Centre on Friday announced the availability of Proton Therapy treatment for Sri Lanka-based patients at its state-of-the-art facility in Chennai.During a press conference held at the Hilton Colombo Residences in Colombo, representatives of Apollo Proton Cancer Centre (APCC) \u2013 the first and only Proton Therapy Centre in South Asia and the Middle East \u2013 shed lights on the importance of Proton Therapy for improving outcomes of cancer treatment and quality survivorship.",
    "APCC, India\u2019s first JCI accredited Cancer hospital, also revealed that the facility had recently performed a complex treatment on Sri Lankan male for a rare form of liver cancer.",
    "It was revealed that the Sri Lankan patient, Jayantha Pushpa Kumara Gamage, a 65-year-old, was treated with intensity-modulated proton beam therapy (IMPT) for Recurrent Oligometastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma, at the Apollo Proton Cancer Centre (APCC) in Chennai, India, the most advanced Cancer Centre and the first Proton Therapy Centre in South Asia & the Middle East.",
    "Gamage was diagnosed with recurrent oligometastatic hepatocellular carcinoma in the retroperitoneal region. After failed treatments with TACE, Lenvatinib, and Regorafenib, he was referred to APCC for proton therapy. Post a detailed preplanning audit, intensity-modulated proton therapy was advice and implemented successfully.",
    "Dr Sapna Nangia, Senior Consultant, Radiation Oncology, Apollo Proton Cancer Centre, said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen significant advantages of proton beam therapy over traditional radiation treatments at Apollo Proton Cancer Center. By precisely targeting tumours with a focused beam of high-energy protons, we can spare healthy surrounding tissues and minimize the risk of collateral damage, particularly in vital organs and sensitive areas. This approach can translate to improved outcomes for patients, including better cancer control rates, reduced risk of side effects, and overall enhanced quality of life.\u201d",
    "On being treated at APCC, Gamage said, \u201cGoing through cancer treatment is never easy, but thanks to the incredible team at Apollo Proton Cancer Centre, I feel like I have my life back. After failed treatments, proton therapy was my last hope, and it worked wonders for me. The staff was incredibly kind and supportive throughout the process, and I can\u2019t thank the team of experts and other members of the team for their dedication and expertise. I\u2019m so grateful to be able to live my life again with minimal symptoms, and I\u2019m excited to see what the future holds.\u201d",
    "The major advantage of proton therapy treatment is that protons slowly deposit their energy as they travel towards the cancerous tumour and deposit most of the radiation dose directly into the tumour without damaging the body further thus maintaining healthy tissues and organs without any complications. Proton therapy has been shown to have excellent local control of various cancers located in some of the most difficult areas such as skull-base regions of the body which are otherwise difficult to treat. The latest breakthroughs in this technology including pencil beam scanning, highly precise image guidance and tremendous refinements in the machine set-up, have led to the adoption of this technology throughout the world in hospital settings.",
    "Proton therapy is being encouragingly adopted for the treatment of various cancers such as brain and spine tumours, skull base tumours, oral cancers, gastro-intestinal cancers, bone and soft tissue tumours, breast cancers, thoracic cancers (lung cancer), genitourinary cancers (prostate cancer) and predominantly in paediatric cancers except for leukaemia.",
    "APCC boasts a state-of-the-art Cancer Surgery Unit that provides specialized 360-degree care using the latest technology systems for complex surgeries. With an unwavering commitment to ensuring an exceptional patient experience, the centre leverages cutting-edge treatment options to deliver world-class care.",
    "The centre is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through research, innovation, and collaboration with other leading cancer institutions around the world.
