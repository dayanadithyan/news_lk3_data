    "Sing-alongs have turned out to be hugely popular, in the local showbiz scene, and, I would say, it\u2019s mainly because they are family events, and also the opportunity given to guests to shine, in the vocal spotlight, for a minute, or two!",
    "I first experienced a sing-along when I was invited to check out the famous Rhythm World Dance School sing-along evening.",

    "The repertoire of songs for the 25th Jubilee Celebration concert will include a vast selection of international favourites, Cowboy and old American Plantation hits, Calypsos, Negro Spirituals, everybody\u2019s favourites, from the \u201960s and \u201970s era, Sinhala evergreens, etc.",
