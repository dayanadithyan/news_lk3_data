    "While moving one step forward in regulating private bus transportation, the National Transport Commission (NTC) has taken steps towards digitalizing by introducing GPS bus tracking systems for more than 1,500 buses operating in the country for easy monitoring, Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.",
    "After launching the event, the minister said the NTC will be equipped with this facility to monitor all the buses in the country round the clock. The digitization of the system will help the NTC monitor the exact location of the bus, the accurate driving speed of the bus will be inspected and ensure that the relevant technical standards are maintained by the bus, and any traffic violations or even spot the locations in the event of accidents.",
    "He said a separate unit has been established within the NTC for real-time surveillance of the buses.",
    "\"The GPS system cannot be removed from the bus. If anyone does so, a message will alert the NTC real-time surveillance unit with the exact location. Shortly after the removal of the unit, the bus will generate a constant warning alarm,\" the minister said.",
    "With the information gathered from the surveillance unit, it would be easier to take legal action, he said.",
    "The minister requested that the NTC director general to ensure a total digital revolution by the end of this year for activities such as issuing route permits, taking decisions on allocating bus routes, issuing rules and regulations over the driving of buses, canceling the licences for illegal activities, imposing fines, repairs to buses and issuing transfer permits.",
    "Meanwhile, NTC Director General Nilan Miranda said under this new digitalizing system, an electronic card has been introduced for bus owners instead of the permit booklet.",
    "The card includes all the details relating to the bus owner, including a QR code that could only be read through NTC devices. Moreover, he said a digital card would be issued for all drivers and conductors in the future. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
