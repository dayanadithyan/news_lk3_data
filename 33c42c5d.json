    "\"In a democratic country, politicians getting involved in the affairs of independent commissions such as the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) and influencing them, directly and indirectly, is an unfortunate situation,\" PUCSL Chairman Janaka Rathnayaka said.",
    "He said the independence of the PUCSL, which had been functioning for 15 years, has been challenged now.",
    "\"Everyone is knowledgeable of the independence of the PUCSL. Due to the influence of politicians, the commission members and the senior officials have to obey their demands and do things not according to the methodology and their conscience,\" Rathnayaka said.",
    "We hope this situation will not continue in the future, as it is not good for good governance or for the democracy of the country.",
    "However, appropriate legal action will be taken soon relating to the recent increase in the electricity tariff without his consent.",
    "He said he would not hesitate to take legal action personally. \"I'm going to challenge the documents taken in connection with the recent tariff revision, which was accepted by the other members. It is not a legitimate document prepared by the PUCSL,\" the chairman said.",
    "The decision taken to enforce it on the senior members to get this directive done at the CEB is illegal and unlawful.",
    "We do not have to fear anyone, as the PUCSL is an independent commission. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
