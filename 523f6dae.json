    "These can be used to detect cars parked in restricted areas, loitering in unmanned areas, and identification of left objects, count people, provide perimeter protection, detect smoke and flame, auto-track suspicious activity, and many more.",
    "Bosch \u2013 the first brand to introduce cameras with cutting-edge intelligence is now equipped with built-in machine-learning capabilities to deliver accurate results. Owners are able to teach the cameras to do specific tasks such as detect user define objects, recognise user define situations, separate objects clustered together, and detect and specify objects by size, shape, colour, etc. Bosch video systems offer high-quality imaging technology, data management, and the highest levels of data security and privacy protection.",
