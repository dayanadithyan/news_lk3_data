    "The Hambantota International Port (HIP) launched its Duty Free Complex with the opening of 2 duty free shops within the port\u2019s premises. The complex is designed to grow the duty-free business catering to the vessels calling HIP.",
    "The first two operators to set up at HIP\u2019s duty free complex are Royale Electronics and United Life, both organizations with over 30 years of experience in the duty free trade.\u00a0\u00a0 They offer a wide array of international duty free goods ranging from imported liquor, confectionery, perfumes, tobacco, etc.",
    "As HIP gears itself to facilitate an increased number of passenger cruise vessels calling at the port, both Duty Free Shop operators will be an essential value addition to overseas passengers and crews.\u00a0 Apart from contributing towards uplifting tourism in the country by promoting cruise liner calls, the port is rapidly progressing in its development of port services, such as the industrial park, marine services, energy hub and integrated logistics; which will automatically increase tourist and investor footfall and require more end-to-end services to be offered. The port\u2019s duty free complex which is of international standards is housed under HIP\u2019s International Commercial Centre will provide integrated support to all of the port\u2019s business platforms. Chairman of China Merchants Group (CMG) Miao Jianmin who was on an official visit to Sri Lanka recently, also toured the HIP duty free complex.",
