    "The receipt of the IMF Fund Facility was a step towards building a better future for the youth and uplifting the country, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.",
    "Making a special statement in Parliament, he said the credit facility amounts to approximately USD 3 billion over 4 years, with the first tranche of USD 333 million will be received.",
    "\"Additionally, the country is expecting about USD 7 billion dollars more in rapid credit support from other parties, he said and added that\u00a0 \" Some people consider the IMF EFF as just another loan, while others claim that the total debt of the country cannot be paid off with the amount received. He noted that these statements show either ignorance or a willingness to betray the country for political gain.\"",
    "\u201cWe are now starting a new journey. We have to introduce many economic reforms throughout the process. The foundation for our success will be through this path. Some of these reforms have already been proposed and implemented through the interim budget of 2022 and the budget for 2023. We will introduce numerous other reforms,\u201d President Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament during his special statement.",
    "\"The government aims to reduce the primary deficit to 2.3% of GDP by 2025 and increase revenue to 14% of GDP by 2026. The standard corporate income tax rate has been raised to 30%, and sectoral tax holidays have been eliminated. The PAYE tax rate has been raised from 12% to 15%, and the tax exemption limit has been reduced from Rs. 300 million to Rs. 80 million,\" he said.\u00a0(Ajith Siriwardana)"
