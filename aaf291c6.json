    "Following the report of at least two incidents of assault and abuse of novice monks at temples, the Chief Sangha Nayaka of the Southern Province Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera has urged the Chief Prelates of main Buddhist chapters to wake up from slumber and act to stop incidents of child abuse in places of worship in the future.",
    "The latest reported incident involved a novice monk at a temple in Pussellawa where he was allegedly brutally abused by three elder monks on April 23. This was because the novice monk failed to recite sermons.",
    "No arrests have been made with regard to this incident, although the chief incumbent of the temple had been questioned regarding the incident.",
    "On the same week, another novice monk at a temple in Aranayaka was allegedly sexually abused. The two monks- accused of being involved in the incident, were produced in courts and were released on bail.",
    "The practice of ordaining novice monks has been frowned upon by many factions, including several leading Buddhist monks. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera said that Chief Prelates of main Buddhist chapters should be responsible in ensuring the safety of novice monks in temples. My proposal is to appoint Chief Prelates or head monks to lead various sub-chapters of these main chapters. By doing so, they can look after their respective chapters,\u201d the Thera said.(Kamanthi Wickramasinghe)"
