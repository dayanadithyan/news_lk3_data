    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 Those guilty of committing economic crimes in the recent past should be investigated under the Anti Corruption Act which the President is planning on passing, stated the Samagi Youth Lawyers Movement.",
    "\"He said that he will implement the best Anti Corruption Law in South Asia. That is good. But the problem here is that the biggest crime since independence has led to the situation Sri Lanka is facing today,\" stated Executive Committee Member of the Samagi Youth Lawyers Movement Attorney Mahesh Parakarama.",
    "Speaking at a media briefing on Sunday (26), Attorney Mahesh Parakarama explained that this 'crime' has resulted \"in people not having medicine and parents being unable to purchase books for their children. The proposed act should ensure that those who committed Economic Crimes in Sri Lanka and destroyed the economy are prosecuted.\"",
    "\"It is pointless if the provisions of the act only come into effect after the date on which it is passed. We urge Ranil Wickremesinghe to bring forward this act so that politicians who committed economic crimes and other corrupt activities over the last 20 to 25 years can be prosecuted and punished,\" Attorney Mahesh Parakarama concluded.",
