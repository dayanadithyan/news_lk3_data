  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Federation of University Teacher\u2019s Association (FUTA) has claimed that the Government must take the responsibility for the delay in the marking of the 2022 GCE Advanced Level examination papers.",
    "FUTA Chairman Prof. Shyama Bannaheka stated that if the Government can meet their demands and provide a proper solution in this regard, they are willing to commence the paper-marking process immediately.",
    "She said that if a solution to their issues is immediate, FUTA is willing to expedite the paper-marking process, and will mark papers even during the upcoming festive season.",
    "\u201cWe decided to withdraw from paper-marking because of the injustice certain members of our association have faced owing to the tax revisions. They need some sort of relief. There were no other demands attached to this refusal to mark papers,\u201d Prof. Bannaheka said.",
    "The Professor vehemently denied recent claims that the FUTA is marking the papers written by those in the Tamil medium, and has withdrawn only from the paper-marking process of those in the Sinhala medium, saying that: \u201cSinhala or Tamil is not relevant to this matter\u201d.",
    "She also added that school teachers too have now joined the movement and that it is not only university professors who are refusing to mark the papers of the 2022 GCE A/L session.",
    "\u201cThus, we are not responsible for this issue being prolonged,\u201d she added."
