    "ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee closed at 306.50/307.00 against the US dollar in the spot market Friday, weaker from 305.80/306.20 a day earlier, dealers said while bonds yields were slightly down.",
    "The\u00a0kerb\u00a0rate was 308/310 rupees to the US dollar, market participants said.",
    "The rupee has been allowed to strengthen from 313.10/40 to the US dollar last Friday.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s has been under upward pressure from around the last quarter of 2023, amid a contraction in private credit and liquidity shortages in the banking system, but was allowed to appreciate from around March 2023 after lifting a surrender rule.",
    "In 2022 Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee collapsed from 200 to 360 to the US dollar in the worst currency crises engineered by mis-targeted policy rates since the central bank was set up in 1950, abolishing a consistent monetary regime that helped the country navigate through two world wars and a Great Depression.",
    "Sri Lanka has also seen foreign investments into high yielding Treasury bills, which will also increase inflows. However when the money is spent by the government, or used to repay foreign debt, the inflows can move out.",
    "As long as credit is negative, the rupee can be controlled by the monetary authority.",
    "The country\u2019s ad hoc peg is currently driven by an IMF reserve requirement and the willingness of authorities to allow currency appreciation.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s exporters have said their margins were hit by electricity prices set at weaker exchange rate. A review of power prices is currently on, which will reflect currency appreciation up to around April 2023.",
    "Exporters usually make temporary profits from depreciation through an Anglophone academic neo-Mercantilist ideology called \u2018competitiveness\u2019, in the time lag taken for destroyed wages of workers and utility prices to catch up.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s ad hoc peg has tended to collapse in the second year of the last two IMF programs in 2011/12 and 2018 as credit recovered and the central bank printed money to keep rates down.",
    "Analysts say that IMF program reserve targets (net international reserve floor PC) and \u2018data driven\u2019 flexible inflation targeting (articulated by a monetary policy consultation clause PC) are at fundamental conflict with each other in a credit recovery, triggering depreciation, stop-go cycles or both.",
    "Under IMF program with a NIR floor PC it is not possible to operate a clean float and with an inflation target (a domestic anchor) it is not possible to operate a consistent peg (an external anchor).",
    "A bond maturing on 01.09.2027 closed at 26.40/55 percent steady from 26.30/27.00 percent, at Thursday\u2019s close.",
    "A bond maturing on 01.05.2025 closed at 28.30/29.00 percent, steady from  28.00/29.00\u00a0per cent at last close.",
    "The rupee closed at 306.50/307.00 against the US dollar in the spot market weaker from yesterday\u2019s close at 305.80/306.20. (Colombo/May19/2023)"
