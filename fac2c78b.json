    "In a statement issued yesterday, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) expressed its grave concerns on the recently gazetted Anti-Terrorism Bill. The BASL said it is firmly of the view that no legislation should be introduced to directly or indirectly, curtail or suppress the fundamental rights of citizens, enshrined in the Constitution. The Association also said that if passed into law this new legislation will have far-reaching effects.",
    "\u201cThe Bill has been published in the gazette without adequate consultations with the relevant stakeholders including the BASL. Hence the BASL calls upon the Government to consider to defer the Bill until there is a wider stakeholder consultation and the concerns of stakeholders including the BASL are taken into account,\u201d the statement read.",
    "\u201cFurthermore, the BASL takes cognizance that the Bill requires serious attention, and as such, has appointed a committee of senior lawyers to review the legality and the consequences of the Bill, and report to the Management Committee of the BASL,\u201d it added. The organisation also said it would not hesitate to challenge any Bill that would deem to undermine the rule of law and the liberty of the citizens in Sri Lanka."
