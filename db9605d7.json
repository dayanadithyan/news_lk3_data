  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) can develop the Eastern Province within six months if they are granted the Governor's post, MJP leader and Tamil Diaspora General Secretary Nimalan Vishwanathan said.",
    "Addressing the media, he said the party had requested the government to grant them the Eastern Province Governor's post soon after the removal of the incumbent Governor.",
    "\"If we are granted the Governor's post we can bring in more investments into the province, develop it and increase the gross domestic product (GDP).",
    "\"Around 72 percent of the jobs in Trincomalee are based on fishing. We can export fish to many countries, and I already received many orders in this regard,\" Vishwanathan said.",
    "\"After observing our progress for three months, decide whether we are suitable for the post or not,\" he said.",
    "\"The former Governor had not done anything for the development of the province. She did nothing to increase the GDP. Senthil Thondaman has been appointed as the Eastern Province Governor. He was the governor of the up-country and he does not know anything about the Eastern Province. The political agenda and the government's mechanisms are creating issues in the country. None of the Sinhala, Tamil or Muslim people are creating issues. They try to go forward with the country. Consequently, these communities should take decisions about this political situation,\" Vishwanathan said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama and Indika Sri Aravinda)"
