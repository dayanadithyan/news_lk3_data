To realise this vision, the Korean Government has formulated a policy and an implementation plan aligned with the Indo-Pacific Strategy for each sub-region, including North Pacific, Southeast Asia and ASEAN, South Asia, Oceania, and the African Coast of the Indian Ocean.",
    "The principles of cooperation for the Indo-Pacific Strategy are based on inclusiveness, trust, and reciprocity. For this purpose, the Korean government would like to attempt to build regional order based on norms and rules, strengthen non-proliferation and counter-terrorism efforts, engage in contributive diplomacy through tailored development cooperation, etc. Especially in the region of South Asia, \u201cSri Lanka is a country with great potential,\u201d the Deputy Minister stated. \u201cKorea supports the endeavours of the Sri Lankan Government and its people to emerge from the current challenges as a strong and resilient economy. In the framework of Indo-Pacific, the Korean government will pursue reliable and mutually beneficial economic partnerships with countries in South Asia through strengthened economic and development cooperation in such areas as trade, investment and development assistance. The government of Korea has increased the ODA budget by 14% this year and Sri Lanka is one of the key development assistance recipients.\u201d",
    "The seminar featured a presentation by the Director for the Regional Strategy Division Jungho Lee on the Indo-Pacific Strategy of ROK and the substantial cooperation Korea hopes to share with Sri Lanka through increased economic and development cooperation.

In 2022, the GDP per capita has increased to $ 34,997. While the major export items in 1962 were limited to a few materials such as iron ore, tungsten, raw silk and squid, it has now diversified and expanded to export items such as semiconductors, automobiles, petrochemicals and shipbuilding. The transformation of the Korean economy was due to the structural and financial sector reforms such as effective regulation and supervision of financial institutions.",
    "Dr. Song further explained that the economy of ROK experienced major setbacks such as the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997-98. Significant structural and financial reforms such as the Financial Supervisory Service, the restructuring of large banks, capital account liberalisation and the free-floating exchange system led to the recovery of the economy. As an outcome of such painful reforms, the Korean economy was better prepared to weather the 2008 Global Financial Crisis with strong economic fundamentals. She reiterated that the lessons from the two crises such as market-based exchange rate, public sector reform, fiscal consolidation, policy sequencing, political leadership and commitment can be used as references in the development of Sri Lanka.",
    "She emphasised that Korea is a bridge between developed and developing countries, and Korea hopes to strengthen more collaborations with Sri Lanka. Human resources development and management, Education and training, Skills development, Infrastructure development and agricultural productivity are prioritised as key areas of cooperation between Korea and Sri Lanka.",
    "Korean ODA representatives, KOTRA Country Director Son Joo Hong and KOICA Country Director Kim Myung Jin also participated in the Expert seminar to share first-hand experiences in the development of Sri Lanka.",
    "The event also featured a traditional Kandyan dance performance and a dynamic Taekwondo performance that captured the attention of the audience. The seminar was conducive to build an informative dialogue on the Indo-Pacific strategy of the Republic of Korea and the future-oriented cooperation between Korea and Sri Lanka."
