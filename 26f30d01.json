    "It was observed by the judges of the ACCA Sri Lanka Sustainability Reporting Awards 2022 that DIMO\u2019s 2021/2022 annual report is a testament to the company\u2019s commitment to evolving, in tune with the requirement of sustainability. They also stated that the company\u2019s desire to better its performance and be innovative in its reporting is clearly visible in the latest outstanding annual report.",
    "Outlining the rational for recognising DIMO as the winner in the Conglomerates and Diversified category, the judges also noted that the company made a significant shift in its business direction towards agricultural solutions to improve economic sustainability and address the national priority of food security.",
    "This change is evident in the company\u2019s evolved operations, including three Agri techno parks dedicated to research and development, continuous farmer education, and the production of organic fertiliser while catering to every aspect in the agriculture value chain. Apart from its agricultural solutions, DIMO has also facilitated the provision of safe drinking water for many households, through executing government\u2019s rural water supply schemes. Ambatale Water Supply System Improvement and Energy Saving project which facilitates a 16% reduction in energy cost is another significant project by DIMO which showcases its efforts towards sustainability.",
    "DIMO\u2019s expansion into areas beyond motor engineering such as education, medical, water, power and energy is another indicator of its focus on sustainable solutions that are directly related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This diversification is also reflected in the company\u2019s value creation model, which is well-defined in the 2021/2022 annual report.\u00a0 \u00a0The judges\u2019 report further emphasised on the company\u2019s commitment to training and development which was evident in the establishment of its own outbound training centre for internal training. This move aptly showcases the company\u2019s dedication to investing in its employees, a vital aspect of ensuring business sustainability. The company has outlined its sustainability agenda up to 2030 and provided Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) assurance, portraying its commitment to responsible business practices in its award winning 2021/2022 annual report.",
    "DIMO\u2019s recognition as the Overall Runner Up and the Winner in the Conglomerates and Diversified category is a testament to its commitment to sustainable practices and development, and is a positive step towards achieving the SDGs and ensuring a sustainable future for all."
