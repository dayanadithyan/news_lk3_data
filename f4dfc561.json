    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s trade unions and professional associations who have been agitating against an International Monetary Fund (IMF) backed progressive tax hike will meet to discuss further union action after a letter to the president went unanswered.",
    "Government Medical Officers\u2019 Association (GMOA) secretary Dr Haritha Aluthge told reporters on Friday March 31 that the unions will meet as the self-styled Professionals\u2019 Trade Union Alliance (PTUA) collective which have so far been organising strikes and demonstrations demanding a revision of the taxes.",
    "The PTUA has been awaiting a promised meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe for some days now. Aluthge previously said on Monday that if the meeting did not materialise, the unions would be compelled to go on strike.",
    "The issue has become stagnant due to government inaction, said Aluthge at Friday\u2019s press conference.",
    "\u201cThe PTUA informed the president in writing yesterday for the last time to please understand the gravity of this situation and to immediately give us a meeting and present the government\u2019s interim solution, through which the government can take measures to ease the sense of tension among professionals,\u201d he said.",
    "The purpose of the meeting is to discuss an \u201cinterim solution\u201d to the professionals\u2019 grievances over the progressive income tax hike until a reported revision that\u2019s due in six months when the country\u2019s recently approved 17th IMF programme comes up for review.",
    "\u201cSadly, there has still been no response,\u201d the GMOA official said.",
    "All unions and professional associations will meet Friday evening together with a number of other unions to discuss further action, he added.",
    "The privately-owned English-language weekly newspaper The Sunday Times reported on March 26 that the IMF had indicated the possibility of revising some of the taxes imposed as part of the IMF\u2019s staff-level agreement with Sri Lanka when the programme comes up for review in six months.",
    "According to the newspaper, IMF officials had conveyed this to representatives of trade unions during a virtual roundtable held last Friday March 24. The virtual meeting was held on the initiative of the IMF and was attended by trade unions and professional associations representing the PTUA including the GMOA. (Colombo/Mar31/2023)"
