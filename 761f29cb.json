    "The National Drivers Association (NDA) in a statement to media warned about the dangers of reusing worn-out tires by cutting grooves into them.",
    "According to NDA, this practice is one of the main causes of motor accidents and it poses a significant risk to drivers and passengers alike.",
    "NDA emphasised that high-quality tyres are essential for safe driving.",
    "The treads on tyres keep the rubber in contact with the road surface, providing good traction and preventing slippage.",
    "This is particularly important on the often-uneven roads of Sri Lanka, where deep grooves are necessary to keep vehicles away from skidding.",
    "Unfortunately, some businessmen are encouraging motorists and riders to re-groove their worn-out tyres, putting many lives at risk. While experienced drivers tend to avoid these re-grooved tyres, many new drivers of motorcycles or three-wheelers are using them.",
    "\u201cWe urge everyone not to take such risks for the sake of short-term profit. Reusing worn-out tyres is dangerous and we urge all drivers to prioritise safety for themselves and their passengers.",
    "Your life and the lives of those who travel with you depend on the quality of your vehicle\u2019s tyres.\u201d NDA Secretary Gayan Dharshana Perera said."
