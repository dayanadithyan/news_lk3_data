    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) will not be a part of a national government with those who do not have a mandate, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said today.",
    "\u201cThe present government and the President are carrying out a Hitler-type campaign to fool the people by spreading falsehood with regard to a national government. This is just like what Hitler using Joseph Goebbels did during World War 2. President and the government are spreading falsehood by using those who identify themselves as journalists. Neither the SJB as a whole nor any individual MP would join to form a national government,\u201d Premadasa said in a special statement.",
    "\u201cWe would call for a snap general or a presidential election. If not we appeal to the government to hold the local government election to determine the pulse of the people. We would consider joining in forming a national government if the people give a signal to that effect,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cSome media institutions are publishing falsehood in exchange for rewards,\u201d he also said.",
    "This is the second special statement made by Mr. Premadasa rejecting any move to join the government within a course of three weeks. (Yohan Perera)"
