    "The ICC said: \u201cIndia were ruled to be five overs short of the target after time allowances were taken into consideration while Australia were found to be four overs short.\u201d India skipper Rohit Sharma and his Australian counterpart Pat Cummins \u201cpled guilty and accepted the proposed sanctions, so there was no need for formal hearings\u201d, it added.",
