    "Secretary of the association Dr. Haritha Aluthge stated that the mosquito population in the localities of the Colombo Municipal Council area and Gothatuwa has exponentially increased.",
    "The doctor stressed that the internationally accepted Breteau Index \u2013 which is used for estimating the density of infectious mosquitoes in an area \u2013 is five times higher than the usual value calculated in certain areas of the Colombo District.",
    "He mentioned that although the index value should prevail at 5%, it is reported to be 25% in certain areas.",
