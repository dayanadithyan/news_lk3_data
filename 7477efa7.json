    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Veddah community, a minority indigenous group that never enjoyed political representation, has weighed in on an ongoing standoff between the government and trade unions over an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed tax hike.",
    "Uruwarige Vanniyalaeththo, the leader of the community, told reporters this week that Sri Lanka\u2019s university lecturers who have refused to mark answer scripts of a crucial school-level university entrance exam should not hold the country\u2019s children to ransom.",
    "\u201cThe delay in marking answer scripts has become a major issue to young people here,\u201d the Veddah chief said.",
    "The indigenous leader was referring to an ongoing strike campaign by the Federation of University Teachers\u2019 Associations (FUTA) who are boycotting the evaluation of last year\u2019s GCE Advanced Level candidates as part of trade union action against a steep IMF-backed progressive tax hike.",
    "Vanniyalaeththo did, however, acknowledge that teachers and other government officials who are on strike or resorting to other trade union actions have legitimate grievances.",
    "\u201cTeachers and officials have their reasons, [but\u2026] if you go to get some medicine, there is a protest there,\u201d he said, referring to a recent strike organised by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) over the same tax hike.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s only innocent citizens that are inconvenienced by all this,\u201d the Veddah leader said.",
    "\u201cThe teachers probably have their grievances. But why take children hostage?\u201d",
    "FUTA\u2019s strike has been controversial, despite the unpopularity of the government\u2019s tax hike. Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, has all but sided with President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his vocal opposition to the teachers\u2019 tactics.",
    "SJB parliamentarian Nalin Bandara told reporters in Colombo on Thursday April 20 that teachers can resort to alternative forms of agitation to win their demands.",
    "\u201cWe are against trade union action when it comes to marking papers. Unions may have their concerns, but union action must be taken without holding children\u2019s future to ransom. This is a serious situation.",
    "\u201cThese children have a lost a year or year and a half of their lives due to exam delays. This is unfair by the children who sat for their exams. Their goals are being delayed,\u201d said Bandara.",
    "Sri Lanka president finds unlikely ally in standoff against protesting teachersSee more",
    "Meanwhile, FUTA has said\u00a0 they will not be intimidated and also accused the government of hurting the quality of the paper-marking process by hiring substitutes.",
    "FUTA spokesman Charudaththa Illangasinghe told reporters Monday April 24 that the association will meet Tuesday evening to discuss the issue and any further trade union action.",
    "\u201cA/L is an important exam; it is the university entrance exam. The government is attempting to bring down the quality of the process by getting other parties to mark the answer scripts,\u201d said Illangasinge.",
    "\u201cWe will not allow the government to destroy education,\u201d he added.",
    "Illangasinghe was referring to a decision by the government to recruit retired university lecturers to the answer scripts. This follows a controversial statement by President Wickremesinghe on April 19 when he issued a one-week ultimatum to the education sector trade unions engaged in the papermarking boycott.",
    "The two-month delay has already seen the schedule for releasing results being disrupted, which has also delayed this year\u2019s exams.",
    "President Wickremsinghe at a meeting with Education Ministry officials on Wednesday warned that he would make education an essential service under emergency law and initiate legal action against teachers who did not comply with the law.",
    "\u201cAll those marked the papers last time, must be available for service now. If not, I will prosecute them and take their property also,\u201d Wickremesinghe told the officials.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t stop the education of children. What nonsense is this? By next week, I will tell the AG (Attorney General) to be ready with the emergency regulations.\u201d",
    "FUTA and school teachers unions\u2019 have been up in arms over the president\u2019s warning.",
    "\u201cIt was the government that brought this problem and it is the government that keeps the problem going.",
    "The government must find a speedy solution and quickly resolve the problem of marking answer scripts,\u201d he said.",
    "FUTA has written to President Wickremesinghe about how they will not be intimidated by \u201cempty threats\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe would like to tell the public, don\u2019t fear anything. We plan to end this soon. We stand for these children.",
    "We care about education. We won\u2019t let the government destroy education,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Apr24/2023)"
