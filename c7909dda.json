  "original_body_lines": [
    "Charges Wickremesinghe\u2019s opinion that people will not be keen to vote is an attempt to influence the courts",
    "Claims President has failed to understand why there was a people\u2019s uprising last year",
    "Slams Govt. attempts to suppress media and citizens through the introduction of new legislation",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Colombo mayoral candidate Mujibur Rahman yesterday slammed President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s speech at the recently concluded National Law Conference 2023/2024 calling it an indirect threat to judicial independence.",
    "At the event, Wickremesinghe opined that most people, including many young people, have lost faith in elections and politics. He hinted that even if an election is held, the people will not be interested in casting their vote.",
    "Rahman noted that at a time cases relating to the Government\u2019s failure to hold polls are being heard before the Supreme Court, Wickremesinghe has now expressed his opinion that political parties even if they join hands will not be able to secure even 51% of the vote. \u201cHe is saying there is no point in holding an election,\u201d the former MP pointed out.",
    "\u201cHe is welcome to his opinion about polls. But he made these comments to a room full of judges and others involved in the legal system. Therefore it can be considered an indirect threat to judicial independence,\u201d Rahman said. The former MP said the President\u2019s behaviour was despicable and said this is an attempt to meddle with the country\u2019s judicial system. \u201cHe is attempting to influence the Courts and the Supreme Court to hang on to power,\u201d he alleged.",
    "Rahman said the President has failed to understand the causes of the people\u2019s uprising last year which forced former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down. \u201cAt the time people asked for an election and they continue to wait for one to express their opinion,\u201d he said.",
    "Rahaman urged all political parties to come together to fight for elections. \u201cIt is time we set aside our differences and come to the fore. The Rajapaksas together with Wickremesinghe are attempting to collapse the electoral map and take this country towards a dictatorship,\u201d Rahman warned.",
    "He also slammed the Government\u2019s attempts to introduce the Anti-terrorism Act and a Broadcasting Authority Act which would lead to further suppression of the media and citizens."
