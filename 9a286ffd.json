    "Last week, the largest capacity crawler crane in Sri Lanka was unloaded at Hambantota International Port (HIP). The crane, with a 750-ton lifting capacity, will be initially used for Hiruras Wind Power Project in Mannar. The German-built Liebherr brand crane was used in Japan and has now been imported to Sri Lanka for civil projects.",
    "\u201cHIP has earned itself a name for its RORO capabilities and currently we are aggressively promoting the port\u2019s ability to handle all types of vehicles in the international market.\u00a0 The way this heavy equipment was unloaded at the port is a fine example of HIP\u2019s capability,\u201dHambantota International Port Group (Pvt) Limited COO Tissa Wickramasinghe said.",
    "The crawler crane which consisted of 1000 tonnes of components was unloaded by HIP within a day.\u00a0 The cargo was then transferred to 42 trucks which took the equipment by road in 2 days to the project site in Mannar for assembling.",
    "\u201cHIP is well known for its accident-free operations and for maintaining very high standards in health and safety.\u00a0 This is one of the key reasons for the port being a preferred choice when importing heavy equipment that need delicate handling like the crawler crane, which to-date is the largest in Sri Lanka,\u201d said Keerthi Manthrirathna, Proprietor of Rainbow Lanka (Pvt) Limited, the largest crane rental company in Sri Lanka."
