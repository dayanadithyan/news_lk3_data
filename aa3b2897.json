  "original_title": "Imran Khan has Always Been Sri Lanka\u2019s Good Friend. Sri Lanka should back him and demand that he gets a fair deal in Pakistan  where political revenge is a commonplace and routine habit.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Pakistan\u2019s leadership battles have almost always been bathed in blood. From the time of the assassination of its second President, Ghulam Muhammad, not long after the death of Jinnah \u2013 the founder of what he called the \u201cmoth-eaten Pakistan\u201d \u2013 very few leaders, if at all, have been able to complete their time in office.",
    "They have been either killed or removed from office under several charges, many of them obviously manufactured. As if to add to this oddity, many of the successor presidents were appointees of the very leader who had been unceremoniously removed. The manner of removal was brutal.",
    "Muhammad Ali Bhutto who held the reins of power during the partition of Pakistan and the birth of Bangladesh was removed by the army chief who personally oversaw his hanging, in spite of the pleas of many world leaders for clemency.",
    "Army Chief Zia-ul-Haq took over ostensibly to preserve Islamic values, which allegedly were threatened by the Westernised, whisky-drinking Bhutto and his wife of Iranian descent.",
    "Zia-ul-Haq was portrayed by the West as an Islamic fundamentalist when they were wisening up to the spread of Al-Qaeda, which they encouraged earlier to challenge the Russians in Afghanistan. CIA \u2018think tanks\u2019 were working overtime to pit Islamic fundamentalism against what they perceived as Communist advances in the Middle East, in Muslim states like Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in the USSR and north of the Khyber Pass in Afghanistan.",
    "They gave a new twist to the old \u2018Great Game\u2019 of the British imperialists who looked on Afghanistan as a barrier to the southward infiltration to India of other growing imperial powers, particularly Russia and Germany. Zia-ul-Haq, who did not play ball, was blown up in his plane in mid-air by bombs hidden in a crate of mangoes which was taken on board at the last minute.",
    "Mid-air antics seem to be the signature style of high-level political killers in Pakistan. Later when there was a rumour of a coup led by Military Chief Pervez Musharraf, Head of State Nawaz Sharif ordered that the plane carrying Musharraf from a visit to Sri Lanka not be permitted to land. But the Army intervened. Musharraf landed in Karachi Airport, his home ground, led a coup, and ousted Sharif, who went into exile in Dubai. Several years later Musharraf was forced to abdicate by a popular movement led by Benazir Bhutto, who was backed by the State Department.",
    "The background to US involvement was the attack on US soil on 9/11 by the masterminds of Al-Qaeda. An infuriated George W. Bush ordered a \u201cseek and destroy\u201d effort in Afghanistan where the Al-Qaeda leaders were living. In this the indispensable partner was Pakistan and step by step its military took control and became in effect a satellite of the US.",
    "The staging point for their Afghanistan offensives was in Pakistan territory. Thus the Pak Army and its security service \u2013 the ISA \u2013 became kingmakers of the country.",
    "Benazir Bhutto\u2019s attempt to seize her family heritage through a mass movement which was gaining ground ended when she was assassinated while on the way to a political rally. This was followed by a period when the Army and the politicians worked in tandem, especially in view of the growing economic crisis which was natural in an economy forced into war mode.",
    "But with the end of the US engagement in Afghanistan, the growing relations with China investing in massive infrastructure projects and India emerging as a superpower which is strengthening its relations with the US, particularly through Indo-Pacific initiatives and the Quad, have led Pakistan into a quagmire of difficulties which in turn has led to an uncompromising confrontation between the Army and the civilian authorities. It has created a testing time for democracy in Pakistan.",
    "The man at the centre of this conundrum is Imran Khan, who is a hero to Pakistanis for a variety of reasons. The most obvious is his fame as a handsome world-class cricketer who first led his Oxford University cricket team and then captained the victorious Pakistani World Cup team.",
    "He was a famous man about town in London, having dated many society ladies and finally marrying Emma Goldsmith, who had a famous and wealthy father, being a relative of the Rothschilds. Her mother was an equally-famous scion of an English lord with left leanings. The marriage of this handsome couple with all its attendant hoopla, including a reference to Princess Diana, who was dating a Pakistani surgeon, was a great social event in the UK. The couple had two sons who are now adults in the UK and, with their mother, are great supporters of their father. After a few years they divorced and Imran remarried several times, but their friendship remains.",
    "Notwithstanding all that glamour, Imran Khan decided to return to Pakistan to do charity work in memory of his mother. However, he was drawn into politics and began the long and arduous journey, seeking power as an honest man in Pakistani politics, which is reeking with corruption.",
    "He was making progress with his party Tehreek-e-Insaf, but it was the Army that ultimately backed him and gave him the protection, without which a leader finds it difficult to survive in Pakistani politics. Once in power with a global profile, especially when the international scenario was rapidly changing, he went off script in the view of the Army high command.",
    "He made overtures to India \u2013 the Pakistan Army\u2019s ever-present \u2018enemy\u2019 which under the Modi administration was identified as being anti-Muslim in character. He also did not follow the succession plan of the Army top brass, leading to a confrontation with his senior generals. The upshot was that he was removed from his premiership after losing a vote of confidence in Parliament. He is now again on the stump, leading protest marches throughout the country. As perhaps could be predicted, an assassination attempt was made in Wazirabad in Punjab where he was seriously wounded. But he is determined to go on.",
    "The latest global developments are again putting Pakistan between the devil and the deep blue sea. The economy is in shambles and is surviving through an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout. The stringent controls introduced under IMF advice are causing hardship to the populace. The reliance of Pakistan on its neighbour China raises eyebrows in the West. Imran\u2019s overtures to India for normalcy in relations were viewed with fear by the Army. It was in this background that Imran\u2019s outspoken interviews on international affairs were resented by many powerful countries.",
    "Deprived of his premiership and with familiar charges of corruption over his head, Imran needs the backing of his friends at this moment. Sri Lanka, which is one of his favourite countries \u2013 not least because of cricketing friendships with players of Arjuna Ranatunga vintage \u2013 should back him and demand that he gets a fair deal in a country where political revenge is a commonplace and routine habit."
