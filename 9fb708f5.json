    "The official delegation from the Department for International Trade in the UK visited the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) on 16 March to discuss the opportunities for Sri Lanka\u2019s export sector under Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS) to be launched by the Government of UK.",
    "Trade Preferences Policy Manager for Sri Lanka Sofie Kinsey, Overseas Trade Policy Advisor for South Asia Fabian Hartwell, and British High Commission in Colombo Deputy Head of Trade and Investment Asanthi Fernando participated in the discussions at the EDB with the objective of identifying potential export sectors for Sri Lanka to expand in the UK market utilising the UK DCTS.",
    "Currently more than 6,000 product lines from Sri Lanka can enjoy zero duty access for the UK market under Enhanced Frame Work preference scheme and another 156 product lines also will be added to the same list under UK DCTS. Being a beneficiary country under UK DCTS, Sri Lanka will become more competitive to further expand in the UK market.",
    "EDB Chairman and Chief Executive Suresh de Mel emphasised the importance of UK DCTS since the UK is the second largest export destination for Sri Lanka with a total export value of $ 966.04 million and a total trade value of $ 1,170 million in 2022. Sri Lanka\u2019s main export products to the UK in 2022 were apparel, engineering products, coconut-based products and rubber-based products.",
    "It was identified that some sectors from Sri Lanka like tea, rubber gloves, animal feed, ship building/boat building, gherkins, kithul treacle and rice flour have a potential to expand in the UK market under new DCTS.",
    "The EDB requested assistance from the UK Government to promote the potential product sectors in the UK market with the purpose of enhancing the utilisation of UK DCTS.",
    "The British team assured their cooperation for Sri Lanka to strengthen the presence of value added products in the UK market by enhancing the utilisation of the new preferential arrangement."
