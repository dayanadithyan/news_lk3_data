    "Pakistan\u2019s media regulator has banned television channels from broadcasting speeches and news conferences by Imran Khan, accusing the former prime minister of attacking the state\u2019s institutions and promoting hatred.",
    "The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) imposed the ban late on Sunday after Khan gave a speech in the eastern city of Lahore, where he alleged that former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa was behind his removal from power in April last year.",
    "The cricketer-turned-politician made the speech after police from the capital Islamabad made an attempt to arrest him in a corruption case. Khan, who denies the charges, evaded the arrest.",
    "In its notification, the PEMRA said Khan was \u201clevelling baseless allegations and spreading hate speech through his provocative statements against state institutions and officers which is prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order and is likely to disturb public peace and tranquillity\u201d.",
    "This was the third time the PEMRA has banned TV channels from airing Khan\u2019s statements since he lost the premiership and started holding mass rallies to demand immediate national elections.",
    "Nearly two hours after the ban, the media regulator also suspended the licence of ARY News, a private news channel, for broadcasting Khan\u2019s Lahore speech.",
    "The PEMRA said the news channel \u2013 considered sympathetic to Khan \u2013 violated its order. But an ARY official rejected the allegation.",
    "\u201cThe PEMRA statement came after 8pm and almost all the channels ran clippings of Imran Khan\u2019s speech in their 9pm bulletins. However, the regulatory authority suspended only our licence,\u201d the ARY official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera.",
    "The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan condemned the regulator\u2019s decision to ban the airing of Khan\u2019s speeches on electronic media.",
    "\u201cWe have always opposed measures to curb voices in the past \u2013 whether under the previous government or earlier \u2013 and we continue to stand by our commitment to freedom of speech, irrespective of the person\u2019s political opinion,\u201d it said in a statement, demanding that the ban be \u201clifted immediately\u201d.",
    "Hammad Azhar, a politician belonging to Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tahreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, said the country was \u201cfast descending into darkness\u201d and there were \u201cconcerted efforts\u201d by the government to put its democracy under threat.",
    "\u201cThis [ban on Khan\u2019s speeches] is not only unconstitutional as it goes against freedom of expression \u2026 There cannot be a blanket ban on speeches of politicians. Other than questions of legality, it is also extremely anti-democratic in nature,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.",
    "\u201cThis regime is petrified of Imran Khan and his ever-soaring popularity, he is now seen as a prime minister-in-waiting. We are seeing police action against Khan and the party workers. There is a media crackdown. We are fast becoming a fascist state.\u201d",
    "Former PEMRA chief Absar Alam said the implementation of law in Pakistan is flawed and the media regulator needs to improve itself.",
    "\u201cPEMRA has become a tool; whoever can use it often does it for their interest,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.",
    "Alam, however, added that the TV channels should take responsibility for what they broadcast.",
    "\u201cThere is so much polarisation in Pakistan that one person\u2019s virtue is another person\u2019s sin. Unfortunately, media has amplified this a lot and they are not following media ethics or showing professionalism,\u201d he said.",
    "Paris-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) last year ranked Pakistan 157 among 180 countries in its World Press Freedom Index list."
