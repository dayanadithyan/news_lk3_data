  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka and private creditors should decide on whether to use a bond linked to economic performance in an upcoming debt re-structuring, International Monetary Fund\u2019s Senior Mission Chief Peter Breuer, said.",
    "Some private creditors believe that Sri Lanka\u2019s projected growth of around 3.1 percent for the next few years are too low and they will have to take steep losses to comply with the IMF\u2019s ceilings on future debt service to regain the ability to repay debt (debt sustainability).",
    "Sri Lanka authorities should answer the questions \u201ccoming from commercial creditors with respect to GDP projections or is there room to use state contingent instruments,\u201d Breuer told reporters in a press briefing after the island\u2019s IMF deal was approved.",
    "\u201cSo, it\u2019s really up to them to find some kind of instrument that works for both parties,\u201d he told reporters.",
    "An instrument that is being considered by some creditors is a bond that will start off with a more optimistic growth assumption, but cashflows will fall to levels projected in an IMF debt sustainability analysis in case growth falls to IMF projections, according to sources who have knowledge of the matter.",
    "GDP linked bonds have never been used in a sovereign debt re-structuring involving private creditors. But so-called value recovery instruments, which are warrants have been used. (Colombo/Mar23/2023)"
