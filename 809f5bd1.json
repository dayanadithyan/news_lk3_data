    "The People\u2019s Convention on Good Governance will be held on 25 February at the BMICH, with approximately 1600 delegates in attendance. All delegates are requested to be in their seats by 9.30 a.m. sharp.",
    "People\u2019s Convention for Good Governance Convener Richard de Zoysa said: \u201cWhen the Central Bank of Sri Lanka could not make good our nation\u2019s monthly international debt instalment, with economic collapse staring us in the face and a well-nigh unstoppable downward journey to national bankruptcy facing us, due to the\u00a0 many blunders made by our previous leaders and the then incumbent Head of State, with individuals, small groups and more vociferous gatherings endeavouring to make an impact and starting a trend of stepping out of their homes and openly protesting against power cuts, fuel and LP Gas shortages and of course the spiralling inflation rates, thus striving to uphold democracy and the right of the people. It was in this dark hour that the People\u2019s Convention for Good Governance was born.\u201d",
    "The Trust set up for this purpose includes Dr. Walter Jayasinghe, Aeshea Jayasinghe, Dr. Sarath Seneviratne, Rashantha de Alwis Seneviratne, Richard de Zoysa, Visakha Tillekeratne, Dr. Palitha Kohona, Prof. Lakshman Watawala, Ishan Jalill, Selvi Sachchithanandhan and Jeevanthi Senanayake.",
    "\u201cThe Constitution allowed a defeated party leader to enter Parliament and ascend to the highest office of the land, plotted to perfection by a now rejected majority in Parliament. Though democracy was not violated, the will and the needs of the masses was not exercised or considered in this process. With all this piling up on us almost to desperation, it was obvious our country needed fresh leadership, with professional think tanks finding solutions to counter the present and to make resolute, well planned road maps for the future, hence the birth of the People\u2019s Convention\u201d, explained Zoysa.",
    "Four forums on the Economy, Education reforms, Productivity and Exports and Ethnicity, represented by the best panellists available and moderated by experts will take place, with live telecasts including worldwide streaming, enabling maximum viewership.",
    "Dr. Pakiasothy Saravanamuttu, Shehara Parakrama, Dr. Tara de Mel, Prof. Rajiva Wijeysinha, Murtaza Jaferjee, Nahil Wijesuriya and Ishan Jalill will be present. Selvi Sachchithanandhan and Prof. Arjuna Parakrama have already confirmed to be a panellist or a moderator.",
    "An address by Jayadeva Uyangoda, an authority of the post-Independence era right up to the present day, will clearly outline the debacle that has befallen us and why this took place.",
    "Subsequent to the Q&A session, de Zoysa will announce an initiative by Dr. Sarath Seneviratne M.D. that will alleviate poverty and assist helpless entrepreneurs who lack collateral to fund their SMEs. The launch of \u2018The Arise Sri Lanka Website\u2019 and \u2018Payment Gateway initiated by Dr. Sarath Seneviratne will be commissioned by the Guest of Honour Dr. Walter Jayasinghe and Aeshea Jayasinghe who will also be the Chief of Trustees and the Treasurer of the Trust respectively. This trust will seek to be a charitable organisation where Dr. Seneviratne\u2019s initiative mooted 15 years ago for the underprivileged, will see reality on this historic day."
