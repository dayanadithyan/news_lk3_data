    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 China\u2019s Sinopec has pledged to invest in Sri Lanka\u2019s southern district of Hambantota at a meeting with the island nation\u2019s president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) said.",
    "The move comes as Beijing is looking to consolidate investments in the island nation\u2019s ports and energy sector amid increasing security concerns raised by the island nation\u2019s immediate neighbour India and the United States.",
    "Wickremesinghe under the previous government has leased the $1.5 billion port built by Beijing to state-owned Chinese firms on a 99-year lease. China\u2019s plans to establish a 15,00o-acre industrial zone around the port has yet to materialize.",
    "The PMD said a discussion took place between\u00a0the representatives of the Sinopec Group and President Wickremesinghe on Monday (13).",
    "\u201cPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the government has taken a principled decision to expand the distribution of fuel & Hambantota has been identified as a primary energy hub,\u201d the PMD said in a statement.",
    "\u201cSinopec has also pledged to invest in a refinery in Hambantota.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka has urged India to develop the energy hub of South Asia in the Eastern port district of Trincomalee. The state-run India Oil Corporation (IOC) has already signed a joint venture with the state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to develop the island nation\u2019s only oil tank farm in Trincomalee.",
    "The meeting with the Sinopec officials comes 10 days after President\u00a0Wickremesinghe directed the petroleum minister and officials to swiftly carry out a plan to revive the Trincomalee oil tank farm and incorporate it into the country\u2019s economy after an inspection tour of the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) oil tank farm in Trincomalee.",
    "Sinopec, also known as China Petrochemical Corporation, is the largest refining company and the third largest chemical company in the world. It\u00a0is the largest oil and petrochemical products supplier and the second largest oil and gas producer in China.",
    "Its total number of gas stations ranks second place in the world. It ranked 5th on Fortune\u2019s Global 500 List in 2021.",
    "China\u2019s aggressive lending to Sri Lanka along with investments of billions of dollars has raised concerns of a plan to establish a military base in Hambantota.",
    "Beijing has denied such a plan and said its move with Colombo has been always commercial.",
    "The West led by the US has blamed China\u2019s aggressive lending as a \u201cdebt trap\u201d which has led Sri Lanka to face an unprecedented economic crisis amid sovereign debt default. However, both China and Sri Lanka have denied the \u201cdebt trap\u201d accusation.",
    "China, instead, had blamed Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign borrowing, which was mostly from the Western countries, as the debt trap and reason for the crisis. (Colombo/March 13)"
