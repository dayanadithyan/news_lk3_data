  "original_body_lines": [
    "The former Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) said today the politicians in this country make decisions according to their whims and fancies and not based on data and now the politicians do not have to face that barrier.",
    "Addressing the media, former commission chairman Janaka Ratnayake said, \"Even though I was removed from the post or if the government changes, the PUCSL will not change and is still active.",
    "\"The commission should not be lost, because we need at least 10 more commissions like the PUCSL, and these commissions will need chairmen like me to change this country.\"",
    "The former chairman requested the remaining commission members continue with their duties without political interventions.",
    "\"The subject minister did not carry out his duty properly. He had gone wrong from the beginning. Instead of performing his duties, he came after me. He came after me during the past year and did what he wanted,\" he said.",
    "\"Most of the ministers who raised their voices against me used to work with me in my building for former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. They do not let me do the writing work because they have an issue with their knowledge. The issue with their knowledge should be solved because our country is like a volcano. Our country is burning from the inside, but no one can see it from the outside,\" the former chairman said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
