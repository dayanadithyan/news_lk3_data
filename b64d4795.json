    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 Oscar-winning Ke Huy Quan first shot to fame as a child actor when he played a pickpocket named Short Round opposite star Harrison Ford in the 1984 blockbuster Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which was shot in Sri Lanka. It was directed by the multiple award-winning Steven Spielberg.",
