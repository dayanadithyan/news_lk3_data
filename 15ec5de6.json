  "original_body_lines": [
    "Regulation of private bus operations remains a challenge since there are influential people like politicians, senior police officers, and officials of the Inland Revenue Department and Customs among bus owners, a Minister charged yesterday.",
    "Haphazard driving, non-issuance of tickets to passengers, speeding, ad hoc stops for boarding and dropping passengers, and non-adherence to time schedules are among major allegations against private bus operators who are responsible of 50 percent stake in the passenger transport service.",
    "Responding to a query about the failure of successive governments to regulate the bus service while improving its quality, Transport, Highways Minister Bandula Gunawardena told Daily Mirror that it had always become challenging to regulate private bus operations throughout the country. The Minister said even the increase of the number of buses plying on certain roads had become impossible.",
    "\u201cThere are politicians, Inland Revenue officials, Customs officials and senior police officers among bus operators. There are buses operating without route permits or licenses. Some people run their buses on roads on temporary route permits. We are now planning to call for tenders to operate buses on routes selected,\u201d he said.",
    "Mostly, buses built on truck chassis ply on roads, and they are uncomfortable for passenger transportation.",
    "Private buses used to operate in three categories as normal, semi-luxury and luxury services. However, the government recently scrapped the semi-luxury service. (Kelum Bandara)"
