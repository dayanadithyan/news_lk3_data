    "The main opposition party, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) led by Sajith Premadasa has decided to call for explanations from two of its parliamentarians over their behaviour at the debate and vote on Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) former Chairman Janaka Ratnayake held in parliament on 24 May.",
    "Accordingly, earlier this week the party\u2019s disciplinary committee has in writing requested an explanation from MPs Vadivel Suresh and Dr. Rajitha Senaratne over their failure to comply with the party\u2019s stance at the recent vote against Ratnayake.",
    "Prior to the vote, the SJB announced its stance publicly and said the group will vote against the Government\u2019s motion to oust Ratnayake. The SJB had also informed its parliamentary group of MPs that attendance at the vote was mandatory.",
    "However, MP Vadivel Suresh voted in favour of the Government\u2019s motion while Senaratne was a no-show at the vote. It is reported several previous transgressions of the duo have also contributed to the party\u2019s decision to call for explanations from the two MPs. An SJB stalwart said disciplinary action will be taken against the duo based on their responses."
