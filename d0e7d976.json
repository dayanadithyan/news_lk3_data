    "Not having proper management and conservation of energy is one of the main problems in Sri Lanka today, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said.",
    "While addressing a meeting at the Ministry, the Minister said that energy drives the entire world economy between countries around the world. Nothing can be done without energy, he said.",
    "\"There are various energies used in various sectors of our country. We need fuel to run vehicles, need electricity for mechanical purposes. All the activities in the country need some kind of energy,\" Premajayantha said.",
    "Out of all the energy sources, we need to select the best energy source which is clear, clean and renewable. The world is moving fast to the best energy source, he said.",
    "The cause of moving to the best energy sources is due to massive climate changes and it directly affects the island countries. The world cannot stop the damage caused to the environment but trying to mitigate the effect.",
