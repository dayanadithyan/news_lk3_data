    "The petition has mainly questioned the role of the cabinet of ministers in procuring medical supplies through unregistered private suppliers, the role of the NMRA in providing a Waiver of Registration to procure medical supplies from unregistered suppliers, non-compliance with procurement guidelines including the emergency procurement process, and abuse of process by the Minister of Health and the Chief Executive Officer of the NMRA.",

    "Health officials have said that 80 percent of the drugs brought to Sri Lanka under the Indian Credit Line system have not been registered.",
    "Sri Lanka was forced to seek Indian Credit Line to purchase its essential medicines after its unprecedented economic crisis resulted in shortage of dollars to acquire most essential drugs.",
    "The island nation\u2019s declaration of sovereign debt default deprived it from purchasing drugs on credit.",
    "India assisted with a $1 billion credit line to purchase essential foods, fuel and drugs with a condition that most of them should be bought from India if they are available, government officials have said.",
    "Health officials raised concerns when Sri Lanka\u2019s health ministry attempted to purchase drugs from unregistered companies, while registered Indian companies were available to buy the same drugs under the credit line. (Colombo/April07/2023)"
