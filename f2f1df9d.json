    "The first ODI between Ireland and Bangladesh in Chelmsford was abandoned after persistent rain, ending Ireland's hopes for automatic qualification to the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup.",
    "Eight teams have made their entry to the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, with South Africa edging Ireland for the final spot after the latter's Super League clash against Bangladesh in Chelmsford ended in a washout on Tuesday.",
    "The most recent changes in the race for automatic spots had come after Sri Lanka's unsuccessful series against New Zealand, and South Africa's two recent wins over the Netherlands in a home series.",
    "* Teams already qualified: India (hosts), New Zealand, England, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, South Africa.",
    "South Africa had given themselves every chance of qualifying automatically for this year's ICC Men's Cricket World Cup in their final series against Netherlands at home. The series victory moved the Proteas past the West Indies and into the eighth and final spot on the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup Super League standings.",
    "But their chances for automatic qualification still hinged on Ireland's ODIs against Bangladesh. A 3-0 series victory for Ireland would have brought them level on points with South Africa, assuming they incurred no penalty points.",

    "Ireland, meanwhile, will have to play the Qualifiers in Zimbabwe in June.",
    "Cricket World Cup Qualifier Teams: 10 (West Indies, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Ireland, Netherlands, Scotland, Oman, Nepal, USA, UAE).",
    "Zimbabwe and Netherlands finished bottom of the Super League table and will head straight to the Qualifier. Scotland, Oman and Nepal finished in the top three of League 2 and booked their place in the World Cup Qualifier.",
    "Nepal finished top three in dramatic fashion, winning 11 of their last 12 matches, overtaking Namibia to finish third in an incredible comeback story.",
    "After disappointing League 2 campaigns, USA and UAE bounced back in the Qualifier Play-off in April, ensuring their top-two finishes on the penultimate day of the competition. (ICC)"
