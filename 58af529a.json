    "Members of the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) will meet with Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena today to discuss matters relating to the Local Government elections.",
    "The meeting has been scheduled after the ECSL requested a meeting with the Premier in light of the issues that have arisen relating to the holding of the Local Bodies polls. According to Elections Commissioner General Saman Sri Ratnayake, the ECSL will hold a key meeting with its members tomorrow to further discuss the same. On the day the ECSL is expected to announce if the polls can go ahead as scheduled on 25 April.",
    "Last month the ECSL postponed the postal vote for the Local Government election indefinitely. Accordingly, the ECSL announced that the vote scheduled to take place from 28 - 30 March and 3 April will not go ahead as planned. It has also been predicted that the Local Government poll set for 25 April will likely be delayed as the Treasury has failed to release the funds required despite repeated requests by the ECSL and the Government Printer. ECSL Chairman Nimal Punchihewa recently expressed his doubts on the possibility of holding polls on 25 April as planned. Election Monitors have also expressed their concerns. Speaking to the media recently, People\u2019s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFEREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said it is unlikely the polls will be held on 25 April.",
