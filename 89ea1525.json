    "The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Shavendra Silva has sent a letter of demand to MP Wimal Weerawansa for allegedly making defamatory remarks on him recently.",
    "Accordingly, General Silva, through his lawyers has forwarded a letter of demand over MP Wimal Weerawansa\u2019s outright lies and baseless allegations of complicity in an alleged conspiracy to overthrow the government during Weerawansa's speech at the book launch of \u2018Nine: The Hidden Story\u2019 at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute on the evening of 25 April and the book itself.",
    "It is also alleged that the MP made similar statements on a TV programme \u2018Salakuna\u2019 aired by Hiru TV and on several other occasions.",
    "General Shavendra Silva in his letter of demand has further claimed \u201c....the statements made by the MP on him and the Sri Lanka Army are absolutely false and baseless. It is said that they have been fabricated and published with the mala fide and ulterior motive to defame General Shavendra Silva and tarnish his hard-earned good name and reputation, both locally and overseas, over his unblemished service to the nation for nearly 40 years. Also, the MP has purely targeted his political acquisitions through such indecent acts.\u201d"
