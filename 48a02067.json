    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Paper marking of GCE Advanced Level exam has been delayed again as teachers withdrew from duties after Sri Lankan government failed to pay the promised allowances, All Ceylon Teachers Union said.",
    "Teachers were promised an allowance of 15,000 rupees, however, the Union complained that only 10,000 rupee was given by the government for the teachers who have been involved in paper correction in over 30 centers across the country.",
    "\u201cAs many teachers are stationed in examination centres away from their home towns, the government promised a 15,000-rupee allowance for these teachers,\u201d Joseph Stalin, the Secretary of the All Ceylon Teacher\u2019s Union, told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cHowever, due to the constraints imposed by the dwindling treasury, the examinations department states they can only pay 10,000 rupees. This is insufficient to cover the teacher\u2019s expenses and has led to protests.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, upon inquiry denying the allegations, the Examination Commissioner Amith Jayasundara said, allowance was specified earlier.",
    "\u201cThere was no such promise of a 15,000 rupee advance,\u201d Jayasundara told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cThis was merely a consideration that was discarded after consulting the financial regulations.\u00a0We have decided on a performance-based pay system with 10,000 rupees being paid after five days of paper marking.\u201d (Colombo/May 29/2023)"
