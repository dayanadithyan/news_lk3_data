    "Former national rugby football player Chula Dharmadasa was appointed as Chairman of a Standing Committee to stabilize the administrative structure of Sri Lanka Rugby (SLR) after Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe dissolved SLR.",
    "Ranasinghe on Monday withdrew a gazette that was issued by former Sports Minister Namal Rajapaksa that suspended SLR and has replaced the elected committee headed by Rizly Illyas with this nine-member committee to oversee amendments to the SLR constitution.",
    "President\u2019s Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe will serve as Secretary of the Committee, while President of Havelock SC Thusitha Peiris will serve as Treasurer.",
    "Also in the committee are Damitha Vitharanage, Kishan Musafer, Savantha de Saram, Group Captain Subash Jayatilleke, Pradeep Basnayake and Brigadier (rtd) Sunil Ranasinghe.",
    "\u201cThe sport has fallen to a new low in the last two years and this committee will also be expected to discuss with various stakeholders and uplift the sport again,\u201d Ranasinghe said.",
    "\u201cThe sport has also lost a significant amount of corporate backing in the last two years, to the effect of Rs. 180 million. We want to bring those sponsors back,\u201d the Minister added.",
    "\u201cEach member of this committee is also expected to work with one provincial to facilitate the changes required at SLR.\u201d",

    "\u201cNot being able to compete under the Sri Lanka flag was a big disadvantage for us, so we hope that after these discussions we will be able to compete under the national flag again,\u201d Ranasinghe said.",
    "\u201cWe have missed many international competitions in men\u2019s and women\u2019s rugby and that has led to a decline in the sport,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cThe men\u2019s team were fourth in Asia in 2014, but now we are seventh. We have dropped seven places in the World Rankings as well, currently at 46.\u201d",
    "The committee has given the primary task of amending the voting structure at SLR, where currently only Provincial Unions are eligible to vote.",
    "\u201cIn several provinces, their clubs do not even have players, but the provinces still retain their voting rights,\u201d the Minister said.",
    "The Daily Mirror learns that the amended structure is expected to give voting rights to \u201cA\u201d Division clubs, while retaining the rights of Provincial Unions if they meet a new criteria.",
    "They will be required to play in either an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d Division tournament, organized by SLR, if they wish to maintain their voting rights."
