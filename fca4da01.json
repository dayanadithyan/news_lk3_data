    "The Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) today expressed displeasure that the payments that had to be made to the staff members who performed their duties scrutinising GCE Advanced Level (A/L) and Ordinary Level (O/L) answer scripts have not been completely settled as yet.",
    "The CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin said that Rs. 2.5 billion had not been paid for the scrutiny of answer scripts and it could hamper future exam duties.",
    "\"The scrutinising of answer scripts for several subjects had begun after a long delay. Due to a delay in settling the advance payments for the officials, the commencement of exam duties today was delayed at nearly 13 examination centres, though the examination department had agreed to pay off the advanced payment by today and tomorrow.",
    "The CTU warned if the promised payments were not settled, it would directly affect the scrutinising of answer scripts of the remaining subjects.",
    "Stalin claimed that the 2022 O/L examination is scheduled to begin on May 29 and that any failure to make such payments, would affect national examinations.",
    "Therefore, the CTU requested that the ministry should take immediate steps to settle this issues for the smooth release of the exam results. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
