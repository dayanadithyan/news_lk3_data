  "original_body_lines": [
    "Asks speaker to conduct an inquiry if Treasury Secretary has violated parliamentary privileges by failing to release funds for LG polls approved by Parliament",
    "SJB\u2019s Palitha Madduma Bandara assures people the Opposition will continue its fight for elections",
    "G.L. accuses Govt. of attempting to interfere in court proceedings through the Parliament",
    "Says Parliament has no right to order the Supreme Court on any of its legal proceedings and functions",
    "The Opposition yesterday submitted a request in writing to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywaradane, calling for a probe on the Treasury Secretary over possible violation of parliamentary privileges by his failure to release necessary funds for the local Government election.",
    "Holding a special press conference in Parliament following the submission, the joint opposition condemned the failure to hold polls and attempts to intimidate the country\u2019s judiciary. Speaking to the media, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara said the joint opposition has taken all the possible steps to ensure the local Government election goes ahead in order to protect the country\u2019s democracy and the sovereignty of the people. He also assured the opposition will continue to fight for the polls.",
    "Madduma Bandara said a privileges-related issue was raised on how the Treasury Secretary could continue to withhold funds approved by the Parliament. \u201cWe noted it violates the MP privileges,\u201d he said, adding that they will continue to fight for it. \u201cWe have even filed a contempt of court petition against the Treasury Secretary,\u201d he said.",
    "Also addressing the press conference, Freedom People\u2019s Congress member MP Prof. G.L. Peiris said the most dangerous phenomenon is that attempts are being made through the Parliament to halt the hearing of a petition before the court. \u201cThey are asking for all legal proceedings to stop. The Parliament has no right to order the Supreme Court on which cases they can take up and which cases they must drop, how the petitions must be heard or the call to justify before Parliament the judgements delivered,\u201d Peiris said. The MP said all opposition parties will stand together to protect the independence of the judiciary and the country\u2019s rule of law."
