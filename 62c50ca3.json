    "Member of Parliament Diana Gamage and Minister of Justice Wijayadasa Rajapakshe had engaged in a verbal battle at the meeting of a special committee appointed to enhance higher education opportunities for youth held at the Parliamentary complex on Tuesday.",
    "It was reported that MP Gamage was asked to leave the committee room by Minister Rajapakshe who was the chair. She has been accused of aggressive behaviour according to reports.",
    "However, Gamage told Daily Mirror that she was asked to leave as she objected to MP Chandima Weerakkody speaking at the meeting as soon as he arrived. \u201c A Chairperson of a committee has no right to chase a member. Even the Speaker cannot send out an MP whenever he wants. If the Speaker had such a right he would have chased many MPs out of the chamber as many of them misbehave,\u201d she said. (Yohan Perera)"
