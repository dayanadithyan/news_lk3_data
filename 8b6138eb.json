    "Good luck came early for four SriLankan Airlines\u2019 passengers flying out on Sinhala and Tamil New Year\u2019s Day, when they were selected at random for free upgrades to Business Class. The airline\u2019s e-commerce team organized the surprise draw at Bandaranaike International Airport to reward and delight online customers of the airline in celebration of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. The lucky flyers were able to indulge in all the comforts and trimmings of SriLankan\u2019s Serendib Business Class Lounge before boarding Business Class for an equally deluxe journey warmed by traditional SriLankan hospitality, to their next destination.",
