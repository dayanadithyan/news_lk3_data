    "Even though the price of Lanka auto diesel was reduced by Rs. 15 from yesterday, the Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) has decided not to reduce the bus fares.",
    "LPBOA chairman Gemunu Wijerathne told the Daily Mirror that the decision was taken until the government implements the travel card system.",
    "\"Without implementing the travel card system, the benefits of the fuel price reduction will not go to the people.",
    "\"Several private fuel companies will be involved in the country's fuel distribution soon.",
    "\"They will sell their fuel at a lower price than the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). So, it is essential to implement the travel card system with immediate effect,\" Wijerathne said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
