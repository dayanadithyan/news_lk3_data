    "COLOMBO (News 1st); His Excellency Most Rev. Dr. Brian Udaigwe, the Apostolic Nuncio of Sri Lanka, said that the truth behind the Easter Attacks continues to evade us.",
    "His Excellency was speaking at a memorial event organized to remember the victims of the 2019 April Terror Attacks.",
    "\"The Holy See condemns terrorism in the strongest terms and recalls that terrorism can only be countered by more cohesive measures at the international level,\" he added.",
    "Most Rev. Dr. Brian Udaigwe said as terror knows no border, the international community as a whole must deny terrorists access to cyber technologies to recruit new adherence from different parts of the world or finance their activities and coordinate terror attacks.",
    "\"No one should be allowed to finance or to provide arms and ammunition to terrorists,\" he stressed.",
    "He went on to note that the tragic event of that fateful morning 4 years ago, which cost death and great suffering, is still fresh in the minds of the people, particularly of the directly affected.",
    "\"We grieve that the truth behind it is still evading us, the commemoration ceremonies are definitely not to seek revenge but to pray, and seek justice for the innocent victims,\" he added.",
    "\"At the same time, we recall that such contemptible acts go against the teachings of the four major religions practiced on this beautiful island and which are reservedly condemned in the act. I earnestly appeal that we continue to pray for the victims, they're martyrs of the attacks, that they remain in the presence of god,\" said Most Rev. Dr. Brian Udaigwe.",
    "\"As we renew our commitment to never let such atrocities happen again, I wish to conclude in the words of the 44th President of the United States of America, Barack Obama. He says no religion is responsible for terrorism. People are responsible for violence and terrorism. I bring to all the affected and all Sri Lankans the blessing of the holy father, Pope Francis,\" noted Most Rev. Dr. Brian Udaigwe.",
