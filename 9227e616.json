    "He extended his gratitude to the Supreme Court for the interim order delivered on the Local Government polls last week and said the Government must now prepare to face an election by force of circumstances. He said the Supreme Court\u2019s intervention to remove all impediments to conducting the election was also a major relief to the Elections Commission.",

    "He also called on the Election Commission to announce the new date for elections without any further delay. \u201cThe IGP and the Government Printer must stop obstructing the elections and extend their support to hold the vote,\u201d he said. The MP noted that the Supreme Court decision has allowed the Treasury Secretary to act independently and any failure to adhere to the court order will be an offence."
