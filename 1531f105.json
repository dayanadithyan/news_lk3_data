    "Even though the Federation of University Teachers' Associations (FUTA) had requested the President for a discussion regarding the issues relating to the scrutiny of 2022 (2023) GCE Advanced Level (A/L) answer scripts, the President has left the country even without giving them an appointment for a discussion, the Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) said.",
    "Addressing the media, CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin said that the issues relating to the scrutiny of A/L answer scripts have gone from bad to worse.",
    "\"The FUTA had requested the discussion a week before. Leaving the country without having had a discussion is not fair. It is a question of who is responsible for the disruption of the scrutiny of A/L answer scripts,\" he said.",
    "Therefore, the FUTA must take a stern decision in this regard. This shows that this government does not want to provide any solutions to the said issue. This also shows that this government does not want to provide solutions to the demands by the FUTA, Stalin added. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
