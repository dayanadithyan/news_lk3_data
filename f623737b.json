  "original_title": "From \u201cNamo Namo\u201d to \u201cSri Lanka Matha\u201d: How Lanka\u2019s National Anthem was Amended Due to Superstition.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka is  experiencing a tremendous economic crisis. Several  knowledgeable persons describe  the current period as the worst ever phase in the Island nation\u2019s post-Independence history. Many acts of omission and commission  are being faulted for this calamity. Mercifully none have blamed Lanka\u2019s national anthem as the cause so far.",
    "This however was  not the situation in the late fifties and early sixties of the 20th century. The national anthem of Ceylon as Sri Lanka was known then was made the scapegoat for the country\u2019s ills. Superstition reigned supreme and the first line of the  national anthem was amended without the consent of Ananda Samarakoon  who wrote the song.This  insensitive and superstitious action, drastically affected the poet who lamented that his head has been cut off. Ultimately  the  sensitive author  committed suicide on 5 April 1962.",
    "An extremely troubling aspect in the  controversial history of  Lanka\u2019s national anthem was the tragic plight of its creator.The poet was star crossed in many ways. It is against this backdrop that I focus  \u2013 with the aid of my earlier writings \u2013  on the tragic tale of  Ananda Samarakoon and his  composition  this week.",
    "A national anthem is a song of patriotic sentiment affirming loyalty to one\u2019s country or nation adopted officially by that Country or Nation. An anthem becomes a national anthem through Constitutional provision, specific legislation or long \u2013 standing tradition.",
    "\u201cGod save the King/Queen\u201d had become the British National Anthem by 1745. With the British empire expanding gradually \u201cGod save the King/Queen\u201d was sung as the National Anthem in all countries and territories ruled by the British.  Ceylon  as Sri Lanka was known then was no exception. Under Queen Victoria\u2019s rule \u201cGod save the Queen\u201d became in practice the National Anthem for Ceylon too. This continued throughout the twentieth century until the end of colonialrule.",
    "When Ceylon gained full independence from the British, there was no approved indigenous National Anthem to be sung .The Lanka Gandharva Sabha was assigned the task of sanctioning  a National Anthem. A competition was organized and a panel formed by the Sabha was entrusted the duty of selecting an appropriate anthem.This panel comprised SLB Kapukotuwa, Dr.OHD Wijesekera, Lionel Edirisinghe, Mudliyar EA Abeysekera, LLK Gunatunga and PB Illangasinghe.",
    "In a controversial decision, two of the panellists were declared winners.A song written by PB Illangasinghe and set to music by Lionel Edirisinghe was announced to be the new National Anthem.It began as \u2013 \u201cSri Lanka Matha/Pala Yasa Mahima/Jaya Jaya\u201d and ended as \u201cJaya Jaya Dada Nanga/Sri Lanka Matha\u201d.The fact that a song submitted by two members of the selection panel had \u201cwon\u201d the national song competition evoked widespread resentment and protests.It was seen as blatantly unfair.",
    "Although the song by the Illangasinghe-Edirisinghe duo was broadcast over the then  \u201cRadio Ceylon\u201d on the morning of Independence day as the national song it was not sung at the official Freedom Day ceremony due to protests .",
    "While the song itself was flawless and above reproach it was the perception of favouritism in the decision to adopt it that fuelled criticism and protests. Thus the song which won the national song competition was unacceptable as far as the people were concerned and began losing credibility.",
    "Meanwhile another song was slowly beginning to capture popular imagination of the people as a potential National Anthem. This was the famous \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d written by Ananda Samarakoon, who was a well-known painter as well as poet.",
    "Ananda Samarakoon was born on January 13, 1911 in a small village, Liyanwela, near Watareka in the Padukka area. His parents, Samuel Samarakoon and Dominga Pieris were Christians. The son was christened George Wilfred. His full name was Egodahage George Wilfred Alwis Samarakoon. There was no Ananda in his name then and he was known as George Wilfred during his childhood and early twenties.",
    "Young George Wilfred studied at Christian College, Kotte (now Sri Jayewardenepura MMV). In 1934, he joined the staff of Christian College, as a teacher of art and music. Inspired by Rabindranath Tagore, George Wilfred joined Shantinekathan, Tagore\u2019s School of Fine Arts in Bengal.He joined Shantinekathan in 1936 and studied art under the famous Bengali artist Nanda Lal Bose, and music and singing under Shanti Devi Gosh.",
    "He came back to Lanka  in 1937 without completing his course and started teaching again. Upon his return George Wilfred became known as Ananda Samarakoon. In 1940, he joined the staff of Mahinda College, Galle.",
    "The genesis of \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d is interesting. It  was not written originally for the purpose of being a National Anthem.Ananda  Samarakoon used to pay frequent trips to India even after his academic pursuit at \u201cShanthiniketan\u201d  had ended.On one occasion he returned from India by air on his first ever plane trip. Samarakoon looking down  from the skies was enthralled and excited at the sight of his native land . He jotted down a few words and lines that came to mind immediately after landing.",
    "On October 20th 1940 he was at his ancestral residence in Padukka. Unable to sleep he tossed and turned in his bed. Suddenly he got up at about 10 pm and began writing a tribute to his motherland relying on the short notes written after his air trip from India. Samarakoon wrote late into the night and the immortal \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d was born. He then took it to Mahinda College where he was teaching and taught it to students after setting it to music.",
    "The song became popular and was included in a musical record in 1946. Being a fine singer himself Samarakoon recorded the song with his partner Swarna de Silva the sister of famous flautist Dunstan de Silva. The song was also included in a book of poems published by him. It was called \u201cGeetha Kumudini\u201d.",
    "Sadly Samarakoon was unable to re-imburse the printing costs incurred to the printer R.K.W Siriwardena and handed over copyright to him.Samarakoon was to regret this later when his creation came to be acknowledged as the National Anthem.",
    "When the Gandarva Sabha conducted the competition to select a national song Samarakoon was away from the Island in India, but his wife and brother had submitted \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d for the competition. Though fully deserving it was overlooked and \u201cSri Lanka Matha,Yasa Mahima\u201d by the Illangasinghe-Edirisinghe duo was selected.",
    "Despite \u201cwinning\u201d the competition \u201cYasa Mahima\u201d was spurned by most people because of the manner in which it was declared the winner. \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d without any official status was enjoying wide exposure and popular acclaim. Its popularity among ordinary people was so great that public opinion favoured \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d over \u201cYasa Mahima\u201d.",
    "The song became famous after a 50 member choir from Musaeus College,Colombo sang it on a public occasion. It was also broadcast on Radio frequently. \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d though without official  recognition was now becoming popular as the \u201cde-facto\u201d National Anthem.",
    "In 1950 the then Finance Minister JR Jayewardene presented a cabinet memorandum that the widely popular \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d be formally acknowledged as the official anthem. Prime Minister D.S Senanayake set up a Parliamentary Select Committee under Home Affairs and Rural Development Minister Sir E.A.P Wijeratne (Father of Dr.Nissanka Wijeratne) to finalise the issue. The committee headed by Wijeratne considered \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d and some other lyrics and decided that Samarakoon\u2019s song should be made the National Anthem.",
    "There was however a minor hitch. The committee wanted a minor change in the words. The song had originally been composed when the country was under the British.Now it was independent.It was therefore felt that the 10th line in the song was inappropriate and had to be changed. Samarakoon was then in India and returned home in mid -1951 after being summoned by Sir Edwin AP Wijeratne. Samarakoon agreed to change the line. So the line \u201cNawa Jeewana Damine\u201d was altered to \u201cNawa Jeewana Demine Nithina Apa Pubudu Karan Matha\u201d with the wholehearted consent and approval of Ananda Samarakoon. Sir E.A.P Wijeratne then presented a Cabinet paper in August 1951 recommending \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d as the National Anthem.",
    "It was unanimously approved by Cabinet and formally adopted on November 22, 1951. Four years after getting freedom, \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d was sung at Independence Day ceremonies as the official National Anthem on February 4, 1952.",
    "While Namo Namo Matha was now being sung as the official anthem there was no uniformity in the melody or manner of singing. Different choirs and singers were rendering it in different ways.This was causing much confusion.So the Government decided to appoint a committee to ensure that uniformity was ensured in rendering the National Anthem.An eleven member committee was appointed in 1953. Among its members were Ananda Samarakoon himself, Devar Suryasena and JDA Perera.",
    "This committee set out guidelines as to how the anthem should be sung and also defined the exact tune for it.The melody was a refined version of the original tune composed by Samarakoon. On June 24, 1954 the Cabinet of Sir John Kotelawela formally endorsed the tune and singing of the National Anthem. The reputed firm Cargills, then agents for HMV Records, was given the order to make records of the National Anthem.",
    "The copyright ownership of \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d was formally acquired by the Government after the payment of Rupees 2500 on June 24, 1954.The money however did not go to Ananda Samarakoon as he had already transferred copyright to Siriwardena the printing press owner who had first published the song in a book of poems.",
    "Having one\u2019s composition officially recognized as the National Anthem was indeed a great achievement. Ananda Samarakoon having accomplished this feat was entitled to bask in glory after reaching that milepost. Alas!That was not to be so.Instead of a dream existence there commenced an ordeal that turned out to be a cruel nightmare for the poet.",
    "In 1956 S.W.R.D Bandaranaike became Prime Minister riding the crest of a Sinhala nationalist wave. The new Government hailed as \u201cApey Aanduwe\u201d ran into a series of problems and difficulties soon. There were political demonstrations against the government, strikes by workers, communal violence and natural disasters like floods, fires and landslides.",
    "In the search for scapegoats certain elements (with vested interests perhaps) pounced upon the National Anthem.In a burst of superstitious or irrational frenzy \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d was singled out as the cause for all the troubles afflicting the country under the Bandaranaike dispensation. A vicious campaign was launched against \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d.",
    "The charge was that the notations in \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d were unlucky and the cause for the country\u2019s ills and misfortunes. The letter \u201cNa\u201d at the beginning was described as a malefix.The inauspicious \u201cGanaka\u201d or \u201cGana\u201d at the beginning of the National Anthem had an ill-effect on the country it was alleged. A \u2018gana\u2019 is the placing of the first three syllables \u2013 how the long and short syllables occur. The opening words of the anthem \u2018na-mo-na\u2019 short-long-short constituted an unlucky gana it was stated.",
    "As criticism mounted Ananda Samarakoon was constrained to defend himself against the charges. He engaged in many newspaper debates and also spoke at public meetings in defence of \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d.",
    "To make matters worse Samarakoon had   huge financial difficulties. Although he conducted a regular programme on the Educational service run by \u201cRadio Ceylon\u201d his creative compositions did not meet with much commercial success.He produced a song and dance pageant \u201cAmaraneeya Lanka\u201d in 1957 but it was a major flop. The onslaught against \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d destroyed Samarakoon\u2019s peace of mind.",
    "In September 1959, Prime Minister S.W.R.D Bandaranaike was assassinated. Elections to Parliament in March 1960 saw a hung Parliament emerge. Dudley Senanayake\u2019s short lived minority government fell. Fresh elections were called. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was swept to power in July 1960. Bandaranaike\u2019s widow Sirima became Prime Minister.The new Government took the campaign against \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d seriously.",
    "The Home and Cultural Affairs Minister Maithripala Senanayake appointed a committee of \u201cexperts\u201d to examine the issue and determine whether the National Anthem was the cause of the country\u2019s troubles.",
    "The committee recommended that the words \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d be changed to \u201cSri Lanka Matha\u201d. Ananda Samarakoon protested vehemently and opposed the proposed change.",
    "The Government however went ahead and unilaterally amended the National Anthem from \u201cNamo Namo Matha\u201d to \u201cSri Lanka Matha\u201d in February 1961. Ananda Samarakoon\u2019s consent was not obtained.Since copyright was now vested with the Government there was no legal remedy available to the poet to prevent this arbitrary action.",
    "The act however had a distressing and debilitating effect on the poet.Senior journalist Kumudini Hettiarachchi wrote a poignant article about Ananda Samarakoon in the \u201cSunday Times\u201d some years ago.In that article she quoted the poet\u2019s nephew Sunil Samarakoon about how the matter affected his uncle.",
    "One day when Sunil was eleven years old his uncle had parked his baby Austin car near the gates and shouted out to Sunil \u201cPuthe ,Mage oluwa galawala, wena ekak hikarala\u201d (son my head has been removed and another fixed instead)\u201cWhen Loku Thaththa told me that his head had been removed and another placed there, I was just a child and didn\u2019t catch the significance, until much later. He was, of course, referring to the substitution of Namo, Namo Matha, with Sri Lanka Matha in the National Anthem,\u201d said Sunil Samarakoon, nephew of Ananda Samarakoon, the composer of Sri Lanka\u2019s National Anthem.",
    "\u201cI remember the day he came home to talk to my father, as he usually did when he had a problem. When I went to greet him as soon as he parked his car, he put his hand on my shoulder and said those words about the oluva (head) in despair. He was never the same again. He became morose. They had changed it without even consulting him.\u201d Wrote Kumudini quoting Sunil.",
    "On April 5th 1962 Ananda Samarakoon was found dead.. His door was broken open as he was not answering knocks on his door. The inquest revealed that he had died of an overdose of sleeping tablets. There was a letter on his desk to then opposition leader Dudley Senanayake complaining of how his anthem had been mutilated. There was also a serene painting on his easel of Lord Buddha meditating and a deer looking on.",
    "A few days before his death, Samarakoon wrote a letter to the \u2018Timesman\u2019 column on the \u201cTimes of Ceylon\u201d newspaper .He wrote, \u201cThe anthem has been beheaded. It has not only destroyed the song, but also destroyed the life of the composer. I am frustrated and broken-hearted. It is a misfortune to live in a country where such things happen to a humble composer. Death would be preferable\u201d.",
    "This then was the tragic fate  of the poet who authored  the National Anthem of Sri Lanka.",
