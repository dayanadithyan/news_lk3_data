    "The new anti-corruption law would incorporate provisions to deal with people who make false accusations on politicians of being involved in fraud and corruption, SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam said today.",
    "He told a news conference that there were strong laws in India to protect national leaders and leaders who saved their country and said such laws were required in Sri Lanka as well.",
    "The MP said there was a situation in Sri Lanka where national leaders and leaders who saved the country were labelled as thieves without any basis and were removed from politics while those who destroyed this country and did nothing constructive for the country were being highlighted.",
    "\"Those who label national leaders as thieves are failed people. This is a sorry state of affairs and a bad situation for the country. If this situation continues, no progressive people will come to politics. The best thing we can do is to bring in a strong anti-corruption law,\" he said.",
    "He said the new anti-corruption law would be brought in by April and passed in parliament. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
