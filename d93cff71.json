    "Sri Lankan batter Angelo Mathews said today that it is so disappointing to see Sri Lanka will be playing only five Test matches this year.",
    "\"It's really disappointing.\u00a0 We are coming off a long layoff, the last Test match was 6 months ago. Everyone's talking about Test cricket is dying, but we are not doing any good for Test cricket, playing only 5 Test matches a year is not enough,\" he said.",
    "Mathews overtook former skipper Sanath Jayasuriya and became just the third Sri Lankan player to have scored 7000 Test runs, as Sri Lanka made a good start on the first day of the first Test against New Zealand at Christchurch.",
    "Mathews scored a valuable 47 on the opening day at Basin Reserve, with Sri Lanka reaching 305/6 at stumps to keep their slim hopes alive of reaching June's ICC World Test Championship final against Australia.",
    "Sri Lanka need to clinch a 2-0 series sweep over the Kiwis in New Zealand and rely on India not defeating Australia in the concurrent Test in Ahmedabad to reach the World Test Championship decider and they gave themselves every chance of doing so on Thursday after they were sent into bat first by Black Caps captain Tim Southee."
