    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has sharply overperformed on a 2022 primary deficit target in an interim budget prepared ahead of an International Monetary Fund program, partly helped by inflation and tight expenditure controls, Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardene said.",
    "Sri Lanka has reported a primary deficit (overall deficit minus interest) of 3.7 percent of gross domestic product for 2022, but that includes on-lending to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, he told a forum organized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.",
    "Proceeds of an Indian credit line advanced to the CPC was 700 million US dollar or about 250 billion rupees.",
    "Excluding that the primary deficit was about 2.7 percent of GDP, Siriwardene pointed out.",
    "It was a correction of 300 basis points compared to 6.0 percent in 2022.",
    "The correction was made with higher taxes, party driven but also due to strict expenditure controls (spending based consolidation) he said.",
    "Each month tax revenues are around 160 to 170 billion rupees.",
    "Out of that about 93 to 94 billion rupees go for salaries, Siriwardene said.",
    "Another 30 to 35 billion went for pensions and Samurdhi welfare payments. About 7 to 10 billion went for medicines.",
    "\u201cYou are left for 20 to 25 billion rupees for all other things,\u201d Siriwardene said.",
    "Sri Lanka has curtailed capital spending and amid the crisis. Salaries have been held down, which will have to go up when conditions normalize."
