    "TEHRAN, AFP: Regional powerhouses Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed Friday to restore ties and reopen diplomatic missions in a surprise, Chinese-brokered announcement that could have wide-ranging implications across the Middle East.",
    "In a trilateral statement, Shiite-majority Iran and mainly Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia said they would reopen embassies and missions within two months and implement security and economic cooperation deals signed more than 20 years ago.",
    "Riyadh cut ties after Iranian protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions in 2016 following the Saudi execution of revered Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr \u2013 just one in a series of flashpoints between the two longstanding rivals.",
    "Friday\u2019s announcement, which follows five days of previously unannounced talks in Beijing and several rounds of dialogue in Iraq and Oman, caps a broader realignment and efforts to ease tensions in the region.",
    "\u201cFollowing talks, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have agreed to resume diplomatic relations and reopen embassies and missions within two months,\u201d said the joint statement, which was published by both countries\u2019 official media.",
    "The detente between Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, and Iran, a pariah for Western governments over its nuclear activities, has the potential to reshape relations across a region characterised by turbulence for decades.",
    "Iran and Saudi Arabia support rival sides in several conflict zones including Yemen, where the Huthi rebels are backed by Tehran and Riyadh leads a military coalition supporting the Government. The two sides also vie for influence in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq.",
    "\u201cIt kind of sets the scene for the region\u2019s two superpowers to start to hash out their differences,\u201d said Dina Esfandiary of the International Crisis Group.",
    "\u201cThe potential downside of that, of course, is that if they are the ones who are divvying up the region and sorting things out amongst themselves, you start to lose sight of regional contexts and grievances, which could potentially be problematic.\u201d Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian welcomed the rapprochement and said Tehran will \u201cactively prepare other regional initiatives\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe return to normal relations between Tehran and Riyadh offers great opportunities to the two countries, the region and the Muslim world,\u201d he tweeted.",
    "Saudi Arabia\u2019s top diplomat Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said the agreement stems from the kingdom\u2019s preference for \u201cpolitical solutions and dialogue\u201d \u2013 an approach it wants to see become the norm in the region.",
    "Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar all hailed the announcement.",
    "The White House too welcomed the deal, but said it remains to be seen whether the Iranians will \u201cmeet their obligations\u201d.",
    "The head of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group, called the agreement a \u201cgood development\u201d.",
    "\u201cIt could open new horizons in the region,\u201d said Hassan Nasrallah, who is often critical of Saudi Arabia.",

    "Sandwiched between Iran and Saudi Arabia, Iraq had hosted several rounds of talks since April 2021. Those encounters were held at a relatively low-level, involving security and intelligence officials.",
    "Amir-Abdollahian had said in July that the two countries were ready to move talks to a higher-level, in the political and public spheres.",
    "But no talks had been publicly announced since April last year."
