    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s President Ranil Wickremesinghe, has suggested blocking share transfers of privatized plantations companies, according to a statement, in a move that may tend to undermine private property rights and curtail the benefits of private ownership.",
    "President Wickremesinghe had met members of a \u2018Plantations Reforms Committee\u2019.",
    "\u201cDuring the meeting, the President suggested that companies should not be allowed to sell their shareholdings without the consent of the government once they have been given land,\u201d the statement said.",
    "The suggested blocking of the shareholder rights is the latest in twist in a undermining private property rights involved in plantations.",
    "A key advantage of share transfer is that firms that see more value or have more financial strength are able to take-over any plantation that is not managed under optimal conditions from a less skilled owner without the state getting involved, analysts say.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Agalawatte Plantations, which was making losses under previous ownership was taken over by new owners who injected around two billion rupees to turn the firm around.",
    "Any restrictions on share transfers and greater state interference in private property would undermine the trend, advocates of economic freedom say.",
    "Plantations have land \u2013 especially those near fast growing area \u2013  which can be used innovatively going beyond simple agriculture, provided state interference is reduce.",
    "The state already has methods of blocking private innovation in the listed regional plantations companies through tools like a so-called \u2018Golden Share\u2019.",
    "President Wickremesinghe had also said that \u201cthe issue of gemming should also be addressed\u201d the statement said without elaborating.",
    "Plantations were originally expropriated from local and foreign shareholders by the state after independence shattering freehold rights of the people which had developed during European rule and also destroying investment security of foreign investments.",
    "As a result, a constitutional guarantee was given for property rights by then President J R Jayewardene to bring back foreign investments.",
    "However as late as 2011 several private properties were expropriated again, clouding the safety of both foreign and domestic investments.",
    "The President\u2019s statement comes as Sri Lanka has now defaulted after borrowing heavily and is trying to bring back foreign investment and privatize remaining state enterprises as well as some of the firms that were expropriated in 2011.",
    "Some political commentators have suggested that Sri Lanka expropriated private companies under Sri Lanka Freedom Party led administrations not just due to leftist or European fascist ideology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_fascism) prevailing at the time but also to extract political revenge from firms which had appeared to support the United National Party in the immediate past elections.",
    "Sri Lanka privatized plantations, which brought income to the state during the British era after they were consuming tax money every month for salaries.",
    "Initially they were sold on short term management contracts, but were later sold on lease contracts up to 20 years giving more stable ownership rights for long term equity investments. (Colombo/Apr30/2023)"
