    "Says it was a mistake to form alliance with unknown party to contest the now-postponed LG polls",
    "Claims it was fortunate LG polls did not go ahead as it saved SLFP",
    "Reveals the party will implement new plan to strengthen SLFP commencing from May Day",
    "Sri Lanka Freedom Party Leader and former President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday vowed the party will not play second fiddle to any other political party in the future.",
    "Sirisena said agreeing to contest under the name and symbol of another party at the now-postponed local Government elections was the biggest mistake made in the party\u2019s history. \u201cThis is where we went wrong. We will not go behind any other party again. If they wish to form an alliance they may come to us,\u201d he said, adding that the SLFP will always take the lead in any such alliance formed. \u201cThis is a gigantic party that ruled this nation. It is a party that won over the world through the leadership of the Bandaranaikes. But we agreed to contest together with a party unknown to the people of this country,\u201d he said. The SLFP had reportedly agreed to contest together with the Freedom People\u2019s Congress and the Supreme Lanka Coalition at the local Government poll which was scheduled to take place on 25 April.",
    "Addressing the SLFP May Day rally held in front of the Central Market in Kandy town yesterday Sirisena said it is fortunate for the party and the people of this country that the elections were postponed. \u201cIt saved the country, its people and the SLFP,\u201d he said. The SLFP Leader said the party will always take the lead in any political movement formed in the future and will also implement a plan to further strengthen the age-old party. The party\u2019s rally was held with the participation of several leading members of the party including MPs and former ministers including Dayasiriya Jayasekara, Thilanga Sumathipala and Sajin Vass Gunawardena.",
    "Sirisena also highlighted the need to form a governance in which the law and peace will reign and where a constitution that protects human rights, justice and fairness will be implemented. \u201cIt is important to form a Government that gives prominence to national security and diplomatic relations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must attract foreign investments and strengthen the export economy, workers and State sector employees,\u201d he added. Sirisena said Sri Lanka must be converted to a people\u2019s state that empowers its citizens. The former President said the country has found itself in this state today as its monies were stolen by the corrupt. He urged people to not vote for such individuals in the future."
