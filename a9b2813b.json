  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) employees have decided to continue to halt the refilling and distribution of fuel from the oil refinery installation at Kolonnawa.",
    "The trade union action was launched in front of the oil installation in Kolonnawa against the government's move to privatize the CPC.",
    "CPC General Employees Union President Ashoka Ranwala told the media that fuel distribution to the country had come to a standstill due to trade union action.",
    "They challenged Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera for his decision to privatize the CPC. Ranwala claimed that they have the power to stop the distribution process across the country and not to underestimate their ability.",
    "\"They said that the ongoing trade union action will continue today. If the minister or the president do not listen to the CPC trade unions, they have decided to engage in a massive countrywide trade union action with the support of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).",
    "Ranwala told the minister not to propel them to go for massive trade union action and take immediate action to roll back the cabinet decision, which led to selling the stakes owned by the government institutions to private companies.",
    "The trade union demanded that the minister should present himself for a discussion with them today and said they would advise the minister how to gain profit. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrame)"
