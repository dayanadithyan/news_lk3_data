    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung has expressed her disappointment over a book authored by a Sri Lankan MP detailing an alleged US-backed regime-change conspiracy, which Chung said should be labelled fiction.",
    "\u201cI am disappointed that an MP has made baseless allegations and spread outright lies in a book that should be labeled \u2018fiction\u2019. For 75 years, the US [and Sri Lanka] have shared commitments to democracy, sovereignty, and prosperity \u2013 a partnership and future we continue to build together,\u201d Chung tweeted Wednesday April 26 evening.",
    "I am disappointed that an MP has made baseless allegations and spread outright lies in a book that should be labeled \u201cfiction.\u201d \u00a0For 75 years, the US & SL have shared commitments to democracy, sovereignty, and prosperity \u2013 a partnership and future we continue to build together.",
    "The ambassador\u2019s remark was a thinly veiled reference to a recently published book by MP Wimal Weerawansa, a Marxist-turned-nationalist politician with a penchant for conspiracy theories that allude to US-led Western imperialist forces looking to destabilise global south states like Sri Lanka. The firebrand MP, widely seen as pro-China and pro-Russia in his foreign policy outlook, was also an influential cabinet minister of several governments headed by former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "On Wednesday, at the launch of his book Nine: The Hidden Story, Weerawansa spoke of an alleged plot to assassinate then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa during the youth-led Aragalaya anti-government protests of 2022. The protests, which for weeks sustained their peaceful disposition, intensified after pro-government elements launched an unprovoked attack on peaceful protestors gathered at Colombo on May 09, which then led to retaliatory mob violence island-wide. One government MP was killed and the residences of several legislators were torched in the chaos that ensued.",
    "At Wednesday\u2019s event, Weerawansa claimed that a conspiracy was hatched to assassinate President Rajapaksa and top military officials and have the Speaker of Parliament take over as head of an interim government. This scheme was to unfold around the second week of July before Rajapaksa resigned after fleeing the country, according to the MP\u2019s purported revelation.",
    "The former MP even claimed that the absence of former Army Commander Gen Shavendra Silva from the country the previous day was suspicious. He added that allegations of human rights violations levelled at Silva by the United Nations were, in fact, aimed at controlling him.",
    "Chung, in a move somewhat uncharacteristic of a senior Western diplomat in Sri Lanka, took to Twitter to flatly and sardonically reject the MP\u2019s claims. This\u00a0 Chinese embassy in Colombo, in contrast, has been noted for not mincing its words when responding to comments made by local politicians.",
    "The Defence Ministry, meanwhile, also released a statement on Weerawansa\u2019s remarks on Gen Silva\u2019s movements around the time of the alleged plot. The ministry said the general had flown to India to take part in a Deputy National Security Advisor Level Meeting of the Colombo Security Conclave, a security conference organised between friendly countries in the South Indian Ocean region, held on July 07.",
    "\u201cThe Ministry of Defence emphasises that under the directions and approval of the then President of Sri Lanka and the Defence Ministry, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and former Commander of the Army General Shavendra Silva participated in the Meeting representing the Government of Sri Lanka,\u201d the Defence Ministry said.",
    "Political analysts speculate that the particular strain of nationalism, which is far from fringe, represented by the likes of Weerawansa is now languishing in the post-Aragalayala political wilderness, many of them having abandoned the Rajapaksa camp, at least on the surface, for the time being, due to its seemingly irreversible unpopularity. This group, commentators note, is unable to hitch its wagon to any viable alternative that stands for the same ideals and objectives that the Rajapaksa-led camp which it once proudly called home. The public\u2019s appetite for \u201cinternational conspiracies\u201d is also no longer what it once was in light of Sri Lanka\u2019s worst currency crisis since Independence, analysts say.",
    "Others, however, while dismissing outlandish conspiracy theories, point to growing US strategic interest in Sri Lanka in the post-war years that saw Chinese influence in the country increase under successive Rajapaksa governments.",
    "In a separate development, the US State Department announced Thursday morning that the US government has barred entry to Sri Lanka\u2019s war-time Navy Commander Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda and his wife.",
