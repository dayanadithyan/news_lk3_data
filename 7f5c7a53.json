    "Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday said the anti-graft agency's arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan was illegal and ordered his immediate release. \"What happened was not justice for Imran khan,\" the Pakistan Supreme Court observed.",
    "The three-member bench of the court declared Khan\u2019s arrest unlawful, providing a major relief for the chairman of the Tehreek-e-Insaf party.",
    "The bench had heard the petition over the legality of Khan\u2019s arrest earlier in the day and ordered authorities to bring him to court within an hour.",
    "Khan\u2019s shock arrest has triggered violent protests across the country, prompting the government to call out the army to help restore order."
