    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s coast conservation authorities have given approval to start water villas with 26 islets, being identified for development, State Minister for Investment Promotion, Dilum Amunugama said.",
    "\u201cWe had received proposals for water villas but we could not approve because we did not have approval from the Coast Conservation (Department),\u201d Minister Amunugama said.",
    "\u201cNow we have got that. This was discussed for a long time but approvals were not given. So, I have to thank them.",
    "\u201cThere are more islets, on 26 islets they have decided and other 15 locations they have given approval for tourism and leisure.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka does not allow developments on the coast on or beyond the beach, where there is strong wave action, as permanent constructions tend to erode beaches and eventually the construction itself.",
    "In countries like the Maldives water villas are built over shallow seas on stilts, usually in sheltered coral lagoons. (Colombo/May28/2023)"
