    "Attorney General Sanjaya Rajaratnam has confirmed that the Attorney General\u2019s Department will file legal action over the X-Press Pearl marine disaster before a commercial court in Singapore today.",
    "Through the case, the Department will demand compensation for the environmental damage caused by the disaster.",
    "The case will be filed by a legal firm in Singapore on behalf of the Attorney General\u2019s Department under the approval of the Cabinet. The compensation demand is to be informed to the courts at a later date.",
    "According to the Attorney General\u2019s Department, a detailed report has been called on the compensation claim from the Maritime Environment Protection Authority.",
    "The litigation process is being carried out in Singapore instead of Sri Lanka based on advice received from an Australian legal firm.",
    "The marine disaster which took place on 20 May 2021 is considered to be one of the worst marine disasters in the world. Recent research by the Center of Environmental Justice (CEJ) found heavy pollution in the marine environment around the X-press Pearl shipwreck. The CEJ said the research was conducted in collaboration with Prof. M.M. Pathmalal of the Animal Science Department of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura from October to December 2021, based on water and animal samples in 11 locations. CEJ said a high amount of nitrate was detected in the surrounding sea and harmful biotoxins were found around Dikowita and Sarakkuwa.",
    "\u201cOil and grease were also found around the ship, along with heavy metals such as lead, zinc, copper, and nickel found in these samples. Those heavy metals were found in sea snails, shrimps, sardines, and herrings exceeding the level approved for human consumption,\u201d the release read. The CEJ said high amounts of lead were found in shellfish, shrimp, sardines, and herring.",
    "\u201cEven in small amounts, this chemical is harmful. The environmental pollution caused by the ship sinking has adverse consequences for the neighbouring fishing communities through their fish consumption,\u201d the organisation warned."
