  "original_body_lines": [
    "Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, scion of the Congress party's political dynasty, has filed an appeal against his conviction and two-year jail sentence in a criminal defamation case. The charges stemmed from his comments about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's surname at an election rally in 2019. The case against him was brought by a BJP lawmaker who alleged that Mr. Gandhi's comments had defamed the entire Modi community. The conviction led to Mr. Gandhi's disqualification as a lawmaker and suspension from contesting elections until his sentence is suspended or he is acquitted.",
    "Opposition leaders have accused the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of pursuing a political vendetta against Mr. Gandhi. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh alleged that Mr. Gandhi was being targeted because of his comments about businessman Gautam Adani's rising fortunes and his proximity to the Modi government. The Congress and other opposition parties have also been demanding that a committee of experts probe allegations of financial fraud against the Adani group.",
    "Last week, Congress party members held protests in several states, and leaders of several other opposition parties joined the protests. Meanwhile, BJP leaders have denied the allegations and stated that the due judicial process was followed in the case.",
    "Mr. Gandhi appeared at the court in Surat city with his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and other top Congress leaders. Many Congress workers had gathered outside the court in support of Mr. Gandhi, holding banners with the words \"save democracy\" on them. Legal website Live Law reported that Mr. Gandhi's appeal was accompanied by two applications: one to suspend his sentence or get bail and the other to suspend his conviction. A decision in his favour in the second application could lead to his lawmaker status being reinstated, the website said.",
    "National elections are due in India next year, and the outcome could have far-reaching implications for the country's political landscape. As the country's most strident and consistent critic of Prime Minister Modi, Mr. Gandhi's appeal is being closely watched by both his supporters and opponents. The outcome of the appeal will determine whether Mr. Gandhi can contest the upcoming elections and potentially challenge the BJP's hold on power",
