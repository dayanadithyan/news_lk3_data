    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013\u00a0The U.S. Senate on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to revoke the authority it gave the President to militarily intervene in 1991 in what became known as the Gulf War and in 2003 for the Iraq War.",
    "The bipartisan effort saw both Democrats and Republicans voting together to pass the legislation by a vote of 66-30.",
    "The bill will now go to the House of Representatives, and if it is passed, as expected, it will signal the formal end to both wars. U.S. combat operations in Iraq ended a decade ago.",
    "The Senate had attempted to bring such legislation earlier, but was not supported by President Barak Obama and then faced complete hostility from the Trump administration. An attempt in 2021 that had the blessings of President Joe Biden failed to pass through the Senate.",
    "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the exclusive right to declare war. But the 1991 and 2003 legislation allowed the President to authorize the two military interventions without a formal declaration of war.",
