    "The West Indies have named their player group for the all-important Cricket World Cup Qualifier next month in Zimbabwe.",
    "The big talking point of the group named came through the recall of bowling all-rounder Keemo Paul, who last played for the side at ODI level back in July last year. Gudakesh Motie, who performed well in Zimbabwe during the West Indies' Test tour earlier in the year, has also earned a spot in the squad.",

    "Cricket West Indies will give players playing in the IPL a chance to recoup ahead of the Qualifier, while those named in the tournament squad not currently in India will prepare with three ODIs against fellow tournament competitors UAE in Sharjah.",

    "Upon speaking to those in the group, Haynes is confident of a strong performance.",
    "\"They are fully aware of the job at hand. We are happy with the preparations and the mindset of the players, and everyone is clear about their roles in the squad.",
