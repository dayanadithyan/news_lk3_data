    "Two mahouts from Thailand\u2019s Forest Industry Organisation, who have flown to Sri Lanka, have met with Sak Surin, an ailing Thai elephant at Dehiwala Zoo, and have started the familiarisation process by feeding and bathing him.",
    "The main job of the mahouts is to train the animal to enter, exit and stay in the specially-built cage, which has been flown to Sri Lanka. They have about two weeks to do the job, so the elephant can be flown home on schedule.",
    "Kanchana Silpa-archa, an advisor to the strategy committee of the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, said in her Facebook post that she was told by an official at the Thai embassy in Sri Lanka that the first encounter between the mahouts and Sak Surin was quite positive, as the elephant gestured for food from the mahouts.",
    "The elephant responded to the Thai language used by the mahouts in their communication. Sak Surin was given sugarcane as a reward.",
    "Atthaphon Charoenchansa, the acting director-general of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, said that it is a good sign that the elephant and the mahouts are getting along, adding that the two men need to spend more time with the animal to ensure its smooth repatriation by air in three weeks.",
    "Sak Surin, a 30-year-old male elephant, is slated for transport back to Thailand on July 1. Special preparations, including the construction of a new cage, are currently underway to ensure his safety during the journey.",
    "Additionally, Sak Surin will undergo specific training before the flight to better acclimate him to the transportation conditions.",
    "The decision to repatriate Sak Surin emerged after a team of Thai veterinarians expressed health concerns during a visit to Sri Lanka to assess the elephant\u2019s condition. Sak Surin is one of three ambassador elephants that were presented to Sri Lanka by the Thai government in 2001.",
    "For 21 years, the 3.5-ton elephant has resided at the Kande Vihara temple, participating in reverence ceremonies.",
    "Thailand media reported that the country's \u00a0prime minister is closely monitoring the planned repatriation of Thai elephant Sak Surin, also known as Muthu Raja, from Sri Lanka.",
    "According to Thai Government Spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri, Caretaker Prime Minister Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha has expressed his gratitude to all the associated agencies for their efforts to facilitate the elephant\u2019s return to Thailand for necessary medical treatment.",
    "A team of veterinarian and mahouts were sent to Sri Lanka from Thailand prepare the elephant\u2019s health for the eight-hour trip. A special cage, 2.10 metres wide, 6.60 metres long and 3.02 metres high was ordered to move the jumbo.",
