    "SJB Colombo Mayoral Candidate Mujibur Rahman says social media has become a headache for Govt. as it has educated people on the country\u2019s politics and increased their political literacy",
    "Claims social media is now a challenge to the Govt. and its many decisions",
    "Asks everyone to band together to fight against the Govt. latest attempt to suppress dissent",
    "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has accused the Government of attempting to shut down dissent by attempting to introduce legislation to control social media.",
    "Speaking at a press conference held at the Opposition Leader\u2019s office yesterday, the party\u2019s Colombo Mayoral candidate Mujibur Rahman said media has now widely spread to social media through the development of technology. He said social media has been instrumental in educating people on the political situation in the country and increasing their political literacy. He also commended social media for supporting the citizen struggles in recent times. \u201cIt can cause significant changes in society. Therefore the Government is now attempting to regulate it,\u201d he claimed.",
    "Rahman said social media has become a serious challenge to the Government and its many decisions. \u201cThey want to identify social media accounts working against the Government and neutralise them. For this they now need a new law,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trying to do what they couldn\u2019t through the new anti-terror law,\u201d he added. Rahman said the Government is attempting to curtail the people\u2019s freedom of expression through the proposed Social Media Act.",
    "He called on all media personnel and activists to take note of this new turn of events.",
    "\u201cWe tell them that the Government is trying its hand at a new tactic to suppress the media, activists and others speaking up for democracy. They want to create a situation where they can suppress these groups and enforce their political policy decisions without any objections. The struggle and the fight for democracy have not ended. It will have to be reignited,\u201d Rahman said. He called on everyone to band together to fight against this.",
