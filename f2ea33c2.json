  "original_body_lines": [
    "The National Organizer of SJB youth, Chamith Wijesundera today (02) lodged a complaint with the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) against MP Wimal Weerawansa over his alleged comments made on the Sri Lanka Army and their connection to the US Ambassador in his recently launched book titled \u2018Nine: The Hidden Story\u2019.",
    "The SJB member charged that the MP had made some serious allegations against the Sri Lanka Army pertaining to its stance during the Aragalaya where Weerawansa had said that the Army was not adhering to the President\u2019s orders but was dancing to the tune of the American Ambassador.",
    "\u201cThe motive behind Weerawansa\u2019s comments would have been to tarnish the reputation of certain Army personnel and the security forces at large,\u201d Wijesundera claimed.",
    "Wijesundera also questioned as to whose agenda it was for Weerawansa to make such allegations which could result in violence in the country.",
    "Therefore, he urged the CID to investigate into the sequence of events and expose the truth to the people."
