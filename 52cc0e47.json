Samson Rajapaksa.

    "Egalahewa expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to lead such a successful and diverse conglomerate while emphasizing his commitment to advancing the Group\u2019s ambitious development plans by working closely with the Board and Stakeholders to achieve continued success. \u201cAs the new Chairman of DSI, I am honoured to lead a company with such a rich history and a strong legacy of success. I believe that the key to success is collaboration, and I am excited to work with the talented and experienced team at DSI Samson Group to drive innovation, improve efficiency, and enhance our competitiveness. Together, we will continue to grow the company and create value for all our stakeholders,\u201d he added.",
    "Mr. Kasun Rajapaksa, Managing Director of DSI Samson Group stated that the 3rd generation board members are strong believers of the fact that in order to establish a system aimed at spanning generations, one must be willing to evolve. The Board has now appointed its first ever non-family, non-executive independent director as the Group Chairman for this reason.",
    "\u201cWe believe that bringing outside experience and knowledge to Chair the Group along with the other Independent Non-Executive Directors will further enrich and strengthen the Group\u2019s corporate governance. Someone from outside the family will inevitably possess a neutral perspective and will uphold the best interests of the shareholders, employees, customers, and the entire organization. The Chairman\u2019s independence means they are not impacted by internal or external forces, and the Board can leverage that centred approach to reach informed decisions.\u201d he added.",
