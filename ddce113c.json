    "The Sri Lanka Mission in Thailand has noticed recently that Sri Lankan nationals are being lured for employment in Thailand particularly for the positions in the Information Technology (IT) sector by dubious IT firms involved in call-centre scams and crypto currency fraud, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.",
    "According to the statement, victims are illegally taken across the border from Thailand mostly into Myanmar and held captive to work under harsh restrictive conditions. Some of the victims have also been apprehended by authorities for illegal entry.",
    "All these victimized Sri Lankans have arrived to Thailand on tourist visas, with the promise of converting the same to work visa after arrival, which has not been successful.",
    "Sri Lankan nationals are therefore advised not to get enticed and entrapped in such fraudulent job offers and are requested to exercise extreme caution and verify the background of recruiting agents as well as any company before taking up any job offer,\u201d the statement said.",
    "It is advised to obtain Thai visa details from the Thai Immigration Bureau Website. www.immigration.go.th"
