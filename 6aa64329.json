  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says law enforcement is pursuing peaceful protests and creating violent situations by attacking demonstrators",
    "Questions the use of soldiers bearing wooden sticks and iron rods against protestors",
    "Expresses concerns if banned gases are being used as tear gas on protestors due to two recent deaths at protests following tear gas attacks",
    "National People\u2019s Party (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Thursday accused the Government led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe of pursuing peaceful protests with a vengeance and creating violent situations by attacking demonstrators.",
    "He said President Wickremesinghe and the Government are violating the people's fundamental rights in a most undemocratic manner. The NPP leader made these comments during a press conference held at the party office in Pelawatta.",
    "Dissanayake said the Government has now gotten into the habit of attacking peaceful protests.\u00a0 \u201cThe right to peaceful assembly and dissent is a fundamental right accorded to the people through the constitution. However, a President without a mandate who came into power with the support of 113 corrupt MPs has unleashed oppression on the general public to safeguard his post and the 113 supporting him,\u201d he said.",
    "Commenting on the crackdown of recent protests and deaths during them, Dissanayake accused Wickremesinghe of using violent mobs to attack protestors and suppress them. \u201cRanil Wickremesinghe is carrying out murders. He responded to the protest against the attack on the IUSF protest on 7 March with more force,\u201d he said. Dissanayake accused the President of blocking peaceful protests and using force to suppress them instead.",
    "He also questioned the use of soldiers bearing wooden sticks and iron rods against the protestors. \u201cWhat is the legal power to arm them in this manner? Ranil Wickramasinghe has started a culture of attacking peaceful protests with various types of sticks now,\u201d he noted. The NPP leader said however the President is mistaken if he believes he can suppress peaceful protests in this manner.",
    "He called on the people to voice their dissent against the Government\u2019s acts of oppression. \u201cWe assure you we will defeat Ranil Wickremesinghe who is oppressing the people despite having no mandate. We will face off against him and his mobs bearing sticks and rods with the power of the people. The people are more powerful than the country\u2019s constitution,\u201d he said.",
    "He demanded the President stop all anti-democratic, repressive and disruptive actions immediately. Dissanayake expressed his concerns about the tear gas used on protestors due to the recent deaths. \u201cWe have a valid concern if banned gases are being used on protestors. We condemn these oppressive acts,\u201d he said."
