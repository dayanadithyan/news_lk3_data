  "original_body_lines": [
    "It was revealed at the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) that the rating system of television channels is not correct and is irregular and biased.",
    "This was revealed by Secretary to the Ministry of Mass Media Anusha Palpita at the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) held recently at the Parliament Complex.",
    "Palpita said a device is installed in about 400 randomly selected TV sets for the purpose of collecting data in order to calculate\u00a0 the rating.",
    "He pointed out that three major media organizations have bought about 300 television sets equipped with these devices by offering money to the institutions that carry out the calculations and hence the data collected is inaccurate.",
    "He also said that since the State media is more responsible than the private media organizations, it is not possible to work with the sole motive of climbing up in the ranks of channel ratings. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
