    "Under the \u2018Aarohi\u2019 (to ascend) initiative of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL), another group of identified middle management level women executives visited Sri Lanka last week.",
    "Aarohi is a pioneering effort and Indian Oil\u2019s Commitment to develop unique strengths in senior women executives aimed toward their all-round development and enhancing their leadership quality, so that they can ascend into significant leadership roles and contribute to the organisation through performance excellence.",
    "This year the batch of Aarohi 5.0 consisting of 10 Women Officials from IOCL visited Sri Lanka with the purpose of understanding the operations of Lanka IOC and interacting with Team LIOC which has been relentlessly pursuing the objective of meeting the energy needs of the beautiful Island nation under any circumstances.",
    "It is pertinent to mention that recently in the month of November 2022, another batch of 14 women executives had visited Sri Lanka under Aarohi 4.0 program and had an enriching experience throughout their visit. During their six day\u2013visit, the group travelled across the length and breadth of the country including visit to Trincomalee Terminal facilities. At Trincomalee terminal, the group visited various facilities including Lower and Upper Tanks Farms, Oil Jetty, Lube Blending and Grease Manufacturing Plant which also involved fruitful interactions with terminal employees of LIOC with visitors displaying plenty of inquisitiveness and enthusiasm. A Harbor trip was also arranged to witness the harbor mount and other facilities at the harbor.",
    "All latest developments, the strategic steps being taken and way forward towards business excellence were shared with the group. An Industrial visit was organised at Army School of Logistics (ASL), Clappenburg, Trincomalee with the kind assistance of Sri Lankan Army, wherein the participants were briefed on the various modalities and importance of Logistics in the smooth functioning of National Safety and Security.",
    "The Aarohi team also visited LIOC\u203as Head office at Colombo and had a lively interaction with all HO employees. The interaction was mutually beneficial as the LIOC employees also gained valuable insight into various new initiatives being undertaken by Indian Oil Corporation in India specially pertaining to female employees. The vibrant interaction has opens new channel of communication between IOCL and LIOC employees which is likely to be beneficial for both the organisations through better exchange of ideas and best practices.",
    "The visiting group also had the pleasure of meeting the High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay, who warmly welcomed the entire group and shared with them the several positive strategic initiatives that Government of India has undertaken and intends to undertake with an aim to strengthen the socio-political relationship between India and Sri Lanka. His Excellency also appreciated the IOCL\u203as unique initiative to organise a visit of the women officials to Sri Lanka which is a sign of further strengthening the mutual admiration between the two countries.",
    "Aarohi team was enthralled by the fascinating landscapes unfolding the mesmerising natural beauty of the Island nation as they visited Tooth Relic temple, Sigiriya Rock, Gangaramaya temple, Lotus tower, Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage, Independence Square, Trincomalee Deer park apart from several other prominent locations enroute their travel destinations."
