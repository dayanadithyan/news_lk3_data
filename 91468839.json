    "\u201cIt is essential to form the broadest alliance possible to defeat the Wickremesinghe administration. Therefore, the Nidahas Janatha Sabahawa is ready to have a dialogue with the SJB, JJB and all other opposition groups,\u201d Mr. Allahapperuma told the Daily Mirror.",
    "\u201cOur intention is to give priority to build a bridge for all opposition parties to fulfill the common goal of defeating the incumbent government.
