    "\u2013 World Oceans Day is June 8. Oceans play a key role in livelihoods, food supplies, and climate.",
    "\u2013 Oceans remove roughly 26% of the CO2 from burning fossil fuels and store it in marine life, seawaters, and on the seafloor\u2014as described in Climate Central\u2019s new report, Ocean Carbon.",
    "\u2013 But human-caused warming and continued carbon pollution put tremendous pressure on marine ecosystems and processes that remove and hold carbon long term.",
    "\u2013 Restoring and protecting oceans can be a climate solution, but must be paired with deep and rapid cuts to carbon pollution.",
    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Every year, people worldwide celebrate World Ocean Day on June 8th. This day is aims to raise awareness about the importance of the ocean and the need to protect them",
    "The theme for World Oceans Day 2023 is \"Planet Ocean: Tides are Changing\".",

    "Scientists estimate that roughly half of the oxygen (O2) production on earth comes from the ocean, and that is estimated to be between 50% to 80% while the ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) that is released in the atmosphere.",
    "The ocean is one of Earth's most valuable natural resources. It provides food in the form of fish, it provides a treasured source of recreation for humans. It is mined for minerals and drilled for crude oil.",
    "Plastic pollution is a growing issue, with millions of tonnes of plastic waste ending up in the ocean each year.",
    "Each year, about 8.8 million tons of plastic ends up in the world oceans, a quantity much higher than previous estimates.",

    "Unlike previous years, this year, the country must pay close attention to the Sea of Sri Lanka, especially on World Oceans Day as millions of tons of plastic waste polluted the Sea of Sri Lanka following the X-Press Pearl Maritime Disaster.",
    "According to the UN environmental advisory mission, the X-Press Pearl carried 1,680 tonnes of plastic pellets when it sank in the Sea of Sri Lanka, some two years ago."
