    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Catholic Church says that it strongly condemns the statements made by Jerome Fernando that disrupt religious harmony.",
    "Rev. Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando, the Spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Colombo told reporters in Colombo that it is observed that the recent comments made by Jerome Fernando, during one of his sermons, likely pose a threat to religious coexistence in the country.",
    "\"We would like to stress that Jerome Fernando is NOT a catholic priest and is not linked to the Catholic Church in any manner,\" he added.",
    "\"We believe that his comments would also taint the views of his followers concerning other religions. We cannot disregard the fact that these comments would threaten religious coexistence and unit, and could lead to communal issues as well,\" warned the Spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Colombo."
