    "The Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in Colombo, Sri Lanka, initiated a landmark Project within the Embassy precincts when engaging the innovator of Green Technology for road and highway paving, AGC Innovate Ltd., to carry out the comprehensive renovation work of the internal road network of the Embassy premises using \u201cPlastic Modified Asphalt Concrete (PMAC)\u201d. PMAC is a novel eco-friendly disruptive technology where the road surfaces are paved using asphalt-modified raw materials derived from non-recyclable plastics waste.",
    "Endorsement of this technology within the Embassy premises as a sustainable initiative reflects the embassy\u2019s commitment and Indonesia\u2019s initiative to promote sustainable practices and environmental protection. It also serves as an example to be emulated by those committed to environmental sustainability. The Indonesian Ambassador Dewi Gustina Tobing, has shown keen interest. According to, AGC Innovate Ltd. Technology Innovator\u00a0 Umayanga Nanayakkara: \u201cIt is indeed a great honour and privilege to be associated with the Indonesian Embassy in their endeavour to\u00a0 promote this sustainable\u00a0 solution in Sri Lanka and it is timely for Sri Lanka to incorporate this into our infrastructure development agendas which will contribute in saving the planet.\u201d",
    "Around 650kg of non-recyclable waste plastics were used in laying the internal roads, and parking area of the embassy premises and the official residence of the Ambassador using PMAC, and the project was completed under the strict supervision of both the Embassy and AGC Innovate officials to ensure the best quality.",
    "Non-recyclable waste plastics, such as polythene bags, have become a primary environmental concern in many countries, including Sri Lanka and Indonesia. These plastics take hundreds of years to decompose and are a nuisance littering the streets, beaches, and waterways, posing a significant threat to wildlife and marine life. They clog drainage systems, leading to flooding and other hazards. The improper disposal of plastic waste also releases harmful chemicals and toxins into the environment, contributing to air, water, and soil pollution.",
    "AGC Innovate is an innovative solution provider for Sri Lanka\u2019s Infrastructure Development has successfully developed Green Technology as a sustainable solution for the waste plastic problem in Sri Lanka by converting waste plastic to a raw material forming an additive to Asphalt Concrete which also improves the quality and durability of the roads, highways, and parking areas.",
    "In 2018 this PMAC technology was initiated for the first time in Sri Lanka under the supervision of RDA on a stretch of highway in Ratmalana and has been certified as an environmentally suitable initiative. It was followed by more than two years of rigorous testing and observation, leading to the receipt of CEA Certification. It is also filed under the National Intellectual Property Agency of Sri Lanka."
