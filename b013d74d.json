  "original_body_lines": [
    "Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Chaminda Wijesiri engaged in an exchange of words in Parliament over allegations by the latter that the Minister is to marry the daughter of the owner of the company which acts as the local agent for 'Sinopec' which is to become a player in the local fuel market.",
    "While denying the allegation Minister Wijesekera said, \u201cThe company had made a statement about its local agent and other details. However, I will raise a privilege issue on another date over the false allegation made against me,\" he said.",
    "MP Wijesiri said he only questioned whether there has been a conflict of interest when allowing the Chinese company to enter the local fuel market and did not intend to sling mud at the Minster.",
    "\u201cThe privilege committee should not become another torture house like Batalanda,\" the MP said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
