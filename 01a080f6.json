  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The unprecedented economic crisis in Sri Lanka may have its genesis at Royal College Colombo which has produced an impressive list of politicians contributing to the country\u2019s steady decline.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressing students at his alma mater this week made an unintended confession that old boys of Royal College were in the forefront of politics for 163 years.",
    "\u201cI have come here to address you at a very difficult time,\u201d Wickremesinghe told students and a small group of past pupils of Royal. \u201cA situation we have not seen in the last 400 years. A complete collapse of the economy.\u201d",
    "He noted that the 1972 republican constitution which shed the country\u2019s secular nature was drafted by old Royalist Colvin R de Silva. It abolished a civil service commission dealing the first blow to the country\u2019s independent civil service commission.",
    "His class-mate Junius Jayewardene did one better introducing the 1978 statute,  blamed for much of the political, economic and social woes since.",
    "\u201cRoyalists have done it so well that no one else can change it,\u201d the 73-year-old Wickremesinghe said referring to his uncle Jayewardene\u2019s constitution.",
    "However, a few minutes after this remark Wickremesinghe appeared to contradict himself, vowing to have a new constitution that will last a century by dumping his uncle\u2019s 1978 statute.",
    "\u201cToday, we are a country which has only Afghanistan below us. We don\u2019t know what the future is. So when we build this future, it\u2019s an economy that must last for 25 years. It must be a new Constitution that must last for 100 years.\u201d",
    "He said Royal College has produced four Prime Ministers and two Presidents. \u201cThis is an outstanding record for any school,\u201d he said.  Wickremesinghe and his prime minister Dinesh Gunawardena have also set their almost unbreakable record.",
    "Both men have known each other from the age of three years and are from the \u201cGroup of 60,\u201d the Form 1 batch of Royal College and were classmates along with the late Anura Bandaranaike, who became Speaker of the House, and a former minister, Malik Samarawickrema.",
    "Wickremesinghe asked present-day Royalists to follow the \u201coath of the young men of Athens\u201d which required them to ensure a \u201cgreater and more beautiful city\u201d for the next generation. It would have been better to ask them to stick with the original \u201cDisce aut discede,\u201d (learn or depart), something the alumni seem to have forgotten.  (Colombo/Feb 24/02/2023)",
