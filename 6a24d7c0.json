    "Finn Allen made 51 after an early piece of luck and Henry Shipley took 5-31 as the Black Caps beat Sri Lanka by 198 runs in the first one-day international at Eden Park on Saturday.",
    "Allen\u2019s off stump was hit by a delivery from Kasun Rajitha in the third over of the match, when he was on nine, but the bails didn\u2019t move and he went on to make 51 off 49 \u2013 his team\u2019s highest score.",
    "The Black Caps were ultimately dismissed for 274 with three balls remaining after being sent in by Dasun Shanaka, as Allen was followed by several of his team-mates in failing to kick on.",
    "Henry Shipley then delivered his best ODI bowling performance as Sri Lanka were dismissed for 76 inside 20 overs, taking 5-31 from his seven overs to set up New Zealand\u2019s seventh-largest ODI win in terms of runs."
