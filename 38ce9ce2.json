  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil National Alliance (TNA) plans to hold discussions with President Ranil Wickremesinghe to settle the island nation\u2019s ethnic issue within a set time limit, according to TNA legislator M A Sumanthiran.",
    "The MP tweeted Monday May 08 evening that the TNA will only discuss the issue on the basis that the island\u2019s north and east are the \u201chistoric habitation of the Tamil speaking people\u201d, which he said is acknowledged locally and internationally. The 1987 India Sri Lanka Accord recognises the two regions as a single entity, he noted.",
    "\u201cWe are not prepared to hold any discussions that goes contrary to that basis,\u201d the MP said.",
    "Sumanthiran could not be reached for comment as at Tuesday May 09 morning for more information on the particulars of the discussion.",
    "Earlier rounds of talks held on the invitation of President Wickremesinghe in early 2023 to find a permanent solution to Sri Lanka\u2019s decades long ethnic issue before the 75th anniversary of the country\u2019s independence from the British failed.",
    "However, Wickremesinghe has reiterated his commitment to devolution of power within a unitary state as a solution to the issue. In February, he told a gathering at the National Thai Pongal Festival in Jaffna that the amendment will be fully implemented and a Social Justice Commission will be established to \u201cbuild a country where everyone can live in harmony, by solving the problems of the people belonging to all sections of the population.\u201d",
    "When full implementation of the India-backed 13th amendment to the constitution was touted as a possible solution earlier this year, some Buddhist monks took to the streets in protest.",
    "Devolving land and police powers to the provinces under the 13th amendment has been controversial, with monks and other nationalist quarters routinely expressing strong opposition. Wickremesinghe, however, has repeatedly stated that he plans a full implementation of the amendment.",
    "The 13th amendment to Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution emerged from the controversial Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 as a purported solution to the worsening ethnic conflict, four years after war broke out. Provincial councils came in the wake of this amendment, though land and police powers have yet to be devolved to the provinces as originally envisioned. Both Sinhalese and Tamil nationalists have historically opposed the amendment, the former claiming it devolved too much, the latter complaining it didn\u2019t devolve enough.",
    "A full implementation of the amendment will see land and police powers devolved to the provinces, a development that is not likely to garner support from Sri Lanka\u2019s more nationalist-oriented parties including sections of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).",
    "The main opposition SJB\u2019s position on this is also unclear. The party boycotted a recent all-party conference (APC) on the ethnic issue and said it supports devolution of power, but the party has yet to articulate its position on the amendment\u2019s full implementation.",
    "The president has explicitly said he does not support federalism, a solution which the TNA has indicated that it is open to.",
    "Federalism has been a highly controversial and politically inflammable idea in Sri Lanka over the years, with many nationalist or even some moderate parties in the south vehemently opposing the very suggestion of it. It is unclear whether this stance has softened over the nearly 14 years since the end of the war, but to date no Sinhalese-dominated party \u2013 the SJB and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) included \u2013 has come out in support for it.
