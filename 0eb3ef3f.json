    "Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Leader Udaya Gammanpila said they have decided to offer conditional support for the privatization programme based on the reality that state-run organizations have become a burden as a result of politicization and corruption during the last seven years. \u201cState run organizations becoming a burden is a reality and we offer conditional support for privatization based on this,\u201d he said.",
    "Privatization should not be fraudulent as it has been during the time of President R. Premadasa, President Chandrika Kumaratunga and during the time of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe from 2001 to 2004. Privatization should be transparent. There should be a mechanism of regulation so that exploitation could be avoided. It should not affect national security and institutions which are essential for an emergency. Institutions which are strategically important should be vested with the state sector,\u201d the MP said outlining condition."
