    "\u201cThe ones who earn the least contribute to most of the remittances and those who hold bigger posts in developed countries, send very little money to the country because they are politically misled and will not send money.\u201d",
    "Many liberal developed nations give permanent resident status to foreign nationalized who can later become naturalized citizens, unlike nationalist nations like Sri Lanka critics say.",

    "\u201cWe have discussed with Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait and The United Arab Emirates to increase the salary earned by these women,\u201d Nanayakkara said.",
    "Many Sri Lankans are now leaving the country after the central bank printed money to maintain an artificially low policy rate and boost growth without working for it (output gap targeting or stimulus) under a discretionary flexible inflation targeting regime and collapsed the rupee.",
    "Before the money printing central bank was set up in August 1950, Sri Lanka was a net importer of labour, like Dubai and Singapore.",

    "Sri Lanka\u2019s remittances through official channels rose to 568 million US dollars in March 2023, up 78 percent from a year earlier, as parallel premiums declined as the central bank put brakes on money printing.\u00a0(Colombo/Apr26/2023)"
