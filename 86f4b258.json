    "Announces 2 new Boeing 747-F leases which add immediate capacity, and signal confidence in global cargo market.",
    "Emirates fleet of over 300 aircraft by mid-2030 will offer expanded cargo flexibility, capacity and capability from a mix of belly-hold on A350s, A380s, 777s, and on dedicated freighters.",
    "Emirates SkyCargo has added two Boeing 747-400Fs to its freighter fleet, showing its strong confidence in the global cargo market in a current environment of volatility.",
    "The cargo division of Emirates, the world\u2019s largest international airline, is expecting 15 more freighters to join its fleet from announced orders and its freighter conversion program, plus a boost in belly-hold capacity from new passenger aircraft deliveries starting with Airbus A350s in late summer 2024, followed by 777-Xs the year after.",
    "Over the next decade, Emirates SkyCargo expects to double its existing capacity, add over 20 new destinations to its freighter network, and offer even more flexibility and services to its customers with a fleet mix of over 300 wide-body aircraft comprising: 777s, 777-Fs, 747-Fs, A350s, and A380s.",
    "\u2018Nabil Sultan, Divisional Senior Vice President, Emirates SkyCargo said: \u201cWhile the current market volatility may cause others to hesitate, Emirates SkyCargo is pushing full steam ahead with our plans. The medium to long term projections for global air cargo show an upward trajectory of between 3-5%. Combine that Dubai\u2019s strategy to double its foreign trade where multi-modal logistics will play a big role, and the economic activity happening in markets around the Gulf, West Asia, and Africa, and the opportunity for Emirates SkyCargo is clear.\u2019",
    "\u201cThe two new 747-Fs which we have leased will give us immediate capacity, while we wait for delivery of five new 777Fs in 2024 and 2025, and 10 777-300ERs to roll out of our conversion program over the next five years. We believe even these additional planes will not be sufficient. By then, we\u2019ll have the MRO set-up to quickly and efficiently scale-up our freighter conversion program if we needed to.\u201d",
    "Secured on a long-term wet-lease basis, the two Boeing 747-Fs complement Emirates SkyCargo\u2019s existing fleet of 11 Boeing 777 freighters, and are currently being deployed to Chicago three times weekly, and to Hong Kong nine times weekly.",
    "He added: \u201cThe new aircraft mean we can expand our freighter network and amplify the connectivity with the main Emirates network. The new fleet mix also gives us more flexibility to serve our different customers even better. Emirates SkyCargo is also investing to develop new products, and to speed up digitisation and technology innovation. It is our ambition to lead the market in delivering specialist solutions that are fast, reliable, flexible, and efficient. More exciting developments to come. Stay tuned.\u201d",
    "Last week, Emirates SkyCargo launched a brand-new creative advertising campaign, showcasing how \u2018The World Works Better with Emirates SkyCargo\u2019. Through every-day scenarios, the advert demonstrates how essential its logistics business is to connect people and products all around the world, whether that is through life-saving healthcare, fresh fruit, flowers, pets, or valuables.",
