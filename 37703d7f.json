    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Bankrupt Sri Lanka is exploring possibilities of exporting up to 100,000 monkeys following a request from China, the island\u2019s largest bilateral lender, the Agricultural minister said Wednesday.",
    "Mahinda Amaraweera said he asked his officials to study the Chinese request to buy the endemic toque macaques known to destroy crops in many parts of the island.",
    "\u201cI have appointed a committee to study the request,\u201d the minister said \u201cThey want the monkeys for their zoos.\u201d",
    "The minister said the request for monkeys to be exhibited at some 1,000 Chinese zoos could be complied with given the large macaque population in the island.",
    "\u201cThe Agricultural ministry stated that a Chinese delegation has requested them to provide Sri Lankan monkeys to Zoos in China,\u201d the Ada Derana network had reported earlier.",
    "The financial details of possible live monkey exports were not immediately known. China holds just over a fifth of Sri Lanka\u2019s bilateral credit and agreed last month to offer debt relief to the island in one with an IMF bailout program.",
    "There was no immediate reaction from the Chinese embassy in Colombo.",
    "Export of wild animals is banned by Sri Lanka, but the government earlier this year removed several species, including monkeys, from a protected list allowing farmers to kill them.",
    "Although Sri Lankan authorities have removed the protected status of toque macaques (common monkey) they remain listed as \u201cendangered\u201d in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
    "Sri Lankan authorities have estimated the monkey population at two to three million in the South Asian nation of 22 million people. Monkeys are considered pests by farmers.",
    "Last year, former president Maithripala Sirisena called for a virtual cull of the monkeys saying they destroyed about a third of crops. Farmers in the northcentral, southern, and eastern provinces say their crops are regularly attacked by monkeys, peacocks, wild boar and elephants.",
    "China has also shown interest in importing donkeys from Pakistan to meet a rising demand for donkey hides. (Colombo/April 12/2023)"
