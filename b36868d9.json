    "Whether it\u2019s sitting on a sofa or staying in a hotel, who doesn\u2019t like to feel comfortable? The same goes for situations in general: Being in your \u201ccomfort zone\u201d is pleasant, including at your job.",
    "\u201cMost people probably associate it with their own personal feel-good zone \u2013 a kind of mental housing, so to speak,\u201d says Matthias Blattmann, a German businessman and author of a book whose title translates as\u00a0You\u2019re Now Leaving the Comfort Zone. Steps to Success.",
    "At their job, it\u2019s typically taken to mean what they\u2019re accustomed to doing and do well, says business psychologist Florian Becker, author of a book on how to effectively motivate employees. This can be quite important, particularly in occupations with high safety risks and requiring top performance, such as surgeon.",
    "\u201cThen the comfort zone is where you have no fear and feel secure,\u201d Becker says.Sounds good. So why are we always hearing that we should leave our comfort zone?",
    "\u201cBecause if we remain there too often, we\u2019re trading future happiness for current pleasure,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf you\u2019re never in a position to leave your comfort zone, you\u2019ll never enter what we call the growth zone.\u201d",
    "Only there is development possible \u2013 personal, occupational and also societal, Becker says.",
    "What\u2019s more, by staying in your comfort zone, you forgo satisfaction and important learning achievements, according to Blattmann.",
    "\u201cYou miss out on insights enabling you to master unforeseen situations in your life,\u201d he says.",
    "Blattmann, who\u2019s 50, began his career as a dance instructor and now manages several companies throughout Germany. He says he still finds it exciting to take on new challenges and learn new things.",
    "Children are the best illustration of personal growth through challenges.",
    "That is, they\u2019re constantly striving to expand their sphere of activity, expose themselves to uncomfortable situations, fall down, get back up, and go to the limit.In other words, they leave their comfort zone. And by doing so, every day they acquire skills, knowledge, self-confidence and opportunities \u2013 all things that are also useful in the workplace.",
    "This childhood spirit of adventure often increasingly wanes with age. The problem, though, is that by staying in your comfort zone, you\u2019re not only neglecting your future prospects and remaining at a standstill, but will ultimately even regress.",
    "\u201cThe comfort zone of people who never push their limits becomes smaller instead of larger,\u201d remarks Becker.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s important to face the music and consider where you\u2019ll end up in five, 10 or 20 years if you go on as usual,\u201d he says. Picturing that in your mind can be jolting and serve as motivation for change.Simple solutions are hard to come by, however.",
    "\u201cPeople who seemingly made an about-face out of nowhere had a certain constellation of circumstances enabling them to leave their comfort zone,\u201d Blattmann says.",
    "Becker agrees that it\u2019s not only fear or laziness that keeps people in their comfort zone. It has a lot to do with their personality, he says.",
    "\u201cSome people are too introverted, and others simply don\u2019t like change,\u201d he notes.",
    "It\u2019s difficult for them to approach people for something, ask for a raise or seek challenging tasks. Those who succeed in entering the growth zone often have the personality trait of \u201cbeing open to new things\u201d.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to exert yourself though, and for that you need energy,\u201d says Blattmann, adding that to summon it you have to be aware of two things: what holds you back and what drives you forward.",
    "\u201cAnd then you\u2019ve got to tap your personal mental fuel\u201d to propel you. It could be wanting to relive the pride you\u2019ve felt after a notable achievement, curiosity, worthy goals or a strong desire to live your life meaningfully.",
    "It also helps, Blattmann says, to immerse yourself in inspirational books, meet new people and simply try things you\u2019ve never done before.",
    "\u201cThe more unaccustomed the activities are, the more our brain is stimulated to think.\u201dCan it be dangerous to take too big a chance?",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s good to take the plunge on occasion, of course,\u201d Becker says, \u201cbut if you go from the growth zone into a panic zone, you hit an ice sheet instead of water and really hurt yourself.\u201d",
    "To put it somewhat hyperbolically, you surely won\u2019t be doing yourself a favour by trying to cross the Alps by bicycle if you don\u2019t ride one all year, points out Becker, who says reasonable, healthy growth is better.",
    "\u201cA certain amount of self-assessment is definitely required as well if you want to venture into something new,\u201d Blattmann says. But, he adds, you actually have nothing to lose: \u201cYou always gain something somehow, even if it\u2019s only experience.\u201d \u2013 dpa",
