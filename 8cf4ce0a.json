    "The government is determined to launch the proposed e-motoring system within this year overcoming resistance from certain bureaucrats.",
    "Cabinet Spokesperson and Minister of Transport and Highways and Minister of Mass Media Bandula Gunawardana revealed that the Cabinet of Ministers has recently approved a resolution to fast-track the project in order to launch it within this year.",
    "The proposed e-motoring system which has been in the making for over a decade is expected to simplify vehicle registrations and minimise corruption and fraudulent activities.",
    "Once the proposed e-motoring system is in place, it will connect vehicle owners, insurance companies, leasing companies and related state departments such as the Customs and import and export agents online, allowing all vehicle registrations to be conducted online.",
    "However, the Minister noted that certain bureaucrats have been purposely delaying the project in order to continue to benefit from the red-tape. He stressed that the government is determined to launch the project within this year, as it remains the only solution to put an end to corrupt practices while ensuring a more efficient and high quality service to the public."
