    "Thailand is holding a pivotal election on Sunday, with the potential to end almost a decade of military rule under Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha. However, the election system is considered to be biased, leaving the shape of the new government unpredictable. It remains to be seen if pro-democracy candidates will be able to overthrow the current military-backed government.",
    "Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief, has run a nationalistic election campaign, opposing opposition parties' proposed reforms and warning they will bring chaos. Nevertheless, polls suggest that many voters are seeking change, with the Pheu Thai party, associated with the exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, predicted by analysts to win the most seats.",
    "At the final rally on Friday, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of the party's leader and one of the three prime ministerial candidates, called the day of the election a \"historic day,\" where Thailand will move \"from junta rule to democratic rule.\"",
    "The outcome of this election will have significant implications for Thailand's future, with the potential for the country to transition to a more democratic government after years of military rule.",
