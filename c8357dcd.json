  "original_body_lines": [
    "The United Nations and the United States led calls Wednesday for Uganda\u2019s President Yoweri Museveni to reject what has been labelled an \u201cappalling\u201d anti-gay bill.",
    "Ugandan lawmakers approved the Anti-Homosexuality Act late on Tuesday after a chaotic near seven-hour session, ordering harsh penalties for anyone who engages in same-sex activity.",
    "Homosexuality was already illegal in the conservative East African nation and it was not immediately clear what new penalties had been agreed, with reports some offenders could face life in prison or even the death penalty.",
    "UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk urged Museveni not to promulgate the bill into law.",
    "\u201cThe passing of this discriminatory bill -\u2013 probably among the worst of its kind in the world \u2013- is a deeply troubling development,\u201d he said in a statement.",
    "\u201cIf signed into law by the president, it will render lesbian, gay and bisexual people in Uganda criminals simply for existing, for being who they are. It could provide carte blanche for the systematic violation of nearly all of their human rights and serve to incite people against each other.\u201d",
    "Amnesty International also appealed to Museveni to reject the \u201cappalling\u201d legislation, describing it as a \u201cgrave assault\u201d on LGBTQ people.",
    "\u201cThis ambiguous, vaguely worded law even criminalises those who \u2018promote\u2019 homosexuality,\u201d said Amnesty\u2019s east and southern Africa director, Tigere Chagutah.",
    "Lawmakers amended significant portions of the original draft legislation with all but one speaking in favour of the bill.",
    "MP Fox Odoi-Oywelowo, a member of Museveni\u2019s National Resistance Movement party who spoke against the bill, told AFP that offenders would face life imprisonment or even the death penalty for \u201caggravated\u201d offences.",
    "Amnesty said Museveni \u201cmust urgently veto this appalling legislation\u201d, saying it would \u201cinstitutionalise discrimination, hatred, and prejudice\u201d against the LGBTQ community.",
    "The discussion about the bill in parliament has been laced with homophobic language and Museveni himself last week referred to gay people as \u201cdeviants\u201d.",
    "Nevertheless, the 78-year-old veteran leader has consistently signalled he does not view the issue as a priority, and would prefer to maintain good relations with Western donors and investors.",
    "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken joined calls for the government to reconsider the legislation, saying on Twitter it would \u201cundermine fundamental human rights of all Ugandans and could reverse gains in the fight against HIV/AIDS\u201d.",
    "Britain\u2019s Africa minister Andrew Mitchell said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d with the passage of the bill while Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s special envoy on LGBTQ rights, Nicholas Herbert, warned it risked increasing \u201cdiscrimination and persecution of people across Uganda\u201d.",
    "\u201cWhile many countries, including a number on the African continent, are moving towards decriminalisation this is a deeply troubling step in the opposite direction,\u201d Herbert said on Twitter.",
    "Gay sex is allowed or has been decriminalised in Angola, Botswana, Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Rwanda, and the Seychelles.",
    "Uganda is notorious for its intolerance of homosexuality, and the passage of the bill was welcomed by some.",
    "\u201cWe are very happy as citizens of Uganda. Culturally we do not... accept homosexuality, lesbianism, LGBTQ. We cannot,\u201d said one local resident, 54-year-old Abdu Mukasa.",
    "\u201cWe were created by God. God created man and woman. And we cannot accept one sex to go on the same sex.\u201d",
    "Homosexuality was criminalised in Uganda under colonial-era laws but since independence from Britain in 1962 there has never been a conviction for consensual same-sex activity.",
    "A court later struck down the law on a technicality, but it had already sparked international condemnation, with some Western nations freezing or redirecting millions of dollars of government aid in response.",
    "Last week, police said they had arrested six men for \u201cpractising homosexuality\u201d in the southern lakeside town of Jinja.",
    "Another six men were arrested on the same charge on Sunday, according to police."
