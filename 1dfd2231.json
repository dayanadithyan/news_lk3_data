    "Gamage said a forged document had been submitted to the Colombo District Court indicating her resignation by the SJB.",

    "The State Minister said she has never drafted a letter of this nature. \"I have not resigned from my post of Deputy Secretary. If that was the case, I should first be removed from the Executive Committee,\" she said.",
