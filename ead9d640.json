    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe directed the Minister of Power & Energy and relevant officials to swiftly initiate a plan to revive the Trincomalee oil tank farm and incorporate it into the country\u2019s economy.",
    "He gave these directives during an inspection visit to the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) oil tank farm in Trincomalee this afternoon (March 03).",
    "The Head of State emphasized the urgency of implementing the Trincomalee Development Program by renovating the 61 tanks of the Upper Tank Farm (UTF), which remained unused for more than several decades.",
    "Upon his arrival, President Wickremesinghe was welcomed by LIOC\u2019s Managing Director Manoj Gupta at the LIOC\u2019s Lower Tank Farm area along with other LIOC senior officials and team members, who briefed him on the operations of the oil tank farm.",

    "During the visit, the delegation also inspected Sri Lanka\u2019s first locally-developed Grease Manufacturing Plant, which was built and launched by LIOC.
