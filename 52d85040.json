    "The collision, described as India's most devastating rail accident of the century, took place in Balasore district.",
    "While a thorough investigation is underway, preliminary findings suggest that the accident was caused by a signal failure, according to KS Anand, the chief public relations officer of the South Eastern Railway.",
    "It is estimated that approximately 2,000 passengers were on board the two passenger trains involved.",
    "The precise chain of events leading to the collision has been the subject of conflicting reports.",
