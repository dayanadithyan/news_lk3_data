    "The family is the foundation of society. That means a good family will help build a good society that is largely free of dishonesty, deceit, and bribery or corruption on a big scale or small. A fair and balanced analysis of Sri Lankan society will show that especially among political leaders and business tycoons, bribery and corruption are rampant while there is little by way of honesty, integrity and sincere desire to serve the people or set an example in servant-leadership. While allegations of huge scale bribery and corruption where leaders make millions of dollars are overlooked or ignored while public money worth billions is known to be hidden some secret\u00a0bank vaults.",
    "These and other crimes come to mind as the United Nations marks the Global Day of Parents on June 1 with the theme being \u201cAppreciate all parents throughout the world.\u201d In a statement, the UN says since the 1980s, the important role of the family has increasingly come to the attention of the international community. The General Assembly adopted a number of resolutions and proclaimed the International Year of the Family and the International Day of Families. Emphasising the critical role of parents in the rearing of children, the Global Day of Parents recognizes that the family has the primary responsibility for the nurturing and protection of children. For the full and harmonious development of their personality, children should grow up in a family environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding.",
    "Designated by the General Assembly in 2012, Global Day of Parents provides an opportunity to appreciate all parents for their \u201cselfless commitment to children and their lifelong sacrifice towards nurturing this relationship.\u201d",
    "Pointing out the need for greater support for working parents in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN says families bear the brunt of the COVID-19 outbreak. As the anchors of the family and the foundation of our communities and societies, parents have the responsibility of sheltering their families from harm, caring for out-of-school children and, at the same time, continuing their work responsibilities. Without support from parents, children\u2019s health, education and emotional well-being is at risk. By introducing family-friendly workplace policies and practices, companies and organizations will be in a better position to promote children\u2019s safety and wellbeing and provide systematic support to employees.",
    "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues its exponential growth, a technical note from United Nations International Children\u2019s Educational Fund (UNICEF), International Labour Organization (ILO) and UN Women on family-friendly policies and other good workplace practices in the context of COVID-19 shows that it is essential to support working families to minimize negative consequences for children.",
    "During the 1980\u2019s, the United Nations began focusing attention on the issues related to the family. In 1983, based on the recommendations of the Economic and Social Council, the Commission for Social Development in its resolution on the Role of the family in the development process requested the Secretary-General to enhance awareness among decision makers and the people of the problems and needs of the family, and of effective ways of meeting those needs.",
    "In a resolution approved on December 9,1989, the General Assembly proclaimed 1994 as the International Year of the Family; and in resolution 1993, the General Assembly decided that May 15 of every year to be observed as the International Day of Families. In 2012, the General Assembly proclaimed\u00a0 June 1 as the Global Day of Parents, to be observed annually in honour of parents throughout the world.",
    "Like no one else, parents and caregivers shape the experiences that build their children\u2019s brains and set them on a path towards healthy development. Parenting is too big a job for parents and caregivers to do alone. They need support to give their children the best possible start in life.",
    "Families remain at the centre of social life, ensuring the well-being of their members, educating and socializing children and youth and caring for young and old. In particular, family-oriented policies can contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals relating to doing away with poverty and hunger; ensuring healthy lives and promoting of well-being for all ages; ensuring educational opportunities throughout the lifespan and achieving gender equality, the UN says.",
    "Spiritual leaders also need to play a key role in this mission. For example, the prophetic Pope Francis has proposed a simple solution to bring about a better family life. He says we need to learn to say \u2018thank you\u2019, \u2018please\u2019 and \u2018sorry\u2019 more often. This is done in our workplaces and elsewhere, but to be sincere and from the heart, it needs to begin in the family."
