    "Allianz Lanka, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s leading insurers, has recently completed an initiative to support the students of St. John Del Rey Tamil Vidyalam. This school is located in the Bogawanthalawa Valley, one of the most picturesque tea-growing areas in Sri Lanka, and serves 543 students from grades 1 to 11.",
    "However, the students of St. John Del Rey Tamil Vidyalam face challenges in their pursuit of education. Many of them come from families engaged in labour work, and the school lacks resources to support them adequately. The school is located approximately 8km from the Bogawanthalawa town, and includes 27 teachers working hard to ensure these students can successfully complete the Grade 5 Scholarship Exam and the Ordinary Level Exam, despite a lack of resources.",
    "In response to this situation, Allianz Lanka donated academic books, library cupboards, and helped to repaint the school environment and give it a facelift to improve the school\u2019s facilities and atmosphere. The donations were officially handed over to the school at a ceremony held recently, which was attended by the Senior Management of Allianz Lanka, together with representatives from Allianz Lanka\u2019s Hatton branch, and its Central Zone for both General and Life insurance. This initiative is part of Allianz Lanka\u2019s CSR strategy, which aims to support quality education in Sri Lanka and contribute to the betterment of the community, while aligning with the UN SDGs.",
    "Commenting on the initiative, Alan Smee, CEO, Country Manager of Allianz Lanka, said, \u201cAs a responsible corporate citizen, Allianz Lanka is committed to supporting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Quality Education and contributing to the betterment of Sri Lankan communities. Through our CSR strategy, we strive to improve the learning experiences and access to education of rural school children by providing them with essential library books and necessary infrastructure support. This project is also in line with our core belief of protecting what is most precious in life, and we are pleased to have been able to make a meaningful difference in the lives of these students. We look forward to getting involved in and conducting other projects like this in the future too.\u201d",
