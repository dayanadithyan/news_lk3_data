    "Says writing off non-performing loans owed by VIPs will lead to a concerning situation",
    "Reveals many debtors are former Ministers, MPs and other VIPs",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress member Prof Charitha Herath yesterday said any attempt to write off non-performing loans owed to state banks by various VIPs will lead to a highly concerning situation.",
    "\u201cSome of the debtors are former Ministers and MPs,\u201d he revealed. The MP also noted that certain individuals whose debts were written off on previous occasions continue to engage in various other business activities to date.",
    "Herath said a program must be initiated immediately to collect the debts owed to state banks by such individuals. He also accused certain persons of attempting to write off these debts amidst the attempts to restructure domestic debt.\u00a0 \u201cThis is wrong. Debt restructuring is one thing. But there is a significant stock of debt that remains unpaid. The Government must take a decision about these,\u201d he said. The MP noted that sit was imperative to collect these loan payments.",
    "\u201cThe Government must be mindful. Former politicians who owe these debts are attempting to evade repayment through the debt restructuring efforts,\u201d he added.",
    "He demanded the government not allow any VIP who owes significant sums to banks to evade their responsibility in repaying them."
