    "Once held but deferred due to the pandemic, \u201cBreak-Fast at Sunset\u201d will be held again on 2 April\u00a0at 5.30 p.m. at the Independence Square to which an open invitation is being extended by the Sri Lankan Muslim Community to anyone free to join in the customs and traditions of Ramadan.",
    "\u201cThis is an open invitation to our brothers and sisters in and around Colombo. In fact, we would\u00a0love to have more participation from other communities/ faiths and the opportunity to host\u00a0them,\u201d organisers said.",
    "The Sri Lanka Muslim Civil Society is organising this on behalf of civil society groups in the\u00a0community as always, stressed a member of the organising committee.",
    "The month of Ramadan sees a rise in activity amongst Muslims. Mostly, people see them\u00a0flocking to mosques for prayers, but the month signifies much more than spiritual cleansing. It\u00a0is equally meant to cleanse the character of a person by improving the quality of his/her\u00a0relationships and transactions with those around them. Hence, breaking fast together or facilitating it for others is considered one of the highest of good deeds and displays of\u00a0exemplary character.",
    "\u201cProphet Muhammad \u2013 may peace be upon him \u2013 taught us that: \u201cBy his good character, a\u00a0believer will attain the degree of one who prays during the night and fasts during the day\u201d,\u201d said\u00a0the committee member, adding that Ramadan is not only a month of fasting but also a month\u00a0of building the habits of giving, sharing, and practicing good character.",
    "Talking about the event, he explained, \u201cWe expect to host circa 1,500 - 2,000 people for \u201cBreak-Fast at Sunset\u201d. Given the location there will be ample parking, but everyone needs to be a little\u00a0bit considerate when doing so. It will be simple, charming, and end within a short time with\u00a0food being served at the location.\u201d",
    "He further explained that Prophet Muhammad \u2013 may peace be upon him \u2013 taught us that \u201cThere\u00a0are three whose duas (prayers/supplications) are not rejected \u2013 a just ruler, the prayer of the\u00a0oppressed person, and that of a fasting person when he breaks his fast.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe will be praying\u00a0that evening for the well-being of our mother land and fellow Sri Lankans, for better times\u00a0ahead economically, socially, and good health. Those joining us can unite in this prayer,\u201d he added.",
    "The month of Ramadan is special to Muslims. They hold fast daily for 30 days and spend the\u00a0nights in prayer. The month is rich with a history of revelations from God and teachings of the\u00a0Prophet. Hence, it is sought after by Muslims as a period to seek forgiveness and reflect on\u00a0leading holistic lives in this world together with those around them and prepare for life in the\u00a0hereafter.",
    "On behalf of the Muslim Community, the organisers extended its thanks to the relevant\u00a0authorities who facilitated the event including the Ministry of Public Administration and\u00a0Colombo Municipal Council and those who\u00a0supported to arrange the\u00a0logistics and event\u00a0coordination."
