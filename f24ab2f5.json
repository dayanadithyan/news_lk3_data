  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Colombo Fort Magistrate today (29 March) issued an order pertaining to the detention of the ill-famed underworld figures \u201cHarak Kata\u201d and \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d.",
    "Accordingly, Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage ordered that proper security measures be followed in the event the duo is taken out of the detention centre for investigative purposes.",
    "He further ordered to keep them in the custody of either an authorized officer of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) or the OIC of the relevant police division in which the investigation is being carried out.",
    "The order was issued in view of a request made to the court by a group of lawyers, including Attorney-at-Law Rienzie Arsekularatne, PC, pertaining to the safety of the two criminals.",
    "The lawyers, referring to how notorious underworld figures \u201cMakandure Madush\u201d and \u201cKosgoda Tharaka\u201d were previously shot dead by the police, requested the court to ensure that handcuffs and leg shackles are on the two suspects whenever they are taken out for investigation purposes.",
    "\u2018Harak Kata\u2019 was brought back to the island with his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika, alias \u2018Kudu Salindu\u2019 after defence officials in Madagascar officially informed the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka, on 08 March, of the arrest of eight suspects including the infamous criminal duo, a Malagasy woman who claims to be the wife of \u2018Harak Kata\u2019 and her father.",
    "They had been arrested in Madagascar on 01 March, in a joint operation conducted by the National Central Bureau (NCB) of the INTERPOL, Madagascar\u2019s law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. The INTERPOL had previously issued Red Notices against \u201cHarak Kata\u201d and \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d.",
    "During his stay in Madagascar, \u201cHarak Kata\u201d had posed as a wealthy businessman while \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d and the others pretended to be his bodyguards.",
    "The extradition process was coordinated by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission in Madagascar.",
    "\u201cHarak Kata\u201d who operates his drug syndicate in Dubai, Malaysia, Singapore, Seychelles, the Maldives and Madagascar was previously arrested at the Dubai International Airport in August 2022.",
    "However, he had changed his name to Herath Dissanayakage Roshan Isanka in the passport which was found on him at the time of his arrest in Dubai. The Dubai Police had released \u201cHarak Kata\u201d on 03 October 2022, as they were unable to complete the legal matters pertaining to his deportation.",
    "\u201cHarak Kata\u201d had been wanted by Sri Lanka Police for his involvement in five murders, six robberies and transnational drug trafficking. He has reportedly smuggled in nearly 670kg of heroin to Sri Lanka via sea routes."
