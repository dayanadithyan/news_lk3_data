    "That has meant they will now need to make the final of the 10-team qualification tournament, that also includes the West Indies, Ireland, the United States and hosts Zimbabwe.",
    "\"I don't feely any pressure. This is the third qualifying round I am playing in, when you consider the last two T20 World Cups,\" Shanaka told journalists ahead of the team's departure to Zimbabwe.",
    "\"Countries like the USA, the Netherlands and Ireland have developed over the last decade in terms of their cricket. Unfortunately we have not played to the best of our abilities over the last few years and that is why we are playing in the qualifiers,\" he said.",
    "\"There is no pressure, but I think its a good challenge for us and I am confident we can win.\"",
