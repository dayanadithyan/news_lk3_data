    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013\u00a0The Bank of England has commenced printing new banknotes with the portrait of King Charles. But the new notes, in 5, 10, 15 and 20 Pound denominations, are not scheduled to be released into circulation until mid-2024, UK media reported.",
    "The delay is in order to recalibrate all types of machines that scan money, such as ATMs and bank money counters, to recognise the new notes.",
    "However, the new 50 pence coin is scheduled to be released several months prior to the notes, as soon as stocks of coins featuring Queen Elizabeth are all released into public circulation.",
