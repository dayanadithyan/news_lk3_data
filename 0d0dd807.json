  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag said that Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka\u2019s returns for the Gujarat Titans in this season\u2019s Indian Premier League has been disappointing, and that the all-rounder has not lived up to expectations.",
    "Shanaka was dismissed for 17 runs off 16 balls in Qualifier 1 of the IPL on Tuesday and has featured in just three matches for the Titans this season.",
    "Speaking to Cricbuzz ahead of today\u2019s Qualifier 2 between the Titans and the Mumbai Indians, Sehwag said, \u201cI am worried about Dasun Shanaka. Gujarat can play Odean Smith and Alzarri Joseph in place of him. Shanaka\u2019s form has been disappointing.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe had huge expectations from him and he hasn\u2019t lived up to even 1% of them. The Titans should play (Abhinav) Manohor instead of Shanaka, as he is a batter who can smash sixes,\u201d Sehwag added.",
    "Shanaka was signed by the Titans to replace New Zealander Kane Williamson who was injured in the opening match of the tournament, and was unutilized for almost all of the group stage games, before making his debut."
