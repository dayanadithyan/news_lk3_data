  "original_body_lines": [
    "In the face of criticism against the new Anti-Terrorism\u00a0 Bill, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the government would\u00a0 not bring about any fundamental changes to the current version.",
    "The bill, already announced in the gazette notification, is\u00a0 to be presented in Parliament for debate and enactment. This is to be\u00a0 enacted by repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which was invoked\u00a0 mainly in dealing with LTTE terrorism.",
    "After the war was over, the government came under pressure\u00a0 from sections of the international community, including the United\u00a0 Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to repeal the PTA to be replaced\u00a0 with a new law that conforms to international standards in countering\u00a0 terrorism.",
    "The parties such as the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) have\u00a0 already raised objections to the provisions of the new bill. However,\u00a0 Minister Rajapakshe said the bill was worked after studying counter-terrorism laws of the countries such as the United States, India, the\u00a0 United Kingdom and Germany.",
    "\u201cThey are even more rigorous than ours. Therefore, we won\u2019t\u00a0 make any major change to the current version. There may be minor\u00a0 changes,\u201d he said.(Kelum Bandara)"
