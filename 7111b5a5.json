    "Responding to reports that members of the Inter-University Student\u2019s Federation (IUSF) members were turned away in Jaffna, Convenor Wasantha Mudalige said the media had misreported the incident.",
    "\u201cIt was members of Douglas Devananda\u2019s Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) that turned up with placards,\u201d Mudalige said. \u201cA group of about 25 people who were visibly intoxicated came to us and said that they didn\u2019t want an \u2018Aragalaya.\u2019 They said that problems affecting the people of the North have been resolved. They said that we can return to wherever we came from,\u201d Mudalige said.",
    "Mudalige accused the government of attempting to misconstrue events by resorting to intimidation. \u201cMothers and fathers in the North have the same problems as those in the South. Their children are missing, some are held political prisoners and the Prevention of Terrorism Act is still a problem for them,\u201d he explained.",
    "If the government wishes to send Douglas Devananda's henchmen in Jaffna and attempt to brush problems under the carpet, that cannot be done, Mudalige opined. He said the IUSF discussion in Jaffna was successful, adding that a visit ended on a high note with plans to revisit Jaffna soon.",
    "\u201cThe media had reported that the people of Jaffna sent us away. This is not true and it has to be corrected,\u201d he added. (Kalani Kumarasinghe)"
