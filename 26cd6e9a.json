    "Accuses President of ridiculing both the people\u2019s right to franchise and democracy under the cover of parliamentary privilege and presidential immunity",
    "Says statements of this nature will delay any incoming international aid and support",
    "Likens Wickremesinghe\u2019s comments to that of a dictator and says only one group was pleased by his tirade",
    "Denies the President ever texted him warning him to not vacate his seat in Parliament",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Colombo Mayoral candidate Mujibur Rahman yesterday questioned President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s state of mind over comments he made this week in Parliament about the local Government poll. Holding a press conference yesterday at the Opposition Leader\u2019s office, Rahman said the President has ridiculed both the people\u2019s right to franchise and democracy under the cover of parliamentary privilege and presidential immunity.",
    "\u201cIn some instances, his comments were in violation of the constitution,\u201d Rahman noted, adding that the President is implying it is he who will decide when the elections can be held. Rahman also accused the President of disregarding the independent commissions set up by him. \u201cWe are confused by his statements,\u201d Rahman said, pointing to the many contradictory statements made by the head of state in recent times.",
    "Rahman likened Wickremesinghe\u2019s comments to that of a dictator and said only one group was pleased by his address to Parliament. \u201cThere was a group who were laughing and cheering him on. He spoke to please this group that destroyed this country, it\u2019s economy and the future of our children,\u201d he said, adding that Wickremesinghe yesterday proved he was in fact the protector of the Pohottuwa and its MPs. Rahman said the President even disregarded the Speaker and acted as he pleased in Parliament. \u201cHe has no power to act in such a manner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows his state of mind and this is a dangerous situation,\u201d he\u00a0 added. Rahman also slammed the President\u2019s statements claiming that no election has been declared and that he will appoint a new Election Commission. Rahman questioned if the IMF and other organisations will now support Sri Lankan given the President\u2019s penchant to make false statements. \u201cWho will help us when the leader of the country is raving like a madman? This is highly damaging. What will the international community think of us? Will they believe the head of state is in his right senses?\u201d he asked. Rahman warned these actions will only further delay incoming aid to the country. He also denied the President\u2019s claim that he had texted Rahman warning him not to vacate his seat in Parliament."
