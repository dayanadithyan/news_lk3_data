    "\u200b\u200bSince its launch in 2018, Uber Eats has emerged as the most loved food and grocery delivery platform in Sri Lanka. Having scaled to 6 cities, the company has unlocked earning opportunities for hundreds of thousands of couriers and merchants, and made food and grocery delivery convenient and hassle-free for customers. Last year, Uber Eats completed 24 million deliveries and remains invested in bringing the best of Uber Eats to Sri Lanka. In March 2023, Uber Eats onboarded 100 locally-manufactured, custom-designed electric cycles for delivery, after becoming the first platform to introduce cycle deliveries last year. This was part of the company\u2019s global mission to be a zero-emissions platform by 2040. During the recent economic crisis, Uber Eats donated $ 200,000 to the Sri Lanka Red Cross to deliver life-saving medicines and food rations to most-impacted families.",
