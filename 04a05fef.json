  "original_body_lines": [
    "While conceding that a reform of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) constitution was necessary, SLC Secretary Mohan de Silva believes that it needs to be done in consultation with its stakeholders.",
    "Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe appointed a 10-member committee in February, led by former Supreme Court Judge Justice KT Chithrasiri, to draft a new proposed SLC constitution, a move that has been condemned by SLC.",
    "De Silva said changes were necessary, such as addressing the bloated number of votes, but it needed to be addressed differently.",
    "\u201cThe SLC Ex-Co has decided that some of the clauses in the constitution do need to be amended, but we are of the consensus view that it needs to be done with the consultation of our stakeholders,\u201d SLC Secretary Mohan de Silva told the Daily Mirror.",
    "\u201cThe voting structure needs to be amended, but a fair mechanism needs to be implemented that ensures the rights of our stakeholders \u2013 our clubs and our associations,\u201d de Silva said.",
    "Interestingly, SLC published a notice in the Daily Mirror on Monday, calling the Minister\u2019s move \u201cillegal\u201d as it \u201cinterfered with the Constitution and due functioning of Sri Lanka Cricket. We will take all necessary action to protect the Constitution of SLC, the rights of its members and the well-being of Sri Lankan cricket.\"",
    "The notice also said that SLC themselves had appointed a ten-member independent committee, headed by President\u2019s Counsel Navin Marapana, to suggest constitutional amendments to the membership, in the interests of Sri Lanka cricket."
