    "Girls have their private photos, which they trusted their partner with, are shared on Facebook Groups, TikTok or Whatsapp, especially after a break-up or argument",
    "Reach out to an organization such as the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT) CERT or the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) to make a complaint and reach out for support",
    "February, a month to celebrate love, whether it\u2019s our partner, our parents or our friends. Social media has opened a world of possibilities in how we express our love and commitment. From articles on \u2018How to Keep the Flame Alive\u2019 to \u2018What to get your significant other this valentine\u2019, the internet holds infinite information to help us navigate the complicated world of dating and relationships.",
    "However, love and relationships transcend beyond this month of love. We should make our loved ones feel special throughout the year, respecting their individuality, choices and making sure they feel special at every opportunity. We talk a lot about what love is to us.",
    "At UNFPA we talk about love and relationships, especially with young people as they start exploring the world of dating, crushes and exploring their sexuality and supporting them to make informed choices to be happy, healthy and safe. Our programmes with young people give us insight into their questions and expectations as they grow older, including the challenges and obstacles they face as they navigate an exciting, albeit dangerous, world.",
    "UNFPA supports and promotes the rights of all individuals to enjoy their sexual and reproductive health by providing access to information services and sexual and reproductive health education. Young people, especially girls, are susceptible to the challenges of relationships. Girls have their private photos, which they trusted their partner with, shared on Facebook Groups, TikTok or Whatsapp, especially after a break-up or argument. This creates a sense of mistrust and insecurity and violates their basic human rights. These incidents lead women and girls to commit suicide and self-harm. If this happens you can:",
    "Talk to a trusted person, especially an adult, that will support and guide you;",
    "Reach out to an organization such as the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT) CERT or the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) to make a complaint and reach out for support",
    "Refrain from engaging with the other person and giving them further information.",
    "As young people move forward in relationships, they should be taught about the importance of consent and respecting the other person\u2019s choice, including their privacy. Love is an all- consuming beautiful feeling which we all enjoy. We enjoy the companionship, happiness and milestones we get to celebrate with our significant other. We should all feel comfortable and safe with our loved ones. A relationship is a partnership. If a young couple wants to engage in a healthy sexual relationship, they should be encouraged to discuss their partner\u2019s comfort and preferences, that doesn\u2019t force one person to compromise or make choices they are not comfortable with.",
    "Unplanned pregnancies not only stifle a girl\u2019s education, but lead them having to sacrifice their dreams and opportunities open to them. UNFPA works closely with young people to dispel myths and misconceptions on contraceptives and raise awareness on safe sex and reproductive health. If you wish to access more information or know about available services, you can:",
    "Visit the Ministry of Health website and access further information",
    "Reach out to the Family Planning Association (FPA) and the National STD and AIDS",
    "Talk to professionals at the FPA for information on contraceptives, cervical cancer testing among other services.",
    "UNFPA with the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health works closely with civil society organizations and youth groups to raise awareness on CSE and ensure that young people have access to information and services that empower them to make informed choices for themselves.",
    "Comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) provides age-appropriate information to help young people explore and nurture positive values regarding their sexual and reproductive health. This includes discussions about family life, relationships, culture and gender roles, and also addresses human rights, gender equality, and threats such as discrimination and sexual abuse.",
    "As Sri Lanka grapples with a socio-economic crisis, the inherent needs of women and girls are sidelined. UNFPA, with support from donors and implementing partners, is racing against the clock to provide much needed support to uphold the dignity and wellbeing of women and girls.",
    "Simply staying informed about the issues and sharing what you learn with others also makes a big difference. Increased public awareness of issues often leads to greater political support to address them. Visit our website to know how you can be a part of our work"
