    "Yes, you read it right; toothpaste makes a really good hair gel. Just squeeze a tiny amount of gel toothpaste in a bowl and add about 50 ml of water to it, and stir it for a while to completely dissolve the toothpaste. Then use this mixture the same way you would use your hair gel. But, remember, you must wash off your hair by the end of the day to ensure that the residue does not build up in your hair.",
    "Toothpaste provides a common solution to your everyday skin problems. To get rid of a pimple, simply apply menthol toothpaste and keep it on for a few minutes. Wash it off to see that your pimple has completely dried out. Always remember to hydrate your skin afterwards, with some moisturising lotion.",
    "Want to get that natural shine on your finger, or toe nails, but you realise you are out of enamel? Well, here also toothpaste comes to your rescue. Take a small amount of toothpaste and buff your nails with it, using a soft brush. Whitening toothpastes can also help to get rid of those ugly tinges that you get on your nails, after extensive use of nail paint.",
    "To get rid of that unsightly bruise, apply a mixture of toothpaste, and a skin lotion, and cover it up with a band-aid. Do this for about two to three days and you will be surprised to see how soon your wound disappears. You can soothe a mosquito bite by applying some toothpaste over the itching skin. Not just this, toothpaste can even be used to heal a few mild burns.",
    "Has your diamond ring lost all its lustre? Then get its sparkle back by cleaning it with toothpaste and a damp cloth. You can also use toothpaste to bring back shine on your silver. Rub some toothpaste on them with your hand. Wait for the toothpaste to dry and wash it off with some water. If you are still unhappy with the result, then you can leave the toothpaste on it overnight. Later, polish your silver with a soft cloth to make them dazzle.",
