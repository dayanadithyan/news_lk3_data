    "Sivalingam Aruran, one of the five accused charged with aiding and abetting the LTTE suicide cadre who attempted to assassinate former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa while he was serving as the Defence Secretary in 2006, has been acquitted and released from the case by the Colombo High Court.",
    "High Court Judge Nawaratne Marasinghe held that the confession obtained from the accused has not been taken voluntarily and thereby it has no evidentiary value.",
    "In this case, the Attorney General filed indictments against the five accused for conspiring with the LTTE suicide cadre and assisting him to carry out his assasination attempt, where two army officers were killed and several others injured while the former Defence Secretary had escaped unhurt. The LTTE cadre had driven an explosive laden vehicle into the former Defence Secretary's motorcade at Pittala Junction on or around December 01, 2006."
