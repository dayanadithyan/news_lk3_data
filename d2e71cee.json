    "\u201cKudos to the Central Bank for sticking to the plan. It\u2019s working. As detailed in our Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) economic Blue Print in which we have said continued relaxation of restrictions will help move the rate to a stable equilibrium, with further action as per our document,\u201d Dr. de Silva said in his Twitter message.",
    "\u201c Balance of payment difficulties and black market premium in the official forex market will be eliminated by adjusting the exchange rate to the equilibrium ( market)level. This can be done through a transitional phase if floating the currency to permit market to reveal the equilibrium rate, and then stabilizing that rate through Central Bank intervention in the forex market,\u201d he added quoting the SJB blueprint.(Yohan Perera)"
