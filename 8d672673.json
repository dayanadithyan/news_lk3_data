  "original_body_lines": [
    "Even if Afghanistan\u2019s Rashid Khan is passed fit to play the third ODI against Sri Lanka tomorrow, he will still be suffering from mental fatigue, cricket commentator Najeebullah Shinwari claims.",
    "\u201cThe iconic face and fan favourite of every League, the superstar Rashid Khan\u2019s non-availability against Sri Lanka could have a hand in the series decider, after Ibrahim Zadran\u2019s special 98 gave Afghanistan victory in game one before Sri Lanka\u2019s strong comeback in game two to level the series 1-1,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt looks like the short three-day gap between the IPL final and first ODI gave the Afghan superstar a mental scare more than anything. If it was a T20, then he\u2019s a giant and will bowl four overs anytime but with the ten overs in ODIs, even the thought will give you mental fatigue.\u201d",
    "\u201cSo playing him in the third ODI will be forcing him to play, rather than out of choice. Anyways it\u2019s another debate of how many leagues he should play a year.",
    "A fit injury free Rashid Khan is better for cricket and fans as well,\u201d he added.",
    "Indian physio Prasanth Panchada has been working overtime with Afghanistan\u2019s star bowling all-rounder Khan to make him fit for the third and final ODI against Sri Lanka. The 25-year-old Rashid Khan was in India for a day\u2019s treatment for a lower back injury. (Bipin Dani)"
