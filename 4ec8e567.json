    "As such, continuing their programme on Road Safety Awareness alongside with the Sri Lanka Traffic Police, hands-on training sessions were carried out including live demonstrations at the Weligama Siddhartha College to 500 kids across 12 schools on ways to regulate traffic near schools. As part of these sessions, a tailor-made training programme for School Traffic Wardens was also conducted to encourage and groom those interested to take on the role. To appraise the efforts and as a monitoring mechanism, 60 participating students were issued a certificate by the Sri Lanka Traffic Police where they were endorsed as certifed Traffic Wardens.",
    "Subsequently and as the first programme of the year, a public road safety awareness programme was conducted to the Staff and owners of two-wheel and three-wheelers at the Karandeniya Divisional Secretariat. Participants were addressed on the importance of making smart decisions when driving.",
