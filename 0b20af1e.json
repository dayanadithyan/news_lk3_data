    "A government official in India has been suspended after he ordered a reservoir to be drained to retrieve his phone.",
    "It took three days to pump millions of litres of water out of the dam, after Rajesh Vishwas dropped the device while taking a selfie.",
    "By the time it was found, the phone was too water-logged to work.",
    "Mr Vishwas claimed it contained sensitive government data and needed retrieving, but he has been accused of misusing his position.",
    "The food inspector dropped his Samsung phone, worth about $1,200 (100,000 rupees), into Kherkatta Dam, in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, on Sunday.",
    "After local divers failed to find it, he paid for a diesel pump to be brought in, Mr Vishwas said in a video statement quoted in Indian media.",
    "He said he had verbal permission from an official to drain \u201csome water into a nearby canal\u201d, adding that the official said it \u201cwould in fact benefit the farmers who would have more water\u201d.",
    "The pump ran for several days, emptying out roughly two million litres (440,000 gallons) of water - reportedly enough to irrigate 6 sq km (600 hectares) of farmland.",
    "His mission was stopped when another official, from the water resource department arrived following a complaint.",
    "\u201cHe has been suspended until an inquiry. Water is an essential resource and it cannot be wasted like this,\u201d Priyanka Shukla, a Kanker district official, told The National newspaper.",
    "Mr Vishwas has denied misusing his position, and said that the water he drained was from the overflow section of the dam and \u201cnot in usable condition\u201d.",
    "But his actions have drawn criticism from politicians, with the state\u201ds opposition BJP party\u2019s national vice-president tweeting: \u201cWhen people are depending upon tankers for water facility in in scorching summers, the officer has drained 41 lakh litres which could have been used for irrigation purpose for 1,500 acres of land.\u201d"
