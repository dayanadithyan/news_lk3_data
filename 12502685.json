    "Prices of essential goods will drop considerably by the end of the year enabling Sri Lanka to be among the countries with the lowest inflation rate, UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene said.",
    "Speaking during a public meeting in Kurunegala District during the weekend, Mr. Wijewardene said Sri Lanka is now occupying the 20th slot when it comes to countries with the highest inflation rate. \"Sri Lanka was the nation with the third highest inflation rate in the globe some months ago but today it is occupying the 20th slot in the rankings. The President had already said his intention is to make Sri Lanka a nation with the lowest inflation rate,\" he said.",
    "\"The Opposition which earlier said Sri Lanka would never get IMF assistance is saying today that all that the nation had got was a loan from the IMF. However people will be able to enjoy some concessions by the end of the year as prices of many essential items such as fuel will be reduced, \" he added. (Yohan Perera)"
