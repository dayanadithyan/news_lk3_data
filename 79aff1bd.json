    "\u2013 For 2023/2024, LAN will focus on strengthening its investor network locally and globally in order to increase cross border investments that will help accelerate its startups",
    "The Lankan Angel Network (LAN), the country\u2019s largest network of angel investors, has elected serial investor and entrepreneur Prajeeth Balasubramaniam as the Chairperson of its board for 2023/2024.",
    "The founder of LAN, and its inaugural chair, Balasubramaniam has taken over the stewardship of LAN from its outgoing chairperson, Ms. Chandi Dharmaratne, who congratulated him and said: \u201cPrajeeth has been the driving force behind Sri Lanka\u2019s startup ecosystem since a few of us came together in a formalized way to fast track its development at the very beginning. It is fitting that he now takes the lead on our investment network\u2019s next phase of growth, while also preparing the startup ecosystem to face a new set of challenges stemming from Sri Lanka\u2019s slow, yet steady, recovery.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe conceptualized a network of angel investors in 2010 with the support of the Indian Angel Network (IAN) and set LAN up in 2011 with a core purpose of having an angel investing ecosystem for Sri Lanka. Our six patrons, namely Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya, Hanif Yusoof, Rajan Anandan, Ms. Linda Speldewinde, Arittha R. Wikramanayake and Ms. Padmaja Ruparel (from IAN), have been very supportive from LAN\u2019s inception and continue to help out when needed, while the initial board and co-founders were very supportive in moulding LAN. In the last 11 years, several chairs and boards have worked towards the betterment of this ecosystem, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them all,\u201d commented the new Chairperson of LAN, Balasubramaniam.",
    "Balasubramaniam will be joined in this important undertaking by the following LAN Board Members who have also been appointed for 2023/2024:Dumindra Ratnayake, Chairman \u2013 Martin & George; Mr. Nathan Sivaganathan, Co-Founder \u2013 Hatch; Mr. Jeevan Gnanam, Co-Founder \u2013 Hatch; Mr. Adil Mansoor, CEO \u2013 Promo Lanka; Ms. Anarkali Moonesinghe, former CEO \u2013 CIMB Sri Lanka; and Mr. Sharhan Muhseen, Chairman \u2013 Platinum Advisors (Singapore).",
