    "Sri Lanka can and must do better to protect its citizens\u2019 fundamental rights",
    "The ATA is so comically broad that any communal gathering faces the prospect of being deemed a terrorism offense, thereby justifying abandonment of due process safeguards",
    "Viewed in conjunction with its definitional problem, the ATA\u2019s rehabilitation\u00a0scheme is abusive\u00a0and coercive",
    "Through its overbroad definition of terrorism and backdooring of deradicalization regulations, the ATA vastly expands state power at the expense of citizens\u2019 fundamental rights",
    "For forty years, human rights activists have demanded repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) of 1979. Ultimately it was money, not human rights (the threat of losing GSP+ trade status) that forced Sri Lanka\u2019s hand. A close read of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) reveals it for what it is: lipstick on a pig. It tinkers at the margins without changing what is rotten at its core. Through its overbroad definition of terrorism and backdooring of deradicalization regulations, the ATA vastly expands state power at the expense of citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.",
    "A major problem with the PTA was its failure to define terrorism. The ATA makes matters worse by defining terrorism too broadly. Any crime consists of two components\u2014a prohibited act and a criminal intent. Both have problems.\u00a0 Starting with the act element, the ATA prohibits \u201ccausing serious obstruction . . . with essential services or supplies\u201d (\u00a7 3(2)(f)). That could encompass last summer\u2019s protests or a labour strike. The ATA also prohibits being \u201ca member of an unlawful assembly\u201d for committing a prohibited act (\u00a7 3(2)(l)). Defining a crime as serious as terrorism on group membership alone is deeply problematic given Sri Lanka\u2019s past.",
    "After the Easter Sunday attacks, police arrested R. Mazahima for wearing a dress printed with a ship\u2019s wheel(misconstrued as Dharmachakra) and Ashnaf Jazeem for writing a \u2018jihad\u2019 poem (that actually spoke against extremism and violence). The ATA would not prevent these arrests; it defines terrorism to include incitement through words, signs, or visible representations that are \u201clikely to be understood by some or all of the members of the public\u201d as encouraging terrorism (\u00a7 10(1)(a)). While statements must be taken in context (\u00a7 10(4)), do we really think officers would act differently tomorrow? Detainees can say that the image or writing did not express their views or was published without consent (\u00a7 10(5)), but not that it was grossly misconstrued.",
    "Gathering or sharing \u201cany confidential information\u201d can amount to an independent offence, raising threats to media freedom despite the carveout for information \u201cpublished in good faith with due diligence for the benefit of the public or in the national interest\u201d (\u00a7 9).The ATA bans sending a \u201cterrorism publication,\u201d which includes anything that could be viewed as useful for a terrorist offence (\u00a7 11(1)(e), (3)(b)). Third party platforms that provide \u201ca service to others that enables them to obtain, read, listen to or look at a terrorism publication\u201d also face liability (\u00a7 11(1)(d)).",
    "The mental state element is even worse. The ATA bans acts committed with the intent to compel action by the state, any other government, or an international organization (\u00a7 3(1)(b)). It bans acts committed to incite discrimination, hostility, or violence (\u00a7 3(1)(e)).While the latter sounds fine on paper, the subversion of the ICCPR Act of 2007raises obvious concerns. Racist monks who terrorize minorities will incite violence with impunity under the ATA while the state arrests minorities for harming majority feelings.",
    "The ATA punishes not only direct perpetrators, but also those who abet \u201cany act preparatory to the commission of an offence\u201d (\u00a7 5(1)).There is liability for failure to report or provide information to police (\u00a7 15). In the United States, where I practice, there is generally no duty to report a crime, except for mandatory reporting by teachers, doctors, and social workers of child abuse or neglect. Singapore imposes such a duty under section 424 of its Penal Code, but violators face only six months imprisonment whereas the ATA imposes 7 years and up to a Rs. 500,000 fine(\u00a7 15(b)).",
    "A hypothetical might help put it all together. Imagine that Tamil and Muslim mothers occupy public roadways protesting the years-long detention of their loved ones under the PTA. They intend to press the government to release or charge those detained. Human rights activists join in seeking legal reform and urging the international community to act. After the first day, protesters meet to share ideas. They post information about this meeting on social media and in local newspapers. Lawyers for PTA detainees attend and give updates about their clients\u2019 cases. Some curious locals attend, while others stay home. Media outlets cover the meeting and the protests. How many potential crimes have been committed under the ATA, and by whom?",
    "Mothers and human rights activists could be liable for taking part in the protests. These protests on public roads obstructed essential services, and they were undertaken with the intent to influence government action and rally the international community.",
    "By attending the strategy meeting, protesters could also be liable for engaging in an act preparatory to the commission of a terrorist offence, as well as for being a member of an unlawful assembly for the purpose of committing that offence.",
    "Lawyers who attend the strategy meeting could be liable for sharing confidential information at the strategy meeting. By offering potentially helpful information, they might be liable for abetting a preparatory act to terrorism or being a member of an unlawful assembly.",
    "Social media companies and data or internet service providers could be liable for transmitting information about the strategy session or protests, which could be understood by some as useful for preparation.",
    "Media outlets are at the whim of a DIG, who must assess if their coverage was published in good faith and with due diligence for the public interest.",
    "Locals who attend the strategy meeting or protests out of sheer curiosity could be liable for being a member of an unlawful assembly.",
    "Those who do not attend but were reasonably aware of one or both could be liable for failing to report information to police.",
    "The ATA is so comically broad that any communal gathering faces the prospect of being deemed a terrorism offence, thereby justifying abandonment of due process safeguards. In a country where existing counterterrorism laws have been abused to trample fundamental rights for minority communities, the ATA\u2019s definitional overbreadth makes things worse, not better. Everything flows from this definitional problem. Positive procedural changes are small comfort at the margins with vastly more people facing arbitrary detention under the proposed ATA.",
    "Less publicized is how the ATA backdoors banned deradicalization regulations to the PTA that were gazetted in 2021. Seeing alarming parallels to China\u2019s Uyghur reeducation camps, the EU Parliament recommended suspending GSP+ again (for the first time since the war) based in part on these regulations. Sri Lankan activists took the matter to court, and the Supreme Court stayed their implementation. The ATA revives these regulations by giving the Attorney General authority to defer criminal proceedings and recommend rehabilitation of the accused(\u00a7 71, 77). Rehabilitation in turn would be administered by the new Bureau of Rehabilitation, created by the Bureau of Rehabilitation Act of 2023.Through these twin bills, the government attempts an end to run around the Supreme Court by incorporating a deradicalization bill into the ATA\u2019s framework.",
    "This would have drastic real-world consequences. Masses of ordinary Muslims were detained after the Easter Sunday attacks, like masses of Tamils detained after the civil war. The ATA gives the Attorney General power to defer an indictment and recommend rehabilitation, reparations, apology, and community servicein ordinary cases (\u00a7 71(1)-(3)). As to persons who have yet to be charged with a crime, on what legal basis may the state order rehabilitation, payment of compensation, or other penalties? Similar powers are bestowed to the Attorney General after charges are filed. The ATA permits the chief prosecutor \u201cat any time before the judgement is given by the High Court\u201d to withdraw the indictment and impose rehabilitation, payment of reparations, and community service in lieu of trial (\u00a7 77(1)-(3)). Once the indictment is withdrawn, on what legal basis may the state order an uncharged suspect to forego liberty and pay reparations?",
    "A poor family cannot withstand loss of their sole breadwinner for three months of detention or 12 months of remand custody, much less years waiting for a case to reach trial. Even if innocent of any crime, the prospect of freedom is too great to forego. Detainees will opt for rehabilitation whether or not they have a strong defense. Viewed in conjunction with its definitional problem, the ATA\u2019s rehabilitation scheme is abusive and coercive. Sri Lanka can and must do better to protect its citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.",
