    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s cement prices are expected to come down by 300 to 500 rupees per 50 kilogram bag of cement, following a recent appreciation of the rupee, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando said.",
    "\u201cThe reduction in prices is due to the strengthening of our currency, the falling interest rates and the current economic standards that we have out in place,\u201d said Fernando told reporters Monday.",
    "A request was made to manufacturers to also reduce prices of steel rods, Fernando said without giving details.",
    "Sri Lanka has in the past slammed price controls on cement but has protected political powerful steep producers with import tariffs, pushing up the costs of citizens struggling to build a house, critics say.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee collapsed from 200 to 360 to the US dollar last year driving inflation up, and has since appreciated to around 295 rupees. In the past two years freight costs also rocketed, but have collapsed to pre-Covid levels after US monetary tightening.",
    "\u201cAlthough the fall in the dollar price is one of the reasons for the fall in cement and steel prices, it is not the sole reason,\u201d a ministry spokesperson told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cIncreasing electricity prices also play a role in the determination of production costs.\u201d (Colombo/June05/2023)"
