    "Whilst highlighting that the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka is to build up a human chain on April 21 to mark the 4th anniversary of Easter Sunday attacks, Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith today urged all citizens to join the church in this exercise.",
    "\u201cWe call upon all our fellow citizens to join us, irrespective of differences of racial/ religious and political party affiliations to make up a human chain which will call upon our leaders to render justice to victims of Easter Sunday attacks and to strengthen the hands of freedom and justice in our motherland, which has unfortunately weakened,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe invite all to gather along the side of the Colombo Negombo main road on both sides by 8.30 am on Friday April 21, starting from St Anthony's Church Kochchikade and St Sebastian\u2019s Church, Katuwapitiya, Negombo, observe silence at 8.45 am and remain there till 9 am,\u201d he added.",
    "The cardinal also called all offices and factories to observe two-minute silence at 8.45 am on April 21.",
    "Asked as to whether it is worth highlighting about the attack now since four years have passed since the mayhem, he said the effort is to prevent everyone from forgetting about the attack and seek the real truth behind the attack. \u201cEven the present President does not seem to be interested in finding the real reason behind the attacks. Actually people including the victims are not going to forget it as more than 300 cases have been filed in various courts seeking justice,\u201d he said. (Yohan Perera)"
