  "original_body_lines": [
    "The committee appointed to probe the recent kidney transplant racket uncovered by Ada Derana\u2019s \u2018Ukussa\u2019 at a private hospital in Borella has recommended that the approval granted for the hospital to perform kidney transplants be temporarily halted.",
    "Accordingly, the Attorney General had informed the Court of Appeal today (04 May) that the committee had recommended that all kidney transplants be suspended at the private hospital in question, until the relevant investigations have concluded.",
    "The matter was raised when a writ petition filed by the hospital, seeking to invalidate a letter issued by the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) recommending that all kidney transplants be suspended at the hospital in question, was taken up in court this morning (04 May).",
    "Appearing on behalf of the respondents, Additional Solicitor General Vikum De Abrew emphasised that the relevant letter was issued by the DGHS based on a probe conducted by the nine-member committee appointed by him, adding that the approval issued for the hospital to conduct kidney transplants expired on 31 December 2022.",
    "Appearing for the petitioning party, however, President\u2019s Counsel Faizer Mustapha argued that as a result of the letter issued by the DGHS, the hospital is facing severe difficulties with their daily operations, highlighting that they are also currently unable to pay the salaries of hospital staff.",
    "He further noted, however, that his client has no objections to conduct the relevant transplant procedures under the supervision of the DGHS in the event they are granted approval to do so.",
    "Upon consideration of the facts presented by both parties, it was decided by the court that the petition would be heard on 11 May."
