Highlighting on the relationship between the two nations, Reddy said: \u201cTrade and investment have grown and there is cooperation in the fields of development, education, culture and in various other fields. Both countries share a broad understanding of major issues of international interest. As a friendship society, we are very happy and equally proud of India\u2019s assistance to Sri Lanka at a time of need and this truly resonates with the phrase \u201ca friend in need is a friend indeed.\u201d",
    "Kishore Reddy looked back on the assistance provided by the Government of India and thanked Gopal Baglay. He concluded his speech with a toast saying: \u201cWe wish Sri Lanka and India peace, happiness and prosperity, today and in the future, and to the enduring friendship and partnership between both countries.\u201d Established in 1949, the Sri Lanka India Society is one of the oldest and largest friendship societies in Sri Lanka and to date works in strengthening to build people to people bonds of the two great nations and continue their deep-rooted, centuries-old ties. The Indo-Lanka relationship has been multi-faceted, unwavering and time-tested. Since gaining independence just six months apart, over the years the neighbours have strengthened their relationship in the region whilst the benefits of its synergies have touched the lives of many. Last year under the leadership of Kishore Reddy the SLIS had two commemorative dinners with the participation of a number of dignitaries which included the current Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and President of Sri Lanka Ranil Wickremesinghe."
