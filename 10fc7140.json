  "original_body_lines": [
    "In an intervention petition, Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera has urged the Supreme Court to dismiss the Fundamental Rights petition filed by Pastor Jerome Fernando who sought order against his imminent arrest by police.",
    "The Intervenient-Petitioner Elle Gunawansa Thero is further seeking an order to refuse the grant of interim reliefs to Pastor Jerome.",
    "In his Fundamental Rights petition, Pastor Gerome Fernando stated that the sermon he delivered on April 30, 2023 does not constitute any offence as alleged by police in their B report filed in the Magistrate's Court.",
    "However, Gunawansa Thera stated that the statements made by Jerome Fernando are far more heinous than those reported to have been made by stand-up comedian Nathasha Edirisooriya, particularly as he made derogatory remarks against all four major religions.",
    "Ven. Gunawansa Thera further stated that, there is abundant evidence to demonstrate that Pastor Jerome has committed offences under section 291B of the Penal Code and section 3 of the ICCPR Act, and thereby, he ought to be arrested forthwith and investigated in terms of the law. Therefore, Gunawansa Thera maintained that reliefs sought for by Pastor Jerome should not be granted and urged to dismiss his petition at the beginning of the court proceedings (in limine).",
    "This intervention petition is to be supported by President\u2019s Counsel Sanjeeva Jayawardena. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)"
