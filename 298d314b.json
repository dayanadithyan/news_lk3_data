  "original_body_lines": [
    "A mother-of-three has been jailed for more than two years for inducing an abortion after the legal limit.",
    "Carla Foster, 44, received the medication following a remote consultation where she was not honest about how far along her pregnancy was.",
    "The \u201cpills by post\u201d scheme, introduced in lockdown, allows pregnancies up to 10 weeks to be terminated at home.",
    "However, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard the woman was between 32-34 weeks pregnant when she took them.",
    "Abortion is legal up to 24 weeks. However, after 10 weeks the procedure is carried out in a clinic.",
    "Prosecutors argued Foster had provided false information knowing she was over the time limit and had made online searches which they said indicated \u201ccareful planning\u201d.",
    "The court heard between February and May 2020 she had searched \u201chow to hide a pregnancy bump\u201d, \u201chow to have an abortion without going to the doctor\u201d and \u201chow to lose a baby at six months\u201d.",
    "Based on the information she provided the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), she was sent the tablets because it was estimated she was seven weeks pregnant.",
    "Her defence argued that lockdown and minimising face-to-face appointments had changed access to healthcare and so instead she had to search for information online.",
    "\u201cThe defendant may well have made use of services had they been available at the time,\u201d said her barrister Barry White. \u201cThis will haunt her forever.\u201d",
    "On 11 May 2020, having taken the abortion pills, an emergency call was made at 18:39 BST saying she was in labour.",
    "The baby was born not breathing during the phonecall and was confirmed dead about 45 minutes later.",
    "A post-mortem examination recorded the baby girl\u2019s cause of death as stillbirth and maternal use of abortion drugs and she was estimated to be between 32 and 34 weeks\u2019 gestation.",
    "Foster, from Staffordshire, already had three sons before she became pregnant again in 2019.",
    "The court heard she had moved back in with her estranged partner at the start of lockdown while carrying another man\u2019s baby.",
    "The judge accepted she was \u201cin emotional turmoil\u201d as she sought to hide the pregnancy.",
    "Foster was initially charged with child destruction, which she denied.",
    "She later pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion, which was accepted by the prosecution.",
    "Sentencing, judge Mr Justice Edward Pepperall said it was a \u201ctragic\u201d case, adding that if she had pleaded guilty earlier he may have been able to consider suspending her jail sentence.",
    "He said the defendant was \u201cwracked by guilt\u201d and had suffered depression and said she was a good mother to three children, one of whom has special needs, who would suffer from her imprisonment.",
    "She received a 28-month sentence, 14 of which will be spent in custody with the remainder on licence.",
    "Ahead of Monday\u2019s hearing, a letter co-signed by a number of women\u2019s health organisations was sent to the court calling for a non-custodial sentence.",
    "However, the judge said it was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d and that his duty was \u201cto apply the law as provided by Parliament\u201d.",
    "He told the defendant the letter\u2019s authors were \u201cconcerned that your imprisonment might deter other women from accessing telemedical abortion services and other late-gestation women from seeking medical care or from being open and honest with medical professionals\u201d.",
    "But he said it also \u201chas the capacity to be seen as special pleading by those who favour wider access to abortions and is, in my judgment, just as inappropriate as it would be for a judge to receive a letter from one of the groups campaigning for more restrictive laws\u201d.",
    "The sentencing has sparked outcry among women\u2019s rights organisations and campaigners.",
    "BPAS said it was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the woman\u2019s sentence which they said was based on an \u201carchaic law\u201d.",
    "\u201cNo woman can ever go through this again,\u201d said its chief executive, Clare Murphy.",
    "\u201cOver the last three years, there has been an increase in the numbers of women and girls facing the trauma of lengthy police investigations and threatened with up to life imprisonment under our archaic abortion law,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cVulnerable women in the most incredibly difficult of circumstances deserve more from our legal system.\u201d",
    "She said MPs must do more to offer protection so \u201cno more women in these desperate circumstances are threatened with prison again\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe average prison sentence for a violent offence in England is 18 months,\u201d she said in a tweet.",
    "\u201cA woman who had an abortion without following correct procedures just got 28 months under an 1868 act - we need urgent reform to make safe access for all women in England, Scotland and Wales a human right.\u201d",
    "The Crown Prosecution Service said: \u201cThese exceptionally rare cases are complex and traumatic.",
    "\u201cOur prosecutors have a duty to ensure that laws set by Parliament are properly considered and applied when making difficult charging decisions.\u201d",
    "When asked whether the prime minister was confident criminalising abortion in some circumstances was the right approach, Rishi Sunak\u2019s official spokesperson said the current laws struck a balance.",
    "\u201cOur laws as they stand balance a woman\u2019s right to access safe and legal abortions with the rights of an unborn child,\u201d he said."
