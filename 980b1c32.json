    "Although he only played in one World Cup, in 1958 in Sweden where France came third, he quite remarkably still remains joint fourth in all-time World Cup goals scored alongside Argentina\u2019s Lionel Messi, with 13 goals, except that it took Messi 26 matches. Ahead of them are Miroslav Klose of Germany with 16 in 24 matches, Brazil\u2019s Ronaldo with 15 in 19 matches, and Germany\u2019s Gerd Muller with 14 in 13 matches.",
    "He had originally been a reserve player but stepped into the limelight when two of his teammates were injured. He scored in every game of that World Cup, including four goals in the third-place match over West Germany. Between 1953 and 1960, Fontaine scored 30 goals in only 21 appearances for France. He retired at only 28 after suffering a double-leg fracture.",
    "All football grounds in France will have a minute\u2019s applause at Wednesday\u2019s matches in honor of Fontaine, who played for renowned clubs such as Stade de Reims, Paris St. Germaine, Nice, and Casablanca.",
    "Born in Morocco, he went on to be Team Manager for both France and Morocco, as well as clubs such as Paris St. Germaine, and Toulouse.",
    "Longtime France Team Manager Didier Deschamps said that Fontaine\u2019s death would \u201csadden everyone who loves football.\u201d",
