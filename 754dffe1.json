    "India has been trying to increase Indian rupee based cross-border transactions.",
    "\u201cThis partnership between Indian Bank and Seylan Bank will enable local customers to enter into transactions denominated in Indian rupee, eliminating the need to conduct Trade and Remittance transactions in USD or any other currency\u201d Seylan Bank said.",
