    "Sri Lankan fugitive gangster Maddumage Lasantha Chandana Perera alias \u201cAngoda Lokka\u201d, who was found dead in Coimbatore in 2020, had died of cardiac arrest, according to the final report submitted by India\u2019s Crime Branch-CID (CB-CID) before a court in Coimbatore last week.",
    "With this, the agency has closed the investigation into one of the two cases it registered following the death of \u201cAngoda Lokka\u201d under suspicious circumstances.",
    "One case is related to his death and the second case is against the gangster\u2019s aides for various charges, including harbouring and arranging forged documents for him during his illegal stay in India.",
    "The agency\u2019s probe found \u201cAngoda Lokka\u201d, who lived in a rented house at Balaji Nagar near Cheran Ma Nagar in India under the assumed identity of \u201cPradeep Singh\u201d for around two years, died after suffering a heart attack on the night of July 03, 2020.",
    "A Sri Lankan woman, Amani Thanji, was staying with \u201cAngoda Lokka\u201d when he suffered chest pain. Thanji, with the help of neighbours, rushed \u201cAngoda Lokka\u201d to a private hospital where doctors declared him dead. The body was later shifted to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital for post-mortem.",
    "Thanji, and two others, a Madurai-based advocate D. Sivakamasundari and her friend S. Dyaneswaran of Erode, took the body of \u201cAngoda Lokka\u201d to Madurai after the post-mortem and cremated it there on July 05 that year.",
    "The actual identity of the deceased came to light after the Coimbatore City Police found the \u2018aadhaar\u2019 card in the name of Pradeep Singh, a copy of which Sivakamasundari produced at the Peelamedu police station, had been obtained using forged documents. The police arrested Thanji, Sivakamasundari and Dyaneswaran on August 02 and the CB-CID later took over the investigation, by registering two cases.",
    "A CB-CID official said the investigation into a second case against eight persons including Thanji, Sivakamasundari and Dyaneswaran was continuing."
