    "eChannelling, the largest channelling arm in Sri Lanka has also joined this sacred endeavour, supporting essential medicine and providing all necessary health and digital lifestyle services throughout the program.",
    "The inaugural donation took place at the Teaching Hospital Ratnapura recently with the participation of SLT Group Chairman Rohan Fernando, SLT General Manager-Marketing Services Anuruddha Suriyarachchi, Ratnapura Director/Teaching Hospital Dr. Anoja Rodrigo, Deputy Director Dr. Sriyani Ranasinghe, several other SLT-Mobitel officers and several staff members of the Ratnapura hospital.

Commenting on the \u2018Sambandiyawe Dahami Sathkaraya\u2019 SLT Group Chairman Fernando said: \u201cOur Vesak program this year is part of a series of initiatives to tackle a pressing social issue faced by the community at large. With the increased concern in the country over shortages in essential medicines needed for surgery, hypertension and life-saving, and antibiotics, SLT-Mobitel has come forward as a socially responsible entity in Sri Lanka to support the nation. We understand that health is the most important aspect in any society and economy and in the spirit of giving, reiterating the true essence and values of the Buddhist philosophy, we aim to contribute towards the wellbeing of our citizens.\u201d",
    "Dr. Rodrigo said: \u201cMedicines are integral parts of the healthcare we provide to all citizens. Without the availability of necessary medicines, we cannot save lives, promote health or even prevent epidemics and diseases. We sincerely thank SLT-Mobitel for their magnanimous donation, uplifting communities, touching lives, especially as we celebrate the light of Vesak.\u201d",
    "The program is part of the company\u2019s ESG initiatives to support government hospitals in obtaining the essential medicines and overcome the prevailing drug shortage. Essential medicines are being distributed among eight provinces. Moreover, the drugs to be distributed are based on the information received from the Medical Supplies Division of the Ministry of Health."
