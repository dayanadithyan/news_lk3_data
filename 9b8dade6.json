    "India\u2019s major opposition parties on Sunday boycotted the inauguration of a new Parliament building by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a rare show of unity against his Hindu nationalist ruling party, which has ruled for nine years and is seeking a third term in next year\u2019s elections.",
    "Modi inaugurated the new Parliament in the capital of New Delhi by offering prayers as Hindu priests chanted religious hymns. Opposition parties criticized the event saying Modi had sidelined President Droupadi Murmu, who has only ceremonial powers but is the head of state and highest constitutional authority.",
    "Shortly after the inauguration, a visibly beaming Modi entered Parliament amid a rousing applause by his party lawmakers who chanted \u201cModi, Modi.\u201d He delivered an almost 40-minute speech in which he hailed India\u2019s parliamentary democracy and said the country had left behind its colonial past, referring to the old Parliament building that was built by the British when they ruled India.",
    "\u201cIndia is the mother of democracy,\u201d Modi said, as lawmakers thumped their desks. \u201cSeveral years of foreign rule stole our pride from us. Today, India has left behind that colonial mindset.\u201d",
    "The opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted: \u201cParliament is the voice of the people. The Prime Minister is considering the inauguration of the Parliament House as a coronation.\u201d",
    "At least 19 opposition parties skipped the event, which coincided with the birth anniversary of a Hindu nationalist ideologue.",
    "Opposition parties said in a statement Wednesday that Modi\u2019s decision to inaugurate the building was \u201ca grave insult\u201d to India\u2019s democracy, because the government had \u201cdisqualified, suspended and muted\u201d opposition lawmakers while passing \u201ccontroversial legislation\u201d with little debate.",
    "\u201cWhen the soul of democracy has been sucked out from the parliament, we find no value in a new building,\u201d the parties said.",
    "India\u2019s powerful Home Minister Amit Shah said the opposition had politicized the event. Other leaders from Modi\u2019s party said the boycott was an insult to the prime minister.",
    "The new triangular-shaped building \u2014 built at an estimated cost of $120 million \u2014 is part of a $2.8 billion revamp of British-era offices and residences in central New Delhi that will also include blocks of buildings to house government ministries and departments, and Modi\u2019s new private residence. The entire project, called the \u201cCentral Vista,\u201d is spread over 3.2 kilometers (1.9 miles).",
    "The project was announced in 2019, and Modi laid the foundation in December 2020.",
    "The plan has drawn intense criticism from opposition politicians, architects and heritage experts, many of whom called it environmentally irresponsible, a threat to cultural heritage and too expensive.",
    "Outrage grew in 2021, when at least 12 opposition parties questioned the project\u2019s timing, saying it was built as the country faced a devastating surge in coronavirus cases. They branded the revamp as Modi\u2019s \u201cvanity project\u201d and said its construction was prioritized over the loss of lives and livelihoods during the pandemic.",
    "A year earlier, a group of 60 former civil servants wrote an open letter to Modi to highlight the architectural value of the old Parliament and said the new plan would \u201cirrevocably\u201d destroy the area\u2019s cultural heritage.",
    "Modi\u2019s government has said the overhaul was necessary because the older building was \u201cshowing signs of distress and overutilization\u201d and that the new design \u201ccombines the country\u2019s heritage and traditions.\u201d",
    "The new building sits just across from India\u2019s old Parliament, a circular structure designed by British architects in the early 20th century. The new four-story building has a total of 1,272 seats in two chambers, almost 500 more than the previous one.",
    "During the televised ceremony Sunday, Modi prostrated himself before a royal golden scepter that his Bharatiya Janata Party says symbolized the transfer of power when it was gifted to the country\u2019s first prime minister on the eve of India\u2019s independence from Britain in 1947. Dozens of Hindu priests followed Modi inside Parliament, where he installed the scepter near the chair of the speaker.",
    "Modi\u2019s critics and opposition leaders have questioned the scepter\u2019s historicity and said the emblem is appropriate for a monarchy, not a democracy.",
    "Last year, Modi inaugurated a refurbished colonial-era avenue in the heart of New Delhi that is used for ceremonial military parades. The boulevard was earlier called Rajpath, or Kingsway, but Modi\u2019s party changed it to Kartavya Path, or Road to Duty, arguing the old name was a \u201csymbol of slavery\u201d that had been \u201cerased forever.\u201d",
    "The controversy over the new legislative building comes just months after opposition leaders protested Gandhi\u2019s disqualification from Parliament in a defamation case over remarks he made about Modi\u2019s surname.",
    "Barely a mile away from the ceremony, a heavy police presence overpowered about 100 protesting Indian wrestlers and their supporters. They accuse their federation president of sexual misconduct and had planned to march to the new Parliament building. Some of the protesters scuffled with police and were taken away in a bus.",
    "Wrestling Federation of India President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has denied the accusations, is a powerful lawmaker from Modi\u2019s party."
