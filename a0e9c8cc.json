    "The Bank succeeded in raising Rs 10 Bn in Tier 2 capital via a debenture issue in February 2023.

The newly obtained capital will enable the Bank to rise above and prevail as one of the Country\u2019s pre-eminent Bank.",
    "Sampath Bank registered a profit before tax (PBT) of Rs 4.5 Bn and a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 2.6 Bn for the three months ended 31st March 2023, indicating a decline of 30.5% and 44.3% respectively from the figures reported in 1Q 2022. This decline was mainly attributed to the exchange losses recorded during the quarter as a result of the appreciation of LKR by Rs 39 against the USD on its foreign currency reserves. All other income lines recorded performance well above the previous period.",

    "Sampath Bank reported a total interest income of Rs 50.2 Bn in 1Q 2023, up by 102% from the Rs 24.9 Bn recorded in the corresponding period of the previous year. The AWPLR moved up significantly from 9.85% at the end of the first quarter of 2022 to 21.4% at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Because of the higher interest rates that existed throughout the reporting period compared to the preceding period, the Bank was able to register a substantial increase in interest income.",
    "Interest expenses too grew in line with the previously indicated interest rate hikes resulting in the Bank recording a total interest expense of Rs 32.1 Bn in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 183% over the figure reported in the first quarter of 2022.

    "The Bank\u2019s Net fee and commission income (NFCI) increased by 19% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. NFCI includes income from a variety of sources, including loans and advances, credit cards, trade and electronic channels.

    "Sampath Bank posted a net other operating loss of Rs 4.4 Bn in the first three months of 2023, compared to a gain of Rs 8.7 Bn reported in corresponding period of 2022, denoting a decline of 151%. This was due to the reversal of exchange gain amounting to Rs 4.5 Bn, resulting from the 10.7% appreciation of the LKR against the USD. However, the Bank recorded a net trading gain of Rs 1.7 Bn for the period under review, compared to a loss of Rs 0.4 Bn in the corresponding period of the previous financial year, mainly due to forward exchange contract revaluation gains. On this basis, the Bank\u2019s net exchange loss from foreign exchange operations for the period under review was Rs 2.8 Bn (1Q 2022: A gain of Rs 8 Bn)",
