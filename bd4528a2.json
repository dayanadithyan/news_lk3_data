    "Buddhist philosophy is significant in its uniqueness with the description of the nature of life and existence, realisation of which is said to be a way out of human suffering",
    "Kalama Sutta is a powerful discourse attributed to the Buddha in Anguttara Nikaya which he delivered to the people of Kesaputta, also known as the Kalamas. In this Sutta, the Buddha encourages the spiritual seekers to use their own judgement based on practical criteria such as consequence of lust, hatred and ignorance on the one hand and acts of wholesomeness, blamelessness and acceptance by the wise on the other.",
    "He advised them not to rely solely on tradition, hearsay, or authority figures, but to investigate and experience things for themselves. The Kalama Sutta is considered a foundational text in Buddhism, as it highlights the importance of critical thinking and ethical conduct in spiritual practice.",
    "Within the Kalama sutta, the Buddha named 10 specific sources whose knowledge should not be immediately viewed as truthful without further investigation to avoid fallacies. This is quite challenging for seekers who prefer to investigate what they are expected to follow.",
    "The sutta says not to accept what is heard through oral transmission (anussava), lineage (parampar), testament (itikir), scriptures (pi\u1e6daka-sampad\u0101na), logic (takka-hetu) and inference (naya-hetu).",
    "The Sutta goes on to explain that even reasoned contemplation (k\u0101ra-parivitakka), acceptance of a view after consideration one\u2019s own opinion (di\u1e6d\u1e6dhi-nijjh\u0101n-akkh-antiy\u0101), appearance of expertise (bhabba-r\u016bpat\u0101ya) as well as what is preached by monk or teacher (sama\u1e47o no gar\u016b).",
    "This boils down to the position where the practitioners of Buddhist philosophy are often confronted with these principles of Kalama Sutta, especially in the areas where Buddhist philosophy differs from other philosophical traditions. To mention some of them,",
    "No-Self (Anatta) Doctrine: One of the most distinctive aspects of Buddhist philosophy is the doctrine of anatta, which means \u201cno-self.\u201d This requires much probing through extensive discussions.",
    "The Four Noble Truths: The Buddha\u2019s teachings are often summarised in the Four Noble Truths, which describe the nature of suffering, its causes, the possibility of its cessation, and the path that leads to its cessation.",
    "The Middle Way: The Buddhist philosophy emphasises the importance of finding a middle way between extremes. This approach emphasises balance, moderation, and avoiding extremes in all aspects of life including thoughts, emotions, and actions.",
    "Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da, commonly translated as dependent origination which states that all dharmas arise in dependence upon other dharmas: \u201cif this exists, that exists; if this ceases to exist, that also ceases to exist\u201d. This is also called Sunyata in Mahayana tradition.",
    "Satipatthana \u2013 The foundations of mindfulness on Kaya (body), Vedana (sensations or feelings), Citta (mind or consciousness) and Dhamma (mental contents) leads to the realisation of nirvana through cultivation of sense of awareness, clarity, and equanimity in the face of life\u2019s challenges.",
    "Brahma Vivarana: Emphasis on practice of Metta (Loving Kindness), Karuna (Compassion), Muditha (Altruistic Joy) and Upekka ( Equanimity).",
    "Buddhist philosophy is significant in its uniqueness with the description of the nature of life and existence, realisation of which is said to be a way out of human suffering, hence the respect and devotion towards.",
    "It would be prudent therefore if the Vesak celebrations also take these fundamental teachings on board through discussions and discourses while the traditions in festive atmosphere will continue to preserve cultural aspects of the philosophy.",
