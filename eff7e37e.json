    "COLOMBO (News 1st) \u2013 In Dublin, Ireland won their fourth Grand Slam by defeating England in a tense Six Nations finale. Although England initially took the lead with two early penalties from Owen Farrell, Ireland responded with a well-executed try by Dan Sheehan. England's hopes for an upset were diminished when Freddie Steward received a red card just before halftime.",
    "In the second half, Ireland scored two tries through Robbie Henshaw and Rob Herring, while Sheehan also scored his second of the game. England scored a try through Jamie George but were unable to pull off a major upset. Despite facing a resilient English side, Ireland, under the leadership of Andy Farrell, found a way to win and gave their talismanic captain Johnny Sexton the perfect send-off in his final Six Nations match, although he was forced to leave the field early due to injury.",
    "After the full-time whistle, the Aviva Stadium was filled with jubilant Irish celebrations as the home side fulfilled their immense promise, having entered the competition as the world's number one team. This was Ireland's first Grand Slam in five years, and it was their first time winning it in Dublin.",
