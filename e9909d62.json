    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s consumer prices jumped 2.5 percent in March 2023, though 12-month inflation eased slightly to 50.3 percent from 50.6 percent a month earlier data from the state statistics office showed.",
    "A re-based Colombo Consumer Price Index went up from 189.5 pints to 195.0 points partly driven by a large power tariff hike.",
    "A rise in the price of one item tends to reduce demand for other goods over time, unless it is monetarily accommodated by printing money to mis-target rates, which is why individual changes in prices cannot push up overall prices.",
    "The electricity price hike was a lagged effect of an earlier depreciation of the rupee, in the wake of money printed to mis-target policy rates earlier.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank abandoned a low credibility by consistent policy external anchor in March 2023 and started to follow an ad hoc peg prescribed by the International Monetary Fund called a flexible exchange from mid March.",
    "Though the exchange rate initially appreciated the credibility of the ad hoc peg through which 1.4 billion US dollars is expected to be collected and loaned to US and other high rates borrowers, is extremely weak and uncertainty and panicky behaviour has dogged the spot market.",
    "The central bank also blocked access to its overnight deposit window in a bid to drive liquidity kept in the central bank into credit.",
    "So far this year the inflation index had climbed 2.94 percent. The annual inflation expected under the central bank\u2019s self declared target is 4-6 percent. (Colombo/Mar30/2023)"
