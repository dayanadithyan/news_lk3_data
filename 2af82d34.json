    "Self-proclaimed Prophet, Jerome Fernando yesterday filed a Fundamental Rights petition through his lawyers seeking an order from the Supreme Court to prevent his possible arrest by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) on his return to Sri Lanka.",
    "Despite providing reassurances to his followers about his imminent return to the country, Fernando, who left on 15 May to Singapore has failed to make an appearance following the initiation of an investigation by the CID.",
    "It is reported the CID is not only looking into the controversial statements made by the preacher about other religions but also his finances and how he secured the funds necessary to construct and maintain his conference hall-style house of worship titled the \u2018Miracle Dome\u2019 in Katunayake.",
    "Due to a recent investigation conducted by Al-Jazeera, Fernando\u2019s financial affairs came under scrutiny, particularly in relation to his association with Zimbabwean Uebert Angel, whom he refers to as his \u201cspiritual father\u201d. In this investigation, Uebert Angel self-incriminated himself regarding allegations of international gold smuggling and money laundering activities.",
    "Authorities have confirmed that the Miracle Dome and Fernando\u2019s Church is not registered with the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs as a place of worship. The CID has to date received five complaints against the pastor for the comments made by him."
