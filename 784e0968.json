    "The Minister in a letter to the IGP said a group of employees at the CPC and the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) had forcibly entered the fuel distribution area around noon on March 28 and obstructed the duties of its employees and also obstructed the fuel bowsers that had come to load fuel and thus crippled fuel distribution which has been declared as an essential service.",
    "The minister said disciplinary action has been taken against some employees identified as having been involved in the incidents and that according to the statements made by them even after these actions, there was a risk of the fuel distribution process being disrupted in the future as well.",
    "Minister Wijesekara requested the IGP to conduct an investigation through the CID and take necessary action against them and also provide security to the fuel distribution zones to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
