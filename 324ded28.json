    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been considering an incentive package for foreign direct investors as the island nation has not been able to attract FDI like other regional peers, Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s investment attraction had fallen sharply amid an unprecedented economic crisis after the government declared sovereign debt default last year.",
    "The island nation has been unable to attract investments into the ambitious Chinese Port City, built by State-Run China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) next to the main port in capital Colombo.",
    "Gunawardena said that despite abundant natural resources in Sri Lanka, the country has not attempted to create a favourable economic environment to attract foreign direct investments.",
    "\u201cThere was a discussion on this at the cabinet meeting. The president said steps are in the process to introduce a concession package including state and financial reliefs to attract (foreign) large investments,\u201d Gunawardena told the weekly cabinet media briefing.",
    "He also said investors who want to invest in the country are not getting the relief from the state and financially like in other countries while lack of changes in the legal framework as well as cultural and political barriers also have discouraged those investors. (Colombo/May 3/2023)."
