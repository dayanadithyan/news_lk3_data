    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka expects discussions on GDP linked bonds and the possibility of future economic growth being higher than projected in a debt sustainability analysis done by the International Monetary Fund, bond holders were told in a presentation.",
    "The possibility of GDP being higher than projected by the IMF will be discussed at upcoming talks with private creditors, a representative of Sri Lanka\u2019s financial advisors told an online meeting with commercial creditors.",
    "The person was responding to a question on \u201cWhat is the likelihood of external debt re-structuring being linked to external debt re-structure?\u201d",
    "As part of the negotiations, it will be discussed \u201cwhat if the country performs better than expected\u201d, the advisor said.",
    "\u201cThere will be a number of discussions from creditors for sure,\u201d the advisor said.",
    "The IMF had projected growth of 3.1 percent for the next few years, which Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe characterized as \u201cconservative\u201d.",
    "Sri Lanka believes that the country can \u201coverperform\u201d on economic growth, but it was too early to say whether it would be 4 to 5 percent or higher, he said, responding to creditor online queries.",
    "Some private creditors are said to be discussing the possibility of offering to take so-called \u2018downside\u2019 bonds where a bond exchange is made on a more optimistic forecast and cash flows will fall if growth falters to 3.1 percent.",
    "There have been \u2018upside\u2019 instruments used in the past, to which sovereigns have agreed. The instruments used so far had not been bonds, but a type of warrant.",
    "Sri Lanka registered higher levels of growth than 3 percent during a 30-year war.",
    "However, in peacetime growth faltered as inflationary open market operations unleashed to suppress rates and generate 5 percent inflation and also output gap targeting (monetary stimulus), under flexible inflation targeting, triggering a series of currency crises and eventual external default in 2022.",
    "Forex shortages or balance of payments deficits, a problem associated with pegged central banks, emerge when external and domestic monetary anchors conflict (typically attempts to operate both money and exchange policy).",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s intermediate regime central bank has denied monetary stability and a stable foundation for people to grow the economy \u00a0for 73 years by suppressing interest rates through inflationary open market operations or targeting the yield curve by purchasing bonds in and out of auctions.",
    "Instead of restoring monetary stability, the money producing monopoly went beyond legal tender laws to enact exchange controls. The central bank has in the past egged the Treasury to impose import controls, through a law enacted in 1969 after triggering forex shortages.",
    "Sri Lanka dropped a consistent policy peg in March 2023 and moved to an ad hoc peg or a flexible exchange rate.",
    "According to the IMF\u2019s core monetary program (Performance Criteria) forex reserves of 1.4 billion US dollars should be collected in 2023 while running the ad hoc peg, with no obvious mechanism to deal with the liquidity created from any central bank dollar purchases.",
    "There is also a double digit inflation target, leaving room for renewed currency instability, regressive inflation taxes on the poor through depreciation, social unrest and low growth. In a further complication, IMF money could also be used for budgetary purposes.",
    "The liquidity impact of such operations or any counter actions are not known. (Colombo/Apr03/2023)"
