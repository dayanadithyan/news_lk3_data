REC Campus takes the responsibility of its students until up to the completion of their degree programmes. The most important factor is that they guide the students after the completion of their MBBS degree to move on to post-graduate studies in their preferred area, or begin their career as doctors,\u201d Dr.Mohamad Chahine said.",
