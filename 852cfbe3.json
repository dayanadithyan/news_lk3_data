    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe speaks at Nikkei\u2019s Future of Asia conference in Tokyo on 25 May",
    "President says Asian countries resisting pressure to take sides between US, China",
    "Nikkei: Sri Lanka\u2019s President Ranil Wickremesinghe said he intends to apply for membership in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade bloc, as his South Asian country strives to rebuild its crisis-hit economy.",
    "Wickremesinghe told Nikkei\u2019s Future of Asia forum on Thursday that Sri Lanka would look to join RCEP \u201cwith the aim of achieving a higher level of economic liberalisation.\u201d Sri Lanka had recently mooted the prospect of joining.",
    "RCEP, known as the world\u2019s largest free trade pact, encompasses 15 Asia-Pacific countries covering about 30% of the world\u2019s gross domestic product and population. It includes China and Japan but not the U.S.",
    "The Sri Lankan leader, who took office last year after his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa was ousted in a wave of protests, painted a picture of smaller countries caught between two superpowers.",
    "\u201cThe pressure on Asian countries to choose between the U.S. and China is being resisted by many,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cMany of us cannot make that choice because we have already made our choice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want an Asia that can accommodate\u201d not only the West and allies who call for a free and open Indo-Pacific but also China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative and proponents of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.",
    "Sri Lanka, he stressed, \u201cis committed to multi-layered connectivity in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe added that he supports Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\u2019s vision of peace and rules-based prosperity, and that it was based on this that he decided to apply for RCEP membership.",
    "As for Sri Lanka\u2019s financial crisis, which triggered a debt default last year, Wickremesinghe said his nation was \u201cone of the first and worst\u201d affected by the shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. He was chosen by parliament to replace Rajapaksa amid widespread public frustration over soaring inflation and shortages of daily necessities.",
    "Wickremesinghe said going to the International Monetary Fund for assistance was \u201cthe only option available\u201d to Colombo. His government secured a nearly $ 3 billion bailout earlier this year, but continues to negotiate debt restructuring with key creditors including China and Japan.",
    "Earlier on Thursday he met with Kishida in Tokyo, saying the restructuring had made \u201cremarkable headway\u201d and could wrap up later this year.",
    "\u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d he told the Nikkei forum. \u201cWe want this exercise [of debt restructuring] to succeed because our experience will enable more middle-income countries [like Sri Lanka] to utilise the IMF in ensuring multilateral coordination for debt relief.\u201d",
    "Recalling the state of the country at the height of the crisis under the Rajapaksa government, he said, \u201cEven if you had money, there was no food.\u201d",
    "He likened the recovery effort to a lifeboat. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Titanic, when the ship is sinking and the boat is there. ... So I asked everyone to come in. And everyone to help.\u201d"
