    "Nominee to the post SJB MP Harsha de Silva slams Speaker for continuous delays",
    "Says it is fourth time his confirmation as chair of CoPF has been postponed",
    "Accuses Govt. of passing bills in violation of standing orders",
    "The Committee of Selection to appoint the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Public Finance (CoPF) has yet again postponed the process. Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Dr. Harsha de Silva who has been proposed to take up the post, yesterday took to Twitter to slam Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena for the continued delays.",
    "\u201cShame on you, Speaker of the Sri Lanka Parliament. 4th time Committee of Selection to appoint Chair of Committee on Public Finance postponed!\u201d he said. The appointment was delayed on three previous occasions. The selection committee failed to make an appointment on the previous occasion due to the absence of Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena at the selection meeting. The Committee on Public Finance has been without a chairman since 30 January.",
    "De Silva slammed the Government for passing bills in violation of standing orders. He questioned the Government\u2019s checks and balances process and asked if this was what it promised the IMF. De Silva has accused the Government led by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) of finding excuse after excuse to not confirm him as Chairman of the CoPF and of approving IMF-related finance bills in violation of the standing order which states the COPF must be chaired by a member of the opposition. Last month he expressed shock that the IMF which insists on Good Governance continues to turn a blind eye to this type of authoritarian behaviour.",
    "De Silva was first appointed to the post in August 2022 but was not among the members reappointed to the committee in the fourth session of the ninth Parliament. Instead, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Mayantha Dissanayake was appointed as the new Chairperson of the CoPF in February this year. However, days later Dissanayake resigned from the post after other SJB members cried foul over his appointment. De Silva was nominated to replace Dissanayake but his appointment has not been confirmed yet."
