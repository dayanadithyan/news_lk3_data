    "DFCC Savings Goal empowers customers to set comprehensive, personalised goals aligned with their unique financial aspirations. Customers can specify their desired goal amount, ranging from Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 10,000,000/- and select a start date within one month from the day of opening the goal account. They then have the freedom to choose the frequency of savings contributions, whether daily, weekly, or monthly, and set an end date for their savings goal, ranging from 30 days to 2 years from the starting date. For added flexibility, extending the end date to accommodate your evolving needs is possible.",
    "\u201cAt DFCC Bank, we understand that achieving dreams is more than just saving money. It\u2019s about creating meaning and structure too, which can help to make these dreams a reality, along with a high-interest rate for added growth,\u201d said Aasiri Iddamalgoda, Senior Vice President of Retail Banking and SME at DFCC Bank, \u201cThat\u2019s why, we have designed DFCC Savings Goal as a unique and novel product that empowers our valued customers and provides them with the flexibility, control and support they need to reach their goals. This is underscored by the fact that there are no penalties involved with this product if you decide to change your goals along the way. We invite all Sri Lankans to start a DFCC Savings Goal, which can be conveniently done with our Online Banking platform for existing customers, and embark on a transformative savings journey.\u201d",
    "Offering unparalleled flexibility, DFCC Savings Goal customers can add additional funds to their goals at any time. Withdrawals are also allowed at any time with no additional charges or fees. Plus, to help customers stay on track to meet their goals, future deposits to your DFCC Savings Goal will be automatically adjusted to compensate if funds are withdrawn, providing a seamless savings experience. If you miss one of your planned commitments, there will be no penalties, while DFCC Bank\u2019s systems will automatically try again, if you have funds available, to help you stay on course. DFCC Savings Goals can also be conveniently closed at any time without penalties whilst still receiving the total interest value accrued up to that period, just like a regular savings account.\u2013 DFCC Bank",
