    "US-based international travel influencer Juliana Broste, a 12x Heartland Emmy Award-winning travel filmmaker and host, showcasing adventures and fun things to do around the world, recommended Sri Lanka to be listed as one of the best places to visit in 2023 and as a result of her continuous effort, Sri Lanka has been listed on the Forbes list as one of the 23 best places to visit in 2023.",
    "This was a result of her visit to Sri Lanka in 2022, under the Visiting Blogger Programme of SLTPB 2022. Juliana, who explored the destination on a photo tour, says that even with inflation, visitors will find Sri Lanka a spectacular, affordable destination worth the long haul.",
    "\u201cLoop around the island and you\u2019ll see why this land will keep you guessing\u2014from the hustle and bustle of capital city Colombo to beautiful beaches, rice fields, waterfalls, plains and mountains. There\u2019s a lot to see in a relatively short distance, so have your camera at the ready. Spotting the wildlife in Sri Lanka is really special,\u201d says Juliana.\u201cYou can go on safari to an elephant sanctuary, go whale watching on the Indian ocean and spy on birds, lizards, jellyfish and monkeys in a mangrove.\u201d",
    "Juliana has selected spotting leopards at the Yala National Park on her bucket list for next time.",
    "\u201cBe sure to pack an all-white outfit that covers your shoulders and legs when visiting religious sites,\u201d says Juliana.",
    "\u201cCatching a traditional Kandyan dance performance is a highlight, seeing men and women in traditional dress telling stories through dance.\u201dJuliana also mentions Nuwara Eliya, known as \u2018little England\u2019, as another must see location to visit. \u201cWinding roads reveal rows and rows of tea bushes on the hillside\u2014be sure to stop in for a cup of tea on your visit to a tea factory and plantation,\u201d says Juliana.",
    "\u201cEqually as fun: sampling a king coconut on the side of the road along your adventure.\u201d",
    "Finally, Juliana has pointed out another two iconic monuments, which are renowned for their breathtaking view and architecture. These include the Lotus Tower, Colombo and Sigiriya. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol of the city and just a touch taller than the Eiffel Tower,\u201d says Juliana.",
    "\u201cAnother famous viewpoint worth the hike is the ancient city of Sigiriya, known as Lion\u2019s Rock, with the ruins of an ancient stronghold located atop a dramatic rock outcrop. It\u2019s wild to think how an entire civilisation lived here centuries ago.\u201dIn February, Forbes magazine recognised Sri Lanka as a \u2018Top Wildlife Safaris Outside of Africa\u2019. In addition, the country was ranked ninth on a list of the 50 most Instagrammable places in the world in 2023, based on the Big 7 Travel social media data, whilst the destination was also ranked among the top 24 countries to travel in 2023 by TravelTriangle, a leading online holiday marketplace."
