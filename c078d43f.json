    "Referring to the recent video clips circulating on social media alleging ill-treatment of Sri Lankan housemaids at the Embassy\u2019s safe-house, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Oman said it will not re-admit any housemaids who illegally leave the safe-house on their own responsibility and legal action will be taken against any housemaid who verbally or physically abuse the staff or engage in protests and cause damage to government property.",
    "In a media statement, the Embassy said, \"Sri Lankan housemaids who run away to the Embassy seeking assistance for repatriation are temporarily accommodated at the safe-house where they get secure accommodation, food and medicine.\"",
    "\"There were seventy inmates at the safe-house, out of which about ten had illegally left and started a violent protest in front of the Embassy on 08 May 2023 and tried to physically harm a s\u00e8nior female staff officer of the embassy.",
    "This has caused undue stress and safety concerns to the staff of the embassy, which was compelled to reluctantly seek immediate intervention of the Omani Police to ensure safety of the embassy premises, staff and other peaceful inmates of the safe-house.",
    "Now, about twenty more housemaids have joined the protests, without acceding to the advice of the police,\" the statement stated.",
    "The statement also highlighted that these protests appear to be orchestrated by elements that are engaging in illegal recruitments, with the belief that they can return to Sri Lanka quickly if they get arrested."
