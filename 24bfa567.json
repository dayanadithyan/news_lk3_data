    "Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry recorded an income of US$ 131.5 million for May from 83,309 arrivals, the lowest monthly income thus far in 2023 since the battered industry started making a notable improvement from the final quarter of last year. It is a decline from US$ 166.5 million in April and the year-to-date highest of US$ 198.1 million in March.",
    "May\u2019s slight decline isn\u2019t a cause for much concern as typically May is considered off season.",
    "For May 2022, Sri Lanka recorded only US$ 43.5 million as income from tourism as the industry hit a nadir again due to social unrest and political instability with arrivals falling to 30,207.",
    "The collapse of the rupee by 80 percent last year also made Sri Lanka a cheaper travel destination for tourists.",
    "Sri Lanka has recorded over half a million tourist arrivals by the end of May and tourism authorities expect to welcome two million tourists by the end of this year."
