    "\u201cWe hear about a move to form a national government. It would not happen if those who are responsible for the country's economic crisis do not come out with confessions and changed themselves. Also, action should be taken against corruption, including alleged fraudulent deals with regard to claiming damages for the X-Press Pearl ship which went down within Sri Lankan waters,\u201d MP Kabir Hashim told a media briefing.",
