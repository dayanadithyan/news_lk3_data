    "The military groups that came carrying weapons and sticks (Kurundu Polu) to control protesters could be para-military maintained by the Avant-Garde, National People's Power (NPP) MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.",
    "He told parliament that a military spokesman had said that the military groups that came to control the protests could not be confirmed as the official government military.",
    "The MP said the military personnel had carried weapons and wooden sticks and added that the official military should carry standard batons with the correct length, shape and colour.",
    "\"These are thugs who came carrying clubs. It is a disgrace to the military in the country. Avant-Garde maintained para-military groups of this nature. We have doubts whether these military groups are para-military of the Avant-Garde,\" he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
