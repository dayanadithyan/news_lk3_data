    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013\u00a0U.S. Former President Donald Trump has been indicted on seven federal criminal charges on Thursday of removing classified documents from the White House, and summoned to a federal courthouse in Miami next Tuesday, U.S. media reported.",
    "Trump becomes the first U.S. president to be indicted on federal criminal charges. He denied any wrongdoing, in a post on social media late Thursday.",
    "Earlier this year he became the first U.S. president to be indicted by a state when the State of New York indicted him on 34 charges of filing false business accounts for apparently using election campaign funds to pay USD 130,000 in hush money to an adult movie star that he had been in a relationship with prior to becoming president.",
    "Last month Trump, who is running for the 2024 election campaign seeking to once again become President, lost a civil case in which he had been accused of sexually abusing a well-known newspaper columnist.",
    "The federal criminal charges stem from an investigation by a Special Counsel who is looking into allegations of classified documents having been moved from the White House to Trump's home in Mar-A-Lago, Florida, and not returned prior to his leaving office. The FBI last August raided Trump's home and seized 33 boxes containing 11,000 documents, some of which were classified.",
    "Trump is also the subject of federal and state investigations that he sought to illegally overturn the results in the state of Georgia of the 2020 presidential election that he lost."
