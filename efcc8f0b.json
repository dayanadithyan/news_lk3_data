  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka and other countries have benefited from value added tax and there is no evidence to support a claim made by some that VAT is regressive, a top economist who has studied the matter in several countries said.",
    "A claim usually made by those who favour direct taxes, where the rulers take away part of the wealth created by people before a gainful economic transaction is decided and made by the citizens themselves, is that value added tax is regressive.",
    "However, Shantayanan Devaranjan, now a professor at Georgetown University, who was a senior World Bank economist for many years and has wide experience in developing countries, says there is no evidence to support that VAT is regressive.",
    "The belief that VAT is regressive may come from the fact that based on the rate, each citizen is treated equally before the law in principle.",
    "\u201cBut the fact of the matter is that if you look at the way most vats are administered, first of all they tend to have exemption on some basic items that the poor consume, such as food,\u201d explains Devaranjan.",
    "\u201cSo the poor are paying less VAT because of the nature of the goods that they consume, than the rich.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve done studies, in Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia, and several other people have done studies all over the world, where we look at the effect of the VAT.",
    "\u201cWe look at the net effect of the tax, we take into account the fact that certain goods are exempt, and what people are paying on net terms and what we find is that VAT is moderately progressive or neutral.\u201d",
    "In many countries, with well-functioning VAT systems health and education is exempt from VAT. In others housing (rent) is also exempt.",
    "VAT is also superior to income tax in another way in that it generates more revenue than income tax.",
    "\u201cThis is true around the world,\u201d Devaranjan says. \u201cIn most countries income ranges about 1 or 2 percent of GDP including in Sri Lanka.",
    "Whereas VAT can raise 6, 7, 8 percent of revenue. Simply as a tool for revenue, the VAT is therefore an efficient tool.\u201d",
    "VAT was developed and gained popularity due to the practical results seen compared to income tax.",
    "\u201cAnd the reason you do not raise much money is that personal income tax is easier to evade,\u201d he says.",
    "VAT is collected down a value chain from different market participants and everyone has to conspire and cheat to avoid VAT.",
    "In Sri Lanka for example only some salaried employees were protesting the rise in personal income tax rates, and there have been comments that others have ways of avoiding the tax.",
    "Observers say VAT has the additional advantage of capturing any avoided money or other unaccounted money as soon as the recipient spends the money.",
    "\u201d East Asia is heavily into VAT,\u201d Devaranjan says. \u201cThey rely much more on VAT than income tax. Europe is mostly VAT.  The US is the one exception. The US has a very elaborate income tax structure that catches a large number of tax evaders. Sri Lanka cannot afford that kind of machinery.\u201d",
    "Initial attempts to bring income tax in the US was struck down by the Us Supreme Court as the tax denied equal protection under the law. US politicians then changed the constitution.",
    "Over the years most US states have also brought in sales taxes at lower rates but not VAT.",
    "Devaranjan says while Sri Lanka appears to be struggling with income tax, other developing countries have managed to operate better income tax systems.",
    "The most damaging tax is not VAT, he says but inflation. Sri Lanka cut value added taxes in 2019 for \u2018stimulus\u2019 and printed money to stop interest rates from going up to finance the gap with borrowings from the ordinary public, triggering forex shortages and inflation.",
    "\u201cWhen you cut taxes you get inflation (if the central bank accommodates the tax cut) which in a sense is a much harsher tax on the poor. It is a bigger tax on the poor,\u201d Devaranjan says.",
    "During the Coronavirus crisis, many East Asian nations which have better central banks also relaxed VAT either cutting the rate like in Vietnam, delaying payment dates and stopped charging penalties for late payments.",
    "Many countries including developed states followed similar policies, including reducing rates during the pandemic, especially for the hospitality sector.",
    "In the absence of monetary accommodation, tax cuts simply raise the debt to GDP ratio.",
    "In Sri Lanka the rupee collapsed from 182 to 360 to the US dollar from 2020-2022 after the central bank mis-targeted rates and attempted to float with a surrender rule, driving up inflation to the highest level seen in the history of the agency which was set up in 1950.",
    "East Asian nations with the best central banks and tighter monetary standards (low inflation targets, hardened pegs or dollarized like Cambodia), generally also have lower tax rates (VAT at 7 to 10 percent and income tax at 17 to 20 percent) and low debt to GDP rates around 40 percent.",
    "Singapore hiked VAT (GST) from 7 to 8 percent from January 2023 and corporate income tax is at 17 percent.",
    "Thailand\u2019s VAT is at 7 percent and will be raised to 10 percent in 2023 and the highest corporate income tax is 20 percent."
