    "Professor C.A. Saliya\u2019s \u2018Doing social research: A guide to non-native English speakers,\u2019 published by Springer, provides beginner non-native English speakers with a comprehensive guide for conducting social research.",
    "Originally published in Sinhala as \u2018Samaja Gavesahkaya,\u2019 the book was adapted into English to cater to communities where English is a second language, such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and some African and Caribbean nations that were once British colonies.",
    "The book\u2019s strength lies in its ability to address the specific challenges faced by non-native English speakers in conducting social research. It does so with clear and concise language, accompanied by colourful illustrations throughout the book. As a result, it is a valuable resource for both non-native English speakers and newcomers to social research.",
    "Professor Saliya\u2019s book offers valuable insights into the structural issues of Sri Lankan society, particularly in areas such as bank lending, income distribution, and credit management. Real-world case studies presented as short stories make the book interesting and easy to comprehend for Sri Lankan readers. Professor Saliya\u2019s research methods and critical-thinking skills have led to interesting theories about motives and systemic loopholes in credit evaluation and administration. The book also includes a chapter on action research that contributed to Seylan Bank becoming a leading private bank in Sri Lanka. Professor Saliya\u2019s approach towards social research, especially on social inequality, is commendable, making the book a practical guide for budding researchers and an insightful read for bankers/financiers and the general public.",
    "The second print of the Sinhala book \u2018Samaja Gaveshakaya\u2019 includes controversial credit administration case studies in both English and Sinhala. As a result, readers familiar with either language can gain insight into the sociocultural issues involved in credit administration, making it a must-read for credit officers and bank managers. The book has been approved by the National Library and Documentation Services Board of the Ministry of Education as a recommended book for libraries. It is now available in bookshops in Sri Lanka or can be ordered online via www.thesocialresearcher.com."
