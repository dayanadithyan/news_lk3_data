    "Ishara Dewendra, a senior ITN news presenter, resigned last week over alleged sexual harassment in the workplace.",
    "\u201cDespite informing the authorities about the harassment I faced, no action was taken,\u201d Dewendra wrote on Friday (21) in her personal Facebook post in Sinhala language.",
    "Sexual harassment remains a crime under section Sri Lanka\u2019s Penal Code and is punishable by rigorous imprisonment for up to five years. However, media rights groups say women media workers are frequently subjected to sexual harassment for various reasons including promotions.",
    "But most of them do not complain or report it because of social stigma, given Sri Lankan society\u2019s ignorance on such complaints and inaction or being dragged by law implementing agencies.",
    "The general society\u2019s attitude of blaming women for such complaints also prevents them from lodging complaints against men.",
    "\u201cI have instructed the General Manager of the ITN to immediately start an inquiry according to the accepted practices of the ITN on the alleged sexual harassment case of a former employee at the News and Current Affairs Division Ms. Ishara Devendra,\u201d Sudarshana Gunawardena, the ITN chairman, said his twitter account.",

    "\u201cSexual harassment has become a severe concern currently,\u201d said Arosh Martin, a researcher and youth activist.",
    "\u201cThe utility of the enacted law is absent in most scenarios. There is a need to enact specific laws and take legal and other actions in eliminating sexual harassment.\u201d",
    "The common occurrence of sexual harassment against women and the emergence of evidence against Harvey Weinstein gave rise to the #MeToo movement.",
    "In 2013, the then Sri Lankan government ordered an investigation into sexual harassment in the media amidst allegations of sexual assault from female journalists. These reports of sexual abuse of media personnel began after journalist shared her experience on Twitter.",
    "The Federation of Media Employees Trade Union addressed the harassment against female journalists by demanding justice for Dewendra.",
    "\u201cIt is a common tragedy in our country that such persons get political protection and live freely despite committing sexual violence against women,\u201d said Dharmasiri Lankapeli, the General Secretary of the Federation of Media Employees and Trade Unions (FMETU) said.
