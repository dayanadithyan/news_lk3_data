    "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said yesterday that he wished to become a pilot if he didn\u2019t venture into politics.",
    "\u201cJust as a pilot is responsible for the lives of passengers, the government is also responsible for safeguarding lives,\u201d he said.",
    "Speaking at an SJB rally in Kolonnawa on Saturday Premadasa said that the government was only making the economy smaller instead of strengthening it.",
    "He said even during the war, then President Ranasinghe Premadsa had discussed with the IMF and had implemented IMF agreements.",
    "\"But, he never agreed on proposals to make the economy smaller or to put the burden on the people. The difference between now and then was, he was able to propose Sri Lanka's own agreements to the IMF. But, now we implement what the IMF has proposed,\" he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa Balasuriya)"
