  "original_body_lines": [
    "Fox Corp and Fox News on Tuesday settled a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million, averting a trial putting one of the world\u2019s top media companies in the crosshairs over its coverage of false vote-rigging claims in the 2020 U.S. election.",
    "The settlement, which legal experts said was the largest struck by an American media company, was announced by the two sides and the judge in the case at the 11th hour.",
    "The jury had been selected earlier in the day and the trial poised for opening statements in Wilmington, Delaware. Dominion had sought $1.6 billion in damages in the lawsuit filed in 2021.",
    "\u201cFox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees and our customers,\u201d Poulos said in a statement.",
    "\u201cTruthful reporting in the media is essential to our democracy,\u201d Poulos said.",
    "At issue in the lawsuit was whether Fox was liable for airing the false claims that Denver-based Dominion\u2019s ballot-counting machines were used to manipulate the presidential election in favor of Democrat Joe Biden over then-President Donald Trump, a Republican.",
    "Tuesday\u2019s settlement spared Fox the peril of having some of its best-known figures called to the witness stand and subjected to potentially withering questioning, including executives such as Rupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old who serves as Fox Corp chairman, as well as on-air hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro.",
    "Fox anchor Neil Cavuto broke into his news show \u201cYour World\u201d about 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to report the settlement. A statement by Fox was read on air.",
    "\u201cWe are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe acknowledge the Court\u2019s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX\u2019s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.\u201d",
    "Shares of Fox Corp closed up slightly at $34 per share, but were down 1% in after-hours trading following disclosure of the settlement amount. Fox has cash on hand to pay for a settlement. It committed $3 billion to buy back shares in the first quarter after revenues beat estimates. Fox Corp CEO Lachlan Murdoch told Wall Street analysts in February that the company had about $4 billion cash on hand.",
    "Dominion lawyers declined to answer questions about whether Fox News would apologize publicly or make changes.",
    "The settlement of $787.5 million is the largest amount of money paid to conclude an American media libel case, said Richard Tofel, principal of Gallatin Advisory. The previously highest payment occurred in 2017 when Walt Disney Co paid $177 million, in addition to insurance recoveries, to settle the \u201cpink slime\u201d defamation case against its ABC network by Beef Products Inc.",
    "Dominion sued Fox Corp and Fox News, contending that its business was ruined by the false vote-rigging claims that were aired by the news outlet known for its roster of conservative commentators. The trial was to have tested whether Fox\u2019s coverage crossed the line between ethical journalism and the pursuit of ratings, as Dominion alleged and Fox denied. Fox had portrayed itself in the pretrial skirmishing as a defender of press freedom.",
    "Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis, presiding over the case, had ordered a one-day trial postponement on Monday. Fox was pursuing settlement talks, two sources familiar with the matter said. Davis delayed the trial on Tuesday, as the two sides appeared to hammer out the deal in private.",
    "The primary question for jurors was to be whether Fox knowingly spread false information or recklessly disregarded the truth, the standard of \u201cactual malice\u201d that Dominion must show to prevail in a defamation case.",
    "In February court filings, Dominion cited a trove of internal communications in which Murdoch and other Fox figures privately acknowledged that the vote-rigging claims made about Dominion on-air were false. Dominion said Fox amplified the untrue claims to boost its ratings and prevent its viewers from migrating to other media competitors on the right.",
    "Adding to the legal risks for Fox, another U.S. voting technology company, Smartmatic, is pursuing its own defamation lawsuit seeking $2.7 billion in damages in a New York state court.",
    "\u201cFor many plaintiffs, a court holding, and admission by the defendant about falsity, are even more important than any actual money damages,\u201d said Mary-Rose Papandrea, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law.",
    "Fox had earlier argued that claims by Trump and his lawyers about the election were inherently newsworthy and protected by the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment. Davis ruled in March that Fox could not use those arguments as a defense, finding its coverage was false, defamatory and not protected by the First Amendment.",
    "The lawsuit referenced instances in which Trump allies including his former lawyers Rudolph Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on Fox News to advance the false allegations.",
    "Murdoch internally described the election-rigging claims as \u201creally crazy\u201d and \u201cdamaging\u201d but declined to wield his editorial power to stop them and conceded under oath that some Fox hosts nonetheless \u201cendorsed\u201d the baseless claims, Dominion told the court in a filing.",
    "Under questioning from a Dominion lawyer, Murdoch testified that he thought everything about the election was on the \u201cup-and-up\u201d and doubted the rigging claims from the very beginning, according to Dominion\u2019s filing.",
    "Asked if he could have intervened to stop Giuliani from continuing to spread falsehoods on air, Murdoch responded, \u201cI could have. But I didn\u2019t,\u201d the filing said."
