    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013 More than half a million people marched in anti-government protests in Poland on Sunday to voice their anger against the ruling party's attempts to pass a new law that would give the government sweeping powers to arrest political opponents and stifle the freedoms of citizens and the media, foreign media reported.",
    "Legendary trade union leader Lech Walesa, the country's first post-independence President, and former Prime Minister and Opposition Leader Donald Tusk joined protesters who had traveled from across the country to the capital Warsaw on the 34th anniversary of the country's first post-democratic election, to protest against the ruling hardline Law and Justice Party.",
    "Large crowds also gathered in other major cities across the country carrying banners that demanded a 'Free European Poland', to protest against a right-wing government that has been accused of eroding fundamental rights and violating the constitution. Poland is a member of the European Union.",
