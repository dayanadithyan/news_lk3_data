    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 University lecturers who have withdrawn from marking GCE Advanced Level answer scripts as part of a trade union campaign said they will not be intimidated and also accused the government of hurting the quality of the paper-marking process by hiring substitutes.",
    "Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) media spokesman Charudaththa Illangasinghe told reporters Monday April 24 that the association will meet Tuesday evening to discuss the issue and any further trade union action.",
    "\u201cA/L is an important exam; it is the university entrance exam. The government is attempting to bring down quality of the process by getting other parties to mark the answer scripts,\u201d said Illangasinge.",
    "\u201cWe will not allow the government to destroy education,\u201d he added.",
    "Illangasinghe was referring to a decision by the government to recruit retired university lecturers to the answer scripts. This follows a controversial statement by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on April 19 when he issued a one-week ultimatum to the education sector trade unions engaged in the papermarking boycott as part of its ongoing series of protests against an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed tax hike.",
    "The two-month delay has already seen the schedule for releasing results being disrupted, which has also delayed this year\u2019s exams.",
    "President Wickremsinghe at a meeting with Education Ministry officials on Wednesday warned that he would make education an essential service under emergency law and initiate legal action against teachers who did not comply with the law.",
    "\u201cAll those marked the papers last time, must be available for service now. If not, I will prosecute them and take their property also,\u201d Wickremesinghe told the officials.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t stop the education of children. What nonsense is this? By next week, I will tell the AG (Attorney General) to be ready with the emergency regulations.\u201d",
    "FUTA and school teachers unions\u2019 have been up in arms over the president\u2019s warning.",
    "\u201cIt was the government that brought this problem and it is the government that keeps the problem going.",
    "The government must find a speedy solution and quickly resolve the problem of marking answer scripts,\u201d he said.",
    "FUTA has written to President Wickremesinghe about how they will not be intimidated by \u201cempty threats\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe would like to tell the public, don\u2019t fear anything. We plan to end this soon. We stand for these children.",
    "We care about education. We won\u2019t let the government destroy education,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Apr24/2023)"
