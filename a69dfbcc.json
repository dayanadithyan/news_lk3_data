  "original_body_lines": [
    "Parliamentarian Ajith Mannapperuma said today he had told Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe that one Chamara Gunasekara living in the UK had received USD 250 million to a bank account in the Bahamas Island in West Indies, whereas the Minister has claimed that the money has been received to an account in a UK bank.",
    "The MP who is the Chairman of the Sectorial Oversight Committee on Environment, and Natural Resources told Parliament that the Justice Minister used his information to suppress the whole issue of the X-Press Pearl disaster.",
    "MP Mannapperuma said he trusted the Justice Minister and gave the unverified information for the Minister to act upon it.",
    "\u201cIf it was verified information, I would not have given it to the Minister secretly. I gave the information to the Minister and asked him to look into it. Instead of doing anything he went before the media with the information and danced like a peacock. After his revelation was proved wrong, now he has started to attack me. He is shooting the messenger instead of acting upon the message,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said that even after a month the Justice Minister has been unable to make a statement whether the information on the alleged bribe was right or wrong.",
    "\u201cHe should hand over his ministry to a child,\u201d he charged. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
