    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) appears to be sending mixed signals on its continued support for rival-turned-ally President Ranil Wickremesinghe, with a senior spokesman now claiming that the party commands grassroots support and the capacity for a show of strength if ever it was called for.",
    "SLPP general secretary and MP Sagara Kariyawasam said at a press conference at the party headquarters in Colombo on Monday April 17 that his party had an understanding with Wickremesinghe that it would support his efforts to \u201crestore democracy\u201d and rebuild the economy while retaining the right to oppose anything that had to be opposed.",
    "\u201cWhen supporting President Wickremesinghe, we had a certain understanding with him that we would support him in restoring democracy in the country and developing the economy and that we would not stand in the way of his administration. However, we retained our right to oppose things that we might have to oppose,\u201d said Kariyawasam.",
    "\u201cThat was the understanding. We believe he will honour that agreement, as shall we. There have been no questions so far about power. If it comes to a question of showing strength, steps can be taken as needed where necessary,\u201d he said.",
    "MP Kariyawasam made these remarks in response to leading questions from reporters who sounded keen to provoke a response from him to speculation that the already splintered SLPP was further divided on its continued support for Wickremesinghe. Journalists also questioned the MP on proposals from the party to Wickremesinghe to appoint certain legislators representing the party to cabinet positions.",
    "Kariyawasam acknowledged that a proposal has been made to the president, and added that Kalutara district SLPP MP Rohitha Abeygunwardena, as someone who worked hard to bring the SLPP government to power in 2020, deserves a portfolio more than main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Rajitha Senaratne, from the same district, who actively campaigned to defeat the SLPP.",
    "Speculation is rife that Senaratne intends to cross over to the government. The MP has publicly expressed his wish to obtain the health portfolio, which he held during the 2015-2019 Yahapalana government.",
    "SJB MP Nalin Bandara claimed a week prior that Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara, considered a rising star in the Wickremesinghe-SLPP administration, had already declared the SLPP\u2019s support for Wickremesinghe at a futures presidential election. However, Kariyawasam was quick to clarify days later that Minister Wijesekara had only said the SLPP could potentially back the United National Party (UNP) leader and not that it definitely would.",
    "Save for a number of SLPP allies that by this time had sat in the opposition benches as independent MPs, the party voted en masse in July 2022 to elect Wickremesinghe as the successor to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa who was forced to resign after a wave of protests over Sri Lanka\u2019s worst currency crisis in decades. Political analysts have said Wickremesinghe ensured the security of SLPP legislators who feared for their lives after a colleague was murdered by a mob on May 09 2022 following a wave of retaliatory mob-violence triggered by an unprovoked attack on peaceful anti-government protestors in Colombo. Various members of the SLPP have publicly thanked President Wickremesinghe for \u201ccontaining the threat\u201d of allegedly attempted insurgency from anti-establishment forces said to have hijacked the hitherto peaceful protest movement.",
    "At the April 11 press conference, Kariyawasam also made the headline-grabbing remark that SLPP national organiser and former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa was fit to lead the country.",
    "Kariyawasam is widely seen as a staunch loyalist of the former two-time finance minister.",
    "SLPP gen secy says Basil Rajapaksa fit to lead Sri LankaSee more",
    "He said at the same press conference that the party had requested Wickremesinghe to have an expert committee review a proposed anti-terrorism bill that has drawn some criticism over its definition of terrorism among other concerns. The party will under no circumstances support any bill that can restrict people\u2019s freedom of expression and their ability to democratically win their rights, he said.",
    "Kariyawasam further said on April 11 that party leader and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was renowned for finishing the war and not for working towards the division of the country, in what sounded like a thinly veiled reference to allegations his camp had once made at the Wickreemsinghe-led United National Party (UNP)\u2019s efforts at peace talks with the Tigers.",
    "The MP added that Wickremesinghe had also failed to win a popular mandate at past presidential elections, a familiar refrain from the opposition.",
    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna wants president to reconsider anti-terror billSee more",
    "At this Monday\u2019s briefing, the MP was asked if the once mighty SLPP was slowly losing its grip on power.",
    "\u201cWe would require power in order to do some good for the country,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBut if at some point some harm is being done to the country, we will take measures to show our power,\u201d he said.",
    "Kariyawasam claimed that the SLPP is still the single largest political party in the country with over three million members, whose allegiance was a result of their belief in the policies of party leader Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
    "The SLPP has the backing of people who subscribe to a specific set of policies, he said.",
    "He criticised some unnamed party stalwarts who he said came to power using Rajapaksa\u2019s image in their campaigns only to abandon the party in pursuit of their own presidential ambitions. It was unclear if this was a reference to SLPP MP Dullas Alahapperuma who ran against Wickremesinghe for the presidency last year and now sits in the opposition together with a number of other former SLPP heavyweights.",
    "\u201cNo matter which heads may be changing at the top, the party still has grassroots support,\u201d claimed Kariyawasam. He did not cite any polling data.",
    "Asked by a reporter if the SLPP was content with continuing its ongoing partnership with President Wickremesinghe, he said: \u201cIf a situation arises where a show of strength is called for, we have the capacity to do it.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, speculation continues of an imminent split in the SJB, which according to some media reports is on the verge of seeing some notable defections to the government to support Wickremesinghe\u2019s International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed reform agenda. However, SJB and opposition leader in a strongly-worded statement on Sunday flatly rejected these reports (Colombo/Apr17/2023)"
