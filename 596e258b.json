    "The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will consider Sri Lanka\u2019s bailout package for approval today, exactly 200 days after reaching a staff level agreement. The approval of the programme would immediately unlock IMF financing for Sri Lanka through the US$ 2.9 billion, 4-year loan under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) as agreed when entering the staff-level agreement in early September last year.",
    "The approval of the IMF Executive Board is also expected to unlock further funding lines through the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which are already lined up, according to Sri Lankan authorities.",
    "Sri Lanka has secured financing assurances from all its major bilateral creditors for the IMF Executive Board to consider the bailout package for the country. If approved, this would be Sri Lanka\u2019s 17thprogramme with the IMF. The expected IMF bailout is seen as a necessary early step on a long road to economic recovery as Sri Lanka has to bring its debt to sustainable levels within a 10-year period following negotiations with its creditors for debt treatment.",
    "The bailout package this time is somewhat different to previous ones as it could be also be used for budget support, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said."
