    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A draft bill to set up a broadcast authority to arbitrate on the \u2018truth\u2019 with powers to cancel licenses is a blow to democracy and economic policy debate, legislator Harsha de Silva has warned.",
    "The Broadcast Bill will control electronic broadcasts which will apply to radio, television and questioned whether it also applied to internet and social media.",
    "\u201cToday people are facing economic problems, some people like how things are being done and some do not,\u201d de Silva, from the opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya told reporters.",
    "\u201cIf the government is saying this is the correct information, and this is the only way to recover the economy, and if someone is saying anything against, then the government says that is not true.",
    "\u201cAnd if the license of the channel that broadcast the opinion, can be suspended or canceled, where are we heading to?\u201d",
    "\u201cWe are telling the government not to take this forward and if they do we will fight to protect the democratic rights of the people in this country.",
    "The United National Party has one opinion, the JVP has another, the Pohottuwa as another and the SJB had another, De Siva.",
    "The government will decide what is the \u2018truth\u2019 in some Gobelsian way, he warned.",
    "\u201cThe decision-making power on how to inform the people about the national economy cannot be given to some authority,\u201d de Silva said.",
    "\u201cIf the correct information is not going to the people, and only one-sided information is going to the people under Gobelsian theory, then we can imagine where this will end.\u201d",
    "In a free society the \u2018truth\u2019 is not arrived at by some state authority like in Nazi Germany but through public debate, philosophers who helped build a free society in Europe have pointed out.",
    "Sri Lanka now has a European style government, having inherited a majoritarian lawmaking process, without any understanding \u00a0of how to maintain a free society, critics say.",
    "Similar problems appeared in Eastern European nations which transplanted Western constitutional government and the popular vote with the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.",
    "\u201cThat mankind are not infallible; that their truths, for the most part, are only half-truths: that unity of opinion, unless resulting from the fullest and freest comparison of opposite opinions, is not desirable, and diversity is not an evil, but a good, until mankind are much more capable than at present of recognizing all sides of the truth, are principles applicable to men\u2019s modes of action, not less than to their opinions,\u201d wrote John Stuart Mill, 19th century English philosopher economist, legislator in the utilitarian tradition.",
    "Another utilitarian, Charles Hay Cameron laid the foundation for constitutional government and legislative council in then-Ceylon in 1833, the forerunner of current parliament, through which the license cancelling the Broadcast Authority bill is to be passed citing national security and economic considerations.",
    "A group of five people will be in the commission. One will be the secretary of the Information Department another will be the director of the telecommunication commission and three will be appointed by the president, subject to a Constitutional Council.",
    "\u201cWith three people from the constitutional council, we can expect independence to a certain extent,\u201d de Silva said.",
    "\u201cIf we are giving the power to cancel the license to these people, we call this not \u00a0objective, but subjective. \u00a0We saw, when movies get released, there were censor boards, and those members according to the minister that is being assigned must do those censoring.",
    "\u201cIf they try to censor and cancel licenses of channels, which then goes on social media, it is completely against democracy.",
    "\u201cWhat we see is that, what could not be done through Anti-Terrorism Bill they are trying to do through the Broadcast Authority Bill.\u201d (Colombo/June04/2023)"
