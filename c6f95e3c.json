    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe participated in International Women\u2019s Day, where he presented awards to women for their achievements. The President said it was women who had played a vital role in securing assistance, as some institutions such as the IMF are headed by women today. Rashmi Nimesha Gunawardena was given a presidential award after getting three \u2019A\u2019 passes in the 2021 A-level examination. Pix by Pradeep Pathirana"
