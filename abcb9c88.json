    "The fund duration is between February 2023 and December 2023 under a project named \u201cEmpowering women in crisis.\u201d",
    "The program aims to support at least 1,200 women including their children who have faced sexual and gender-based violence and will support 500 women-led micro-enterprises at risk of collapse and over 2,000 individuals at risk of poverty and malnutrition.",
    "The projects will work with women-led enterprises in the districts of Ampara, Colombo, Monaragala, Vavuniya and Mullaitivu.",
    "\u201cOur goal is to ensure that women and girls who are most vulnerable to the ongoing crisis are not left behind in response and recovery efforts, and to ensure that their safety and security are prioritised during this time,\u201d Japanese Ambassador Mizukoshi Hideaki was quoted as saying.",
    "In 2022, the United Nations Population Fund said one in four women have been subjected to physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives.",
    "The project will provide safe houses access to essential commodities, ensure that shelters and safe houses where facilities were improved and refurbished continue to function rather than face closure due to inadequate funding and support. (Colombo/Mar23/2023)"
