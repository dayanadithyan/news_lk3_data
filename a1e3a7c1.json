    "There has been an increase in the number of earth tremors felt in Sri Lanka and earthquake conditions are reported more than usual, Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) Director General (Acting) M.M.J.P Ajith Prema said.",
    "He told the media today that several minor tremors had been reported during the past few years, with 16 minor tremors recorded in 2020, 18 in 2021, five in 2022 and nine minor tremors in 2023 until now.",
    "\"Sri Lanka lies in the middle of the Indo-Australian Plate. The earthquakes occur and affect the countries on both corners of the plate. There is a possibility of not recording higher magnitude earthquakes in Sri Lanka,\" he said.",
    "The collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate has caused 8.0 magnitude earthquakes in the Himalayan mountain range. The creation of the plates occurred a million years ago.",
    "GSMB senior geophysicist Ms. Nilmini Thaldena said minor tremors less than magnitude three in the Richter Scale were observed within the country, and the most clear records could be found only after 2012. Research is being carried out globally regarding the earthquakes occurring in the southern part of the country, she said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
