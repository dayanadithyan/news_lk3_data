    "Advocata Institute recently launched a policy action group, \u201cWomen\u2019s Policy Action Network\u201d (WPAN) supported by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, advocating for policy reforms enabling women\u2019s economic empowerment.",
    "WPAN\u2019s primary goal is the establishment of the policy action group aimed at promoting women\u2019s economic empowerment, with men and women from civil society organisations, policymakers, and the private sector. It aims to focus on pertinent issues that restrict women from participating in the labor force. The most pressing being unpaid care work, lack of legislation around nighttime and part time work for women.",
    "Chair of WPAN\u00a0 and Advocata Institute Senior Research Fellow Dr. Roshan Perera,\u00a0 launched the network inviting all to join in, as Advocata and WPAN embark on an evidence-based model for progressive and inclusive policy changes.",
    "As part of the launch a keynote speech was delivered by Jetwing Travels Chairman and Managing Director Shiromal Cooray.",
    "Advocata Institute Senior Research Fellow Dr. Roshan moderated an eminent lineup of panelists that included Virtusa Director Sampath Thrimawithana, Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment Advisor to the Minister Shan Yahampath, CIMB Investment Bank Sri Lanka Former CEO Anarkali Moonesinghe and Verite Research Senior Research Analyst Sumini Siyambalapitiya who spoke on their current work in examining and alleviating barriers to women\u2019s participation in the workforce.",
    "The panel also highlighted some examples that should be considered in supporting policy reforms, such as regulated affordable childcare, paternal or parental leave and normalising a different options and timelines for when women should participate in the workforce \u2013 as traditional career paths do not fit biological clocks.",
    "The event consisted of representatives from civil society organisations, policymakers, and women leaders who generated strong advocacy conversations on behalf of women. WPAN unites people who are dedicated to the empowerment of women to provide a strong voice for policy reforms to economically empower women. It is thus an umbrella network harnessing voices for change to empower women through economic freedom.",
    "Representing the Netherlands Embassy, The Deputy Ambassador Anouk Baron explained why they are supporting this initiative: \u201cWomen worldwide make up over half of the population, yet it is still rare to find a place where they are equally represented in places where decisions are made about their lives. In Sri Lanka, that is particularly important now as the country is reforming towards an inclusive, sustainable future. The Kingdom of the Netherlands supports WPAN with a vision that if women and men have equal opportunities, we will have a safer, more stable, and more prosperous world.\u201d"
