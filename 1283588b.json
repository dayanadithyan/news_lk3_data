    "Releasing of results of GCE Advanced level exam 2022 will be delayed and GCE Advanced level examination 2023 will have to postponed if the trade union action launched by teachers who are marking answer papers continue further, Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha told Parliament today.",
    "\"This phenomena will take place if those who are engaged in trade union action fail to be flexible. Those who mark advanced level answer papers wanted their allowance increased. I managed to get cabinet approval for an increment recently. However the teachers have informed that they are not satisfied with the increment,\" the minister said.",
    "\"These teachers should take into account the current economic crisis and be flexible,\" he added. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
