Western countries seek to defeat Russia and try to make strategic defeat,

Answer - Yes, we can report to the military, we are examining the education of the students, not the civilian population.

The strategy of Sri Lanka is very important. We also appreciate the balance of Sri Lanka's balanced neutral position on Ukraine.

We expect you to maintain this neutral position, even when you face pressure from the West.

### AKD’s NPP-JVP & the Generic Left Aren’t Doing Their Best to Win

*2024-01-22 16:50:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/akds-npp-jvp-the-generic-left-arent-doing-their-best-to-win/) · `en`

The Left has the best chance of being elected to office in Sri Lanka since 1964 or 1947. That’s speculative. So let me put it more clearly. Never in my lifetime has the Left been closer to assuming governmental power by democratic means, i.e., leading the country. We have never been closer to having a left-wing leader and administration.

Society is dividing between those who think that’s a good thing and those who think it’s bad. As Mao said in his first political essay on the Peasant Movement in Hunan, opinion is divided between those who say “it’s fine” and those who say “it’s terrible”. Mao thought it was fine.

We had a similar division of opinion during the Aragalaya. Opinion remains divided about it. I was among those who said “it’s fine”. Ranil thought it was fine and then that it was terrible. The Pohottuwa thought it was terrible all along.

### Farmers' Frauds

*2024-01-22 16:03:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174530) · `ta`

Vavuniya District Rice Mill Owners Association President C.. Vivekanandan said.

At present, the harvest has begun and the buyers who buy paddy to the farmers are defrauding the establishment of the farmers and buying paddy to the farmers.

He pointed out that the farmers were likely to lose about 15 kilos by replacing the upper part of the scales, and that the farmers were giving the bike to the buyers and the loss of several thousand rupees because they were getting 100 and 200 rupees more than the buyers.

He has therefore asked the farmers to act very much when selling paddy.

### The mountain community looking for leaders within the parties ..!

*2024-01-22 16:00:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174528) · `ta`

In the hill country, only the party leaders are just coming up. The union does not see people leaders who talk about labor rights. Two hundred years later, no solutions about labor issues can be found, and the government's votes have been put into a very weak position.

It is amazing that those who said that milk and honey will run in the hill country. People who spoke verses on stage in cinema style have gone a long way from people. Once the election is probably declared, people will come as usual. It is now guaranteed that these people are going to make a series of mistakes to welcome them.

Labor Affairs is heading towards failure. In the negotiations, it has been revealed that more than a thousand rupees has not been complied with the company.. It is not possible even if some trade unions tried to keep the president in fear of meeting the companies directly. How are companies that do not listen to the president's work back to the trade unions that are not supportive of the people?

Prices for non-food items, however, fell 6.3% in December from 7.1% year-on-year in November.

Exclusive class culture is a feature of Sri Lanka's free education.Thousands of teachers who receive the monthly salary and conduct exclusive classes and get millions of money.

The Ministry of Education has defined the number of students in a classroom.In the 40 -minute course, the teaching of a teacher should be understood and the environment should be existed in the classroom.

This is why the number of students is defined.Similarly, the number of teachers can only have physical qualifications and skills that teach in a classroom.

But the same teachers are the same teachers who teach about five hundred students from two to three hours.. Parents and the Ministry of Education do not question this. But the issues of the Finance Minister Ranjith Siyambalab Bittiya are thinking about the amount of parents spending on exclusive classes in our country.. Parents are allocating thirty percent of their children for exclusive classes, rather than the amount they spend on school education, he said.

### Watch: Super-slingy Thushara sends Jos Buttler’s off-stump flying, takes two in two on SA20 debut

*2024-01-22 14:01:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Watch-Super-slingy-Thushara-sends-Jos-Buttlers-off-stump-flying-takes-two-in-two-on-SA20-debut/108-275493) · `en`

Jan. 22 (wisden) - Nuwan Thushara, bowling with a super-slingy action, claimed two wickets in two balls to kick off an electric death spell on SA20 debut.

The 29-year-old, who has played six T20Is for Sri Lanka, is building a portfolio in franchise cricket, with today (January 21) marking his bow for MI Cape Town in South Africa’s SA20. Handed the new ball up against the formidable opening pairing of Jos Buttler and Jason Roy, he began with an exemplary yorker and mixed slower balls in as well, but was hit for three boundaries in his first two overs as Paarl Royals began strongly.

When he returned for the 18th over, Paarl Royals were 140-1 and aiming for an explosive finish, but Thushara had other ideas. His first ball zipped past Buttler’s outside edge to send off-stump cartwheeling, and his second left Fabian Allen hobbling, a vicious yorker smashing the West Indies international on the top of the boot. He was given lbw.

### Modi inaugurates Hindu temple on razed Babri mosque site

India, Jan 22 (BBC) - India's PM Narendra Modi has taken part in rituals to open a grand temple to popular Hindu god Ram in Ayodhya city.

The temple replaces a 16th-Century mosque razed by Hindu mobs in 1992. The demolition had sparked nationwide riots in which nearly 2,000 people died.

Thousands of invited guests, including top film stars, industrialists and cricketers, attended the event.

But some Hindu seers and most of the opposition boycotted it, saying Mr Modi was using it for political gains.

General elections are due in India in the next few months and Mr Modi's political rivals say the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be seeking votes in the temple's name in a country where 80% of the population is Hindu.

Critics have also accused the government of going overboard with what is essentially a religious celebration in a country which - according to its constitution - is secular.

In the contemporary world where politics and diplomacy are determined by the basis for the ideas that are spread through social networks, these people cannot succeed.

This is because Indians and the Maldives do not have the number of influential numbers and energy on social networks.

### Ron DeSantis ends 2024 campaign, endorses Trump over Haley

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis ended his fading presidential campaign on Sunday and endorsed Donald Trump just two days before the pivotal New Hampshire primary, leaving former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley as Trump’s last long-shot challenger for the Republican nomination.

DeSantis’ decision, less than a week after his deflating loss to Trump in Iowa despite an enormous investment there, caps a stunning fall from grace after DeSantis had been widely seen as Republicans’ most promising alternative to Trump ahead of the general election in November.

His departure sets up the one-on-one battle that Haley has coveted against Trump, the former president who has maintained an iron grip on the Republican electorate despite facing four criminal prosecutions. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all the cases.
