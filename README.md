In early June, the World Bank ranked Russia as the fourth-largest economy globally based on PPP, surpassing Germany due to cheaper gas and political instability. Russia's economic growth, initially lagging, surged post-Ukraine invasion, aiming for global dominance. Despite challenges, including sanctions and a shift towards militarization, Russia's economy boomed, with the World Bank tripling its growth forecast to 3.2%. However, Russia still trails India and China in size, with the shadow economy potentially underestimating its true GDP.

Purchase-Power-Balance (PPP) and Gross National Production Measurement is preferred by many economists. This is because it takes into account the difference between local prices and nominal prices.

The World Bank has upgraded Russia's ranking after reviewing its data. And Russia says that Japan has actually overtaken Japan in 2021 and has since retained the fourth place since.

Its earlier calculations were based on 2017 data, but these are now updated to reflect 2021 statistics.
