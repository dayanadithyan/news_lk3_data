### Sri Lanka banks in talks about getting ISBs repaid in rupees: Sources

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s domestic banks are in talks with the government seeking repayment of their sovereign bonds in rupees, sources said though there are concerns over the likely impact on the exchange rate from such a move.

Out of 12,550 million dollars of sovereign bonds outstanding, about 1,750 million dollars of bonds are held by resident investors, the bulk of which are banks.

When a dollar asset is repaid in rupees, the banks have a negative foreign exchange position against the deposit liabilities called the net open position which has to be covered by purchasing dollars from the market.

By exchanging a rupee security, banks are hoping to reduce or avoid a haircut on the ISB holdings as they did in the case of Sri Lanka Development Bonds.

When Sri Lanka Development Bonds were repaid in rupees without a haircut, the central bank also provided some dollars in August 2023.

The Rajapakse government has taken steps to burn the bodies of Muslim citizens who died in the Kovit infection without any scientific resolution.

The entire Muslim community was very painful by this decision of that government. The affected families are still aware of its pain.

It is a foolish thing for the government to think that the government can escape from the other Muslim people.

The government has suddenly made such a resolution to protect Rajapakse from the crime and blame the authorities.

If the authorities have been given the ally not scientifically to burn the bodies, who made the decision.
