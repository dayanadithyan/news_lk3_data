### Politics and the Plantation Wage

*2024-07-01 11:00:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/politics-and-the-plantation-wage/) ¬∑ `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe chose the Ceylon Workers‚Äô Congress May Day platform, in Kotagala, to announce the increase of the plantation workers‚Äô daily wage to Rs 1,700.00. An unexpected presidential fiat, delivered just a few months before a possible election by a potential presidential candidate, was made public from the political platform of a major plantation trade union, generally seen as pro-government. The self-evident political implications do not merit either debate or elaboration.

In a rational world, in any industry, the employer and the employee should arrive at a fair wage through a consultative process. The unsolicited intervention of a third force with an agenda unrelated to the interests of either party, is undesirable from all points of view. Still, there are precedents, when sitting presidents have mandated wage increases in the plantation sector, for patently political reasons, ignoring the possible toxic economic consequences.

R. Sampanthan, a key figure in Sri Lanka's Tamil National Alliance, passed away, leaving a significant void in Tamil politics. Known for his dedication to public service over a legal career, Sampanthan's diplomatic efforts were pivotal in the Tamil community's struggles. His loss is deeply felt, especially in the Trincomalee district, where he represented Tamil interests. A unifying force within the party system, his absence marks the end of an era in Tamil political history. Condolences pour in for his family, friends, and supporters, with prayers for his soul.

The loss of Annar is a disaster for the Tamil national political area. He is a great man who sacrificed his legal career and engaged in people's politics.

It must be remembered at this moment that he used his political sort of politicalism and experience as diplomacy on many occasions during the three kinds of struggle of the Tamils.

His loss, which was the ultimate belief in the Tamil representation of the Trincomalee district, is not compensated.

He is the only one who coordinated the historic party and the federation of parties that traveled in different currents, and in all his enabled times, his personality would not be shattered.

Our race today has lost a long -term experience of the political history of Sri Lankan Tamils.
