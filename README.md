Trade Minister Nalin Fernando on Friday met the Egyptian Ambassador Maged Mosleh to discuss measures to boost bilateral ties.

The Minister said that Sri Lanka is considering convening the next session of the JCTEC in June this year.

The Ambassador said that Africa is a potential and fast-growing and highly potential market and Sri Lankan exporters can exploit this potential by investing in Egypt. And Sri Lanka has an additional advantage through relatively relaxed rules of origin under a free trade agreement.

During the meeting, the Minister explored the opportunity to import big onions from Egypt, and the Ambassador expressed willingness to assist with such imports.

It provides a source of income, a new livelihood, a motivation to reform and an overall drop in reoffending rates

This news item of the UK Telegraph is not simply interesting, but also provokes progressive thoughts, when you read the words of a current KPMG employee, a former offender. I have reproduced those words here.

New thinking for GOSL, Prisons, our Ministry of Justice and forensics in our accounting profession?

Rather than leave the thought behind, I am putting pen to paper and sharing this, such that it may trigger new thinking in our country, our profession, our corporate community. Thus this article today, in my now not so regular “Thought Leadership Forum” column.

### 2019 Easter Sunday tragedy: National Peace Council says intl. role in ascertaining truth remains relevant

*2024-04-30 00:18:11* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/2019-Easter-Sunday-tragedy-National-Peace-Council-says-intl-role-in-ascertaining-truth-remains-relevant/14-761180) · `en`

The National Peace Council (NPC) in a statement said yesterday that the international role in ascertaining the truth of the 2019 Easter Sunday tragedy remains relevant even today.

On April 21, the country marked the fifth anniversary of the tragic Easter Sunday bombing that claimed the lives of approximately 300 persons and left more than 500 others injured and maimed. The enduring consequences of the Easter Sunday bombing need to be kept in mind. The economic repercussions, stemming from the decline in foreign investments and tourism, continue to haunt the country, contributing to the economic challenges faced today. The National Peace Council is particularly concerned that the erosion of trust in Government leadership, exacerbated by perceived failures in accountability and transparency, remains a pressing concern for all citizens. Unfortunately, this leads to frustration and loss of faith in the system, which can also lead to further injustices.

### A call to end  ‘Corporal Punishment’  and create a fear-free childhood

*2024-04-30 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/A-call-to-end-Corporal-Punishment-and-create-a-fear-free-childhood/172-281587) · `en`

School and home are the places where children spend most of the time of the day; hence corporal punishment should be absent in both places and they should feel safe in such environments

Research unequivocally shows that corporal punishment is linked to adverse outcomes, including increased aggression, poorer mental health, and diminished cognitive development, which could result in long-term psychological issues and social dysfunctions, ultimately contributing to a cycle of violence that affects the broader society and future generations

A study on the perceptions of Sri Lankan parents on the use of corporal punishment (2012) found that 74 per cent of parents resort to corporal punishment

The alternatives are rooted in communication, understanding, and mutual respect

### Law reforms stagnate in Lanka while world marks global Day to End Corporal Punishment

Corporal punishment affects over 1.3 billion children worldwide and is the most common form of child abuse globally and in Sri Lanka, where complaints of cruelty against children have increased by three-fold in the past ten years.    As the world celebrates and respective governments pledge to do more to abolish a heinous crime against children on International Day to End Corporal Punishment on April 30th, neither the Government of Sri Lanka nor the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), the most powerful institution maintained by public funds to protect and promote children’s rights is recognizing the only day dedicated to a specific type of child abuse.

What are the proposed legal reforms to ban corporal punishment?

The only group against whom assault is decriminalized is the 25% of citizens, 5.2 million children in Sri Lanka.

### Early Buddhism’s links with urbanisation and commerce

*2024-04-30 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Early-Buddhisms-links-with-urbanisation-and-commerce/172-281590) · `en`

When land-based feudalism replaced urbanism and trade, Buddhism waned in India, says Indian scholar Balkrishna Govind Gokhale

In sixth century BC, Buddhism thrived in the Gangetic Plain in North India due to urbanisation and the development of trade. According to the renowned scholar of Buddhism in India, Balkrishna Govind Gokhale, Buddhism began to decline in India when urbanisation and trade yielded place to feudalism.

In his paper in the Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies (Vol Number 2, 1982, University of Wisconsin Madison), Gokhale says that the use of iron tools, beginning from the seventh century BC, increased agricultural productivity, which in turn led to larger commodity surpluses, which became available for exchange through trade.

The government made two important decisions recently on medical education in the country. One was to establish a medical faculty at the National School of Business Management (NSBM) in Homagama and the other was to enroll local students at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University to pursue medical degrees.

Cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said on March 12 that the proposed medical faculty would come under the direct supervision and regulation of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).

He stated that the new faculty will enroll 500 local and foreign students annually and the Homagama Base Hospital will be upgraded to teaching hospital status, like the Kalubowila Hospital, for the NSBM undergraduates’ clinical training. The NSBM has agreed to provide funds for the development of the Homagama Base Hospital in accordance with the standards of medical education published by the SLMC, he said.

The bank reached this agreement following her request, she added.

While addressing an event organized in Ratnapura to distribute smart agriculture equipment for farmers in the area, she said that it is important not to subsidize the upliftment of the people but to provide them the strength to stand up independently.

### May Day, May Day! Collective Rights versus Individual Rights

Weakening labour rights and a race to the bottom is never a recipe for inclusive, equitable and sustainable development

When employers are permitted to collectively represent their interests, it is an implicit acknowledgement that there is unity in strength. If so, why should workers, weakly placed in the labour contract, evidenced by the fact that they do not earn a living wage, currently in a poverty trap and earning poverty wages, be curtailed from union representation? The few unions in the apparel sector do have to change their officer constituency and make them more representative of their workers. We are aware that unions need change, but that does not mean we throw the baby out with the bathwater

Following is a statement by UNITE – (a coalition of trade unions and mass movements) on May Day, pledging to fight against the inequalities which exist amongst us, and forging a struggle against the neoliberal State and international world order, which dispossess the working people

On 4 May 1886, workers in Chicago staged a protest in the Haymarket Square, fighting for an eight-hour workday. Workers withstood brutal attacks by the police and sacrificed their lives and bodies to make the eight-hour workday a reality. All of us in Sri Lanka enjoy an eight-hour work day, which became one of our fundamental rights as working people as a result of the struggles and sacrifices of our predecessors. Today, we have come full circle where our Government and employers are drafting a new labour law shredding sanctified labour rights, including the eight-hour workday, under the guise of a single Employment Act.

Today, I stand at the intersection of corporate leadership and social responsibility, deeply reflecting on the vital role we play in shaping a society that cherishes and protects its most vulnerable members—our children. Today, 30 April, is the International Day to End Corporal Punishment and I invite you to join me on a journey of reflection, action and commitment towards eradicating this deep-rooted societal ill.

A study on the perceptions of Sri Lankan parents on the use of corporal punishment (2012) found that 74% of parents resort to corporal punishment and believed it to be a necessary means of disciplining children. Meanwhile, a National Child Protection Authority (2017) study on disciplinary methods practiced in Sri Lankan schools found that 8 out of 10 students have experienced at least one episode of corporal punishment in the school setting.

### What’s Ranil’s secret?

Out of all the Lankan politicians, the most baffling case for me is Ranil Wickremesinghe. I mean, what leadership theory can explain his behaviour? What management theory can predict his actions? How can the same man ruin his party beyond repair and still become the president of a country? Who would even believe this stuff? It simply doesn’t add up, which makes it an interesting topic for research. Let’s try to analyse this anomaly, this outlier.

Well, for starters, Ranil is one tough cookie. The man knows how to survive in the treacherous hellhole of politics. He’ll climb over dead bodies or lie under dead bodies, depending on the situation, just to live another day. I mean, think about all the UNP leaders who died along the way. But Ranil survived. Maybe that’s it. The whole of RW phenomena can be defined with just that simple explanation. But I think it’s more complicated than that.

In the meantime, a Cardinal can remain active and can vote at a conclave to elect a new Pope until he reaches the age of 80. This is the tradition of the Catholic Church," he added.

### Fitch affirms Sri Lanka’s UB Finance rating at ‘BB(lka)’

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch affirmed licensed non-bank lender UB Finance Company Ltd’s national long-term rating at ‘BB(lka)’. The outlook is stable.

The rating is driven by Fitch’s expectation of extraordinary support from Union Bank of Colombo PLC, which owns 89.9 percent of UB Finance.

“UBF’s rating is constrained by our view that any support required may be more of a burden relative to UB’s modest balance sheet size, compared with other Fitch-rated financial leasing companies owned by larger banks,” Fitch said in its assessment.

The rating agency expects the proposed rights issue to bridge UBF’s regulatory capital shortfall. “However, the capital buffer could be thin against the regulatory minimum capital of LKR2.5 billion and may fall below the regulatory requirement should there be any unforeseen losses.”

Fitch Ratings – Colombo – 26 Apr 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed UB Finance PLC’s (UBF) National Long-Term Rating at ‘BB(lka)’. The Outlook is Stable.

Cinematographer Sukumar and composer Devi Sri Prasad contribute positively.

### Scotland’s Humza Yousaf resigns as country’s leader

Scotland’s leader Humza Yousaf resigned on Monday, further opening the door to the UK opposition Labour Party to regain ground in its former Scottish heartlands in a national election expected later this year.

Yousaf quit as head of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) after a week of chaos triggered by his scrapping of a coalition agreement with Scotland’s Greens.

He then failed to secure enough support to survive votes of no confidence against him expected later this week.

Resigning little over a year after he replaced Nicola Sturgeon as first minister and SNP leader, Yousaf said it was time for someone else to lead Scotland’s devolved government.

The SNP’s fortunes have faltered over a funding scandal and the resignation of Sturgeon as party leader last year. There has also been infighting over how progressive its pitch should be as it seeks to woo back voters.
