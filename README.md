Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was the Prime Minister of the Chancellor, is now the president of the President.

Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has questioned whether anyone can expect justice in such a situation.

IsraelтАЩs misguided (as the US President chooses to call it) attack on the Iranian Consulate in Syria, the retaliatory strikes by Iran on Israel and counter-strikes by Israel on Iran have set West Asia (referred to as the Middle East by the US and the West) in flames. By these actions, the taboo against direct attacks on each other has now disappeared.

If there is another round-a conflict over IranтАЩs nuclear advances or another strike by Israel on Iranian military officers- both sides will feel free to launch direct attacks on the other.

Relations reached a point of no return on April 1, 2024 when an Israeli air strike destroyed the Iranian Consulate annex building in Syria killing 16 people, including a senior Quds Force Commander.

Prime rate hits a peak level of 29.67 percent in November 2022

The often watched market lending rate, which guides the rest of the rates on loans to small businesses to mortgages to consumers, touched a two-year low last week continuing its descent.

The average prime lending rate or the rate at which the banks lend to their most creditworthy clients for a short term fell 22 basis points to 10.41 percent last week.

This was the lowest level from 9.85 percent on April 1, 2022 just before the Central Bank raised interest rates by a bumper 700 basis points to rein in the inflation at the time.

Both government securities yields and the market lending rates are on the descent during the last 10 months since the time Central Bank pivoted to cut rates for the first time in June last year.
