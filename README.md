Israel retrieved the bodies of six hostages from the Khan Younis area in southern Gaza overnight, according to statements from the military and the prime ministerтАЩs office on Tuesday.

The families of Yagev Buchshtab, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Yoram Metzger, Nadav Popplewell, and Chaim Perry have been informed, the statements added.

The Hostages Families Forum, an organisation that represents most hostage families, welcomed the news but renewed its call on the government to conclude a hostage release deal with the Gaza-based Palestinian militant group Hamas.

тАЬThe immediate return of the remaining 109 hostages can only be achieved through a negotiated deal. The Israeli government, with the assistance of mediators, must do everything in its power to finalise the deal currently on the table,тАЭ it said.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the Middle East this week trying to secure a ceasefire and hostage return agreement between Israel and Hamas.

### Why not shake hands with the president?

Sujeewa Senasinghe criticized Sajith Premadasa for not shaking hands with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, calling it unnecessary fuss. He suggested a warm greeting like "Ayubowan" would've been healthier, reflecting the Sri Lankan culture. However, he also mentioned the impossibility of congratulating Kamala Harris due to her disability, and responded to criticisms by labeling Premadasa's actions as arrogant and disgusting.

ЁЯЯй

SJB's vice -president Sujeewa Senasinghe today said that the failure of Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa with the current President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the day of the filing of the nomination was creating unnecessary confusion.

тАЬSome people create unnecessary fuss about the matter. It would have been nice if President Wickremasinghe had congratulated Premadasa. Greeting 'Ayubovan' would have been healthy and sweet and the best way to greet. This is the real Sri Lankan greeting system, тАЭhe said at a media briefing.

"But, of course, one cannot congratulate Kamala Haris as a handicap," he said.

Responding to the comments made by National People's Power Candidate Anurakumara Dissanayake that Premadasa had acted with the president, Senasinghe said that he had expressed his arrogance and disgust.

### Search resumes in Sicily yacht sinking with finance boss among missing

Specialist divers on Tuesday launched a fresh search for six people, including UK tech tycoon Mike Lynch and the chairman of Morgan Stanley International, missing since their yacht capsized off the Italian island of Sicily.

The British-flagged Bayesian, which had 22 people aboard including 10 crew, was anchored some 700 metres from port before dawn Monday when it was struck by a waterspout, a sort of mini tornado.

Fifteen people aboard, including a mother with a one-year-old baby, were plucked to safety; one man has been found dead; and six people remain missing.

On Tuesday, three divers strapped on oxygen bottles and began their descent to the wreck, some 50 metres below the sea surface.

Most of those aboard the yacht were British, and the passengers were guests of Lynch, celebrating his recent acquittal in a massive US fraud case, according to Italian media.

Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is contesting as an independent candidate, will soon release his election manifesto.

In the past, the presidential candidates have published their election manifesto but there has been a huge gap between their promises and their implementation.

Besides breaching the Trump campaign, officials also believe that Iran tried to hack into the presidential campaign of Kamala Harris.
