### ICC chief prosecutor seeks Netanyahu, Hamas leaders’ arrest

(AP) — The chief prosecutor of the world’s top war crimes court said Monday he is seeking arrest warrants for leaders of Israel and Hamas, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over actions taken during their seven-month war.

While Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, do not face imminent arrest, the announcement by the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor was a symbolic blow that deepened Israel’s isolation over the war in Gaza.

The court’s prosecutor, Karim Khan, accused Netanyahu, Gallant, and three Hamas leaders — Yehia Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh — of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel.

Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders condemned the move as disgraceful and antisemitic. U.S. President Joe Biden also lambasted the prosecutor and supported Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas.

### The Beautiful Terrible Signs: The Ongoing Saga Of Rheumatic Heart Disease

Every physician likely recalls an unforgettable moment from his or her clinical rotation as a medical student that profoundly impacted him or her, leaving an indelible mark. For me it was the encounter with a patient suffering from Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis in India. In fact, it was the presence of my larger-than-life clinical professor that made the moment even more memorable. His mesmerizing descriptions of the clinical signs, such as “opening snap,” “rumbling mid-diastolic murmur,” and “presystolic accentuation,” along with precise timing between the second heart sound and the opening snap, had elevated the experience to another level. However, amidst my fascination, I must confess, I had failed to recognize the true gravity of these signs—their reflection of extreme suffering on the part of the patient. It never even once occurred to me then that these captivating signs were, in fact, manifestations of medical failure, the root cause behind them.
