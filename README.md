### Two remarkable personalities: screenwriter and ex PM

*2024-01-21 04:51:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/two-remarkable-personalities-screenwriter-and-ex-pm/) · `en`

We Sri Lankans, in the majority are fatigued with annoyance, battling rising prices, facing a gloomy future and having to contend with capricious politicians, ineffectual MPs and religious mavericks; the last of three men performing free from constraints, guidelines and permissive interpretation of Buddhism. Thus we earnestly seek personalities or events that inspire hope and admiration. This last week I read about two persons who interested me immensely, restored hope in humanity and impacted on my emotions.

Peter Julian Robin Morgan, CBE, is my first person of interest. He was born on April 19, 1963, in Wimbledon, London, to immigrant parents: father a Jew who escaped Nazi Germany in 1933 and a Roman Catholic mother who fled Poland under the Soviets. His father died when he was nine. He grew up in London and attended two schools in London and Somerset and obtained a fine arts degree from Leeds University.

### Oil supply tightens in Europe over Red Sea disruptions

*2024-01-20 20:24:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/oil-supply-tightens-in-europe-over-red-sea-disruptions/) · `en`

The structure of the global benchmark Brent crude futures market and some physical markets in Europe and Africa have been reflecting tighter supply partly over concerns about shipping delays as vessels avoid the Red Sea due to missile and drone attacks.

The disruptions – which have been the largest to global trade since the COVID-19 pandemic – have combined with other factors such as rising Chinese demand to increase competition for crude supply that does not have to transit the Suez Canal, and analysts say this is most evident in European markets.

In a sign of tighter supply, the market structure of Brent – which is used to price nearly 80 percent of the world’s traded oil – hit its most bullish in two months on Friday, as tankers diverted from the Red Sea following recent air strikes by the United States and United Kingdom on targets in Yemen.

This piece uses the vast amount of information on the web, social-media, broadcasts and news sites. My role is to use what limited intelligence providence has endowed me with to select and filter. I hope this will be of service to readers who do not have the patience to explore all the available information themselves. Nations are fretful above all else of existential concerns, that is politics in the sense of security, not politics in the familiar but vulgar sense of endemic corruption. Once existence is assured the second matter to focus on is material wellbeing; prosperity, employment, wealth and so on broadly falling under the umbrella term ‘the economy’. My accent in this piece is on the Great Powers (America, China and Russia) though discussion of the Middle East (the Muslim World and Israel) is unavoidable.

### Sajith urges Speaker to postpone parliamentary debate on Online Safety Bill

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has written to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena urging the postponement of the upcoming parliamentary debate on the Online Safety Bill.

The Second Reading of the Online Safety Bill is scheduled for January 23 and 24, as per a decision taken by the Committee on Parliamentary Business earlier this month.

In his letter, Premadasa pointed out that, if passed, the Bill would permit the proposed Online Safety Commission and the minister in charge of the subject to exercise unlimited powers, restricting the people’s right to freedom of speech and expression.

In other countries of the world, adequate time and an opportunity to create wide public space are given before bringing forth such Bills, the opposition leader said, alleging that the government has not followed such process when presenting the Online Safety Bill.

Instead of protecting the victims of online harassment, this Bill will only serve political interests, Premadasa said further.

Globally and regionally, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decline in measles vaccination rates, resulting in a notable increase in measles cases.

Compounding this challenge, Sri Lanka has been grappling with an imported measles outbreak since May 2023, with cases predominantly reported among vaccine refusal communities and partially vaccinated individuals (aged 9 months to 3 years).

In response, the Epidemiology Unit initiated a nationwide MMR Catch-up Immunization Programme on January 6, specifically focusing on children who had missed their routine MMR vaccinations. The programme aims to ensure that children aged 9 months to 15 years have the opportunity to receive any missed routine MMR vaccinations.

This piece uses the vast amount of information on the web, social-media, broadcasts and news sites. My role is to use what limited intelligence providence has endowed me with to select and filter. I hope this will be of service to readers who do not have the patience to explore all the available information themselves. Nations are fretful above all else of existential concerns, that is politics in the sense of security, not politics in the familiar but vulgar sense of endemic corruption. Once existence is assured the second matter to focus on is material well-being; prosperity, employment, wealth and so on broadly falling under the umbrella term ‘the economy’. My accent in this piece is on the Great Powers (America, China and Russia) though discussion of the Middle East (the Muslim World and Israel) is unavoidable.

Since ‘Indian thought’ encompasses a great deal of philosophical schools and religions, including Buddhism, there is no Sinhala art which has not been shaped, one way or another, by something ‘Indian.’ So, I must be specific and quite narrow in my focus.

### Sri Lanka top doctor seeks equality in healthcare

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s health care system was hostile to sexual minorities and has institutionalised unfair treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, a top physician said Friday vowing to battle against inequalities.

The new President of the College of Physicians Upul Dissanayake told fellow doctors at his induction in Colombo on Friday that the health sector had failed to recognise diversity and there was widespread discrimination.

The majority of healthcare personnel discriminates against 12 percent of Sri Lanka’s population estimated to be from the LGBTIQ (people who have identified themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, or questioning), Dissanayake said.

He quoted a 2013 study showing that sexual minorities feared seeking help from psychiatrists or psychologists to discuss the violence they may have faced. And of those who sought assistance, 12 percent had a negative reaction from a doctor.
