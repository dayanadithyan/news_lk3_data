The establishment of the OIT, as currently proposed, poses a serious threat to Sri Lanka’s domestic industries and economic stability

Sri Lanka’s world record for corruption, nepotism and bad governance is now being elevated by the proposed setting up of an Office for International Trade (OIT) in the Economic Transformation Bill (Part (iv) Chapter XXII Clause 99 - 131. The transfer of State or National powers in the vital area of international trade to non-accountable politically appointed Board of private individuals in the OIT is indeed serious in that it has a pervasive effect on goods, services, employment, production, agriculture, phytosanitary and technical aspects health, investment, economic sovereignty, and a gamut of other factors affecting the day-to-day lives of the people.

### Unvisited places

If the executive presidency is not abolished, if the PTA stays (or is replaced by something as bad or even worse), if militarisation is not rolled back, if political monks continue to dictate terms and conditions to the country, what would system-change look like?

Sri Lanka always ranks low in the World Happiness Index; 128 out of 148 in 2024 (we rank 48 in Global Militarisation Index though, and possess the 17th largest military in the world). We are also a gloomy lot in terms of how we see the country’s future. According to a new Institute of Health Policy (IHP) poll, in May 2024, 80% of Lankan adults thought the country was heading in the wrong direction. Just 4% thought the country was on the right path; a slight improvement compared to February 2024 when 0% felt the country was on the correct track (https://ihp.lk/research-updates/number-sri-lankans-thinking-country-heading-wrong-direction-continues-increase).

An obstacle course that spanned three continents just to process something as simple as ordering dinner

I was born in Sri Lanka, live in the US, and visit my home country often. The very idea of having to get a visa to a country I lived in for a greater part of my life is discomforting. Nevertheless, in order to comply, three weeks before I travelled, I went through the process. No different from thousands of others. However this time, it turned out to be a bizarre obstacle course set up by an Indian outfit masked behind a bunch of acronyms.

### Next SL leader needs economic vision, not just debt management skills: Prof Charitha Herath

*2024-07-03 04:45:17* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Next-SL-leader-needs-economic-vision-not-just-debt-management-skills-Prof-Charitha-Herath/56-763770) · `en`

Freedom People’s Congress (FPC) member Prof. Charitha Herath has called for Sri Lanka to appoint a leader capable of managing the country’s economy, not merely its debt. Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Herath addressed the current economic situation and the forthcoming political changes.

Herath highlighted that the broad economic crisis has now evolved into a debt crisis. He criticised the prevailing focus on debt management, which he believes has led to a misconception that the ideal Presidential candidate is one who excels in debt management.

“This is wrong. No matter who is appointed, he must manage debt, but the reason for choosing a new President should not be his ability to manage debt. It should be someone with a broad vision to manage the economy,” Herath asserted.

He warned that economic management has been overshadowed by an excessive focus on debt management.

Countries such as Ghana, Jamaica and Ecuador have been in harmony with the country and the people, but the president and the government of our country have not been able to achieve such compliance.

ECONOMYNEXT — Seeking concessions on foreign loans without making any commitments is neither practical nor feasible, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said, noting that bilateral creditors never reduce the principal on a loan.

“What constitutes this foreign loan? Where do lending countries get the money? They lend us the tax money and the savings of their citizens.”
