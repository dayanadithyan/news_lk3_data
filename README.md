### Choosing between Robert Wilmot Horton and Ponnambalam Arunachalam

*2024-01-23 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Choosing-between-Robert-Wilmot-Horton-and-Ponnambalam-Arunachalam/172-275517) · `en`

Changing names of places and roads bearing the names of foreigners is common in countries that have gained independence from foreign rule. Such changes can be easily justified in some cases where the foreign ruler was despotic, but in others it may be a bit tricky as both personalities may have had significant contributions to their credit.

In most cases, the personages displaced are driven into oblivion despite their contribution to society, and erased from history.

The proposed change-over from “Horton Place” in Colombo 7 to “Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam Mawatha” is justified given the yeoman service rendered by Arunachalam to Ceylon, and the fact that he resided there.

### We need a Foolproof Mechanism for Presidential Pardon

Many hailed the recent Supreme Court ruling on the case against the granting of Presidential pardon to former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva who had been convicted for the murder of former Presidential Advisor Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8, 2011, calling it a landmark judgement. However, their stand on the mater does not seem to be so different than the decision by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to grant the pardon to Silva. Both were politically driven.

The irony of the decision by former President Rajapaksa was that at the time of the murder, both Silva and Premachandra were working closely with him, one as a monitoring MP for the Defence Ministry to which Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the Secretary, and the other as the Advisor to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on trade union affairs. However, the family of Premachandra distanced themselves from the government alleging that the government of the day was siding with Silva during the investigations.

Tapping into advanced technologies, such as all-photonics networks and quantum and edge computing, could be the linchpin in harnessing what’s beyond the horizon. Imagine a tomorrow where Sri Lanka paves its tech avenues with 5G, virtual reality, and augmented reality — a visionary dreamscape manifesting in real-time, shaking the foundations of its economic and competitive stratum

A leap into the innovation frontier has its challenges. The lack of extensive citation networks, a shortfall in venture capital funding, and skill mismatches represent the systemic constraints strangling the pipeline of creativity and opportunity. Sri Lanka stares down these bottlenecks, aware that overcoming them is a prelude to any genuine advancement in global standing

Unless that political culture is removed and replaced with a secular democratic culture there is no

hope for ethnic and religious minorities to live in Sri Lanka with dignity, freedom and justice

To the two minorities therefore the choice is starkly evident. Either they vote for a leader and party that advocates system change to bring about a new socio-economic order grounded in integrational politics, secular democracy and corruption free governance or vote for a champion of the old system that has kept the nation divided since independence, immiserised the economy and created a class of political parvenus thriving on public wealth. Alternatively, if the Tamils decide to boycott the election that would be suicidal

Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana announced a staggering 91% vaccination rate for measles among children, a crucial step in combating a recent resurgence of the disease after eradication. This achievement demonstrates the country’s dedication to proactive healthcare, he said.

Speaking at a media briefing on Monday, Dr. Pathirana outlined further health priorities for 2024. Disease prevention takes centre stage, with plans to bolster primary healthcare services and improve efficiency for patients. Prompt access to essential resources is also a key focus, he stressed.

However, tackling non-communicable diseases (NCDs) remains a major challenge. Over 20% of Sri Lankans battle diabetes, and the country holds the dubious distinction of having the highest prevalence of high blood pressure among over-35s in South Asia. Addressing these concerns and their associated complications like heart disease and stroke is critical for Sri Lanka’s long-term health, the minister said.

### Create smart roads before creating smart drivers, Anjana tells government, police

*2024-01-22 16:55:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Create-smart-roads-before-creating-smart-drivers-Anjana-tells-government-police/108-275504) · `en`

Colombo, Jan 22 (Daily Mirror) - The Inter Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) today requested the government and the police to create smart roads before creating smart drivers.

Addressing the media association's secretary, Anjana Priyanjith said the government and the police must keep in mind that they are unable to create smart drivers without having smart roads.

"We questioned the Police Department to find out and tell them whether a higher number of fatal accidents occur in Colombo town or out of Colombo. We know the cause of the fatal accidents in Colombo town. We saw the sons of VIP officials, police officers and other higher-ranking officials who used to meet with fatal accidents during the night under the influence of alcohol. We do not know whether proper legal action was taken against them," he said.

### AKD’s NPP-JVP & the Generic Left Aren’t Doing Their Best to Win

*2024-01-22 16:50:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/akds-npp-jvp-the-generic-left-arent-doing-their-best-to-win/) · `en`

The Left has the best chance of being elected to office in Sri Lanka since 1964 or 1947. That’s speculative. So let me put it more clearly. Never in my lifetime has the Left been closer to assuming governmental power by democratic means, i.e., leading the country. We have never been closer to having a left-wing leader and administration.

Society is dividing between those who think that’s a good thing and those who think it’s bad. As Mao said in his first political essay on the Peasant Movement in Hunan, opinion is divided between those who say “it’s fine” and those who say “it’s terrible”. Mao thought it was fine.

We had a similar division of opinion during the Aragalaya. Opinion remains divided about it. I was among those who said “it’s fine”. Ranil thought it was fine and then that it was terrible. The Pohottuwa thought it was terrible all along.

### A bleak forecast for 2024 and beyond : Politics (security), economics and military

*2024-01-22 16:48:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-bleak-forecast-for-2024-and-beyondpolitics-security-economics-and-military/) · `en`

This piece uses the vast amount of information on the web, social-media, broadcasts and news sites. My role is to use what limited intelligence providence has endowed me with to select and filter. I hope this will be of service to readers who do not have the patience to explore all the available information themselves. Nations are fretful above all else of existential concerns, that is politics in the sense of security, not politics in the familiar but vulgar sense of endemic corruption. Once existence is assured the second matter to focus on is material well-being; prosperity, employment, wealth and so on broadly falling under the umbrella term ‘the economy’. My accent in this piece is on the Great Powers (America, China and Russia) though discussion of the Middle East (the Muslim World and Israel) is unavoidable.

### Farmers' Frauds

*2024-01-22 16:03:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174530) · `ta`

Vavuniya District Rice Mill Owners Association President C.. Vivekanandan said.

At present, the harvest has begun and the buyers who buy paddy to the farmers are defrauding the establishment of the farmers and buying paddy to the farmers.

He pointed out that the farmers were likely to lose about 15 kilos by replacing the upper part of the scales, and that the farmers were giving the bike to the buyers and the loss of several thousand rupees because they were getting 100 and 200 rupees more than the buyers.

He has therefore asked the farmers to act very much when selling paddy.

### The mountain community looking for leaders within the parties ..!

*2024-01-22 16:00:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174528) · `ta`

In the hill country, only the party leaders are just coming up. The union does not see people leaders who talk about labor rights. Two hundred years later, no solutions about labor issues can be found, and the government's votes have been put into a very weak position.

It is amazing that those who said that milk and honey will run in the hill country. People who spoke verses on stage in cinema style have gone a long way from people. Once the election is probably declared, people will come as usual. It is now guaranteed that these people are going to make a series of mistakes to welcome them.

Labor Affairs is heading towards failure. In the negotiations, it has been revealed that more than a thousand rupees has not been complied with the company.. It is not possible even if some trade unions tried to keep the president in fear of meeting the companies directly. How are companies that do not listen to the president's work back to the trade unions that are not supportive of the people?

### Sri Lanka’s inflation rate rises to 4.2% in December

*2024-01-22 15:51:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96624/sri-lankas-inflation-rate-rises-to-42-in-december) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s consumer price inflation rate rose to 4.2% year-on-year in December from 2.8% in November, the statistics department said on Monday.

The National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) captures broader retail price inflation and is released with a lag of 21 days every month.

Food prices rose 1.6% in December after falling 2.2% in November on the year, the Department of Census and Statistics said in a statement.

Prices for non-food items, however, fell 6.3% in December from 7.1% year-on-year in November.

Sri Lanka racked up record high inflation last year after its economy was pummelled by the worst financial crisis in decades, triggered by a plunge in foreign exchange reserves.
