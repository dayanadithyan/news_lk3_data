### Debt and taxes: Can we hide our heads in the sand?

Unless we ask more and better questions of those who want to rule us, history may repeat

A few days ago, I attended the launch of a policy platform by an organisation called Piripun Deshayak where the audience included at least one Presidential Candidate. I was quite surprised that the document (and the presentations) made no mention of debt or taxes.

Saubhagyaye Dakma, the policy platform developed for Gotabaya Rajapaksa by Viyath Maga was a disaster, but it addressed both debt and taxes. That was in the good old days of 2019.

In these darker times how could anyone propose actions, including significant public investments, to make Sri Lanka a developed nation by 2040 without addressing these key issues, I wondered. Where was the money, once the debts were serviced?\

### Economic stability with SOE reforms need system change

Is there a more fundamental reason that permitted SOEs to operate without accountability, burden public finance, contribute to economic crisis and misallocation of resources?

The Head of Emerging Market Economies Johanna Chua, when commenting recently on Sri LankaтАЩs emerging economic stability under IMF direction made a crucial point that тАЬpeopleтАЭ should тАЬfeelтАЭ the stability after paying a heavy price for it. But she failed to identify those people she was referring to. IMF being an institution created by and for the affluent never cared for the poor and downtrodden. It is a class biased institution predominantly interested in maintaining the stability of the capitalist system with its financial structure.

### Israel reportedly agrees to  resume talks

Under international pressure Israel has reportedly agreed to resume talks on a solution to the Gaza crisis. Widespread support for Palestine, the ruling of the ICJ, arrest warrants sought by the ICC and US prodding have forced Israel to bend, even if only slightly.

Times of Israel (TOI) reported last week that Israel, the United States and Qatar have agreed to renew talks on a hostage deal and truce with Hamas, the paper said. Talks were suspended in April.

TOI further said that the fresh negotiations will be based on a new outline negotiated in Paris by CIA Director William Burns, Mossad Chief David Barnea, and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani.

In line with this, the Israeli war Cabinet expanded the mandate of the team negotiating a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas, TOI said.

### Overall decline in April PMI

Sri Lanka Purchasing ManagersтАЩ Index for Manufacturing (PMI тАУ Manufacturing) recorded an index value of 42.0 in April 2024, indicating a contraction in manufacturing activities following the seasonal pattern. New Orders, Production, Employment and Stock of Purchases sub-indices declined during the month, resulting in an overall decline in the index.

As per the respondents, the decline in New Orders was mainly due to the end of the festive seasonтАЩs demand, particularly for food & beverages. Further, the decrease in Production was primarily due to the fewer working days in April, as most factories were temporarily closed for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holidays. Moreover, Employment and Stock of Purchases decreased during the month, in line with the decline in New Orders and Production. Meanwhile, SuppliersтАЩ Delivery Time further lengthened in April, owing to the extended holidays in the month.
