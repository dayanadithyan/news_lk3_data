His comments are the strongest yet by any US lawmaker on the issue, while others have called for steep tariffs to keep Chinese electric vehicles (EV) out of the country.

In February, the White House said the US was opening an investigation into whether Chinese cars pose a national security risk.

"We cannot allow China to bring its government-backed cheating to the American auto industry", Senator Brown said in a video on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.

Senator Brown, who is a Democrat from the the car-producing state of Ohio, is seeking to win a fourth term in office in November's election.

### Sri Lanka Yukthiya operations leading addicts to seek Ayurveda high

ECONOMYNEXT – A shortage of drugs due to the Yukthiya crackdown has led some addicts to look for alternative medicines, State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody said.

“The shortage of pharmaceuticals has led some individuals addicted to drugs to turn to certain alternative medicines within the indigenous medical system, Jayakody said at a press briefing last week.

Sri Lanka allows cannabis to be used in the manufacture of ayurvedic medicine. Raw materials in Ayurvedic medicine include several parts of the cannabis plant, as well as abin (Papaver somniferum Linn), in herbal remedies.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that over-the-counter products available at shops that sell ayurveda products (sinhala beheth) provide varying degrees of relaxation or stimulation.

Jayakody said a written notification has been sent to Public Security Minister Tiran Alles and the Inspector General of Police regarding the challenges faced by the indigenous medical sector due to operation ‘Yukthiya’.

### Taylor Swift’s music back on TikTok after dispute

*2024-04-12 08:40:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Taylor-Swifts-music-back-on-TikTok-after-dispute/108-280638) · `en`

April 12 (BBC) - Taylor Swift's songs are back on TikTok following a dispute that led her label to stop licensing its content to the app.

Her music's return on Thursday comes ahead of the release of her new album, The Tortured Poets Department.

Universal Music pulled songs by its artists in January, including Rihanna and Ariana Grande, citing a licensing dispute.

While many of her songs - including You Belong With Me and Cruel Summer - are again available for users to add to their videos, music belonging to Universal's other artists has still not been relisted.

That may be because unlike other artists, Swift owns the copyright to her music under the terms of a 2018 deal with Universal. Some reports speculated Swift reached a separate deal with TikTok.

"Swifties" - Taylor Swift fans - took to the platform to share their delight at her music returning.

"OMG this made my whole year," wrote verified user Jessica Golich, adding that users would "have the whole new album to play with".

### Vietnamese billionaire sentenced to death for $44bn fraud

Vietnam, April 12 (BBC) - Behind the stately yellow portico of the colonial-era courthouse in Ho Chi Minh City, a 67-year-old Vietnamese property developer was sentenced to death on Thursday for looting one of the country's largest banks over a period of 11 years.

It's a rare verdict - she is one of very few women in Vietnam to be sentenced to death for a white collar crime.

The decision is a reflection of the dizzying scale of the fraud. Truong My Lan was convicted of taking out $44bn (£35bn) in loans from the Saigon Commercial Bank. The verdict requires her to return $27bn, a sum prosecutors said may never be recovered. Some believe the death penalty is the court's way of trying to encourage her to return some of the missing billions.

The habitually secretive communist authorities were uncharacteristically forthright about this case, going into minute detail for the media. They said 2,700 people were summoned to testify, while 10 state prosecutors and around 200 lawyers were involved.

Sivagnanam Sreedharan, a Jaffna MP of the Sri Lanka TNA, said that the party's decision was important while the Tamil general candidate was in principle.

He said this while commenting on attempts to stop a common candidate on behalf of the Tamil parties in the upcoming presidential election.

In the upcoming presidential election, initiatives to stop a common candidate on behalf of Tamil political parties.

At present, those who are expected to field in the presidential election do not reveal themselves as compassionate on any issues, including a solution to the ethnic problem of the Tamil people.

Therefore, supporting the Candidates of South Sri Lanka without any basics is an inappropriate endeavor. It is a suitable approach that all the Tamil parties unite and stop the general candidate.

I am in principle compliance with that effort. However, it is very important that the party needs to take a decision on the issue of the Sri Lankan Tamil party.

Colombo, April 12 (Daily Mirror) - The Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) today claimed that the National Transport Commission (NTC) has failed to provide sufficient buses for people to leave from Colombo.

The Association's Secretary Anjana Priyanjith claimed that people have to wait at the private bus stand for more than three hours to get their buses.

During previous years the NTC had discussions with private bus associations to arrange buses without inconveniencing commuters, he said.

"Earlier, we were advised to assign short-distance buses to long-distance services to meet the demand. But this time no such decision has been taken. Therefore, people have to wait many hours at the bus stand to get their transport facilities", Priyanjith said.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) said that sufficient buses were assigned for people to get to their villages.

### Appropriate moment: Sajith, Tamil party should speak with Anura- Dayan Jayatilaka

*2024-04-12 06:38:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181012) · `ta`

Diplomat Dayan Jayatilaka advises Tamil parties to engage with main rivals, Sajith and Anura, amidst Sinhalese and Buddhist communalism. He suggests against stopping a Tamil general candidate, noting the lack of public support for such a move. Despite the historical tributes by Tamil parties in presidential elections, the current attempt to unite behind a common candidate faces challenges due to differing political tendencies and the absence of unanimity. Jayatilaka emphasizes the importance of addressing long-term issues with Sajith and Anura, drawing parallels with Catalonia and Kurdishland, and advocates for strategic decision-making to leverage the current political climate.

🟩

Diplomatic Dayan Jayatilaka has said that the Tamil parties, Sajith, should carry out talks with the main rivals, as the time when the Sinhalese and Buddhist communalism, which have long been politicized at home, have been appropriate.

He also pointed out that while the political tendency of the Tamils is going on, the attempt to stop a Tamil general candidate will not be appropriate.

He said this while commenting on the Tamil political parties, which are based on the North and East, have taken a public candidate in the upcoming presidential election.

The Tamil people have carried out various tributes in the past in the presidential election. However, the tricks have not received enough reactors to the Tamil people.

Against this backdrop, Tamil political parties are trying to stop a common candidate on their next presidential election.

It is a possible strategy if all parties come forward to work together on this issue.

Several potential candidates ranging from incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe to   media magnate Dilith Jayaweera are tipped to be in the presidential fray.

Adding to this fluid state of affairs are recent attempts  by vested interests to field a “Hindu” as a common presidential candidate in the 2024 election. Even as people were becoming aware of efforts by interested parties to nominate a  Hindu  presidential candidate, the head of a  Hindu organization in Northern Sri Lanka issued a public statement calling for a common  candidate to contest the forthcoming presidential poll on behalf of all Hindus in the Island.

Real estate tycoon Truong My Lan was sentenced Thursday to death by a court in Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam in the country’s largest financial fraud case ever, state media Vietnam Net said.

The 67-year-old chair of the real estate company Van Thinh Phat was formally charged with fraud amounting to $12.5 billion — nearly 3% of the country’s 2022 GDP.

Lan illegally controlled Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank between 2012 and 2022 and allowed 2,500 loans that resulted in losses of $27 billion to the bank, reported state media VnExpress. The court asked her to compensate the bank $26.9 million.

Despite mitigating circumstances — this was a first-time offense and Lan participated in charity activities — the court attributed its harsh sentence to the seriousness of the case, saying Lan was at the helm of an orchestrated and sophisticated criminal enterprise that had serious consequences with no possibility of the money being recovered, VnExpress said.
