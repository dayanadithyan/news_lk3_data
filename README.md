### Rise in flies poses risk of diarrhoea and contagious viral fever

*2024-06-11 06:11:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Rise-in-flies-poses-risk-of-diarrhoea-and-contagious-viral-fever/108-284562) · `en`

Colombo, June 11 (Daily Mirror) - As floodwaters recede, the proliferation of flies has raised alarms among health authorities due to the increased risk of diarrhoea outbreaks and the spread of contagious viral fevers.

According to consultant Dr Deepal Perera, the abundance of organic matter in flooded areas accelerates the maturation of fly eggs, leading to a rapid increase in fly populations as floodwaters subside. These newly hatched flies, seeking food sources, often gravitate towards faeces, garbage, and contaminated surfaces, further exacerbating the health crisis.

“The consequences of the surge in fly populations are dire. Flies are notorious carriers of pathogens, including bacteria and viruses responsible for diarrheal diseases and viral fevers,” he pointed out.

“Contaminated food and water sources, when ingested, can lead to a range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, cramps, nausea (feeling an urge to vomit), and loose stools,” Dr Perera stated.

### Ransomware menace plaguing Sri Lankan businesses: Kaspersky

*2024-06-11 03:22:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Ransomware-menace-plaguing-Sri-Lankan-businesses-Kaspersky/108-284555) · `en`

A total of 2,650 ransomware incidents have been detected and blocked by Kaspersky’s cybersecurity solutions for businesses in Sri Lanka from January to December 2023, it was revealed.

Experts from the global cybersecurity company insist on organisations, regardless of shape and size, to beef up their IT security posture as ransomware, especially the targeted type, continues to be a damaging menace for organisations in the region.

“The era of widespread mass attacks by encryptors on both individuals and businesses is gradually fading away. Instead, we are witnessing a shift towards organised groups that execute hacks involving data theft and encryption, commonly referred to as double extortion.

The rationale behind this evolution lies in the perpetrators’ ability to operate with greater efficiency, thereby enabling them to demand significantly higher ransom sums,” said  Fedor Sinitsyn, Lead Malware Analyst at Kaspersky.

### Sri Lanka should separate foreign policies from borrowing policies: Dr. Devarajan

*2024-06-11 02:20:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Sri-Lanka-should-separate-foreign-policies-from-borrowing-policies-Dr-Devarajan/108-284550) · `en`

A prominent economist stressed the need for Sri Lanka to separate its foreign policies from the borrowing policies, so it does not repeat the same mistakes that have resulted in it having to grapple with high cost of debt.

Citing the government’s decision in 2019 to reject the favourable loans from the US and Japan, to choose commercial loans from China, due to the country’s lenient stance over Sri Lanka’s human rights issue, former World Bank Acting Chief Dr. Shanta Devarajan noted the move was detrimental and added to the woes of the country.

“I think this was a big mistake because it mixed up the foreign policy objectives with the economic policy objectives. You always borrow from the cheapest lender, regardless of what your foreign relations are with that country. So, Sri Lanka should keep its borrowing policy separate from its foreign policy,” asserted Dr. Devarajan.

He added that some say it is impossible to make the separation but it is possible, as in the case of Taiwan and China.

The court on January 17 quashed the clemency given by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva who had been on death row over the murder of former Presidential Advisor Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8, 2011.

Both rulings by the Supreme Court to quash the capital punishment given to Duminda Silva and Jude Shramantha Jayamaha were based on technicalities - meaning the President had failed to adhere to the proper legal procedures in granting the special Presidential Pardon.

It is essential that leadership development caters to an organisational need and is carefully planned and monitored

Effective leaders are those who enable positive people performance through role modelling, inspiring a shared vision, facilitating an environment of open and frank discussion, licensing the challenge of the status quo, enabling empowerment and decision making, and celebrating success. You do not necessarily have to be a good manager to be a good leader or vice versa. Leadership is hierarchy agnostic. In a corporate setting, leadership need not be confined to just the chief executive officer or the C-suite. It can be allowed to flourish at every level of the organisation provided the roles, and deliverables, of individuals and teams are clearly defined
