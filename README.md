### ‘The known devil’: Untangling the biased brain

A voter might favour a course of action because it aligns with their pre-existing beliefs, and not because it is necessarily the best choice – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Birds build nests. Spiders spin intricate webs. Dogs bury bones. The salmon swims upstream. Babies suckle. These are not learned behaviours. They are instincts and reflexive behaviours that we are born with. They are important because they help us adapt to our environment and to survive.

In contrast, ‘learning’ is a change in an organism’s behaviour or thought or knowledge, as a result of experience. Learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills through experience. We have learned when we have changed. But in Sri Lanka, it seems, that we never learn. This is a pithy that is often expressed.

Learning involves complex processes of conscious and unconscious processes. If you have tried to learn a new language or a skill like playing a musical instrument, you will know that learning is not always easy and that outcomes vary.

### Role of second preference: a simulation of 2024 Presidential election in Sri Lanka

*2024-09-20 05:49:52* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Role-of-second-preference-a-simulation-of-2024-Presidential-election-in-Sri-Lanka/4-766924) · `en`

It will be wise to mark a second preference in this election – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Sri Lanka awaits the election of its 10th President in a political landscape that has not been seen before in history. For the first time, at least three frontrunners are contending for the presidency – as opposed to the usual bi-candidate race – with a certain possibility of none achieving an over-half majority vote. This new structure of contest has affected many socio-political dimensions of the election.

However, in this article, we wish to focus on how the presence of more than two major candidates would affect the existing voting system and the mathematics governing its outcome. This simulation – rather than a modelling to predict the next president of Sri Lanka – is a critique of the systems designed to measure our social choice, their strengths and limitations in upholding the fundamental notions of democracy.
