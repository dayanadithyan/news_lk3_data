It was only after I saw thousands of Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãwho lost their homes as an unexpected violence that had been unleashed on the morning of Monday 25th, and I decided to record the events in the quarter.

Many people lost their loved ones, and many were killed by Sinhalese.

I am going to inform you about the things that took place at this camp and my personal experiences before sheltering at the Ratmalana Airport.

I am going to share their experiences with other refugees in this camp.

I went to my office in Maharagama. I went to the bus station on the road.

(Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, while a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed her taking a marginal lead over her Republican rival.

In a 17-minute speech, Harris aggressively went after Trump‚Äôs vulnerabilities, comparing her background as a former prosecutor to his record as a convicted felon.

Harris ticked through a list of liberal priorities, saying that if elected she would act to expand abortion access, make it easier for workers to join unions and address gun violence, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump, the Republican nominee for president in the Nov. 5 election.

‚ÄúDonald Trump wants to take our country backward,‚Äù she told a cheering crowd of several thousand at West Allis Central High School in a Milwaukee suburb in Wisconsin, a battleground state with a pivotal role in deciding the election outcome.

### 41 years ago, the Sinhala Buddhist chauvinist policies responsible for the Black July are the cause of the military occupation of today- Pearl.

*2024-07-24 12:11:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189249) ¬∑ `ta`

In 1983, the Sinhala Buddhist majority's policies sparked the Black July massacre, leading to ongoing military occupation and economic exclusion of Tamils in Sri Lanka. The event, commemorated by the Pearl Organization alongside global Tamils, highlights the enduring impact of Sinhalaism on Tamil rights and safety. Despite calls for reconciliation and accountability, including at the UN Human Rights Council, little has changed for Tamils, who face continued marginalization and lack of justice. The organization advocates for international support and self-determination for the Tamil people.

üü©

The Sri Lankan government has said that the same Sinhala Buddhist majority policy is due to the Sri Lankan government's land grabbing military occupation and economically exclusion, the same Sinhala Buddhist policy that has led to the riots.

To commemorate the 41st anniversary of the Black July, the Pearl Organization is joining Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãaround the world to commemorate the victims of the planned massacre against Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãtoday.

Moreover, Sinhalaism, which is responsible for violence, is trying to investigate how to influence the current events, as well as the Tamil nation.

After the independence of 1948, Sinhala Buddhist chauvinism was rapidly rooted in the structure of Sri Lanka.

The abolition of the rights of Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãand national communal rhetoric led to many anti -Tamil massacres.

Black July is one of the most ruthless horrible massacre that took place before the war.

Bangladesh partially restored telecommunication services on Wednesday although Internet connection was slow and social media remained suspended, days after deadly protests against reservations for government jobs killed almost 150 people.

The country has mostly been calm since Sunday when the Supreme Court scaled down reservations for various categories to 7 percent, overruling a high court verdict reinstating a 56 percent quota in government jobs that had been scrapped in 2018.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina‚Äôs government said on Tuesday that it would heed the Supreme Court ruling.

As demonstrations against the quotas ¬†which included a 30 percent reservation for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan ¬†tapered off, the government started easing the curfew imposed last week.

Restrictions will be relaxed for seven hours on Wednesday and offices will also be open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., officials said.

Minister of Trade Nalin Fernando has stated that it is possible to reduce the retail price of an egg to Rs. 40.

He warned that if egg producers fail to reduce prices for the festive season, the government will once again resort to importing eggs from India.

The minister further stated that the egg prices have suddenly dropped by Rs. 6 and that he will thoroughly look into this by obtaining reports from the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA).

He expressed concerns stating that if an egg cannot be sold for at least Rs. 40, they would have to import eggs from India. He pointed out that during the festival season in December, cake manufacturers will also be purchasing a large quantity of eggs.

Therefore, he emphasized that if the egg prices are not reduced by then, the government will have to import eggs or ensure customer protection by providing eggs at the correct price.

### If AKD Is Going To Be Another Political Leader?

The major argument of this article is to discuss whether Anura Kumara Dissanayake‚Äôs political path is suitable for the socio-political recovery in Sri Lanka. Apparently, he seems to be a possible candidate for the forthcoming presidential election because of his long-term political experiences as a member of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. But is it enough to be a leader of this fallen land? This land is at present going through different crises. It is in chaos. There is no point in becoming a microphone-political-leader who addresses people with heavy arguments. That is an outdated tradition, which has no sense at all.

It is so easy to speak with so many rosy words and please people with different tongues. The majority of citizens of this land are fond of jokes but never listen to concrete discussions that lead to being better countrymen. Most of the people live in an illusion. Myths are the way of life that they deserve always. This is Sri Lanka!
