We have a candidate in the form of Sajith Premadasa who will be backed by many at a Presidential poll. We also have a good team which could emerge victorious at a General election. Therefore, we in the SJB are ready for any election,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe have called for the holding of a General and Presidential elections simultaneously in an earlier instance as well. We therefore, reiterate our stand that both elections should be held simultaneously. There seems to be no legal barrier for such an eventuality,‚Äù he added.
