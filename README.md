ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka hopes to resume talks with bondholders after the International Monetary Fund assesses their latest proposal of the ad hoc group that deals with the country, State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe said.

Sri Lanka initiated the first round of face-to-face discussions with bondholders in March where proposals and counter proposals were exchanged and agreement was reached to issue bonds linked to economic performance.

However, Sri Lanka had not agreed to the triggers nor the actual quantum of upside and the latest April proposal had not been assessed by the International Monetary Fund to ensure whether it was in line with a debt sustainability assessment. Their earlier proposal in March was assessed to be insufficient.

‚ÄúThe next steps would entail further consultation with the IMF staff regarding assessments of the compatibility of the latest proposals with program parameters,‚Äù Semasinghe said.

### Tensions in Gulf could hurt Ceylon Tea cuppa: Industry

Says worsening situation in Gulf could immediately put a strain on tea prices

Tea Board says industry has not officially shared any concerns as yet

The mounting tensions in the Middle East that are becoming increasingly unpredictable are likely to impact the Ceylon Tea cuppa, the industry stakeholders said, especially since over 50 percent of the island nation‚Äôs tea is exported to that region.

While the issues stemming from the Red Sea attack have already impacted the industry with longer delivery time and higher freight costs, new issues such as closure of airspace among others could add to the woes.

‚ÄúContinuity of this would mean restricted movement of people, sending out samples and getting orders. As long as the sea is open, things should be okay.

Colombo, April 18 (Daily Mirror) - The Police department has decided to enhance crime detection by integrating public and private CCTV camera systems with the Police CCTV camera system, a senior police officer said.

In the initial stage, around 2000 CCTV cameras from private entities, including residences in Colombo city, will be linked to the police's camera network.

This initiative will be carried out in collaboration with interested participants. Individuals and private companies with CCTV systems are encouraged to connect their cameras to the Police CCTV system in Colombo, the official said.

As the second stage, steps will be taken to integrate the police camera system with cameras across the country.

While there is a notable presence of cameras in homes and private establishments in Colombo, their current impact on crime prevention is deemed minimal. The police department has only 176 CCTV cameras.

Accordingly, direction has been issued to implement the programme as soon as possible.

To cover up the reality, over-emphasis is placed to indicate that Sri Lankans are provided with too many subsidies and¬†living beyond their means but a blind eye is turned to corruption and lack of governance

Lack of governance and corruption is so mainstream, even after the current IMF program is implemented, such corrupt practices are continuing and this was highlighted in the Parliament as well. It‚Äôs no wonder, the implementation of the anti-corruption bill is progressing at a snail‚Äôs pace

Corruption and investment have been synonymous in Sri Lanka for decades as investments paved the way for corrupt politicians and their close associates to embezzle public funds with ease. In a country where the term ‚Äúgovernance‚Äù was used as a shield to cover corruption, hardly any room was left for transparency to play a role.

Katchatheevu is an uninhabited island-now in a sea of controversy-and sandwiched between India and Sri Lanka in the Palk Bay

In the matter of Kachchativu too, it could have been taken before the ICJ or an Arbitration Tribunal, as in the case of the Rann of Katch dispute between India and Pakistan

Article 15 of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, sets out the criteria for delimitation of the territorial sea between states with opposite or adjacent coasts

Many studies have documented the tremendous wage gains that migrant workers experience across borders.; however, it is also well understood that these riches come at a price and migrant stories of abuse are common knowledge

The 2022 Football World Cup in Qatar centered the world‚Äôs attention on the abuse faced by thousands of primarily South Asian migrant construction workers. The spectacle was a rare opportunity to press the case for reform not just in Qatar, but across many Gulf-region governments whose glittering skylines conceal a staggering amount of migrant abuse. Yet, just as the fervour of fair weather football fans has waned, so too have international outrage and promises of reform.

While President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the splintered Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) government and opposition parties are focusing on the elections, what election should be held or when and on what basis, more attention needs to be given to vital issues relating to Mother Earth, as the world marks Mother Earth day on Monday, April 22.

In a statement, the United Nations said that Mother Earth is clearly urging a call to action. Nature is suffering. Oceans are being filled with plastic and turning more acidic. Extreme heat, wildfires and floods have affected millions of people.

Climate change, human-made changes to nature, as well as crimes that disrupt biodiversity, such as deforestation, land-use change, intensified agriculture and livestock production or the growing illegal wildlife trade, can accelerate the speed of destruction of the planet.

Every stable democracy needs a political and ideological centre. In Ceylon/Sri Lanka, the political Centre as distinct from the Right and Left was always identified with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) founded by SWRD Bandaranaike.

When he crossed the floor in Parliament in 1951, leaving DS Senanayake‚Äôs UNP government he was followed by only one MP, DA Rajapaksa, Mahinda‚Äôs father.

When the SLFP or a faction of it shifted Right and went into alliance with Ranil Wickremesinghe‚Äôs UNP in 2005, Mahinda continued the centrist tradition (which he sincerely thought to be ‚Äòleft‚Äô). The SLFP‚Äôs successor party the SLPP, founded with Mahinda as leader, continued the centrist tradition, however distorted and wayward, until Gotabaya‚Äôs nomination in 2019.

Sri Lanka may reach a deal with investors to restructure its $12 billion in defaulted global bonds by mid-May, according to strategists at Standard Chartered.

The South Asian nation has been hoping to reach a deal in the next few weeks, though the first round of direct talks with dollar bondholders failed to yield a breakthrough. The remaining disagreements relate to the structure of ‚Äúmacro-linked‚Äù bonds, an instrument proposed by bondholders, whose payout would vary depending on the nation‚Äôs economic performance.

‚ÄúWe think timelines are critical and expect an agreement by mid-May,‚Äù strategists including Shankar Narayanaswamy wrote in a note.

Further delays would take the talks too close to the planned presidential elections, Standard Chartered said.
