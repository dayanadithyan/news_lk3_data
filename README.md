Prisoner Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera, a social miscreant and public provocateur in saffron robes, who was condemned by a Colombo High Court Magistrate to four years rigorous imprisonment with an additional fine of Rs. 100,000, had been released on bail after intense pressure from Buddhist prelates and the Sinhala Buddhist supremacist organisation Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) whose Secretary General happens to be this notorious prisoner. His release is the latest victory for political Buddhism, a deviant creed drawn up by a group of Buddhist monks, which in course of time became a vote winner in almost every election in Sri Lanka.

In a country like Sri Lanka, where ethno-nationalist politics has polarised the communities and made them see each other as enemies, we need a new language to talk about our political future under a framework of devolution which emphasises inclusiveness rather than exclusiveness

Devolution of power to regions is essential for a democratic society. However, as Rosa Luxemburg warned, national self-determination can be a dangerous distraction from the imperative to collaborate with labour movements. Sri Lanka faces a severe economic crisis, debt burden, and exploitation of labour and natural resources by multinational corporations and governments. The marginalised, such as workers, peasants, plantation workers, women, LGBT+ individuals, and oppressed castes, are the most affected. The Alliance, as a progressive movement, ought to address fundamental issues such as devolution of powers and class, caste, and gender divisions, as well as exploitation and dispossession, to unite the people
