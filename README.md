A similar injunction was also issued against the SLFP Acting General Secretary Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala.

### TISL challenges appointment of CIABOC Director General in Supreme Court

Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) has filed a Fundamental Rights Petition (SC FR 110/2024) in the Supreme Court, challenging the appointment of W. Kanishka D. Wijeratne as the Director General (DG) of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC).

Wijeratne, who had previously served as the DG of CIABOC since January 2020, was reappointed to the same position on 2 April 2024, following the enactment of the new Anti-Corruption Act.

TISL’s petition contends that Wijeratne’s appointment violates provisions of the Anti-Corruption Act, and lacks procedural integrity and transparency. TISL requests the Supreme Court to nullify the appointment or alternatively direct the authorities to remove Wijeratne and appoint a new DG in accordance with the law.

The petition further argues that he does not meet all statutory requirements and criteria for the DG role.

the Sri Lankans who are recovering from the economic crisis has been severely affected by their food coping strategies

Pulses, which are high in the quality and quantity of protein, make up only 8% of the nation’s protein intake

Sri Lanka depends significantly on pulse imports, yet there is a sizeable gap in the total pulse supply to meet the dietary needs of the population

Given the current level of pulse production in Sri Lanka, the immediate goal should be to improve local production gradually while filling gaps in supply to achieve dietary requirements through imports

Long-term strategies must focus on coordinated efforts involving policy support, research and extension, and market and demand considerations

### True value of Ceylon Cinnamon

*2024-05-08 00:18:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/True-value-of-Ceylon-Cinnamon/4-761522) · `en`

Everything needs to have a reason, framed in its purpose. Without reason and purpose, life and everything that is part of living decays into meaninglessness. Mark Twain brilliantly explained, “The two most important days in life are the day you were born and the day you find out why.” That truth applies as much to life as to business. There was a time – when it was thought private enterprise – businesses pursuing their own interests – would contribute to a better outcome for society as a whole. It was thought that individuals in pursuit of profit would inadvertently contribute to the economic well-being of society as a whole.

### Religious misrepresentation and Israeli bloodlust in Rafah

*2024-05-08 00:03:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Religious-misrepresentation-and-Israeli-bloodlust-in-Rafah/172-282113) · `en`

Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for the obliteration of Rafah, Deir al-Balah, and Nuseirat.

In the dark ages one could, to an extent excuse bloodlust and calls for the eradication of an entire race of a particular people. People of that day and age were primitive. Bloodthirsty men of the cloth called for the eradication of particular peoples whom they saw as their enemies. They used God’s name as a cover for their hatred.

The fear of so-called ‘Holy men’ who had private discourses with the deities led them to follow the dictates of those crazed characters.

So it is quite surprising, to hear modern-day rulers of Israel spout blood-thirsty calls for the killing of an entire people -in today’s context the Palestinians- because of what some misguided old men called for in bygone ages.

Israel’s Finance Minister was referencing passages in Israel’s ‘Holy  Book’ where early religious leaders called for the total destruction of  the Amalek people.

### Lady picking pockets-symptoms of wider social malaise - EDITORIAL

Two days ago this newspaper highlighted the story of a Woman Police Constable (WPC) being arrested for picking the handbag of a shopper in Kandy. Not many of us citizens were shocked or dumbfounded. After all, this was ‘merely’ a case of a so-called ‘law keeper’ breaking a law.

We as a nation know how our country’s leaders brought our people and the nation to a position of bankruptcy through corrupt practices. The political leaders of this country are not much different from political leaders in even the richest country in the world.

During the era of prohibition in the United States, the infamous US criminal Al Capone rose to success on the back of the Temperance Movement. On January 16, 1919 prohibition was passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives.

### How wheeler-dealing over visa  could  kill tourism’s golden goose

If the Government of Sri Lanka desires to streamline the inefficient and corruption-laden immigration and emigration authorities, one can’t find fault.

The Immigration Department is infested with crooks that have fought against even the most innocuous measures of oversight and accountability. CCTV cameras purchased to install in its head-office are still stored in the warehouses for six years, the Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts (CoP) found recently.

But, a controversial and unsolicited tender that awarded the monopoly of visa processing to a private contractor, VSF Global -- which overnight doubled the on-arrival visa fees, unleashed chaos and confusion at the airport, and risked the future of the tourism industry in the country--smack of a scam far extraordinary or grand incompetence, and most likely both.

Colombo, May 07 (Daily Mirror) -  In a bid to mitigate the pharmaceutical drugs abuse menace, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) will back police and excise officials to identify and crackdown the trends of misusing psychoactive medicines.

In a move to make the law enforcement officials aware, the NMRA organized a special programme last week to educate the psychoactive substances, which are prescribed as medicinal drugs for various ailments.

A senior NMRA official told the Daily Mirror that under the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) four pharmaceutical drugs were included in its act through Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drug Act (Amendment) No 41 of 2022.

The mentioned drugs identified as Diazepam, Tramadol, Pregabalin and Gabapentin are regularly used to treat anxiety, seizures, epilepsy, alcohol withdrawals and neuropathic pains.

Colombo, May 7 (Daily Mirror) - Defence Secretary General Kamal Gunaratne requested Sri Lanka's war heroes not to become victims of human smugglers who are recruiting people to serve in the armed forces on the Russian-Ukrain war front.

He revealed that Sri Lanka's war heroes are being lured by false promises to join the armed forces in the Russia-Ukrain conflict.

"These promises include offers of land in Saint Petersburg, Russian citizenship for their families and monthly salaries exceeding Rs.1 million. However, these promises remain unfulfilled, with no compensation provided for deceased war heroes and their families. Many Sri Lankan soldiers have already been sent to the conflict zone, resulting in casualties and injuries, whose extent remains unknown.

Gunaratne clarified that these soldiers were not legally recruited but rather coerced into serving as mercenaries. He urged war heroes to avoid falling prey to these human smugglers.

### Suicide, again?

*2024-05-07 23:06:32* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Suicide-again/14-761509) · `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe expects Lankan rupee to appreciate further and reach 280 per dollar by June. Namal Karunaratna, a leading light of the NPP/JVP, states that rupee will start sliding soon, reaching 400-500 per dollar. He dismisses the rupee’s strong performance as a fluke caused by a recent spate of dollar loans.

Karunaratne’s analysis is wrong. The rupee is gaining mainly due to the boom in tourism and influx of foreign remittances. As some independent analysts have pointed out, the value of the rupee could fall in the second half of the year if vehicle imports are allowed. But the rupee would plunge to the depths of Karunaratne’s expectations only if the Wickremesinghe administration makes a Gotabaya-style error.

### Fleas dream of buying a new dog

Up to this day, we are nowhere near a “broad social dialogue” or a “listening campaign for an inclusive economic recovery”

In the unfolding saga of our sovereign default, three ‘economists’ who aren’t even faintly associated with power politics have made candid assessments of our debt predicament.

In their own inimitable fashion, they have implored that we abandon ‘reckless fantasy’ and come to grips with real, brutal truth.

Quite early on, Professor Premachandra Athukorala of the Australian National University produced a study “Sovereign Debt Crisis of Sri Lanka” – its causes, policy responses and prospects with Swarnim Wagle of the UNDP regional office Asia Pacific.

“Sri Lanka is in the midst of an unfolding economic crisis, the depth of which is yet to be seen,” he prophesied in August 2022.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe warned the public that the country could go back to the 2022 crisis if any future government changes the current International Monetary Fund (IMF) subscribed economic policies reforms.

Weerasinghe said there is hardly any space for economic policy maneuvering under the current situation, but there could be a few adjustments without changing the overall goals, which President Ranil Wickremesinghe government had agreed with the IMF.

Sri Lanka is in a recovery path after it entered into an IMF deal with some difficult reforms including higher taxes, steep cut in expenditure on government institutions, drastic reforms in state-owned enterprises, and stable inflation-targeted monetary policy.

“We need to continue the same process going forward and if there is a deviation, that would be a challenge. That’s the important message we want to give,” Weerasinghe told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo on Tuesday.

### Do not tell the companies to leave the gardens because of the salary - Mano Ganesan

*2024-05-07 16:43:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/182906) · `ta`

Mano Ganesan advises against companies taking over gardens due to unpaid salaries, emphasizing alternative actions by the government and the Minister of Labor. He warns against dividing supporters by handing over gardens to companies, advocating for land rights and making people small plantation entrepreneurs. He references Sajith Premadasa's 2019 election manifesto, which aimed to turn plantation workers into small estate owners, ensuring their livelihoods and protecting gardens until a government solution is found.

🟩

If President Ranil Wickremesinghe has not been able to pay the salary announced on the May Day platform, he must take an alternative action as the head of state.. The Minister of Labor, who declared the Gazette, should take action. The government in the state should stop the sports of friends in the state, the fireworks exploding and the pongal rice.. If we ask for our cooperation in this regard, we will consider it positively.

But I warmly tell the mountain friends in the state not to present the slogan, "Gardens should be handed over to the government and go to the companies". If the company goes to the company and the government takes responsibility for the land, they will be divided to their supporters. This is how the people of the government and the government of the government today have been issued without listening and our people who lived there are in the middle of the country.
