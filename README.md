### She Walked Gently Into The Night: A Tribute To Roma De Zoysa

I did not know Roma de Zoysa prior to my arriving in Southern California. But her impeccable pedigree, which needed no exaggeration, had been a subject of many a conversation that occurred in the Los Angeles circles. When I met her for the first time, the immediacy of her presence was no surprise either. The impression she created has been embedded in me never to fade away, ever.

Roma‚Äôs journey of life through nine decades on earth has been one that most Ceylonese ladies would compete enviably to share; born into one of the most prestigious and elite Down-South families, Roma, amongst mostly men, led not only her own life in her own terms but also influenced a then patriarchal social environment with stoicism of a man and elegance of a graceful lady. She could not let a social event occur without her serene intervention nor could she wait without contributing her mite which was of enormous magnitude in material finesse and spiritual guidance.

*2024-06-27 17:56:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187115) ¬∑ `ta`

In Sri Lanka, state-supported anti-religious minority activities have escalated, with police involvement. The U.S. highlighted these issues in its 2023 religious freedom report. Local majority communities claim state backing for violent incidents against religious minorities, especially Christians and Muslims. Christian groups allege harassment and restrictions on religious practices, with the National Christian Swiss Coalition Organization (NCEASL) reporting police and state official interference. Civil activists and media report arrests of Tamil National People's Front supporters for peaceful protests and ongoing surveillance and harassment of Muslims post-2019 Easter Sunday attacks. The government is accused of viewing Muslim and Christian communities as threats to Sinhala Buddhist dominance, leading to legal controls and arrests under the ICCPR law. Religious transaction registrations are criticized for being arbitrary, with NCEASL reporting nine incidents against Muslims and 13 against Hindus. Concerns also arise over the Presidential Secretariat for Archaeological Traditional Management potentially leading to land grabs in Tamil and Muslim areas.
