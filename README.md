In a significant move to improve the living conditions of those residing in estate housing areas, the Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved directing the Legal Draftsman to drafting a new Bill aimed at converting estate housing areas into villages.

The move aims to ensure that residents of estate line rooms receive the same level of services and dignity as those living in villages.

“Currently, residents of estate houses and line rooms in estate areas are not adequately provided with rural-level services by State institutions. The new law seeks to amalgamate these estate houses and line rooms into villages, thereby ensuring they are treated with dignity and respect,” Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.

Professor GL Peiris criticizes the delay in deciding the presidential election timeline, questioning the president's term length due to legal ambiguity. Former President Maithripala Sirisena seeks clarification from the Supreme Court regarding his term under the 19th Amendment. A High Court ruling on the president's term leads to a call for suspending the election due to a constitutional conflict. Despite efforts, it's deemed impossible to finalize the draft on the president's term within the required timeframe.

🟩

Professor GL Peiris, a representative of the Independent People's Council and Independent Opposition MP, said that this is a waste of time.

Speaking at the postponement of the postponement debate on the presidential election in a timely manner in accordance with the legal arrangements in Parliament on Thursday (11), he said.

With the Supreme Court clearly issuing a clear regard to the president's tenure, is the president's tenure for five years?Or six years?That is explored.

Former President Maithripala Sirisena has sought the Supreme Court on his tenure.

The 19th Amendment of the Constitution was passed only after Maithripala Sirisena was elected president. The Supreme Court has given the Supreme Court that its arrangements will be considered the basic law of the country after the implementation of this amendment.

### National Chamber of Exporters expresses concern over Customs disruptions

*2024-07-12 01:46:13* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/National-Chamber-of-Exporters-expresses-concern-over-Customs-disruptions/56-764177) · `en`

National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) said yesterday that the recent actions taken by the Sri Lanka Customs Officers’ Union, including a two-day “sick leave” campaign and work-to-rule initiatives, have had profound implications across Sri Lanka’s business community, particularly affecting exporters and importers. It said these actions were initiated due to perceived grievances and unmet demands from the Customs Officers’ Union on various issues.

NCE President Jayantha Karunaratne highlighted the significant disruptions caused by these actions. He emphasised that the work-to-rule approach has resulted in substantial delays in clearing imported goods at ports and checkpoints, causing disruptions in production schedules and logistical operations. These delays have particularly impacted exporters, who face stringent deadlines to fulfil international orders, leading to strained relationships with overseas buyers and potential financial penalties for missed deliveries.

### Is excessive board interference killing executive spirit?

Management’s role is to manage, and the board’s role is to oversee without killing the innovative spirit of management

Whilst in law, and on paper, a board is superior in rank to management, it is important that a board must never make the management feel inferior. Directors and executives must cohabit on a platform of collaboration, trust, and respect. The board-management relationship must be positioned as a value creating partnership where the board is humble in displaying some subservience to management’s technical, functional, and integrating expertise in running the company and the management appreciates the board’s advisory, guidance, governance, and oversight roles in increasing stakeholder value. A shared vision is vital and will result in management accepting the board’s untethered authority over selected aspects of the company

### That regional carrot of doing good and being best

In addition to pressures of acquiring customers, there are also the stringent compliance regulations from these blocs

The EU and the US disburse significant amounts of money under the banner of doing good, and often mandate local partners with no subject matter expertise to drive programs on mental and sexual health, child welfare, nutrition and employee rights that do more damage than good to the future of our nation. When these are married to local individuals and organisations that give scant regard to the nation, its people and future; the outcomes can be perilous

The European Union and the US are amongst preferred export destinations, but winning buyers from these markets do not come easy. In addition to pressures of acquiring customers, there are also the stringent compliance regulations from these blocs. Hypocrisy and geo-political powerplay is rife, but cracks are slowly but surely beginning to show.

### Change, system or the people?

*2024-07-12 01:02:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Change-system-or-the-people/4-764161) · `en`

Whether a nation with this record can find the balance after a summersault of an attempted system change, only history will tell

From 1948, it has been an endless series of missteps, reflecting a national temperament which urges the path of backwardness and poor productivity. The emphasis was not on becoming a stronger or a wealthier nation, but on a hazy idea that all our ills are due to the nastiness of the system, there is this wealth somewhere in the country which should be distributed equally! A system must be created that feeds all the braggarts and the laggards (our Parliamentarians have already done this by voting in all kinds of benefits for themselves!)

A spectre is haunting Sri Lanka – the spectre of the NPP/JVP.

All powers of old Sri Lanka have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: A President without a popular mandate, a Government lacking credibility, political parties with tired faces, and businessmen with dark histories.

### Questions over the term of the President

*2024-07-12 00:57:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Questions-over-the-term-of-the-President/4-764160) · `en`

Unsurprisingly the SC has dismissed the Fundamental Rights petition requesting the Supreme Court to hold that the President has a term of six years, in limine. Reportedly, the SC has found no merit in the petition.

If the term of office of the President had been interpreted to be six years, as the petitioner had sought, it would no doubt have been expressly in violation of the Constitutional provisions, limiting the President’s term to five years, introduced by the 19th Amendment.

What the petitioner had pleaded for was sort of a judicial review of post-enactment legislation by the Supreme Court, a power which the SC is not vested with under the Constitution of Sri Lanka. It could hardly be surmised that the SC could arrogate to itself a power that is not vested in it by invoking any other doctrines of law, including inherent jurisdiction. However, the power of interpretation of the Constitution that lies with the SC is a power that it can use as it may deem fit.

ECONOMYNEXT  Sri Lanka’s National Water Supply and Drainage Board is considering to go with smart water meters to cut down expensive wage paid for 1,100 manual water readers, Water Supply Minister Jeevan Thondaman said.

“They are paid 150,000 rupees a month. It is higher than my salary of 76,000 rupees. They work almost four days in a month,” the Minister told a Foreign Correspondent Association (FCA) Forum in Colombo late on Wednesday.

“So now we are considering to fix 600,000 smart water meter within the next two years.”

He said smart meters will give accurate and clear data while reducing the room for corruption.

Thondaman’s new move comes as the government is in the process of rationalizing all the expenditures on state-owned enterprises.

Under President Ranil Wickremesighe’s government, the NWSDB’s monthly loss of 2.3 billion rupees has turned into the same amount of monthly profit, Thondaman said.
