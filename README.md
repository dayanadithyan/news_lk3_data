To address the complexities involved in Ranil Wickremesinghe's potential candidacy and the challenges he faces, let's break down the key points:



1. **Economic Recovery and Debt Restructuring**: The agreements with Paris and Beijing mark a crucial step in Sri Lanka's journey towards economic recovery. However, the road ahead is long, requiring careful management and implementation of the agreed terms. Wickremesinghe's experience and leadership during previous economic crises position him uniquely to navigate these challenges.



2. **Presidential Election Dynamics**: The upcoming election is shaping up to be a contest of personalities and policies. Wickremesinghe's track record, especially in handling the current economic crisis, sets him apart from other contenders. His ability to lead during difficult times and his plans for economic revival are likely to be central themes in his campaign.



3. **Public Perception and Support**: Wickremesinghe's success in the election hinges on his ability to connect with the populace, particularly the impoverished majority whose lives have been significantly impacted by the economic crisis. His campaign must focus on tangible improvements in their living conditions and clear communication of his vision for Sri Lanka's economic future.



4. **Challenges and Criticisms**: While Wickremesinghe has demonstrated resilience and leadership, he must also address criticisms and challenges head-on. This includes ensuring that the benefits of the economic recovery plan trickle down to all segments of society, addressing the root causes of poverty, and managing expectations effectively.



5. **Strategic Campaigning**: For Wickremesinghe to secure victory, his campaign must emphasize his experience, leadership qualities, and a clear roadmap for economic recovery. Leveraging his past successes and addressing the current economic challenges directly will be crucial. Additionally, highlighting his commitment to transparency, accountability, and inclusivity can help build trust with voters.



In conclusion, Ranil Wickremesinghe's potential candidacy for the presidency of Sri Lanka is fraught with opportunities and challenges. His ability to steer the country through economic turmoil, coupled with a strategic campaign that addresses the needs and aspirations of the Sri Lankan people, will be pivotal in determining his electoral success.

### Interim order issued against DayasiriтАЩs expulsion from SLFP

The Colombo District Court has issued an interim order against the Sri Lanka Freedom PartyтАЩs (SLFP) decision to expel MP Dayasiri Jayasekara from party membership and the post of General Secretary, Ada Derana reporter said.

Jayasekara, who was the former General Secretary of the SLFP, had sought an order revoking the decisions taken by the party to oust him from the position he held within the party.

Jayasekara had filed the complaint before the Colombo District Court, challenging the decision taken by the SLFP to expel him as the partyтАЩs General Secretary and a letter directed by the partyтАЩs then chairman Maithripala Sirisena which mentioned that a disciplinary inquiry would be conducted against Jayasekara and asked him to provide excuses to defend himself.

On September 05, 2023, MP Dayasiri Jayasekara was ousted from the SLFP with immediate effect and he was stripped of his position as the partyтАЩs general secretary.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka has recorded a 706 million US dollar current account surplus in the first quarter of 2024 as the financial account recorded a deficit amid private and official debt repayments and reserve collections, data show.

Sri Lanka has recorded current account surpluses, since the last quarter of 2022 when monetary stability is reached.

The current account is a mirror image of the financial and capital accounts, subject to errors and omissions.

The way external accounting is calculated, only the balance of payments surplus and deficit (as defined) can be accurately measured.

Whether there is a balance of payments deficit or surplus depends on the note-issue activities of the central bank.

When money is printed through reverse repo or standing facilities, regardless of a budget deficit or surplus, there are foreign exchange shortages, making it difficult to make foreign payments, especially in the capital account, leading to a run down of reserve and eventual default.
