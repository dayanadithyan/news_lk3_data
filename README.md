JVP leader Anura Kumaratisanayake has said that we will ensure the legitimate right to the power of the Tamil people who have been denied by the rulers for many years.

"We believe in the party that we can build a permanent solution to the ethnic problem of Sri Lanka," he said.

He said the provincial council should not be a permanent decision by the provincial council, but the Tamil people think that it is their right.

Can you make it clear that there is no response from the National People's Power on the 13th Amendment to the Constitution?

We have repeatedly informed our position on the 13th Amendment and Provincial Councils.

We have also mentioned this in our policy document released in 2019.

We do not consider the provincial council as a complete solution to the country's ethnic problem, but the provincial councils have been in the upper country for the past three decades.

The people of the North East consider their victory as provincial councils after years of request.

### Unveiling the dark reality: Sri Lanka’s deepening drug crisis

*2024-04-28 06:53:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/unveiling-the-dark-reality-sri-lankas-deepening-drug-crisis/) · `en`

Robert Frost once wrote, ‘Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.’ It’s a place like Hotel California in the popular Eagles song by that name — you can check out any time you like but you can never leave.

It’s all about family. The prodigal son or daughter can return. And when they do, other residents cannot pack their bags and leave, however distasteful the returnee has turned out to be or the returning is.

And even if they are far away, ‘family’ remains, in our thoughts and in our hearts, whether they are ‘prodigal’ or not. Indeed, while there are degrees of prodigality or extravagant behaviour that displease friends and relatives, few things can make people grieve as extreme addiction to narcotics and alcohol. It is a ‘family matter’ unlike anything else. It is in fact a household matter wherever the addict may reside.

### Sri Lanka’s Political Landscape: Navigating A Tripartite Contest

*2024-04-28 05:04:35* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/sri-lankas-political-landscape-navigating-a-tripartite-contest/) · `en`

As Sri Lanka braces itself for a pivotal presidential election, the specter of a tripartite contest looms large, promising both challenges and opportunities for the nation’s political future. Against a backdrop of delayed and cancelled elections, disillusionment with traditional political parties, and socioeconomic turmoil exacerbated by the global pandemic, the stage is set for a seismic shift in the country’s power dynamics.

The protracted postponements of provincial and local government elections have fuelled public frustration and eroded trust in the democratic process. The vacuum created by these delays has allowed incumbents to wield disproportionate influence, exploiting executive powers for personal gain and partisan advantage. The unchecked exercise of authority by appointed governors and the manipulation of electoral timelines have further eroded the foundations of democratic governance.

### Popes and Cardinals

*2024-04-27 15:07:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/popes-and-cardinals/) · `en`

The enthusiasm generated by the election of a new Pope may give the impression that the 500 million Roman Catholics – sometimes derisively called Papists – are a separate species of human beings. That is not the impression I carried away, after a stay of over five years in Rome. Roman Catholics are, I am certain, like the rest of us, capable of all the follies to which human frailty exposes men and women.

The Pope does not dictate the policies of governments; not even those of the Government of Italy which, in recent times has been successively totalitarian, conservative, middle-of – the-road, and left of center.

### Is Religion the opium of the masses?

*2024-04-27 14:43:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/is-religion-the-opium-of-the-masses/) · `en`

Perhaps there is no phrase of Karl Marx that is better known or more frequently quoted than his quip about religion being the opium of the masses. So let me quote the passage in full.

“Religious distress is an expression of real distress and a protest against this distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, the spirit of a spiritless condition. It is the opium of the masses. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the condition for their real happiness. The demand to give up this illusion is the demand for men to give up a condition which needs illusions”. Marx, Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right.

### A.T. Ariyaratne and the Bauddha Jatika Balavegaya (BJB)

“I got disillusioned with politics. An idea was born in my mind that a social revolution minus political colouring should be staged. The Sarvodaya Shramadana movement was the outcome of this thinking.” – A.T. Ariyaratne

The passing of A.T. Ariyaratne at the age of 92 years on April 16, 2024 removes from the national scene a colossus that straddled many spheres of local life and singularly gained international recognition for himself and his country to an unimaginable extent. Though small and diminutive in physical size he reached dizzy heights that should inspire the current and future generations to emulate him. A.T. Ariyaratne was an innovative thinker who consistently punched above his weight.

Much has been written of him and much will be written of him in the future. Therefore, I will confine myself in this essay to the lesser publicized aspects of his charismatic life.

### And one last driver

*2024-04-27 14:19:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/and-one-last-driver/) · `en`

Having writted about the drivers of my classmates on two occasions I cannot allow the peculiarities of our own ‘charioteer’ to go untold for he was, like all of his breed, an exceptional servant of those times.

We did not properly appreciate our help-karayas of yore. Our maids were all extensions of our mothers as far as getting us to keep clothes clean, rooms neat etc. and drivers were CIA agents. What linked the  Nona Mahattaya to the driver’s affections defied comprehension.

Affection is the wrong word. Loyalty was the trait mothers enjoyed from their drivers. A driver was the caretaker of the car, which he kept in prime condition – washing it daily and dusting the insides – which was necessary since no cars were air-conditioned during my school days. Ergo the seats etc. got extremely dusty. Car carpets likewise.
