Media organizations and trade unions have jointly appealed to the Speaker not to grant the Speaker's approval to the Bill until the guidelines of the orders sent to the Speaker by the High Court are confirmed.

As civil society activists, we think that we should completely reject the Foundation Protection Bill, which we think we can be a major danger to expression.

We, who belong to the sovereignty of Sri Lanka, on January 24, ignore the guidelines of the court without any discussion with those involved in this issue and express strong opposition to the passage of Parliament.

Opposition MPs have pointed out that the legislation was passed in Parliament without the proper recruitment of the court guidelines.

The court had given guidance following the filing of more than 45 basic violation petitions against the copy of the Bill.

If the opposition parties are correct, it is the act of deducting the sovereignty of the people and thereby considering the contempt of court.
