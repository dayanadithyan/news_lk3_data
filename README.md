More than 80 earthquakes, the strongest of 6.3 magnitude, struck Taiwan’s east coast starting Monday night and into the early hours of Tuesday and some caused shaking of buildings in the capital Taipei, the island’s weather administration said.

The quakes were centred on the largely rural eastern county of Hualien, where on April 3 at least 14 people died after a 7.2 magnitude temblor. Taiwan has been jolted by hundreds of aftershocks since then.

The fire department in Hualien said early on Tuesday that a hotel which had already been damaged on April 3 and was no longer in operation was now slightly leaning on its side.

Taiwan lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes.

More than 100 people were killed in a quake in southern Taiwan in 2016, while a 7.3 magnitude quake killed more than 2,000 people in 1999.

Unfortunately, the same mysticism and beliefs that Buddha dispelled two and a half millennia ago have crept back into Buddhism. It is true that some of it has cultural, artistic, or sentimental values. But if the human affliction for beliefs and mysticism, or the shortcomings in our sensory apparatus, are used to exploit the innocent and waste valuable resources that could be put into better use, that would be an insult to Dhamma, its author, and purveyors. The preferred outcome of comparing Buddhism and science would be to enable science savvy young generations to relate to Buddha Dhamma and prevent falling prey to mysticism

### An ‘arriere-pensee’ to proposed debate of SJB vs JVP/NPP

*2024-04-23 00:39:46* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/An-arriere-pensee-to-proposed-debate-of-SJB-vs-JVP-NPP/14-760889) · `en`

The Leader of the Opposition (LoO) having a public debate with Anura Kumara Dissanayaka (AKD) is simply a mismatch and an insult to the office of the LoO.

It is a globally accepted practice that an argument, debate or a discourse on an important issue or subject has to be conducted between two equal individuals, groups or societies. Otherwise, it will become a joke or useless exercise that fails to meet the expected objectives.

The office of the LoO is a statutorily established legislative body headed by the leader of the second largest political party in Parliament and not affiliated to the government in a parliamentary democracy according to Thomas Erskine May (1815 – 1886).

The Leader of the Opposition is the Prime Minister-in waiting in a Westminster form of governance or in any other legislature that practices a form of parliamentary democracy. He or she has a responsibility to safeguard the honour, dignity and statutory obligations of himself and his office.

Palitha Thewarapperuma, a controversial politician from the Kalutara district met a tragic death last week. His popularity was reflected in the huge crowd that gathered, including thousands of Muslim men and women from many parts of the district.

In December 2013, when the authorities decided to close the Badureliya hospital, Thewarapperuma chained himself to a truck and threatened to fast to death. The hospital was reopened

There is no doubt that this title itself will bring bemusement to the denizens of the land of Mahavamsa.
