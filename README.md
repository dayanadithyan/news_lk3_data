*2024-08-17 00:08:46* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Hobson-s-choice/4-765663) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s remarkable recovery should be credited to the able leadership of President Wickremesinghe and his political and bureaucratic team

I see President Wickremesinghe’s policies as the only option for Sri Lanka in the immediate future. I sincerely hope that whoever is elected on the 22nd will not try to reinvent the wheel as President Gotabaya Rajapaksa did and destroyed our country. I strongly believe in the old adage “A known devil is better than an unknown angel”

There has been a sigh of relief that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has called for the Presidential elections and the Elections Commission has declared 21 September as the day of reckoning for Sri Lanka.

Many suspected that the President was trying to postpone elections and very few believed that President Ranil Wickremesinghe will call for the election as scheduled. He pulled out his magic wand and 85% of the lotuses chose his lake to thrive. There could be many more surprises prior to 21 September.

### Political forces of South Sri Lanka, who are blinded by our eyes

*2024-08-16 21:02:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191233) · `ta`

Key contenders Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa, and Anuragumara Dissanayake frequent the North and East, engaging with Tamil parties and individuals. Despite internal discussions and a Memorandum of Understanding among Tamil groups advocating for a joint candidate, external pressures and political maneuverings, particularly from Sumanthiran, complicate efforts towards unity and representation.

Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa and Anuragumara Dissanayake, the main candidates of the Tamil people in the 2024 presidential election, are frequently coming to the North and East and meeting various parties and individuals there.

### “A Comfortable Abode”

*2024-08-16 19:42:44* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/a-comfortable-abode/) · `en`

This month, known as “Nikini,” holds great significance in the Buddhist calendar as it marks the First Dhamma Sangayana (First Buddhist Council), which took place on the full moon day of this month. This pivotal event occurred three months after the passing of Lord Buddha when senior monks, led by Mahākāśyapa Thero, convened to establish and reinforce the monastic disciplines. This decision was prompted by concerns over the misbehaviour of a monk within the noble Sangha community.

On this auspicious Nikini Poya day, I wish to share some Dhamma that deeply resonated with me. I recently listened to a recorded interview with Mr. A.S. Balasooriya, a respected Buddhist layperson from Sri Lanka, who offered insightful reflections on a poem from the Theragatha. The interview, conducted in Sinhalese, was broadcast on Sri Lanka TV and provided a profound exploration of the teachings.

### Sri Lanka cbank: rupee appreciation due to high inflows; depreciation possible in late 2024

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s recent rupee appreciation is due to higher foreign currency inflows compared to the outflows, but there is a possibility for depreciation in the latter part of this year, central bank officials said.

The rupee currency has seen an appreciation in the recent months and traded around 300 rupees per U.S. dollar this week compared to 320 rupee in January this year.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is also the island nation’s Finance Minister, had expected the rupee to appreciate to around 270 per US dollar by June this year.

“The main reason is we have more inflows,” D. S. T. Wanaguru, Director, at the Central Bank’s International Operations Department told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo on Friday (16).

“The market has more foreign currency liquidity than the outflows. That has facilitated the central bank to purchase more foreign currency from the market.”

Almost twenty years ago, I received a call from Don Harold Stassen Jayawardena. Of course, at the time I knew him as ‘Harry Jayawardena’ as did many Sri Lankans, especially in business circles. I was in England, veritably forced into exile by political circumstances which included the abduction and torture of the deputy editor of ‘The Nation,’ a newspaper published by Rivira Media Corporation, of which I was at the time the Managing Director, and a brutal attack on Upali Tennakoon, the editor of our sister newspaper in Sinhala. These attacks came just after my friend Lasantha Wickramatunge implored me to leave the country and not too long before he himself was killed. It was a time not just of exile but abandonment; for reasons of convenience or fear almost all those I considered friends avoided me. There were a handful who didn’t give a damn about possible consequences or cared enough to be supportive. I didn’t count Harry among them.
