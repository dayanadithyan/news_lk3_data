*2024-06-11 00:42:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185791) ┬╖ `ta`

South Africa advanced to the Super 8 round in the 9th T20 World Cup by defeating Bangladesh by 4 runs in a closely contested match at the New York Nasav Kandri International Stadium. Despite a challenging start where they lost six wickets and managed only 113 runs, Henry Glassen and David Miller's partnership of 79 runs revived South Africa's innings. In response, Bangladesh also struggled, losing seven wickets for 109 runs, with Tauhid Ritoy's 37 runs being a highlight. Keshav Maharaj's bowling performance, taking three wickets across four overs, sealed South Africa's victory.

ЁЯЯй

South Africa won by 4 runs in the T20 World Cup for the D Group, which was completed shortly before the New York Nasav Kandri International Stadium between South Africa and Bangladesh.

With this victory, South Africa has increased the chance of playing the Super 8 round in the 9th T20 World Cup.

It is worth noting that the two -day teams have failed the second team with the target of a very low total number.

Pakistan lost by 6 runs in response to 120 runs in the same stadium against India.

South Africa became the pride of the team that retained very little total number in the T20 World Cup after winning with Bangladesh. Earlier, India's 119 runs were the smallest number.

South Africa decided to bat first, which gave them difficulty again, losing six wickets in 20 overs and scoring only 113 runs.

In the match against the Netherlands, the total number of South Africa's leading quarries was 23 runs in the 5th over.

### Presidential pardons shouldnтАЩt encourage impunity - EDITORIAL

The Supreme CourtтАЩs June 6 reversal of the order of President Maithripala Sirisena to grant a pardon to Jude Shramantha Jayamaha, who was sentenced to death over the Royal Park murder incident on July 1, 2005, was the second such action by the apex court within the last six months.

The court on January 17 quashed the clemency given by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva who had been on death row over the murder of former Presidential Advisor Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8, 2011.

Both rulings by the Supreme Court to quash the capital punishment given to Duminda Silva and Jude Shramantha Jayamaha were based on technicalities - meaning the President had failed to adhere to the proper legal procedures in granting the special Presidential Pardon.

Benefits outweigh drawbacks and external finance will not be a problem

Having taken a firm decision to include nuclear energy in its mix of energy sources, Sri Lanka is now well on the way to harnessing it. Literature on the subject shows that the benefits of going for nuclear energy outweigh the drawbacks, and external finance will not be a problem.

The Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board (SLAEB) Chairman Prof. Rexy Denzil Rosa has said that Sri Lanka has identified nuclear energy as a clean and green energy source to fulfil future electricity demand. In March 2024, the Sri Lankan Cabinet committed the country to a nuclear power programme.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says that Sri Lanka is pursuing nuclear power to increase its low carbon power production, tackle climate change and increase energy security.

It is essential that leadership development caters to an organisational need and is carefully planned and monitored

Effective leaders are those who enable positive people performance through role modelling, inspiring a shared vision, facilitating an environment of open and frank discussion, licensing the challenge of the status quo, enabling empowerment and decision making, and celebrating success. You do not necessarily have to be a good manager to be a good leader or vice versa. Leadership is hierarchy agnostic. In a corporate setting, leadership need not be confined to just the chief executive officer or the C-suite. It can be allowed to flourish at every level of the organisation provided the roles, and deliverables, of individuals and teams are clearly defined

### Provincializing Universities: The Risks & Dangerous Precedent Of The Newly Proposed NEPF

So far critics have quite convincingly pointed out the neoliberal motives behind the proposals and the threat that it poses to the longstanding tradition of free education in Sri Lanka. These criticisms hold merit, as the compilers of the framework have failed to present any moral stance, such as a commitment to social justice and equity, within the document.

### Fear Of Tainted Politicians: To Hold Or Not To Hold Elections

*2024-06-10 16:40:50* ┬╖ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/fear-of-tainted-politicians-to-hold-or-not-to-hold-elections/) ┬╖ `en`

Tainted politicians are abundant in Sri Lanka. If a small pebble were thrown from the spectator gallery in the legislature, there is a 99 percent chance it would hit the head of a scam-tainted politician. These individuals are either compromised by their own actions or by their association with and support for the most corrupt and vile political leaders alleged to have committed numerous crimes, including the embezzlement of state funds. Corruption among Sri Lankan politicians is rampant, a scourge that has undermined governance, the judiciary and civil liberties. It has stifled economic growth, and eroded the very fabric of society, a phenomenon that knows no boundaries. Its impact has been devastating, affecting not just the corridors of power but reaching deep into the daily lives of ordinary citizens for more than seven decades.
