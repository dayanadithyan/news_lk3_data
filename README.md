Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and seven others have been further remanded until June 14 by the Maligakanda MagistrateтАЩs Court.

They are facing charges related to the import of substandard human immunoglobulin vials.

Meanwhile, the court also ordered the release of the fourth suspect of the case under a monetary bail of Rs. 100,000 and two surety bails of each worth Rs. 500,000.

This order was issued when the relevant case was taken up before the Maligakanda MagistrateтАЩs Court today (03).

Both Sri Lanka and South Africa have stars who shone in the recently concluded IPL. Matheesha Pathirana, who took 13 wickets for Chennai Super Kings at an economy rate of 7.68, will be a force to be reckoned with, as will be South AfricaтАЩs Heinrich Klaasen, who scored 479 runs for Sunrisers Hyderabad as they secured a runners-up finish in the IPL final.

ItтАЩs not just Pathirana who brings express pace for Sri Lanka. Dishan Madushanka and Dushmantha Chameera can also bowl express pace. Nuwan Thushara, meanwhile, has had his highs and lows but his figures of 5/20 against Bangladesh in a T20I n March will act as an inspiration of sorts to do better.

June 3 (Bridgetown) - Namibia scored a nerve-shredding victory over Oman in their T20 World Cup Group B clash in Barbados on Sunday after a low-scoring thriller was decided by a super over.

Oman had looked to be heading for defeat after a superb four-wicket bowling display from Ruben Trumpelmann saw them all out for 109 off 19.4 overs.

But Oman's bowlers responded with a disciplined performance to contain Namibia's bats, with Mehran Khan conjuring a superb spell to leave the match on a knife edge.

### Pulling Kandy Multi -Traffic Terminal Project: People in discomfort

*2024-06-03 11:04:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185175) ┬╖ `ta`

Kandy, Sri Lanka's capital, faces significant traffic congestion, with studies showing over 50% of its population relying on public transport. A multimodal transport terminal project, aimed at easing this issue, began in 2015 with World Bank funding.

Despite initial promises of completion by early 2022, as of May 2023, only 25% of the work has been done, with no clear end date. The project, expected to cost around $300 million, aims to improve public transportation coordination and reduce vehicle regulations in Kandy, but ongoing delays have led to widespread discontent among the affected population.

### Australia lifts minimum wage as families grapple with higher living costs

AustraliaтАЩs independent wage-setting body on Monday raised the national minimum wage by 3.75%, largely in line with inflation, as families tackle soaring living costs.

The minimum rate will rise to A$24.10 ($16.05) per hour from July 1, resulting in an extra A$33 per week for about a fifth of the Australian workforce or about 2.6 million employees.

In its annual review, the Fair Work Commission said cost-of-living pressures have hit low-income employees the most, though inflation is considerably lower now than it was at this time last year, when it awarded an increase of 5.75%.

But the report said it was not тАЬappropriate at this time to increase award wages by any amount significantly above the inflation rate principally because labour productivity is no higher than it was four years ago.тАЭ

Australian consumer price inflation rose at an annual pace of 3.6% in April, the highest level in five months, adding to risks the next move in interest rates might be upward.
