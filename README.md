Parent and teacher attitudes and aspirations may differ with harder sanctions for boys or inadvertent rewarding for lower effort because ‚Äòboys will be boys‚Äô

Females comprised 64% of all state university enrolments for medicine, dentistry, law, science, IT, education, management and arts

Even at the primary school level, girls‚Äô attainment outperforms boys‚Äô with cut-off marks for grade 5 scholarship entrance exams consistently higher for prestigious girls‚Äô schools compared to boys‚Äô schools

But the trend is reversed in the workplace where men earn on average more than women for every level of education in Sri Lanka in every occupational category; the disparity is a symptom of deeper structural issues

Integrating work-related initiatives into the curriculum, such as vocational training, work placements or entrepreneurial opportunities that come with a stipend or other incentive, may be a way to show that learning is worthwhile

During the past few weeks, most parts of Sri Lanka have been experiencing torrential rains and floods partly due to the South-West monsoon which was aggravated by climate change issues such as the cutting down of trees.

On Tuesday (28), the UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara caused a stir when he said there were plans to postpone both the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections. However, other sources denied any such move and said that President Ranil Wickremesinghe had assured that elections would be held. So, while President Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) government are focused on elections, they should also dedicate time for issues such as climate change as it no doubt affects the entire country and its people.

### In Mayilathamaduwu

*2024-05-29 15:16:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184786) ¬∑ `ta`

In Mayilathamadu, Batticaloa, ongoing injustices against immigrants involve police complicity, livestock theft, and violence. This issue, rooted in a long history of livestock farming, escalated during planned settlements from 2013 to 2016. The Tamil National Alliance opposed these actions, leading to legal challenges. The situation worsened under Gotabhaya Rajapaksa's governance, with farmers resorting to hiding their livestock due to threats and inadequate food supply. Over 1400 cattle have died, and four departments allegedly deceive farmers. The government's economic crisis exacerbates the problem, risking the destruction of native breeds and potential importation of foreign cattle. This scenario is seen as a form of political manipulation aimed at fostering communal conflict for political gain. Efforts to address these issues, including international outreach and legal actions, have yielded limited results, with continued atrocities against the immigrants.

üü©

The President of the Batticaloa District Civil Social Operators Union said that the iniquities of the immigrants in the Mayilathamadu Madhavan area continue to be carried out to this day, with the help of the police, they carry out their injustice.

He made this statement during a conversation on the crisis faced by the Milky Ways at Batticaloa at the Colombo National Christian Society

He said that cattle are missing, killing them, putting ammunition into the food, killing them with sharp weapons and shooting fire.

Madhavan, Batticaloa, has been involved in livestock farming for more than five generations of long history.

From 2013 to 2016, similar planned settlements took place - these were carried out under the State Event.

After the change of 2015, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) was the Opposition of the Opposition of the Maithripala Sirisena -a case was filed by Durairajasinghe, Minister of Agricultural Livestock Development of the Eastern Provincial Council.

The President was speaking at a workshop with young law professionals with young law professionals.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that financial allocations have already been allocated.

Once a law passed in the England parliament, no one can interrogate. That was the foundation of the supremacy of Parliament. The Parliament is the Parliament.

American method is different. By the American methodology, when they drafted some law, they gave the executive powers to the executive powers and the Congress Congress and the Court of Justice.

At the time of the Pakistani election on February 8, Imran Khan suffered 14 years in prison for other mistakes and charges. A week ago, Khan, the country's most popular opposition leader, was disqualified from being in office for 10 years. His party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was subjected to mass persecution and repression and its central offices were sealed by the police.

The contradictions against the party and its leader were fiercely. Yet Khanal was able to oppose them. Although allegations such as voting and military intervention and all races were supported by the government, PTI won 93 seats. The ruling party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN), won 75 seats and Pakistan People's Party (PPP), led by Benazir Bhutto's son Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, won 54 seats.
