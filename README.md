### Concerns emerge on unauthorised players entering local lubricant sector

*2024-05-07 03:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Concerns-emerge-on-unauthorised-players-entering-local-lubricant-sector/108-282061) · `en`

While Sri Lanka’s petroleum industry awaits the establishment of a new regulator, concerns are being raised about the potential for unauthorised players to enter the market, particularly in the lubricant sector.

The previous regulatory body, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), ceased its activities in market monitoring, consumer and trade education, import inspection and action against unauthorised operators and product adulterators.

As per the Energy Ministry directive, the lubricant licence fees that were previously paid to the PUCSL are now to be paid directly to the ministry.

An entity expressing concerns in this regard is Chevron Lubricants Lanka PLC.

“With this development, there is a risk that the vacuum could result in a proliferation of unauthorised players and product adulterators, which would be detrimental to the licensed players, consumers and government, in terms of loss of revenue,” said its MD/CEO Bertram Paul in the company’s annual report.

### US House passes anti-Semitism curbing Bill as university students turn against Israel

*2024-05-07 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/US-House-passes-anti-Semitism-curbing-Bill-as-university-students-turn-against-Israel/172-282042) · `en`

The United States House of Representatives has overwhelmingly passed a Bill that would expand the definition of anti-Semitism (anti-Jew). The Bill was passed when university students across the US had risen to condemn Israel’s genocide in Gaza. It now goes to the Senate for consideration.

When it becomes law, the “Anti-Semitism Awareness Bill” would allow the US Federal Department of Education to restrict funding and other resources to campuses perceived as tolerating anti-Semitism.

The law would mandate government civil rights offices to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA’s) definition of anti-Semitism.

But the definition has also drawn criticism because most of its examples of anti-Semitism involve criticism of Israel, including calling it a “racist endeavour or a racist project.”

### Collective resolve of regional and international actors, a glimmer of hope for Afghans - Air Chief Marshal Bulathsinghala

Afghanistan has been in deep political divisions, structural governance  challenges, and economic insecurity to impede durable peace and  development progress for years. The interruption of the fragile peace  talks with the Taliban and the withdrawal of the NATO troops have  created more uncertainty for Afghanistan. The power shift made on 15th  August 2021 has complicated the matter further to a very higher  proportion

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) is a  political UN mission established to assist the people of Afghanistan in  laying the foundations for sustainable peace and development. United  Nations Security Council Resolution 1401 established UNAMA on March 28,  2002. Its original mandate was to support the Bonn Agreement of December  2001

### Press freedom, a boon for economic recovery

Sri Lanka ranked 150 out of 180 countries in the 2024 Edition of the Press Freedom Index, published annually by Reporters Without Borders (Reporters Sans Frontiers - RSF) is a remarkable drop of 15 positions from 135 to 150 when compared to 2023.

However, Sri Lanka has been ranked higher than India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. India is ranked 159th, Pakistan 152nd and Bangladesh 165th. Norway is ranked in the top position and Eritrea  in the last position. The RSF’s ranking is based on five indicators such as political context, legal framework, economic context, socio-cultural context and safety of journalists.

Sri Lankan authorities might still argue that media freedom in the country is above what prevails in the neighbouring countries and also they might find gaps in the index citing the fact that one of the criteria for Sri Lanka’s ranking in the index is the unresolved issues that have occurred during the separatist war which ended 15 years ago.

### SL’s debt-restructuring problems cast shadow on share-trading; indices dip

*2024-05-06 22:34:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sls-debt-restructuring-problems-cast-shadow-on-share-trading-indices-dip/) · `en`

The stock market yesterday witnessed some profit- taking by some share investors mainly due to delays in the external debt restructuring exercise. Sri Lanka expects to implement a debt restructuring framework in June this year but this will likely be delayed further, market analysts said.

Sri Lanka has failed to strike an agreement with international bondholders on restructuring more than US $12 billion in debt, a mandatory requirement set out by the IMF. This essentially accounts for the relevant delays.

All Share Price Index went down by 28.07 points, while S and P SL20 declined by 23.12 points. Turnover stood at Rs 2.1 billion with five crossings.

2. When the new proposal was introduced, VFS charges were not mentioned. Since it came to light, I have objected to the proposal. @sajithpremadasa

Sri Lanka’s tourist visa went from 50 to 100 dollars as an online portal was shifted to IVF-GBS, VFS Global, a private contractor, following an unsolicited proposal.

Sri Lanka’s tourism minister has introduced ‘free’ visas to seven countries to boost visitors but the private companies are collecting 18.50 and another 7 dollar fee from visitors from those countries as well.

A purported resignation letter that was circulating was not genuine, Minister Fernando said, told cabinet he did not want “to be a part of the decision to increase any visa fees.”

May 6 (ICC) - Scotland name their 15-member squad for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024.

Top-order batter Michael Jones and fast bowler Brad Wheal make a return to Scotland's T20I squad for the upcoming mega event in West Indies and USA.

The duo, both of whom last played in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022, aren't part of the squad that will play in the upcoming T20I tri-series in the Netherlands but have been named in the T20 World Cup squad.

Richie Berrington will captain the side that will hope to better their performances from 2022, when they famously registered a big win over the West Indies.

“To have Michael Jones and Brad Wheal available, their experience from previous T20 World Cups is crucial for the group," head coach Doug Watson said.

"I’m looking forward to meeting them both, getting to know them and seeing their skills up close. The bulk of the squad have been together for a while now and did a fantastic job last summer at both the 50-over Qualifier and the T20 Qualifier.

“The government benefits from increased efficiencies and transparency in managing the complete process and improved resource utilisation,” VFS said.

May 6 (ICC) - Brian Masaba holds the honour of leading Uganda in their first appearance at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, with their 15-player squad locked in.

After stunning Zimbabwe and the African field in qualifying, the Cricket Cranes look ahead to Group C play, taking on co-hosts West Indies, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Afghanistan.

Masaba will be deputised by Riazat Ali Shah, and the skipper joins several Ugandans with over a decade’s experience in international cricket, underlined by 43-year-old Frank Nsubuga, who will be one of the oldest players in the tournament.

A cult hero in emerging cricket circles, Nsubuga’s squad selection caps off a life’s devotion to the game. He first represented Uganda in ICC events as a 17-year-old in the 1997 ICC Trophy, a pathway event on the road to Cricket World Cup 1999.

Fast-forward 25 years, Nsubuga made headlines, taking a sprawling catch approaching the boundary in a Cricket World Cup Challenge League match against Kenya in 2022.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s controversial visa deal which led to doubling of fees with multiple charges, was awarded without a tender and nobody could compete against the VFS company in any case, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles said.

Many things are done without tender in Sri Lanka and the visa deal was a proposal, he said.

“There are several [procurement] methods in Sri Lanka,” Minister Alles explained to reporters Monday, amid brewing controversy over the visa deal which had led to a doubling of visa costs to around 100 dollar per tourist.

“There is no need to call tenders for this type of thing. This is a proposal. There is a method of studying proposals. Many things (orner-tharam-deval) are done that way.”

The correct way to do the deal was when a company made a proposal, appoint a committee to study it and go back to cabinet, he explained.

Just the other day, at the University cafeteria while enjoying a cup of ginger tea, a good friend of mine happened to say, “Nowadays students are going through a lot of unnecessary turmoil and struggles due to the lack of self-awareness, and unfortunately, they attribute it to stress, anxiety and depression. And they end up swallowing pills for temporary relief. It’s true that compared to the past generations, these students are facing many challenges. But that doesn’t necessarily mean each one needs individual therapy and medication. Most of them only need an opportunity to increase their resilience”.

### Sri Lanka plantation companies benefitted from weak rupee, labourers did not: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) benefitted from the weakening of the rupee and saw export gains, but the benefits did not go to the workers, Minister of Estate Infrastructure Jeevan Thondaman has said.

“Even through the economic crisis, RPCs have benefitted from the weakening of the Rupee that gave them an over 80% increase in Rupee revenue in 2023 vs 2021,” Thondaman said on X (twitter).

“When the real value of daily worker wages plummeted from around 5 USD to 2.7 USD and inflation plunged over half the workers to below the poverty line, RPCs continued to reap the benefits of their hard labour.”

“While export revenues grew exponentially, none of those benefits went to the workers, who are the backbone of the industry.”

The minister said he was hopeful of an announcement favourable to the workers from RPCs who have said that they will be responding to the wage hike for plantation workers today (6).

“I also saw today that Sajith Premadasa had demanded money to stop talking about it. These are both wrong.

“Doing these things will not help the country. I am asking to tell the truth to educate the public.

“I do not take even 5 cents from anyone. The people in the country know that.”

### Sri Lanka to issue 30-day single entry tourist visa below 100 dollars

*2024-05-06 14:54:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-issue-30-day-single-entry-tourist-visa-below-100-dollars-161496/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will issue a cheaper 30-day single entry visa for a lower cost, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles said, as the tourist sector was hit by 100 dollar visa with a shift of visa processing to a private contractor.

Sri Lanka issued a multiple entry visa for 50 dollar final prices before the shift to IVS-GBS VFS Global group, when the visa went up to 100.77 with 18.50 fee and convenience fee on top of the gazette 75 dollar price.

“The 30 day visa with single entry was at 50 dollars,” Minister Alles told reporters in Colombo Monday as the crisis escalated.

“However, when we passed it, it was removed from the document, and subsequently from the system.”

It is not clear whether the IVS-GBS VFS Global group will also charge an 18.50 fee and the convenience fee on top of the 50 dollars.

Minister Alles told reporters that the cabinet was free to decided on the price of the visa, or a free visa but when the private platform was used, its service fees had to be paid.

### Australia’s Qantas to pay $79m over ‘ghost flights’ furore

*2024-05-06 14:09:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/australias-qantas-to-pay-79m-over-ghost-flights-furore/) · `en`

Australia’s flagship airline Qantas has agreed to pay $120 million Australian dollars ($79m) to settle a lawsuit over the sale of tickets for already cancelled flights.

The airline will pay a fine of 100 million Australian dollars ($66m) and provide compensation of 20 million Australian dollars ($13m) to more than 86,000 customers after advertising seats for thousands of “ghost flights” in 2021 and 2022.

“Qantas’ conduct was egregious and unacceptable. Many consumers will have made holiday, business and travel plans after booking on a phantom flight that had been cancelled,” said Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairperson Gina Cass-Gottlieb in a statement on Monday.

“Importantly, it demonstrates that we take action to ensure that companies operating in Australia communicate clearly, accurately and honestly with their customers at all times,” Cass-Gottlieb added.

### ARE WE BOLD ENOUGH FOR A RADICAL CHANGE?

*2024-05-06 13:43:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/are-we-bold-enough-for-a-radical-change/) · `en`

Mr Ranil Wickramasinghe (ex-PM, ex-MP and now President) is reported to have berated the present government authorities, for going around begging for funds to purchase the Anti-Corona Virus Vaccines from India (AstraZeneca (Oxford)) and from China (Sinovac). Yes, it is great shame that our nation has managed its finances very poorly and recklessly. Even before the “Robber Barons,” invited by RW’s uncle “Dickie” got here, the local models were well immersed in the technology of large-scale larceny. So, mendacity is not a novelty to us. In fact it possibly started somewhere in the fifties or early sixties. It has grown since, both in ubiquity and scale.

### May Day Politics: A Pregame to Presidential Election

*2024-05-06 13:32:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/may-day-politics-a-pregame-to-presidential-election/) · `en`

May Day this week lived up to expectations as pregame to the presidential election that is expected before the end of October. Political parties strutted their wares and prospective candidates made their pitches. Little was said that was not already known but what was said by each contender does give clues to the direction that each one’s campaign would likely take. There was one constant refrain in the editorials and commentaries before and after May Day: that the Day was all about propaganda for the presidential election, and nothing about the rights of the working people, or their plights – from unemployment to underemployment to low wages, regressive taxes and the crippling cost of living.

Minister Alles revealed this during a special press conference held today (06) in relation to the recent controversial issue concerning the issuance of On-Arrival Visas at the BIA in Katunayake.

The Minister explained that the proposal regarding the new visa system was unanimously passed in Parliament without a debate on November 23, 2023.

He stated that the issue of visa fees was also part of the adopted proposal, and that even though it was passed in November, it was not possible to implement the change through the Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) system and therefore they had to wait until April 17 to implement it through the VFS system.

### Sri Lanka expressway SOE to help pay off Rs860bn in debt: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sahasya Investments, a new state enterprise which will manage expressways, is part of efforts to pay off 860 billion rupees of debt linked to their construction, Transport and Highways Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.

### Panama’s Mulino wins presidency with support from convicted former leader

(Reuters) - Panama’s former security minister Jose Raul Mulino on Sunday stormed to victory in a presidential poll dominated by his old boss, the popular ex-leader Ricardo Martinelli, who buttressed his campaign despite being holed up in Nicaragua’s embassy.

Mulino, 64, was one of the favorites for the presidency after he stepped in to replace Martinelli on the ballot when the former president was barred from running due to a money laundering conviction.

“Mission accomplished, damn it,” Mulino told his supporters to loud cheers and applause. “To Ricardo Martinelli, friend, mission accomplished as well.”

Mulino said his government would be pro-investment and pro-business and said the Central American country would honor its debts, but also vowed to not forget the poor.

“I promise to the country at this time to put together, to establish, a government of unity as soon as possible,” Mulino told electoral officials earlier as they video called him to confirm he had won the presidency.
