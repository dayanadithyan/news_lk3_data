### Extreme Asian heat spurs LNG demand ahead of summer months

Extreme temperatures across Asia are driving up liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand in the region as importers seek cargoes ahead of summer, with imports in South Asia hitting records.

This could tighten available supply and further lift Asian spot prices that have already gained a third since April, with heatwaves across South and Southeast Asia boosting air-conditioner use and other cooling demand. Prices are now at a near six-month peak at $12 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) and are expected to remain elevated.

‚ÄúSpot prices are now driven by Asian demand. Temperatures in South Asia are rising due to a heatwave, increasing power demand,‚Äù said Siamak Adibi, principal consultant at energy consultancy FGE.

While China may still see lower demand compared with its record breaking shipments in 2021, demand from India and the rest of Asia has compensated for any drop-off, Adibi said.

### The solution is the solution to the right to self -determination - evidence of genocide in Sri Lanka

*2024-05-31 11:30:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184934) ¬∑ `ta`

The discussion revolves around the importance of recognizing the genocide in Sri Lanka and advocating for self-determination as a solution. It highlights the U.S.'s acknowledgment of the genocide, the need for international support, and the potential for peaceful resolution through self-determination. The conversation also touches on the historical significance of self-determination rights and the role of the U.S. in supporting such causes globally.

üü©

He said that self -determination is an essential solution, and that the Member of the US House of Representatives Wile Nikel said that it is necessary to take place.

He said that the US recognizes that the genocide took place in Sri Lanka, but there is evidence that Barack Obama has spoken in his book.

Thank you for submitting a historic resolution in the US Congress - Can you tell me more about it?

I think this is the most important step towards the hearing of our voices in the United States on the issue of repression and self -determination against the Tamil people.

I think the solution to the right of self -determination can reach it in a peaceful way.

The rest of the world's most important countries have examined the United States.

This is the first step in the first phase of the Congress and the other members of the Congress have received great support and I am very confident that we are heading towards.
