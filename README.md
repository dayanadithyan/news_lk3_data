But Hazaranga feels that he is unable to quickly change themselves in accordance with the pitch given in the United States.

Sri Lanka scored 77 runs at the New York Nasav County Stadium against South Africa.

Sri Lanka then scored 124 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in Dallas in Dallas against Bangladesh. However, Sri Lanka lost due to the absence of leading bowlers to throw Death overs.

Sri Lanka's Super 8 round dream was scattered when the game with Nepal was completely abandoned.

Sri Lanka won by 83 runs in the match with the Netherlands. Or it would have returned to the country barefoot.
