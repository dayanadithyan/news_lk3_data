“Don’t buy things you can’t afford with money you don’t have to impress people you don’t like”. This quote from Dave Ramsay which applies to individuals and families may as well apply to governments also. Why did Sri Lanka borrow so much, was there proper accounting of how it was spent, how many of the projects funded by borrowed money actually met the real needs of the country, and who really benefited, are all questions that still remain unanswered.
