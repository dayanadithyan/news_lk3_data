### Shehbaz Sharif to be coalition candidate for next Pakistan PM

*2024-02-14 06:30:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97247/shehbaz-sharif-to-be-coalition-candidate-for-next-pakistan-pm) · `en`

Former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will be the nominee for Pakistan’s next premier to lead a new coalition alliance formed between different parties, a spokeswoman said on Tuesday after national elections last week returned a hung parliament.

The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Tuesday said it would support Sharif’s party to form a minority government, ending a stalemate after inconclusive elections in the nuclear-armed nation lead to days of political uncertainty.

A spokesman for Sharif’s party, Marriyam Aurangzeb, said in a post on social media site X, formerly Twitter, that Nawaz Sharif, the elder brother of Shehbaz, had nominated him for the post.

Shehbaz Sharif belongs to his brother’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the largest recognised party with 80 seats and PPP is second with 54. Together, the two parties have enough for a simple majority in the 264-seat legislature.

Colombo, Feb 14 (Daily Mirror) - Former President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Upul Jayasuriya PC said the President should not make the Constitutional Council a puppet of the executive but let it function independently on its own.

He said the President had made statements on several recent occasions indicating that the Constitutional Council was part of the executive and that it should function under the purview of the latter.

“We would like to remind the President that the Constitutional Council was established to control certain executive powers of the executive, thus it should not behave like a puppet,” he said.

The President's Counsel made these remarks recently whilst addressing a special gathering of lawyers from countrywide during the launch of the new legal framework of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, which was organised by the Samagi Lawyers Federation.

### Valentine's Day: 'There's more than sex. There's a lot of love there '

*2024-02-14 03:59:45* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/czd7vjv7gwyo) · `si`

Valentine's Day: 'There's more than sex. There's a lot of love there '

"Love is felt. No one can label the love of that heart. There are times when Valentine's Day will love to stay with freedom with the man who loves them so much. But they have no freedom. "

In love, the king's abundance is the most beautiful of the world, as well as those who have left their lives for their love for their love.

Shashini, who joined the Valentine's day on February 14, told the BBC Sinhala service that they were banned from Sri Lankan society to love with his partner.

Shashiy and her companion's love story has begun about 4 years ago. Yet, BBC told the Sinhala.

"I and I went to a restroom. We saw a Straight Cuppal (Straight Cuple), watching the eating and talking to us, we saw one thing. I didn't have any problem. But for a while, I thought it was tortured and worried for us. So we returned to pack the bill, packing the food that quickly carped. "

OSA - newest weapon in Govt.’s arsenal to suppress freedom of expression and dissent

Sri Lanka’s beleaguered Government, amidst fighting a faltering economy and battling to increase state revenue is now facing a barrage of criticism after bringing into law the Online Safety Act (OSA). Amnesty International Sri Lanka called it an ‘additional weapon’ in the hands of the Government. Late last week Sri Lanka’s Justice Minister acknowledged deficiencies and called for all-party consultations.

The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has issued a stark warning to the President – that the OSA was not validly passed by Parliament.

In a detailed analysis the HRCSL highlights 30 instances of failure to comply with requirements set out by the Supreme Court, where several petitioners made applications challenging various aspects proposed by the Government in the Bill.
