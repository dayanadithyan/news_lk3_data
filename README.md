You know that Sri Lanka faced racism in the middle of the 1980s- before the racism, we spent 0.5 more and less than safety expenses.

It increased to three percent in 1985 and increased to 5.9 percent in 1995 in ten years.

In 1985, our safety cost became $ 188 million in 2008, it became $ 1.5 million.

In the 1980-90s, our social development pointers were very good for other South Asian countries.

As for Sri Lanka, we should be concerned about majorityism, despite all we believe in democracy.

When the academic reform in Sri Lanka was carried out in the 1970s, it caused some communities to be discriminated against. This caused the community to carry arms.

### Colombo’s most popular caricaturist in a bygone era

*2024-02-25 03:18:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/colombos-most-popular-caricaturist-in-a-bygone-era/) · `en`

With the passing of time, Lorenz did not have the time he would like to dedicate to the arts as before. The demand on his time in other fields such as in law and politics necessitated him to mainly if not totally focus on those aspects. However, his pencil and sketchbook never left his side. When inspiration struck him, out came a fine caricature. It has been over 150 years since his death and most of his once famous caricatures have been lost. A few have been reproduced as plates in some important publications over the last 100 years and preserved for posterity.

Caricatures have always been endearing pieces of art which have commented on sophisticated matters. In the dynasty of Lankan caricature artists such as J. L. K. van Dort, Bevis Bawa, Aubrey Collette, W. R. Wijesoma and Gihan de Chickera, C.A. Lorenz can be safely positioned as the ‘pioneer’.

Professional wrestling was introduced to Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) by Donovan Andree, a prominent organiser of sporting and musical events for the middle class. An entertainment starved nation was quick to lap up the fare so diligently selected by Donovan.

For a period of about two decades after the ceasing of hostiities in World War 2, Ceylon’s middle class woke up from a long war induced slumber to find that we were living in a virtual cultural desert. For the Sinhala speaking folk there was some relief from the emergence of Sunil Santha waxing lyrical on the joys and the beauty of the rural countryside through songs like “Olu Pipeela,” “Handapane” and “Bovitiya dhang palukam waray” For the English speaking Colombo centric middle class there was only Radio Ceylon and the Western movies and associated music like Jimmy Rodgers epic “Moonlight and Skies” and Doris Day’s “Que Sera “and the like.

### The Academician and the Elephant: an adventure in the wilds of Wasgamuwa

Accounts of conflicts in remote jungle areas between man and elephant appear in our newspapers regularly. They make sad reading – man and beast each fighting a never ending battle for survival under increasingly difficult circumstances. There are then accounts of people getting killed, seriously injured or narrowly escaping when on tour in parks, sanctuaries and even outside these while seeking entertainment from seeing animals in their natural habitat. And then, of course, we’ve been inundated with press articles about the two baby elephants taken forcibly from Pinnawela to Kandy.

With elephants so much in the news, an incident came to mind a few weeks ago listening to a brilliant academician at a seminar in Colombo. This academician, a friend of many years, had been living abroad for a long time excelling in his studies and profession. On his return he had an almost insatiable thirst for travel – off the beaten track – the more remote the better.

### The late Alexei Navalny

*2024-02-24 21:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-late-alexei-navalny/) · `en`

You may wonder why I write about a now dead Russian, this Sunday. Three reasons: I had seen news on him on BBC newscasts a couple of years back and then very recently too and read about him; admired his fearless stand on corruption in Russia and then his mysterious death. I was saddened. Disturbing thoughts on how things could turn out even in democratic Sri Lanka crowded my mind. Third reason: his life and death are relevant to all countries for one reason or another, chiefly that opposition to governments and leaders is of such vital importance.

Alexei Anatolyevich Navalny, born June 4, 1976, was of Russian and Ukrainian descent. His father was from a village on the Belarusian border and was evacuated to a region in Ukraine after the Chernobyl disaster. He grew up in Obninsk, about 100 km southwest of Moscow but spent holidays with his grandmother in Ukraine. His parents owned a basket weaving factory which they still manage.

“There should be no greater priority than ensuring that the quality of the air we breathe, the rainfall that provides our sustenance, and the host of ecosystems that make human life possible are protected for our children and their generations.”

The bounty of nature is a gift from God that mankind, for centuries, has taken for granted and quite often abused. The evidence of such destruction is seen all over the world – in polluted beaches, dirty waterways, denuded forests, and the regular killing of wild animals, even those which are endangered and protected by law. Mankind’s refusal or inability to live in harmony with nature has resulted in damage to the environment which cannot be repaired…

### Unexploded World War II bomb found in a garden in England

An unexploded bomb from World War II has been taken out to sea and detonated after being found in a garden in the English city of Plymouth, authorities said Friday.

As many as 10,000 people were impacted when parts of the southern English city were cordoned off to enable bomb disposal experts to take the device away, a member of the local parliament, Johnny Mercer, said in a post on social media.

The decision to detonate the bomb at sea was taken “after considering all options, including a controlled detonation on site,” according to a government statement.

“I think it is fair to say that the last few days will go down in history for Plymouth. This war-time bomb has really brought out war-time spirit, people coming together to really support each other and whilst it has been really tough – we got through it,” said Tudor Evans, leader of Plymouth City Council.
