Accusing CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe of undue influence, Mahawatte claimed that there are alarming discrepancies in the bank’s operations.

Sri Lankan women seem to have gained an unprecedented and considerable importance in Sri Lankan politics lately, thanks to the record gatherings of women by JVP/NPP as a part of their show off of power, as the major elections are around the corner.

These gatherings have some sort of copycat effect on some other political parties as well, which is also a good sign, as far as women’s politics is concerned.

It is within that context that the International Women’s Day fell on March 8. Yet, we could witness comparatively fewer commemorative events and media concerns this year, in view of that day.

The need for women’s politics has been felt for a long time not only as they are half or more of the population, but also in most so-called developing countries they play a subservient role in politics, giving up the decision-making right to men in the family, the father, brothers, husband or sons.  Very rarely do women make political decisions totally independent of the male relatives.

As a turbulent world races into year 2024, the  only remaining superpower is a troubled giant (China is a great power, but its military (especially naval) and nuclear forces are still no match for America’s, and it would be economically  disastrous for China to start an arms race with the US now with its economy in  trouble).

The American economy is in trouble, too, with the US dollar losing its value and dire predictions of another Great Depression by next year, though some analysts predict that the US will emerge in better shape from a possible economic crash than any other country in the world.

### No reprieve from Supreme Court: Online Safety Bill and Anti-Terrorism Bill

*2024-03-11 23:58:51* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/No-reprieve-from-Supreme-Court-Online-Safety-Bill-and-Anti-Terrorism-Bill/4-759358) · `en`

Analysis of Supreme Court determinations demonstrates many critical issues that adversely impact human rights were not addressed in its deliberations

The Online Safety law and the Anti-Terrorism Bill are two important building blocks in the architecture of repressive laws the Government is constructing. Both were challenged in the Supreme Court, with the Supreme Court finding certain provisions of both unconstitutional. Stakeholders, such as opposition politicians, civic activists, tech companies and the United Nations called upon the Government to, at a minimum, incorporate the Court’s recommendations in the Online Safety Bill before it was enacted. The Government instead passed the law ignoring parliamentary procedure and failed to ensure compliance with Supreme Court determinations.

Colombo, March 11 (Daily Mirror) - The jobs of about 6,000 employees are uncertain if SriLankan Airlines is unable to show progress of its operational and financial units within the next six months, Shipping and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.

A discussion on the current progress of the airline was held with the company administration and the trade unions at his office this morning.

Sri Lanka Airlines was blamed and subjected to extensive criticism due to its constant delays in operations from time to time. The delays annoyed passengers and inconvenienced them in the recent past.

Minister de Silva said the government decided to repay USD 510 million out of the USD 1.2 billion in loans borrowed from several commercial banks and other institutions to enable the airline to continue its operations.

The decision was taken after a proposal made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Finance Minister.

Malnutrition stunts the brain and affects the body. It is not an issue to be resolved in 2048 – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Contrary to claims of ‘technocrats’ claiming robust progress, there is real, visible, touchable and detectable misery in the heartland. According to the latest WFP country report 17% of the population is facing moderate acute food insecurity. 31% of children aged under 5 are malnourished. 20% of children aged under 5 suffer from wasting. People are compelled to skip meals, beg, or borrow food, or simply learn to live in the gutter, staring at stars

In his recent update to Parliament on the nation’s economy, President Wickremesinghe claimed that it is “widely acknowledged” that Sri Lanka has achieved a certain level of economic stability.

“We’re diligently strengthening the economy each day, striving tirelessly to improve the lives of our people and fortify the economy. Our actions are guided by a strategic plan, ensuring a systematic and methodical approach.”

### It’s happening now…what

*2024-03-11 23:10:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/its-happening-nowwhat/) · `en`

Singer Alston Koch, who now resides in Australia, came up with a song, titled ‘Can We Take This Climate Change,’ and that was 16 years ago…in 2008.

Elaborating on what made him come up with this ‘climate change’ song, the ‘Disco Lady’ hitmaker said that he noticed that some of the beautiful fruit trees, butterflies, birds, etc., that existed when he was young, were gradually disappearing and that the heat was on the rise.

‘Can We Take This Climate Change’ was created by Alston for a United Nations WTO presentation in London, and that was in 2008.

The song was also presented by Geoffrey Lipman, Chairman of International Council of Tourism Partners (ICTP) at the ‘Live the Deal Climate Change’ conference in Copenhagen.

Alston Koch was the Goodwill Ambassador for the campaign, and the song was promoted, globally, by ICTP, in their campaign for green growth.

Dr. Harsha de Silva, a parliamentarian, emphasizes that negotiations with international credit providers, not the IMF, are necessary for the government's progress. He warns that compliance with credit providers could lead to a crisis for the new government, potentially causing bankruptcy. He advocates for transparent negotiations with credit owners and holds the opposition responsible. He insists on not negotiating with the IMF and has outlined amendments to be discussed with the Monetary Fund representatives.

🟩

The International Monetary Fund did not seek negotiations with international credit providers. Parliamentarian Harsha de Silva said he emphasized that negotiations with the loan owners should be transformed and obtained the compliance of the opposition.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe was summoned by the International Monetary Fund on Monday (11). In response, he further stated that he added.

I do not request negotiations with the IMF. Sought negotiations with international credit providers. It is imperative for the government to advance in the wake of the current compliance with the International Monetary Fund.

Therefore, if compliance with international credit providers and financial institutions can be implemented in the future, it would be a crisis for the new government that would rule. In the event of such a situation, the country will be able to repay the bankruptcy and cannot repay the debts.

### The Menace Of Political Nepotism: Sri Lanka’s Downfall

*2024-03-11 21:17:25* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-menace-of-political-nepotism-sri-lankas-downfall/) · `en`

Since gaining independence in 1948, Sri Lanka has faced numerous challenges on its journey towards progress. One of the key factors hindering the nation’s development has been the pervasive influence of political nepotism. Over the years, politicians have, regrettably, allowed their offspring and political heirs to ascend to positions of power, ultimately contributing to the country’s decline.

From the early days of independence, political dynasties have taken root, leading to a system where familial ties often hold more weight than merit and competence. The consequences of this nepotistic trend are visible across various sectors, including governance, economy, and social welfare.
