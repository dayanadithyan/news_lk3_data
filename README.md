### NPP support surge linked to opposition weakness

*2024-03-12 23:23:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/NPP-support-surge-linked-to-opposition-weakness/108-278719) · `en`

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror) - The surge in the support for the National People's Power (NPP) led by Anura Kumara Dissanayaka can be attributed to the weakness of the Opposition, Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said.

The primary opposition should be prepared to assume governance. However, this opposition prepared prematurely.

Therefore, the emergence of a third party became prominent as uncertainty loomed over the effectiveness of the opposition.

As a result, the main opposition's only course of action may be to collaborate with the ruling party. If they choose not to unite without careful consideration, several key leaders from the main opposition may opt to join the government.

However, the selection of the common opposition or the President will be made by the Members of Parliament based on their personal opinions, but there is no relevance to being in the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or any other political party.

Sivaguru Adheena Chief Minister Velan Swamis has called for the rise of the people in the Northeast to achieve justice.

He made this comment after a court verdict of Vavuniya on Tuesday (12) to visit the Vidunarimalai case.

Sri Lankan police pass through. The court has been reported to the court falsely without any legitimate reasons for the arrest.

The arrested people are suffering from uniform food. Words do not come when their relatives look at the film. In this situation, we need to unite a people's uprising in the North and East as soon as possible. It has been proven that we can uphold justice.

Therefore, all the relations of the Northeast, public organizations, political parties, university students and affected parties will be held in Vavuniya soon in Vavuniya.. We want everyone's rituals.

### India moves to implement controversial citizenship bill that excludes Muslims

India has announced rules that would allow it to implement a controversial citizenship bill that excludes Muslims.

The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs announced the rules Monday, ahead of India’s general election in the spring, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will seek a rare third term in power.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act provides a fast-track to citizenship for immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan – provided they are not Muslim. The controversial law would apply to religious minorities persecuted on religious grounds, including Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians.

The bill, originally passed by India’s parliament in 2019, could not come into effect until the rules were notified.

Despite being well-received by Modi, a Hindu nationalist, the bill was heavily protested by opposition parties, which claimed it was unconstitutional and marginalized India’s 200-million Muslim population.
