### Biden warns Netanyahu US policy depends on Gaza civilian protection

President Joe Biden warned Israel of a sharp shift in his policy over the Gaza war Thursday amid growing frustration with Benjamin Netanyahu and mounting domestic pressure in a US election year.

A tense phone call between the two leaders appeared to yield at least some results, as NetanyahuтАЩs office announced within hours it would temporarily allow more aid to flow into Gaza.

Biden has stood solidly behind Israel and its prime minister since HamasтАЩs October 7 attacks, and his criticism of civilian deaths in Gaza has not stopped Washington from supplying military hardware to its key ally.

But the Democrat faces spiraling anger from Muslim and younger voters over his support for Israel, and political allies have been pressing him to make the aid conditional on changed Israeli behavior.

In a 30-minute call with Netanyahu after Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers from US-based charity World Central Kitchen, Biden hinted at doing just that.

Meanwhile domestic container volumes were also picking up as the economy recovered from a currency crisis and tourism inflows boosted incomes of the people, driving more imports, despite foreign reserve collections.

Domestic containers surged 39 percent to 92,097 in February 2024, from 66,236 in February 2022.

Sri LankaтАЩs total container volumes in February were up 30.3 percent to 1,337,557 TEUS.

### Can the IMF program be renegotiated by a future government?

President Ranil Wickremesinghe chairs a meeting with the IMF in Colombo тАУ File photo

In my opinion, the IMF program Sri Lanka has got now is lenient when you compare it with many other countries. The 17th IMF program may not be enough even if implemented fully. Therefore, there is very little space to make changes in the broader program targets.

1.Achieve a primary budget surplus of 2.3% by 2025 and beyond

2.Bring annual foreign currency debt service from 9.4% of GDP in 2022 to 4.5% of GDP during 2027-2032. Reduce the governmentтАЩs gross financial needs which was at 35% of GDP in 2022 down to below 13% from 2027-2032.

3.Public debt, which was 128% to GDP, should be reduced to 95% by 2032.

If there were to be any renegotiations of the IMF deal by a future government, it will have to change one or all of the above. Let me go through them one by one.

The Presidential Media Division and the Daily News released press releases and media news items titled тАЬCountry set for rapid transformation into an export economyтАЭ quoting remarks made by you at the inauguration ceremony of a historic temple in Kegalle.

As a caring citizen I said, тАЬthree cheersтАЭ, happily thinking that at last, the country was on the correct governance path focusing on the creation of new strategic leadership options and policy changes to encourage present and new investors to produce tradable goods and engage in external services. I was delighted that the statement began with a reference that Sri Lanka can no longer continue to rely on borrowings (presumably external?) to address the imbalance between imports and exports, which if pursued will inevitably lead to another economic crisis within a decade.

Growth is the fundamental focal point behind any business decision. However, whether businesses achieve meaningful growth is the big question today. For the growth to be meaningful it has to come at a decreasing marginal cost. Meaningful growth happens only where businesses build with scalable DNA.

### Sustainability in business тАУ or corporate greenwash

тАШSustainтАЩ is derived from Latin and it means hold up or support. Its etymology suggests endurance without yielding; continuity without downfall. Sustainability, by extension, may well be the capability of sustaining, but in common speech and in commercial jargon it has become a vague and abused term, laying claim to a plethora of definitions. What then does sustainability mean, and what should it mean in business? What ought we sustain, and does sustenance suffice?

The need to address sustainability in business arose because irresponsibility in commerce and industry have led inter alia to scarcity of clean water, drain of natural resources, ill health of communities, strained employees and landfills of unsold produce тАУ not only when mistakes have occurred, but even when operating as designed and being economically profitable.

We all know that тАШconversationтАЩ might not be the most appropriate word to use in the context of a debate.

The April 1 attack by Israel on the Iranian consular office in the Syrian capital of Damascus, killing several people including a senior Revolutionary Guard general and diplomats, is a potential trigger for a regional war. Let the entire world suffer and let millions of people die in such a war, which will have a devastating effect on developing countries. Israel will not stop until it conquers the world.

This is not a dark prophecy. Israel is well on the path to achieving its ambitions. With the West, the Arab world, and one-time Non-Aligned Movement stars paying obeisance to Israel, the Zionist state believes it is special and above the law. It believes international human rights laws, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and myriad United Nations mechanisms for a rules-based world order are only for nations other than Israel.
