### Could you believe crabs killing giant guitarfish?

Guitarfish, also known as shovelnose rays, are a species of ray that are named because of their guitar-shaped bodies. They belong to the order Rhinopristiformes, along with the wedgefish and sawfish. This group are also called shark-like rays due to their flattened body with pectoral fins fused to the sides of the head and a hind body that resembles a shark, with two dorsal fins and a caudal fin.

The Rhinopristiformes exhibit slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity, like many other rays and sharks. Such characteristics, alone or in combination, make fishes in this group vulnerable to extinction. The global IUCN Red List of threatened species reveals that species in the order Rhinopristiformes are amongst the most threatened marine fishes and over 70% of guitarfish are either threatened or data deficient.

### The many faces of impunity

Such impunity is possible because an absolute majority of victims are the most discriminated against people in Sri Lanka: Upcountry Tamils

Ten years: that was how long three State institutions didn‚Äôt pay EPF and ETF monies to their retired and deceased employees.

Most victims of this act of criminal injustice suffered and died in silence. A few (about 2,000) filed court cases. The larger society, including the media, political parties and the labour movement, didn‚Äôt know, didn‚Äôt care.

This injustice happened in the only place it could have been perpetrated with legal, political, and societal impunity: the plantation sector. The culprits were the three State-owned plantation companies. The excuse was that these companies made losses. How many state-owned enterprises make profits? Do the loss-making ones (which include CEB, CPC, and Air Lanka) deny their employees EPF and ETF payments? What would happen if they even tried?

The 19th Amendment was not attended by Maithripala Sirisena's presidency at the time. He was released at 6 years. After five, he was able to stay 5 years old when I was five. Accordingly, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa becomes the President for five years.

### Constitutional Error may give Ranil and Parliament one more year-Eagle Next

*2024-06-11 17:25:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185846) ¬∑ `ta`

Ranil Wickremesinghe may extend his term and Parliament's lifespan by one year due to a constitutional loophole not addressed since the 19th Amendment in 2015 aimed at democratic reforms. Despite amendments reducing terms to five years, Article 83(D) allows him to extend it without parliamentary approval for extensions over six years, enabling an 11-month extension without constitutional violation. Political analysts suggest he deserves more time as the country isn't ready for elections.

üü©

Ranil Wickremesinghe has issued his term of office and the lifetime of parliament for a further year, according to the Emanami Next website said

Ranil Wickremesinghe may use a mistake of the political system that has not been paid since the 19th Amendment in 2015.

The 19th Amendment sought to ensure democratic reforms and to ensure the nation and reduce the term of the parliament and the president.

Although all the references to the six -year term of the Parliament and the President of the Parliament, in accordance with the 19th Amendment have been changed to five years, Article 83 (D) has given President Wickremesinghe to extend his tenure.

Any Bill to extend the five -year tenure of the President or Parliament must be approved by a two -thirds majority in Parliament.

However, under Section 83 (D), the universities are only needed if they are extended for more than six (6) years, not five (5) years

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì India and its Southern Tamil Nadu state should take strict actions against their fishermen who encroach into and involved in illegal fishing in Sri Lankan seas with the usage of banned bottom trawler methods, the island nation‚Äôs Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda said.

Sri Lanka has seen bottom trawling by Indian fishermen during the peak fishing season in Sri Lanka‚Äôs northern waters off Jaffna. Bottom trawling is banned by Sri Lanka and is a punishable offense, which has led to arrest of a raft of Indian fishermen along with their bottom trawlers.

Depletion of fish resources in the Northern sea in the face of continuous Indian bottom trawling, a method of banned fishing that involves dragging heavy weighted nets across the sea floor, has pushed some Northern fishermen to take up Chinese funded sea cucumber farming.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs North is just 27 km from the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
