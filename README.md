Attorneys' lawyers united by the Prime Minister's parliamentary speech that the Supreme Court's order on the Inspector General of Police Deshambanduthenkoon cannot be strengthened.

The lawyers' organization, which has recently pointed out that the government is following the tendency to deliberately refuse to adhere to the court's orders, has said that this is a barrier to the country's progress in all aspects.

President's Attorney Upul Jayasuriya said that if you are trying to use the powers of the post if they are trying to continue working as the Inspector General of Police, it is a contempt of court.

He has rejected some claiming that the High Court does not have the authority to issue an order against the resolution of the Constitutional Council.

### Chavakachcheri Hospital Saga: The Tip Of The Iceberg Of A Broken & Outdated Health System – Part II

*2024-07-27 02:25:13* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/chavakachcheri-hospital-saga-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-of-a-broken-outdated-health-system-part-ii/) · `en`

In Sri Lanka, 95% of physicians and staff are duty-conscious and have been doing their work diligently, even with the constrained environment and limited resources. However, the exiting system has been in place for over a century and the outdated concept with focus on centralized hospital-based health system is showing cracks.

In the 80s, I recall a cartoon in the Island newspaper captioned with the newspaper, stating “Sri Lanka has the best telecommunication system” -Minister of Telecommunication. The picture showed a man talking to himself looking at the phone: “I want to congratulate the minister, but this damn thing is out of order”

Now, about the health system in Sri Lanka, first thing comes to the news is that the Health Minister is in jail for corruption of illegal procurement. However, recently, it’s all about the misdeeds, competing behaviors and name calling with health care workers Strike En-Masse in Chavakacheri is the leading news.

### Democracy should be about ethics, morality and social values, not just regime changes

No doubt many are questioning the moral and ethical values of politicians in general and the limitless price they will pay to achieve their ultimate objective, power

Democracy today is the dominant principle and practice throughout the world to legitimate political power through the choices expressed by people and yet its relationship to moral and ethical values and traditions does not seem to be an integral part of democracies. Moral and ethical theories are universal theories, whether they are on account of religious faiths or otherwise as they based on basic human values of kindness, compassion, fraternity and a sense of the wellbeing of a community rather than the individual. This thinking appears to be in contradiction of how people think and act when it comes to what is generally understood and practiced as democracy

The Aragalayists were not a bunch of romantically attached revolutionaries representing any dead leader or outdated theories. Instead, they were eye witnesses to a system of governance which for decades promised one thing but delivered quite another

If there is one glaring failure of Sri Lanka’s 76 years of democratic experience, it is the failure to produce good governance. That was made clear when IMF, after reviewing the economy’s performance over the last two years and under its direction, stressed the importance of serious reforms in governance if the economy were to move forward and achieve sustainable growth. The reasons for bad governance are several to enumerate and discuss here, but they all stem from the one single root – the political preoccupation to subvert Sri Lanka’s democracy into a Sinhala Buddhist supremacist ethnocracy

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Ceylon Electricity Board can cut capital expenditure to make payments to power producer if required, after the regulator mandated a bigger price cut than was proposed, Fitch Ratings said.

The cut was bigger than was proposed by the CEB, Fitch said.

“The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka’s instruction on the 22.5% average tariff cut, made during the regulator’s quarterly tariff review, was larger than the 10% proposed by CEB,” Fitch said.

Coal prices have dropped 31 percent, over the past year, while hydro power in the generation mix had risen to 31 percent.

Assuming unchanged tariffs and costs for the rest of the year, Fitch said CEB’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin will narrow to about 11 percent in 2024, from the 26 percent in 2023 reported in its preliminary accounts.
