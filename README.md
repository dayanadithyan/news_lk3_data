A team of Indian and Sri Lankan scientists has found that the Vedda share a strong genetic similarity with the Austroasiatic Munda-speaking Santhal and Juang tribes in Odisha and the Dravidian-speaking Irula, Paniya and Pallar found in Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

Their study, published this week in the scientific journal Mitochondrion, has revealed that the Vedda have a greater genetic similarity with these five tribes than with either Sri Lanka’s Sinhalese or Tamil populations with whom they have shared the island for centuries.

China has written off an unspecified amount of Zimbabwe’s interest-free loans and pledged to help the Southern African country find a way out of its debt crisis, even as activists warned of a permanent debt trap.

Most of the foreign debt was purchased from China, as the country is ineligible for loans from multilateral creditors such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after defaulting on repayments since the turn of the millennium.

Since the fall of long-time ruler Robert Mugabe six years ago, Zimbabwe has been struggling to reach an agreement with creditors to restructure its unsustainable debt.

Although their  contention to justify a showdown between the Presidential candidates of  the two parties seems to be logical, a veiled hesitancy on their part in  meeting the SJB Economic Committee could also be sensed.

Despite the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the Jathika Jana Balawegaya (National People’s Power –NPP) having been throwing challenges at each other for a debate over the economic recovery of the country, they seem to have their apprehensions as well in meeting the challenge.

In April 2022 our country was declared bankrupt. We were unable to import basic needs such as food, fuel, cooking gas, medicines and other necessities. A sudden ban on the import of petroleum-based fertiliser nearly killed some of our main export crops such as tea, rubber and coconut. Soon shop shelves ran empty. Long queues formed around fuel depots. Amid the turmoil, the executive president fled the country.

A situation of anarchy was eased with the election of President Wickremesinghe to the presidency by Parliament. Wickremesinghe was able to steady the ship and prevent the country from sliding into anarchy.

Today, for the first time in three years gross official reserves crossed the US$4 billion mark at end of December 2023.

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said his soul was praying for peace.

The founder of the late Sarvodaya. D. He said the above when he went to pay tribute to Aryaratne's funeral.

The late Aryaratna is the best social service task. For some time Ranasinghe made a huge contribution to the Gum Udawa Project with Premadasa. The disappearance of a man who has carried out pure social welfare is an unbearable loss to our country and the people. His Sarvodaya Movement is still a great service to the people of our country.

### Energy is people’s property; time to claim our share

If I made this statement even a few short years ago, I would have been labelled insane.  The ground reality at that time would have clearly supported that view, at least to the extent of our claiming our share.  But much has changed in those years, particularly for Sri Lanka, when no one would now dare claim that any fossil fuel-based energy generation, the playing field of a chosen few, is cheaper than renewable energy. This most encouraging change has much more far-reaching implications, in that the basic resources available are natural renewable resources such as sunshine, wind, water on one hand and no one can claim ownership of these resources and the technologies of converting these to electricity are now economically feasible at much smaller scale. Of particular interest are the solar energy technologies, which has now made it possible for electricity consumers to become “Prosumers”.

### The 2019 Easter Tragedy: The 5th year of callousness

The People in Sri Lanka continue to be deeply unhappy and distraught in terms of investigations into the worst act of terrorism in contemporary times in Sri Lanka. The Easter Bombings 2019.

Five years is upon us this Easter and the nation sadly is none the wiser.

Meanwhile the suffering of those who were maimed and injured in varying degrees, has continued unabated.

A book by the former President also alludes to disagreements and disillusionment amongst senior military officials in other matters, begging the question if this disillusionment is a manufactured version to create space between these officials and their one time colleague and Boss.

The President at the time of the Easter Tragedy has awoken from a presumably manufactured slumber and has claimed to have knowledge of the Mastermind/s behind this attack which is beyond sinister. His shameful attempt to make light of this very tragic tragedy is not only shameful but reaches to new depths of depravity.

### Go East(er)! – A look back to 21/4 and hearkening at what lies ahead

*2024-04-19 23:05:01* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Go-East-er-A-look-back-to-21-4-and-hearkening-at-what-lies-ahead/4-760810) · `en`

As April showed this year, Easter – together with Eid and Aluth Avurudu – can be entertained in ecumenical hearts,

without breaching the undivided peace that prevailed in the hearts of most people of an island race keen to live in harmony

Sri Lanka is no stranger to hostiles with big black backpacks brimming with explosives, literally and metaphorically.

A protracted conflict between insular tribes, stoked by ethno-nationalism and egged on by war profiteers, taught us to expect sudden or strategic violence in public places and contested spaces.

The tsunami of 2004 took a sleeping island by surprise in their homes. But being used to ‘nature red in tooth and claw’, the wound was more readily assimilated than death blows delivered by neighbours in 1983.

That, and humanity’s inhumanity to humankind, combined to make the Easter Sunday bombings of April 2019 arguably the single explosive event with the farthest-reaching ramifications of our times.

*2024-04-19 23:02:38* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Paris-A-Moveable-Feast/4-760809) · `en`

One of the most enchanting books I have read in recent times has to be “A Moveable Feast” by the celebrated American writer Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961). The book eludes easy categorisation, although it could be broadly considered a memoire of a period of his early life, when he lived in Paris (from 1921 to 1926). Hemingway had kept notes of his Paris days, getting down to writing A Movable Feast only in the last years of his life, in 1957 to be exact.

Colombo, April 19 - The United National Party (UNP) which is led by incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe today urged the Sri Lankan people not to get deceived by National Peoples Power (NPP) and Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith.

UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara made these remarks while making a special statement in reference to to the meeting which a group of NPP members had with Cardinal Ranjith on Thursday. Range Bandara questioned as to whether Cardinal is out to vouch support for NPP the same way he did for former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019.

Some 272 people were killed in the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019. This should be remembered with condemnation. Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith had confessed after a few years that he had stood for former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa during the 2019 presidential election.
