The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) in a letter to the Attorney General this week has stressed that it is imperative that an independent and impartial criminal investigation be launched into the alleged enforced disappearance of Gonapinuwala Kapila Kumara De Silva, a resident of Horowpathana, Anuradhapura in March 2024.

The HRCSL urged the Attorney General to review the evidence and allegations and decide whether a separate criminal inquiry should be initiated by the Sri Lanka Police under the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Act, based on the Attorney General’s counsel.

The HRCSL observed that De Silva was reported missing on 27 March 2024. According to De Silva’s account, he was allegedly abducted by a group in civilian attire in a white van who identified themselves as law enforcement officers.

### International transitional justice scholars call on SL to halt establishing truth commission

*2024-05-16 03:21:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/International-transitional-justice-scholars-call-on-SL-to-halt-establishing-truth-commission/56-761859) · `en`

Over 70 international transitional justice and human rights scholars have urged the Sri Lankan Government to halt the establishment of a Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation (CTUR) as it has been rejected by victim groups and the broader national context is not conducive for such a process.

The statement signed by leading authors and researchers of transitional justice from across the world also highlights concerns over the Government’s lack of political commitment towards genuine truth-seeking that could lead to justice and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.

The statement said it recognises the right to truth as a key human right affirmed in UN treaties and other mechanisms and asserts that if conducted properly a truth-seeking process can contribute towards establishing the extent and the patterns of past violations, as well as their causes and consequences. In so doing, it can help reconcile deeply divided communities and help bring closure to victim-survivors, it said.

Former Speaker and National Movement for Social Justice Chairperson Karu Jayasuriya voiced his profound regret yesterday over the Police’s handling of the porridge distribution event in Sampur commemorating the victims of the war and enforced disappearances.

In a statement, Jayasuriya said the society must empathetically acknowledge the anguish of those who have lost loved ones to death or disappearance. “It is our collective responsibility to prevent such tragedies from plunging our country into another dark era,” he said.

“Therefore, it is imperative for the entire society, including Government authorities, to act in these situations with the best interests of the country at heart. Failure to do so could potentially lead our nation into a dark age,” remarked the former speaker.

Freedom People’s Congress (FPC) member MP Prof. Charitha Herath on Tuesday emphasised the importance of prioritising the Presidential Election over Parliamentary Polls, urging the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) to focus on this goal. Speaking at a press conference held at the party headquarters, Herath highlighted the constitutional mandate to hold the Presidential Election in a timely manner.

He noted that while dissolving parliament and conducting a general election are separate processes, there have been instances of delays in convening parliament after dissolution, leading to delayed general elections. Given this context, Herath stressed the need to prioritise the Presidential Election, which is mandated by the constitution.

### Joining BRICS opens new possibilities for Sri Lanka

*2024-05-16 01:59:52* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Joining-BRICS-opens-new-possibilities-for-Sri-Lanka/14-761845) · `en`

Recently, the Ambassador of the Republic of Sri Lanka in Moscow, Janita Liyanage, told reporters about her country’s desire to join BRICS in the near future. The Government expects that this will have a positive effect on the economy and lead to a significant increase in the standard of living of ordinary citizens, since it will not only allow the country to conduct duty-free trade with the member states of the bloc, but also provide an opportunity to receive financial support necessary to solve Sri Lanka’s problems from large BRICS regional development funds.

Considering that the total share of GDP of the bloc is 37% of the global total, all this might give a good impetus to the development of the island.

### Telecom Act amendments don’t address the future: Are they at least fixing flaws from the past?

The country is changing. Apartments and condominiums are popping up everywhere. Technology and markets are changing. Navigating the streets without Google maps seems unthinkable. Data consumed in a month 25 years ago is now consumed in a few hours.

The world is changing. Stories about vehicles that are communicating our braking patterns back to the manufacturer and insurance companies do not seem like science fiction, though we know our cars (and our insurance companies) are not like that, yet.

The future is already here; it’s just not very evenly distributed, as William Gibson, the writer, says. Are our laws ready for the future? Are they at least adequate for the present?

### Sri Lanka’s amended Telecommunications Bill should be sent back to the drawing board

*2024-05-16 00:37:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-amended-Telecommunications-Bill-should-be-sent-back-to-the-drawing-board/4-761832) · `en`

It is critical that the Government puts a stop to its conservative and traditional approach to telecoms regulation and handles it in a way that will ensure that digital connectivity spurs the development of the nation

Sri Lanka’s Telecommunications Act first came into force in 1991. It was subsequently amended in 1996. There have been no further amendments or revisions to the Act since then, although there have been several (but failed) attempts to update this legacy Act over the years. An amended Bill has now been sent to Parliament for consideration and is expected to be debated by the country’s lawmakers in the next few weeks.

One would think that the legislation governing one of the most dynamic and critical sectors should have kept up with the times, but here we are 28 years later, attempting to maintain a historical artefact and supplement it with piecemeal amendments, in the hope that this will help sustain digital development for the next decade and more.

### Stolen Assets Recovery Framework: There is much room for improvement

*2024-05-16 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Stolen-Assets-Recovery-Framework-There-is-much-room-for-improvement/172-282665) · `en`

The rallying call for recovering stolen assets during the 2022 protests is still fresh in our minds. If the Abacha loot could be returned to Nigeria by Switzerland, could Sri Lanka not do the same?

In response to the protests and building on the work done by experts over many years, the agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and the IMF now contains a structural benchmark where the GoSL has committed to enact a Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) in keeping with international standards by April 2024.

In March 2023, the Minister of Justice appointed a committee chaired by Supreme Court Justice Yasantha Kodagoda. Dated April 10, 2024, the182-page report of the POCA Committee, now available on the website of the Ministry of Justice, sets out a framework for an upcoming Proceeds of Crime Act.

The current framework is a good start with room for improvement

### Family is the first essential cell of human society

Families stay together if they regularly pray or meditate together. This is a hallowed philosophy that goes a long way to show that good families make good societies and countries. We need to see unity in diversity in families with none dominating or having his/her way. Family members need to be sacrificial and forgiving, embodying values of love, peace, joy, patience, kindness, humility, gentleness and meekness. Some believe the husband is the head of the family and must take the final decision on important issues, but this has been proven to be wrong. The right way is a collective decision by the husband, wife and grown up children. If all family members have an attitude of foot-washing service to others, it will set a good example to the neighbourhood and provide a solid base for the country of good citizens who are concerned not only about themselves, but about the future of the country and the future generations.

### Change, not continuity is imperative for consensus, stability and recovery

*2024-05-15 23:43:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Change-not-continuity-is-imperative-for-consensus-stability-and-recovery/4-761831) · `en`

Basil Rajapaksa’s idea of a snap Parliamentary election proceeds from the ruling party’s viewpoint that it has a better chance of survival while its partner Ranil holds office and controls the administration.

There is no guarantee though, that if and when that Parliamentary election is held, Ranil won’t tell the country “Ok, now you’ve had your election for this year”, and press ‘pause’ on the scheduled Presidential election.

That is almost exactly what happened in 1982. We had one national election but not the other. The Presidential election was in October 1982, and JR Jayewardene won. The Parliamentary election was scheduled for early 1983, but a Referendum was held instead in December 1982 which the UNP coercively and fraudulently won, and the Parliamentary election was postponed. That lit the fuse that led to Black July 1983, two civil wars (North and South), and foreign military intervention.

A High Court in Pakistan on Wednesday granted bail to Imran Khan in the 190 million pounds corruption case, in which the jailed former prime minister and his wife are accused of receiving land worth billions of rupees as a bribe from a real estate tycoon.

A two-member bench of the Islamabad High Court had reserved the verdict on Tuesday after the completion of arguments.

On Wednesday, the court asked Khan to submit a surety bond of Rs 1 million in order to secure bail. However, the order will not result in the ex-premier’s release from Adiala jail since his sentences in the Iddat and cypher cases are yet to be suspended.

In December last year, the National Accountability Bureau initiated an investigation against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, and others in a case of alleged acquisition of hundreds of canals of land under the name of Al Qadir University Trust, resulting in a reported loss of 190 million pounds to the exchequer.

“Since there is a need to go to those places to collect the rice, if any party is fraudulently obtaining Aswesuma benefits, they may not have come forward to get it for fear of revealing their identity,” Shehan Semasinghe said in a statement.

Free rice was given to the poorest families in the country, which include Aswesuma beneficiaries, in April.

Semasinghe said the government has called for a report on the people who are currently receiving Aswesuma benefits but did not come to get free rice. The relevant report is being prepared by the Development Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance.

The minister said that he will receive the report by next week.
