### Sri Lanka BOP surplus to June 2024 running slightly behind last year

ECONONYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s balance of payments is still strongly in surplus in 2024 under the current interest rate structure, but is running slightly behind 2023, official data show.

Sri Lanka had recorded a BOP surplus (as defined) of 1,761 million US dollars by June 2024, down from 1,957.6 million dollars a year earlier.

Broadly, the BOP surplus is an improvement in net international reserves, and is a reliable figure unlike numbers like ‘current account’ balances which can be subject to large errors.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has run deflationary policy to collect reserves.

Under IMF programs, a central bank is able to collect reserves soon after hiking rates and contracting domestic credit, but misses reserve targets as the economy recovers and a narrow call money rate is targeted with excess liquidity on mathematical formulae (real interest rates or growth), critics have said.

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has issued a directive to return government property if it is being misused.

In a statement, the commission said it has received numerous complaints that immovable and movable properties provided by the government to individuals holding official positions were being used unlawfully even after those positions had been vacated.

As a result, the relevant authorities are instructed to take immediate steps to reclaim such properties.

The CIABOC has issued this notice to Ministry Secretaries, Provincial Chief Secretaries, Heads of Local Government Bodies, Department Heads, District Secretaries, and the Heads of Statutory Bodies affiliated with the government.

According to Sections 41 and 111 of the Anti-Corruption Act, failing to return such property to the government is a punishable offence under the law, it warned.
