ආදුරුප්පුවීදිය පොලීසිය තුළදී සැකකරුවන් දෙදෙනෙකුට වස ලබාදුන් පුද්ගලයාව පොලිසිය හඳුනාගෙන තිබේ.

ජින්තුපිටිය ප්‍රදේශයේදී පසුගියදා සිදුවූ වෙඩි තැබීමක් සම්බන්ධයෙන් අත්අඩංගුවට ගෙන ආදුරුප්පුවීදිය පොලිස් සිර මැදිරියේ රඳවා සිටියදී ඔවුන්ට වස ලබාදී තිබුණේ ඔවුන්ගේ සුවදුක් විමසීමට පැමිණි පුද්ගලයෙකු විසිනි.

එම පුද්ගලයා පොලීසියට පැමිණීමට පෙර ආදුරුප්පුවීදියේ වෙළෙඳසැලකට යන අයුරු එහි CCTV කැමරාවක සටහන්ව තිබුණි.

පොලීසිය සඳහන් කළේ සැකකරු අධික ලෙස මත්ද්‍රව්‍යයට ඇබ්බැහි වූවකු බවය.

එමෙන්ම ඔහු විසින් වස ලබාදුන් සැකකරුවන් දෙදෙනා මෙන්ම ඔහුද පූකුඩු කන්නා නම් අපරාධකරුගේ සමීපතමයන් බවද පොලීසිය පවසයි.

කුඩු සෙල්විගේ පාර්ශ්වයේ සමීපතමයෙකුට ඔවුන් වෙඩි තැබීමට කටයුතු කර තිබුණේද ඒ සමීප සබඳතාව හේතුවෙනි.

ඒ අනුව කුඩු සෙල්විගේ පාර්ශ්වය විසින් මෙම පුද්ගලයාට මුදල් ලබාදී අපරාධය සැලසුම් කර ඇති බවට පොලීසිය සැකකරයි.

වස පානය කිරීම හේතුවෙන් රෝහල් ගතකළ පුද්ගලයන් දෙදෙනාගේ තත්ත්වය ද බරපතල බව වාර්තාවෙයි.

COLOMBO (News 1st); In a significant development today, the opposition leader raised concerns over the Online Safety Act, pointing out nine clauses that are allegedly not in line with the determination given by the Supreme Court.

Despite these concerns, Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa maintained a firm stance, stating that no part of the passed Act can be altered.

A heated exchange erupted in the Sri Lankan Parliament today between Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena over the passing of the Online Safety Bill, which critics say violates Supreme Court rulings and disregards judicial guidance.

Premadasa accused the government of ignoring the court's recommendations on several key clauses of the bill, including those pertaining to revoking internet access and addressing contempt of court. He highlighted the court's emphasis on the need for due process and magisterial oversight, both of which he claims are absent in the current legislation.

The “right to disconnect” is part of a raft of changes to industrial relations laws proposed by the federal government under a parliamentary bill introduced in parliament. The bill was passed in the Senate on Thursday but will need to go back to the House of Representatives to vote to approve some amendments.

“I think it’s a wonderful idea,” said Sydney resident Colvin Macpherson.

“We all need to relax, we all need to be able to switch off and not be disturbed by emails and phone calls in the middle of the night. Both of my kids are lawyers as well, so they work horrendous hours as it is and you get things coming in at night time,” he said.

In the wake of that attack, Kataib Hezbollah said it was suspending attacks on American troops to prevent “embarrassment” to the Iraqi government.

It was a precise strike on a moving vehicle in a busy street and the car was reduced to a fiery wreck.

One of the victims has been identified as Abu Baqir al-Saadi, a senior commander in Kataib Hezbollah.

COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka currently has the highest electricity charges in South Asia, with households paying 2.5 to 3 times more for electricity than the average price paid by households in other South Asian countries, according to analysis that was published this week.

Published on PublicFinance.lk, Sri Lanka’s premier economic insights platform, this analysis by Verité Research looked at what households are charged for their electricity when consuming 100, 200 or 300 units, at the start of 2024.

The calculation only took into account the charges of the supplier, and did not include government taxes such as the Social Security Levy, which is charged additionally in Sri Lanka.

The second highest household electricity charges in the region are in Pakistan; yet they are far less than in Sri Lanka. Households consuming 100 units are charged 50% more in Sri Lanka than Pakistan; and those consuming 300 units are charged 97% more in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka is hopeful of making progress by next month on two delayed wind energy projects to be built by India’s Adani Green Energy Ltd, its energy minister said on Wednesday.

The cash-strapped south Asian island nation, which has suffered from crippling power blackouts and fuel shortages, has been trying to speed green power generation to hedge against surges in imported fuel costs, but the wind projects are still being evaluated because of disputes over pricing and plant efficiency.

“Maybe in the next four weeks, we will see some results on the negotiation process, and there is another negotiation for the transmission lines that is also being evaluated,” Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the India Energy Week event in Goa.

“Both are (happening) simultaneously, so I am hopeful that by March, we will have something,” he said.

The growing prospect of the return of Donald Trump to the White House despite the weaponized Department of Justice (DOJ) orchestrating a plethora of court cases against him has unnerved the establishment in Washington, D.C., afraid that he will ‘drain the swamp’. The moguls controlling the media in cahoots with those in the Democratic Party who are calling the shots in the White House in the context of a cognitively impaired Joe Biden have gone on overdrive to demonize Trump. Quite often Biden is literally not aware of his surroundings or what he is saying.

### Pope hits back at critics of blessings for same-sex couples

*2024-02-08 12:31:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Pope-hits-back-at-critics-of-blessings-for-same-sex-couples/108-276594) · `en`

Feb 8 (CNN) - Pope Francis has hit back at those criticizing his decision to allow blessings for same-sex couples, saying the critics are guilty of hypocrisy.

“No one is scandalized if I give a blessing to an entrepreneur who perhaps exploits people: and that is a most serious sin,” the Pope said in an interview in the latest edition of Italian magazine Credere, to be published on Thursday, February 8.

“Whereas they are scandalized if I give it to a homosexual… This is hypocrisy! We all have to respect each other. Everyone! The heart of the document is welcome.”

Last year, the 87-year-old Pontiff authorized priests to offer informal blessings of couples in “irregular” unions in a landmark document issued on December 18, 2023. It is the first time the Vatican has allowed for such blessings, having previously forbidden any such move.
