### SOERU and insulation it provides against bad privatisations

*2024-07-25 03:49:02* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/SOERU-and-insulation-it-provides-against-bad-privatisations/14-764710) ¬∑ `en`

For decades, Sri Lanka‚Äôs SOEs have been plagued by inefficiency, corruption, and a lack of transparency. Apart from the burden on the public purse, the consequences for citizens have included substandard medicines to exploding gas cylinders. Over the past 20 years vested interests have mushroomed around SOEs.

The opposition to privatisation in Sri Lanka stems from a mixture of ideology and vested interests. On the ideological front, there‚Äôs a lingering sentiment, rooted in post-independence nationalism, that views state ownership as a bulwark against foreign exploitation. This perspective sees SOEs not just as economic entities, but as symbols of national sovereignty and social welfare, regardless of how well these entities actually serve the purpose for which they were set up.

The continuing lack of a political leadership in the Sinhala South that accepts the Tamil and Muslim people as equals and as citizens with equal rights and dignity, is what denies a decent political solution to the TNQ

The Sinhala South and its leaders cannot for a moment leave all responsibility with Tamil leaders for all these sectarian and extremist developments that make solutions more and more difficult. Political leaders in Sinhala South even now avoid discussing political answers to post-war issues in North-East and for their long-standing issue of sharing political power. Everything belted out on Southern Sinhala political platforms are issues for Sinhala-Buddhist consumption, no different to Sinhala-Buddhist politics of Black July, 41 years ago. No political leader in the South can be heard here in the South saying his or her political party would negotiate power sharing for Sri Lanka with Tamil and Muslim political parties

Successive regimes unsuccessfully tried to bury what happened during the war¬†‚Äì Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

A reconciled society respects and champions the rights of all citizens. Identifying issues that need to be addressed when working towards reconciliation becomes crucial. Achieving a just, equitable society requires equal life opportunities for all, regardless of anyone‚Äôs background.Effective reconciliation demands enlightened leaders addressing past crimes and rights violations. It transcends political classes, requiring genuine commitment

In Sri Lanka, fear is pervasive. Suppression of media and fundamental rights of people and repression of human rights defenders foster a climate of fear, silencing victims, and inhibiting reconciliation. Political and criminal interests threaten the justice system, putting lives at risk for exposing the truth.

Meet the jackfruit, a tropical treasure poised to revolutionise the global food industry.

Native to Southeast Asia and boasting the title of the largest tree-borne fruit on Earth, jackfruit has transcended its Sri Lankan roots to become a global culinary sensation. Introduced to Sri Lanka by Arthur V. Dias, during the British colonial era, when rice scarcity threatened starvation, the jackfruit emerged as a crucial source of sustenance, with its rich carbohydrates and natural fats providing much-needed energy. This lifesaving role later earned the title ‚ÄúRice Tree‚Äù.

In this backdrop, the High Court recently issued an interim injunction against the Gazette, which conducted a second hearing of the Gazette case on a daily salary gazette case issued by the Ministry of Labor.

It was only after I saw thousands of Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãwho lost their homes as an unexpected violence that had been unleashed on the morning of Monday 25th, and I decided to record the events in the quarter.

Many people lost their loved ones, and many were killed by Sinhalese.

I begin this diary with the firm belief that someday the people who call themselves Sinhalese Buddhists can someday be carried to the civilized world or somebody.

I am going to inform you about the things that took place at this camp and my personal experiences before sheltering at the Ratmalana Airport.

I am going to share their experiences with other refugees in this camp.

To this day we have regret that our political issues have been resolved to this day, as they are born in the North East and have been very badly met with the oppression of the North East.

Today, the Tamil people were killed in the capital of 1983, especially in 1983, without any science.

How many thousands of murders, violence and disappearance have been committed against the Tamil people.

At this time, how many parties from the South are coming north, they will say something about what they are going to give to the Tamil people, and they will say something else in the South.

There, Sinhala politicians continue to adhere to racism and the tactic for voting here.
