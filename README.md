### Gota‚Äôs flight cum resignation in 2022 and ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù book in 2024

The book was merely a banal repetition of a conspiracy theory without substantive proof to bolster it

The mountains have laboured and brought forth a mouse! Former Sri Lankan President Nandasena Gotabaya Rajapaksa has after many poya days reportedly authored a book. The political grapevine had been buzzing for several months that a book by the ex-president known popularly as Gota and Gotabaya was in progress. It was supposedly a bombshell book with explosive revelations. The book belied such expectations. It was a

Gotabaya Rajapaksa released a statement on 6 March that his book will be launched on 7 March 2024. He also posted on X as follows ‚Äì ‚ÄúMy book ‚ÄòThe Conspiracy to oust me from the Presidency‚Äô will be available in English and Sinhala at leading bookstores from tomorrow, Thursday, March 7th, 2024.

### APAC economies and commodity exporters most exposed to China stress scenario: Fitch

*2024-03-13 03:57:52* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/APAC-economies-and-commodity-exporters-most-exposed-to-China-stress-scenario-Fitch/14-759429) ¬∑ `en`

Fitch Ratings believes that economies in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) and commodity exporters would be particularly affected under a severe downside stress scenario in China. There would also be a dampening effect on international price pressures.

Fitch‚Äôs analysis released last week, based on internal modelling using the Oxford Economics Global Economic Model, sees vulnerabilities in Vietnam, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, through their strong economic linkages with China.

It also suggests Middle Eastern energy exporters, such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar and Oman, would see slower real GDP growth. However, this does not capture factors such as Qatar‚Äôs long-term LNG supply contracts, which we think should make its exports less sensitive to short-term shifts in Chinese demand, limiting the hit to its GDP.

According to the constitution, the president has the power to dissolve the parliament and hold the general election. The party is strong as the party.

A party of the ruling party refers to their personal position as Ranil Wickremesinghe, the presidential candidate of Sri Lanka PA. The problem is how fair it is to refer to a personal position within the party.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe is not the presidential candidate of the Sri Lanka Peoples Alliance, and no talks have been held at the top level of the party as presidential candidate. He is the leader of the United National Party.

The president's carrying out the United National Party (UNP) at the United National Party (UNP) at Kurunegala last Sunday.

Douglas Devananda proposes a "Marine Scout Brigade" to monitor and protect Indian fisheries in the North, addressing illegal fishing activities by Indian fishermen.

üü©

Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda has said that a Cabinet paper has been submitted to create a volunteer organization "Marine Scouts:" to monitor the safety of the North.

The Marines are carrying out their duties as much as possible in the northern seas to control the violation of Indian fishermen.

However, our marine resources and our fishermen's fisheries equipment are being illegally destroyed by Indian fishermen entering our waters.

In this case, I have submitted the idea of another attempt to carry out the maritime surveillance.

It is worth noting that I think I can create a voluntary organization called the Marine Scout Organization to monitor the activities of the Indian fishermen and control the activities of the Indian fishermen.

Our Health Ministry, according to a recent report in the ‚ÄòDaily Mirror‚Äô has rejected out-of-hand a report published in the prestigious British ‚ÄòLancet‚Äô magazine concerning child malnutrition and underweight young girls in our country.

If the matter was not so sad and serious, the denial of the Ministry Secretary would be funny.

Over 2.9 million children need humanitarian assistance to access lifesaving nutrition, health, education, water and sanitation, protection, and social protection services.

### Russian economy grows despite sanctions- study

Of the two countries that at each other‚Äôs throats now - Russia and Ukraine - it is Ukraine which appears to be the underdog despite massive American and Western arms aid.

While the Russian economy is growing despite severe US and European sanctions, Ukraine is facing a major arms and manpower shortage with dim chances of being rectified.

Given the possibility of Donald Trump returning to power in the US, even the current level of Western support to Ukraine may not be forthcoming. And unlike Russia, Ukraine has no indigenous capability to sustain itself, whether economically or militarily.

On the other contrary, Russia, has been able to circumvent the sanctions and keep its economy humming, according the Vienna Institute of International Economic Studies (VIIEC). And there has also been no let-up in its military efforts.

### NPP support surge linked to opposition weakness

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror) - The surge in the support for the National People's Power (NPP) led by Anura Kumara Dissanayaka can be attributed to the weakness of the Opposition, Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said.

The primary opposition should be prepared to assume governance. However, this opposition prepared prematurely.

Therefore, the emergence of a third party became prominent as uncertainty loomed over the effectiveness of the opposition.

As a result, the main opposition's only course of action may be to collaborate with the ruling party. If they choose not to unite without careful consideration, several key leaders from the main opposition may opt to join the government.

However, the selection of the common opposition or the President will be made by the Members of Parliament based on their personal opinions, but there is no relevance to being in the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or any other political party.

Increased malnutrition of baby and mothers in this country. According to a survey conducted in 2022, 25% of children aged 5-18 are lessweight children. Many such statistics show that nutritional deficiency is increasing and that mothers and children become a group of nutritional deficiency.

The Opposition Leader said that the United People's Power will meet representatives of the International Monetary Fund in the next few days and the International Monetary Fund's Special Cooperation Program is needed to address the malnutrition of mothers, infants, children and school children in the country.

The International Monetary Fund is the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the establishment of a special fund and the need for a special national program to get out of this nonsense.. The development of nutritional deficiency is equivalent to forming an evil cycle. The opposition leader added that this has a negative impact on the country's productivity.

It certainly is not going to be fiction or an irresponsible bed time story.

üü©

Sivaguru Adheena Chief Minister Velan Swamis has called for the rise of the people in the Northeast to achieve justice.

He made this comment after a court verdict of Vavuniya on Tuesday (12) to visit the Vidunarimalai case.

Sri Lankan police pass through. The court has been reported to the court falsely without any legitimate reasons for the arrest.

The arrested people are suffering from uniform food. Words do not come when their relatives look at the film. In this situation, we need to unite a people's uprising in the North and East as soon as possible. It has been proven that we can uphold justice.

Therefore, all the relations of the Northeast, public organizations, political parties, university students and affected parties will be held in Vavuniya soon in Vavuniya.. We want everyone's rituals.
