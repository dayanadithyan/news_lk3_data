### Vallibel One rebuts anonymous message circulated on social media

*2024-08-02 06:20:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/Vallibel-One-rebuts-anonymous-message-circulated-on-social-media/34-765055) · `en`

Vallibel One PLC yesterday issued a statement to the Colombo Stock Exchange refuting the anonymous, yet adverse message circulated on social media.

Our attention has been drawn to an anonymous message which is being circulated on social media under the caption “Vallibel One’s Rs. 163 billion Conundrum: A financial Thriller Unfolds Amidst Political Ambitions”.

We regret to note that the message appears to have been published with mischievous intent. The author of the publication, resorting to verbiage and a blatant distortion of facts has twisted a prudent application of policies by the company to cast sinister aspersions on the ultimate majority shareholder of the company, for political purposes. The circulated message states that the company is faced with a serious crisis referring to a “Rs. 163 billion set aside for expected credit losses”, which is manifestly false. In fact, the figure, Rs. 163 billion represents the Net amount of Loans and Advances of the Group.

The public are getting ready for the mega entertainment without properly understanding impact/implications their vote may lead to the future of this nation.

The evolving economic ties between India and Sri Lanka present significant opportunities for growth and collaboration

Sri Lanka’s recent economic turmoil and recovery efforts present a complex narrative marked by internal challenges and external macroeconomic shocks. The economic crisis disrupted the financial landscape, leading to significant international involvement, mainly through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and strategic partnerships with neighbouring countries like India.

India’s participation in Sri Lanka’s recovery process underscores its economic and strategic interests in the island nation. As the first bilateral creditor to provide financial assurances to the IMF, India was crucial in facilitating Sri Lanka’s bailout program. This financial support, totalling around $ 4 billion, included multiple credit lines and currency support, highlighting India’s commitment to regional stability amid Sri Lanka’s economic downturn.
