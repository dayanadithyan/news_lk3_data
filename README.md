### Tamils in the presidential election must prove democratic strength - Sabah Kukadas

*2024-04-10 15:50:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180868) ¬∑ `ta`

Sabah Kukadas emphasizes the need for Tamils to demonstrate democratic strength in the presidential election, highlighting the importance of unity and strategic decision-making to avoid chauvinism leading to racism.

üü©

Relo's leadership committee member Saba Kukadas said that after the war silence, the people's basic aspirations were not revealed for 15 years after the war.

It is not easy to make a conclusion in other elections.

In the past, the presidential elections have not been racially advantageous but they must unite in the aftermath of the war, but it is imperative that all political parties and civil organizations in the Tamil homeland must unite in the same site to implement this.

The decisions of Tamils must be tactically beyond criticism that chauvinism can turn communalism into racism.

Whatever the decisions of the Tamils in the past, the South has turned it into communalism, for example, the separatism is the reality of separatism.

It is therefore stated that the aspirations of the ethnicity will be made in the international arena and the political liberation of the Tamil people in the international arena and the global regional conversation of the global regional countries.

British physicist Peter Higgs, whose theory of a mass-giving particle ‚Äì the so-called Higgs boson ‚Äì jointly earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics, has died aged 94, the University of Edinburgh announced on Tuesday.

‚ÄúHe passed away peacefully at home on Monday 8 April following a short illness,‚Äù the Scottish university, where he had been a professor for nearly five decades, said in a statement.

It called him ‚Äúa great teacher and mentor, inspiring generations of young scientists‚Äù.

‚ÄúHis family has asked that the media and public respect their privacy at this time,‚Äù the university added.

Higgs used ground-breaking theoretical work to help explain how the Universe has mass, thus resolving one of the greatest puzzles in physics and earning him a place alongside Albert Einstein and Max Planck in textbooks.

His 1964 theory of a mass-giving particle, which became known as the Higgs boson or the ‚ÄúGod particle‚Äù, won him and Belgian physicist Francois Englert the 2013 physics Nobel Prize.
