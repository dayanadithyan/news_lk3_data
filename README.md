The Election Commission emphasizes that false information is circulating alleging that the voters registered in the voter’s list will be facilitated to cast their vote at any polling station in the island.

Additionally, postal voters retain the option to cast their vote in the presence of their Certifying Officer, providing a measure of convenience for those unable to visit their designated polling station, the statement added.

In preparation for the upcoming election, the Commission will send official ballot notices to registered voters. These notices will include the voter’s name, the address of the polling station where they are eligible to vote, and detailed voting instructions, the commission said.

To continue where I left last week, Kamala Harris is till riding high, and Donald Trump is finally being exposed for his crass limitations. But with 94 days to go there is plenty of time left for twists and turns, and ups and downs.

### Monster assembled from human flaws? Frankenstein would make a Trump

*2024-08-05 10:57:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/monster-assembled-from-human-flaws-frankenstein-would-make-a-trump/) · `en`

Someone asked “Why do some British people not like Donald Trump?” Nate White, an articulate and witty writer from England wrote the following response:A few things spring to mind. Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace – all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.

So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump’s limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.

Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing – not once, ever.

I don’t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility – for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.

At least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes in Bangladesh on Sunday as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse tens of thousands of protesters calling for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign.

The death toll, which includes at least 13 policemen, was the highest for a single day from any protests in Bangladesh’s recent history, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on July 19 when students took to the streets to demand the scrapping of quotas for government jobs.

The government declared an indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Sunday, the first time it has taken such a step during the current protests that began last month. It also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday.

The unrest, which has prompted the government to shut down internet services, is Hasina’s biggest test in her 20-year regime after she won a fourth straight term in elections that were boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

### Election Commission Action: Read carefully

*2024-08-05 10:03:00* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/தேர்தல்-ஆணைக்குழு-அதிரடி-கவனமாக-வாசியுங்கள்/175-341608) · `ta`

The Election Commission warns against false reports about voting procedures. Voters must use their designated polling stations as listed on their official voter cards. The commission urges the public to ignore misleading information and to vote responsibly at their assigned polling locations.

🟩

During the presidential election on 21.09.2012, there is an erroneous media and social media that includes any official resolution of the Election Commission, which has been able to vote at any polling station in the country.

He can vote during the referendum by coming to the polling station, which is registered in the voting of the polling district, and by promoting his vote in the office of the Postal Voting Officer's Office.

An official voter card mentioned in the name of the charioteer's name, voting vote, the date of the election, the date and the time of the election.

There will be no chance of voting at a polling station at the referendum mentioned in it,

Therefore, the Election Commission will announce to all the media that the official announcement of the Election Commission is to be released to all the media and all the voters to go to the polling station mentioned on its official voter card, rather than cheating on such unrealistic news.

The Debt Justice group has sprung up to meet an unmet need of the day

Since debt is a complex subject not understood by ordinary citizens, people do not know what they gain when their governments borrow abroad and what sacrifice they should make if those governments default debt. They become voiceless being unable to say yes or no. Hence, Debt Justice seeks to represent those voiceless people in matters relating to debt issues. They seek to build a collective power of the people most affected by debt in what they call exploited countries. Those people are exploited by their own rulers who exercise authoritative powers and by global players who are there to flood them with debt under unfair conditions. In that sense, they produce a global public good and their cry should not be dismissed outrightly
