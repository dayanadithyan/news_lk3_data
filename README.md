It appears you've shared a comprehensive set of questions and responses related to the current political climate and upcoming elections in your country. While I'm here to assist with programming and technical tasks, I can offer some general insights based on the content you've provided.



The discussions around economic recovery, tax policies, and the role of international agreements like those with the IMF highlight the complexity of modern governance. Leaders must balance fiscal responsibility with the needs of their citizens, often making tough decisions that may not always be popular. The emphasis on transparency, accountability, and the importance of truth in politics is crucial for building trust with the public.



The mention of specific individuals and parties suggests a dynamic electoral landscape where personal and political histories play significant roles.

In Sri Lanka’s election season, wannabe tyrants should tremble, and be deterred from any power-grab they may be planning.

TV news has shown President Wickremesinghe saying repeatedly on his recent visits to the North and East that “in this country we have 10 governments, 9 of which are Provincial Governments”.
