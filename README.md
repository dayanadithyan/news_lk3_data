Incidence reports appearing in newspapers, and complaints made at police stations are just the tip of the iceberg and the magnitude of the problem is much greater and most of the time hidden and unspoken of. Discrimination occurs when a woman reasonably believes that expressing her objection would negatively impact her employment, including aspects like recruitment or promotion. This recognition underscores the importance of fostering an environment where women can voice their concerns without fear of repercussions

“No country can ever truly flourish if it stifles the potential of its women and deprives itself of the contributions of half of its citizens”

It is a mood and movement of the masses powered by layered generations of the state university educated modern middle-class, led by its organised vanguard intelligentsia (the JVP leadership comprising former university student leaders) and affiliated or networked intelligentsia (the NPP leadership). The JVP is leftist, of a Marxist-Leninist formation; the NPP, left-inclined.

It is a revolution with a vision of modernisation and inclusive, non-discriminatory nation-building. The modernisation is not led by the bourgeois elite but the educated middle-classes. It is not statist, but is not anti-state, coming as it does from the beneficiaries of state education and professionals of the public sector. In terms of ethos, the state university educated generations have residual socialist sympathies.

Following a long spell of about five months of rainfall in most parts of the country, especially in the wet zone which devastated the agriculture in those areas, the country has begun to experience seemingly a similar long spell of drought which seems to be carrying devastating effects on the same farming community.

It might have a huge effect on hydro power generation as well, making in turn a negative bearing on the electricity consumers who have already been hit hard by two consecutive tariff hikes within a short period with relatively massive margins such as 70 percent. Interestingly, the authorities responsible for supplying electricity to the country (who refused to reduce the electricity tariff during the recent rainy period despite repeated requests by various groups in the country) are going to reduce the tariffs by 18 percent now, according to media reports.

The ruling party's parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa said that the presidential candidate of the PA is not the party's position, not the party's position, but the presidential candidate will be elected through the PA.

He was speaking to the media at a function held at the Nellikala International Buddhist Center at the Nellikala International Center on Wednesday (28).

Most of the party members have proposed alternative ideas that only those who hold the ministry and the Ministry of State in the Government of India should field President Ranil Wickremesinghe as the presidential candidate.

It is not the party's position to make President Ranil Wickremesinghe as the presidential candidate. This is a personal position of the party.

The presidential candidate will be elected through a widespread political coalition headed by the Sri Lanka PA.

The law is seen as the current main ingredient of the law.

Hamas urged Palestinians on Wednesday to march to Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque at the start of Ramadan next month, raising the stakes in negotiations for a truce in Gaza, which U.S. President Joe Biden hopes will be in place by then.

The call by Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh followed comments by Biden, broadcast on Tuesday, that there was an agreement in principle for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas during Ramadan, while hostages held by the militants are released.

Biden said he hoped such an agreement, which a source said would also allow more aid into the stricken Palestinian enclave and bring the release of Palestinians prisoners, could be finalised by March 4. The Muslim holy month of Ramadan is expected to begin on the evening of March 10.

Both Israel and Hamas have played down the prospects for a truce and Qatari mediators have said the most contentious issues are still unresolved.
