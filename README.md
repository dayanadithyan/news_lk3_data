The island nation was sued in July 2022 by Hamilton Reserve Bank Ltd., which sought full payment on more than $250 million of Sri Lanka‚Äôs dollar bond that was due that month. The bank says it holds more than 25% of the bonds, which would likely enable it to block any modification of the notes.

On Friday, Sri Lanka sought an extension of a delay of the lawsuit that was granted in November. Hamilton Reserve opposed the new request, saying that the country has kept the bank ‚Äúin the dark‚Äù about the negotiations despite repeated requests for information.

The island nation is prioritizing restructuring obligations to its private creditors as it seeks to fast-track a debt overhaul and exit a sovereign default, the foreign minister told Bloomberg last month.

### Early days ‚Äì Herbert Cooray‚Äôs childhood in Kosgama and schooling in Colombo

*2024-03-03 00:44:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/early-days-herbert-coorays-childhood-in-kosgama-and-schooling-in-colombo/) ¬∑ `en`

We begin today serializing the biography of Herbert Cooray, the founder of the Jetwing Group who earlier ran a successful business as a building contractor as had his father before him. The biography was written by Shiromal Cooray, his daughter, who with her brother, Hiran, now leads Jetwing.

The history of the Jetwing family of companies is essentially the story of its founder, Herbert Cooray. It is the story of an unusual man who rose from modest, relatively obscure beginnings to establish what is today the largest independent business group in the Sri Lankan tourism industry. Such an achievement, significant in itself, appears more remarkable when we consider that it was achieved in the face of entrenched competition from established and long-standing hotel and travel firms that had made their reputations in the years when most traveled by sea, and cruise ships such as P&O‚Äôs famous Canberra were regular visitors to the Colombo Harbour.

The Yukthiya operation appears to be a last-ditch effort by the present Sri Lankan government to salvage public support ahead of the pivotal 2024 presidential election.

More than a year after he visited Sri Lanka, US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu went on record calling Sri Lanka the greatest comeback story in ‚Äúthe region I work on.‚Äù He contrasted the situation two years ago ‚Äì rife with shortages and riots ‚Äì with the relative stability and calm present today. Pointing at the support given by India in 2022, he highlighted USAID‚Äôs humanitarian efforts in the country and the debt restructuring assistance given by Japan, France, and India.

Not surprisingly, Lu does mention China, but only in the context of the pressure that US allies applied on it to grant Sri Lanka debt relief. Just as unsurprisingly, he credits Sri Lanka‚Äôs recovery to ‚Äúa Little Help from friends‚Äù and ‚Äúthis better proposition‚Äù that the US Indo-Pacific strategy offers for the region. One can only assume he means that Sri Lanka is a comeback story partly ‚Äì or largely ‚Äì because of US intervention in the Indian Ocean.

Worldwide, the observed impacts of climate change are driving a multiplicity of conservation and mitigation strategies. Climate change is a gradually-evolving disaster which may not be reversible. However, there is much that man can do to mitigate its impact.

To combat climate change, one must be able to evaluate its progress and impact scientifically. One of the major technical contributions from Dilmah to the cause of managing climate change was to establish a Climate Research Station, the first of its kind in the world by a private entity, at Queensberry Estate, Upper Kotmale. This self-sustained research centre, located at the highest point on one of Kahawatte Plantations estates, was launched in December 2017, in collaboration with the Foundation for Environment, Climate and Technology (FELT) and the University of Peradeniya.

The global political scene was very left-inclined from about the mid-1960s to say 10 or 15 years ago. The sweeping trend to social democracy in post-war Europe, a surge to the left throughout Asia (Chinese Revolution, defeat of US Imperialism in Vietnam, post-war USSR, our own JVP) and a little later in Africa (Patrice Lumumba, revolution in Mozambique, Nelson Mandela etc), signposted what may be loosely called a period of global shift to the left. That ended about 10 years ago. The last spurt was perhaps Obama‚Äôs re-election. The reverse trend became prominent in the US with Trump and internationally a dynamic that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.

### Weak litigation clears man charged for sexual harassment of foreign woman

*2024-03-02 18:50:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Weak-litigation-clears-man-charged-for-sexual-harassment-of-foreign-woman/108-278116) ¬∑ `en`

Colombo, March 2 (Daily Mirror)- A man who was charged with exposing himself in a manner of sexually harassing a foreign woman was discharged from the case by the Kaduwela Magistrate‚Äôs Court due to the weak prosecution case, which proceeded in some instances without the virtual complainant giving evidence.

The Thalangama Police filed a charge sheet against the accused, alleging sexual harassment of the foreign woman through indecent exposure under Section 345 of the Penal Code. The complainant woman claimed that the driver had exposed himself to her while he was driving a vehicle at a slow speed and she had been humiliated by the incident.

Police arrested the accused and produced him before court and was subsequently granted bail.

The case proceeded for a considerable time, during which the foreign woman intermittently attended court on certain dates. However, at the final stage, she was missing.

### Globally, A Rightward Political Shift Is Visible

*2024-03-02 18:30:31* ¬∑ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/globally-a-rightward-political-shift-is-visible/) ¬∑ `en`

The global political scene was very left-inclined from about the mid-1960s to say ten or fifteen years ago. The sweeping trend to social democracy in post-war Europe, a surge to the left throughout Asia (Chinese Revolution, defeat of US Imperialism in Vietnam, post-war USSR, our own JVP) and a little later in Africa (Patrice Lumumba, revolution in Mozambique, Nelson Mandela etc), signposted what may be loosely called a period of global shift to the left. That ended about ten to years ago. The last spurt was perhaps Obama‚Äôs re-election. The reverse trend became prominent in the US with Trump and internationally a dynamic that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.

### It is accepted today and proven beyond doubt that Ranil was the best man and the only man who could have pulled the country out of the abyss it had fallen into.

*2024-03-02 18:09:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83704) ¬∑ `en`

The worst crisis Sri Lanka faced was in 2022, when it had to declare bankruptcy. A 30-year civil war, two insurrections, racial riots and a tsunami had not deterred this nation from repaying its loans on time. But one corrupt family and their cohorts had brought our country to its knees. Overnight, an incompetent president lost control, and the country was plunged into economic and social chaos.

Transport was at a virtual standstill due to a shortage of fuel; people died standing in queues for gas; schools had closed; 10- to 13-hour power cuts were the order of the day; and children were dying due to a lack of basic medicines.

The situation exploded on May 9 when Mahinda Rajapaksa‚Äôs attempts to use violence to quell a peaceful protest resulted in countrywide burning and looting of houses, pushing Sri Lankan society into hitherto unknown darkness.

### ‚ÄúThere is great political inequality in India‚Ä¶this inequality is driven by money. As a result, people with deep pockets influence political decisions‚Ä¶ Large Donors to Political Parties Influence  Policy‚Äô

*2024-03-02 18:00:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83706) ¬∑ `en`

It is perhaps one of the many painful ironies afflicting Sri Lanka‚Äôs political landscape that though an ecstatic song and dance was made about the country‚Äôs ‚Äòfirst ever‚Äô law regulating election expenditure passed by Parliament last year, no elections were held thereafter to practically ‚Äòtest‚Äô its legal strength.

We cannot blame anyone but the Government for this given its postponement of elections including local government elections arguing that it did not have the required funds, unashamedly citing the country‚Äôs bankruptcy propelled by a crass and corrupt ruling class.

Thus, the Regulation of Election Expenditure Act, No 3 of 2023 stood in solitary splendor for more than a year of it being certified by the Speaker on the 24th of January 2023.

Until now, that is. Apparently the Election Commission is going into overdrive summoning political parties for ‚Äòbriefings‚Äô on the Act in the expectation of whatever forthcoming elections.

### India has officially eliminated ‚Äòextreme poverty‚Äô: US report

India has now officially eliminated ‚Äòextreme poverty‚Äô, which can be seen through the sharp decline in headcount poverty ratio and stark increase in household consumption, American think tank Brookings said in a report.

The report, authored by Surjit Bhalla and Karan Bhasin, states that this has been a result of the government‚Äôs strong policy thrust on redistribution, which has led to strong inclusive growth in India over the last decade.

India has just released its official consumption expenditure data for 2022-23, providing the first official survey-based poverty estimates for India in over ten years.

According to the data, real per capita consumption growth has been recorded at 2.9 per cent per year since 2011-12. Under this, rural growth at 3.1 per cent was significantly higher than urban growth of 2.6 per cent.

The data also presented an unprecedented decline in both urban and rural inequality.
