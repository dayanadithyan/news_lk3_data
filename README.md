ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s revolutionaries, whose children study at international schools, oppose education reforms and scuttle any attempt at reforms by taking to the streets, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said.

“There is one group that is opposed to education reforms. These are revolutionaries who recently became ‘modern’. They say free education need not be modernised. They say Sri Lanka’s stagnating education must continue the way it is,” Premadasa said speaking at an event.

“Every time something new is being attempted, what do they do? They take to the streets. They go on paada yatras and hold protests.

“But did you know? The children of these big revolutionaries study at international schools,” the leader of the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) said.

Acknowledging that disparity in education is a real problem in Sri Lanka, Premadasa said that measures must be taken to address it.

“An SJB government will be dedicated to achieving that change,” he said.
