ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì The US Federal Reserve cut rates 50 basis points to target an overnight rate of 4.75/5.00 percent, with Chair Jerome Powell saying inflation and employment was balanced.

‚ÄúInflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,‚Äù Powell told reporters after the rate cut.

‚ÄúAs inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation have diminished and the downside risks to employment have increased.

‚ÄúWe now see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate.‚Äù

The Fed‚Äôs ‚Äòdual mandate‚Äô is blamed for the current high inflation as well as the 1970s collapse of the Bretton Woods system and subsequent Great Inflation.

IHP‚Äôs SLOTS MRP estimates using interviews conducted to 13 September indicate that Anura¬† ¬† ¬† Dissanayake would have won the Presidential election on a count of second preference votes¬† if the Presidential election had been held in early September.

In the MRP estimates of the views of all adults, Anura Dissayanake led with 48%, followed by Sajith Premadasa on 25%, Ranil Wickremesinghe on 20%, and Namal Rajapaksa on 5%. These estimates were associated with a margin of error of 3‚Äì6% for the three leading candidates. The latest IHP MRP modelling indicates that there was a strong surge in favour of Anura Dissanayake since July, when he briefly trailed Sajith Premadasa in voter preferences.

These MRP estimates are based on a substantially revised MRP model (version 4.0) that is still in beta testing. Data came from 20,714 interviews conducted from 31 August 2021 to 13 September 2024, including 541 interviews conducted in September 2024.
