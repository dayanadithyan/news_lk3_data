The Essential Importers and Traders Association warns that removing the special freight tax on imported goods in Sri Lanka could lead to higher prices due to corruption. The government plans to abolish this tax from January next year, a move that was initially imposed in 2007 to combat corruption. The association argues that this tax, which charges based on the value of goods, helps reduce corruption by making it more difficult for importers to bribe customs officials. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has suggested replacing this tax to increase government revenue, but the association believes that advanced customs procedures will mitigate corruption.

üü©

The Essential Importers and Traders Association said that if there is no mechanism to control corruption in Sri Lanka, the removal of special freight tax on imported goods will be a price hike.

The Cabinet has decided to abolish the 17 -year -old tax law from January next year.

A spokesperson of the association told Daily Mirror that it was imposed by its members in 2007 for the sake of increased corruption when assessing the items.

‚ÄúThen, the imported goods were rated for these charges to be imposed. Then, dishonest importers bribed the customs officials to lower their imported goods so that they could pay less on tax -basis. This has affected the real importers. So we asked the then government that this special freight tax should be imposed.

It charges on the amount of imported goods and leads to lower corruption. When the value of the goods is charged, it can lead to corruption. ‚Äù

He also said that the cost of imported goods consumed by the people can ensure stability.

The fund was raised in response to accusations against Palestinians, but some religious, political, and civil organizations have remained silent, showing hypocrisy.

### Stalin clashes with Modi

*2024-04-03 11:30:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180311) ¬∑ `ta`

It seems you've provided a detailed narrative on the historical and political context surrounding the Kachchativu issue, including the involvement of various political figures and parties. This issue has been a point of contention for many years, involving territorial disputes, fishing rights, and the broader geopolitical landscape of India and Sri Lanka.



Given the complexity and the historical depth of the issue, addressing all the points you've raised would require a comprehensive analysis that goes beyond the scope of a single response. However, I can provide a brief overview and some insights based on the information you've shared:



1. **Tax and Flood Relief**: The specifics of why Tamil Nadu's tax proposal was met with a 29-penny return by the Union Government and the absence of a one-rupee flood relief during natural disasters are likely tied to broader political and economic considerations. These decisions would involve evaluating the financial implications for the Union Government, the strategic importance of Tamil Nadu's resources, and the overall budgetary constraints.



2. **BJP's Ten-Year Rule in Tamil Nadu**: The impact of the BJP's rule in Tamil Nadu over the past decade would depend on various factors, including policy implementation, governance, and the party's approach to development and welfare. The effectiveness of the BJP's policies in Tamil Nadu would be a subject of debate among political analysts and the public.



3. **Kachchativu Issue**: The Kachchativu issue is deeply rooted in historical and territorial disputes between India and Sri Lanka. The transfer of Kachchativu to Sri Lanka in 1974 was a significant event that has had lasting implications for the fishing communities in Tamil Nadu. The controversy surrounding this decision and its aftermath has been a point of contention among various political parties and has influenced the broader political landscape in Tamil Nadu.



4. **DMK's Relationship with Congress**: The relationship between the DMK and Congress, especially in the context of the Kachchativu issue, reflects the complexities of Indian politics. The DMK's stance on the issue, as well as its alliance with Congress, has been influenced by a range of factors, including historical grievances, political strategy, and the broader dynamics of power in Indian politics.



5. **Kachchativu's Geography and Historical Context**: Kachchativu's geographical location and its historical significance as a fishing ground for Tamil Nadu's fishermen have been central to the dispute. The island's strategic importance and the rights of its inhabitants have been at the heart of the controversy, with various political actors and international bodies involved in the resolution of the issue.



In summary, the Kachchativu issue and its broader implications for Tamil Nadu's politics and governance are multifaceted and deeply intertwined with the region's history, geopolitical dynamics, and the strategic interests of India and Sri Lanka. Addressing these issues requires a nuanced understanding of the historical context, the political dynamics at play, and the broader geopolitical implications.

When the Indian parliamentary election begins to warm up, people and candidates will be alerted. Free, cash banknotes will start chasing people.It is only the political leaders of the party, as they awakened from deep sleep. Many things that have been forgotten will be remembered. The electoral field will be heated by the right rivalry. That is the case in Tamil Nadu.

Voting for the 39 constituencies in Tamil Nadu will be held on April 19, and the counting of voting will begin on June 4.

Tamil Nadu ranks fifth in terms of Lok Sabha places. In the 2019 election, the DMK -led secular progressive Alliance won 38 seats of a total of 39 seats.

Colombo, April 3 (Daily Mirror) - Research conducted by the government has revealed that more than 60 percent of the voters in Sri Lanka are still undecided on whom they should vote for, UNP Assistant Leader Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday.

Former Minister Kariyawasam told a press briefing that rumours of certain political parties expected to get a high percentage of votes is false.

At the same time he said that incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe will spring a surprise similar to one the country had during the 2015 Presidential election. "There are many things happening behind the scenes. Therefore don't come to conclusions seeing from the outside," he said in this regard.

"Many individuals and parties have pledged their support to President Wickremesinghe and they will make a move when the election is drawing near, " he also said.

Also he announced that the UNP will hold a May Day procession in front of Tower Hall this year.

The Colombo High Court rejected the bail application filed by the counsels representing the recently imprisoned Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera yesterday.

Colombo High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige rejected the bail application, stating that the counsels had failed to present any special circumstances before the Court that would warrant the release of Gnanasara Thera on bail.

The defence counsels urged the court to grant bail to Gnanasara Thera pending appeal, considering the extended delays in concluding appeal hearings at the Court of Appeal and his health condition as grounds for release.

On 28 March, the Colombo High Court sentenced Gnanasara Thera to four years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 100 000 over a contentious statement made by him about Islam and Muslims in 2016.

### New Director General for Bribery Commission

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed W. K. D. Wijerathne as the Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), the President‚Äôs Media Division (PMD) said.

The appointment was made in accordance with the provisions of the new Anti-Corruption Act.

Wijerathne has held the same position before, but this new appointment is under the new Anti Corruption Act, which was passed in the Parliament in September last year with wide powers.

The new Act gives CIABOC broader ability to investigate and prosecute incidents of bribery and corruption. The commission has previously examined claims of bribery and corruption but has failed to meet expectations because most complaints have not resulted in prosecution.

The creations of Mary Shelley and Lord Balfour; the former being fiction and the latter being played out in 4K ultra-HD resolution today, are separated by time and space, but offer lessons for the enquiring mind.

The vote taken on 29th November 1947 to create the state of Israel, was rejected by all Arab States. On 30th November, the very next day, the first phase of the Arab-Israeli war began and ended with thousands dead and the forcible expulsion of more than 700,000 Palestinians from their homeland.

World leaders refused to accept the ominous beginning as a harbinger of darker, more dangerous times ahead.

### When ‚ÄúAiyo‚Äù Sirisena accused India‚Äôs RAW of plotting to assassinate him

‚ÄúPutting your foot in your mouth‚Äù is a figurative expression about a person saying or doing something that should not be done or not have been said, especially if it embarrasses the person concerned or someone else. Among those who frequently put their feet into their mouths are politicians of all kinds and hues and from all parts of the world.

Sri Lanka the miracle of Asia is second to none in this sphere. From ‚ÄúApey George‚Äù George E de Silva of Kandy in the past to CV Wigneswaran of Jaffna in the present, there have been several politicians in this resplendent Island who are famous for this. However the greatest of all politicians in this respect arguably is Pallewatte Gamaralage Maithripala Yapa Sirisena who served as the sixth executive president of Sri Lanka from 2015 to 2019. Such is his reputation for doing or uttering inappropriate things that Sirisena has acquired the prefix ‚ÄúAiyo‚Äù. Many refer to him as ‚ÄúAiyo‚Äù Sirisena nowadays.

### Countering NPP‚Äôs rise: Emerging political alliances and election strategies

The National People‚Äôs Power‚Äôs (NPP) current election campaign aiming for the presidential election has a strong momentum. The confident body language of its leadership is one indicator of this. Their rallies are well-attended and there appears to be a strong bottom-up support. The NPP‚Äôs seemingly growing electoral prospects have propelled it to being in the centre of political discourse, and this has led other political parties/factions to be on the defensive.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP, the main party within the NPP) is known for launching its election campaigns prematurely. This is why, despite their rallies being well-attended and their anti-establishment discourse being attractive to people in general, their popularity has not translated to votes, never having gone more than 5% at a general election so far. However, this trope may not hold as firmly this time.

This Online Safety Act will have a huge impact on the freedom of expression of Sri Lankan citizens

In 2018, ‚ÄúEUROPOL‚Äù headquartered in Hague, Netherlands, a key organisation established to prevent and combat serious internationally organised crimes, cybercrime and terrorism, had clearly defined the difference between cyber-dependent crimes and cyber-enabled crimes. As defined by them, any crime that can only be committed using computers, computer networks or other forms of information communication technology was named as cyber-dependent crimes and traditional crimes facilitated by the Internet and digital technology were categorised as cyber-enabled crimes. So, there are two categories of cybercrimes and these definitions are internally accepted.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs sovereignty over Kachchativu, according to the narrative, was never in doubt and it was in fact the Kachchativu issue that decided the demarcation of the maritime boundary between Sri Lanka and India

The book relates how laws were brought to confine fishing to areas within the boundary of each country

There were also reports of illicit immigrants from South India using the Kachchativu Festival to enter Sri Lanka

The sovereignty of Kachchativu Island which Sri Lanka had exercised throughout history is once again disputed by India. This is despite India having withdrawn the claim- that it owned this island- with the presentation of facts to the Government of New Delhi some years ago.¬† However, the island, barren and uninhabited most of the year, had remained a contentious issue for over a hundred years.

### Sri Lanka to import 1,000 vehicles to improve tourism sector transportation

The government has decided to import a total of 1,000 buses and vans to improve the transportation facilities provided to tourists.

Accordingly, in a bid to boost the tourism sector, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to a proposal presented by the Minister of Tourism and Lands to import 750 vans and 250 buses.

As per the proposal,¬†6-15 seater vans, as well as 16-30 seater (small) buses¬†and 30-45 seater (large) buses¬†are planned to be imported, without any special tax relief.

The government says that, although it is considered a custom in the tourist industry that vehicles engaged in the industry for tourist transportation should not be used for more than 6 years, it is apparent that the condition of the vehicles used in the industry is not satisfactory and sufficient.

In a statement, it added that the fame earned by Sri Lanka as a prominent tourist destination is tarnished due to the usage of age-old vehicles as a result of the limitation of vehicles and essential spare parts.
