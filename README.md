More than 90 people have died after a boat capsized off Mozambique’s northern coast, authorities say.

Those aboard the boat were fleeing a cholera outbreak and were travelling from Lunga to Mozambique Island, off the coast of Nampula, local media reported.

The fishing boat could accommodate a maximum of 100 people, however there were around 130 people on board, a representative of the island administration told the STV television station.

“Because the boat was overcrowded and unsuited to carry passengers it ended up sinking ... There are 91 people who lost their lives,” said Nampula’s secretary of state Jaime Neto.

The AIM news agency, citing a representative of the maritime authority, reported that the ship was probably wrecked when it was hit by high waves.

Rescuers had found five survivors and were searching for more, but sea conditions were making the operation difficult.

### Fcode Labs introduces power of AI in coaching

*2024-04-08 04:56:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/fcode-labs-introduces-power-of-ai-in-coaching/) · `en`

Fcode Labs, a leading healthcare technology consultancy company, has announced the launch of Progress Magic (www.progressmagic.com) – revolutionary platform designed to supercharge mental and corporate coaching practices.

Progress Magic leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to streamline workflows, optimize client outcomes, and unlock transformative results for both coaches and their clients. The platform is secure. It’s HIPAA, GDPR, and PDPA compliant which means, it uses all the industry best practices on security and data privacy to operate in the USA, Europe, Singapore, and Sri Lanka.

The rise in mental health and corporate coaching clientele is outpacing the availability of streamlined administrative solutions. This cuts into valuable client interaction time, potentially leading to stalled progress or client abandonment. Traditional methods of scheduling, billing, and record keeping can be cumbersome, hindering coaches’ ability to deliver the highest quality care.

“Sri Lanka is blessed with plenty of wind — a renewable energy resource with which cheaper electricity can be provided to consumers without spending millions of dollars on fossil fuel, but it is still an enigma why the government of Sri Lanka is dragging on finalizing the Adani wind power project in Mannar,” they said.

Indunil Bandara, Convener of the Youth for Renewable Energy Organization voiced concerns over the issue of increasing electricity unit tariffs faced by Sri Lankans.

### Sri Lanka forex reserves improving, but global oil prices keep increasing

*2024-04-08 04:19:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lanka-forex-reserves-improving-but-global-oil-prices-keep-increasing/) · `en`

The gross official reserves were provisionally estimated at US dollars 4,951 mn as at end March 2024 including proceeds from the People’ Bank of China (PBOC) swap arrangement, which is subject to conditionalities on usability, according to the Weekly Economic Indicators of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

The report, however, stated that during the period under review (March 29- April 5), crude oil prices exhibited an increasing trend. Crude oil prices increased owing to optimism on demand with the expansion in manufacturing activity in China and the US, coupled with the concerns about tight supply stemming from escalating geopolitical tensions and major producers keeping output cuts in place. Overall, both Brent and WTI prices increased by more than US dollars 3.00 per barrel during the review period.

The situation, therefore, appears to remain ambivalent for Sri Lanka as the cost of incoming shipments of oil could jump in the coming weeks.

Ex-President Sirisena is once again in the news for all the wrong reasons. Hardly had the ink dried on news stories of his sudden firing of three senior Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members, we learned that a court order has barred him from performing duties as chairman of that party.

The court order was based on a complaint to the court by Chandrika Kumaratunga for the removal of Sirisena from the post of SLFP Chairman, on the grounds he was unsuitable for the role. Among the reasons for his ouster were charges he was unlawfully holding the Chairmanship of the party in violation of the Party Constitution.

Additional charges arose from Sirisena’s actions during the constitutional crisis of 2018 being deemed incorrect. He was also found guilty of having violated the fundamental rights of people in the case of the Easter Sunday bombings.

In response to past controversies surrounding nekath, the government appointed a team of astrologers in 1992  to determine the official auspicious times, which were widely accepted. However, professional rivalry or jealousy often leads astrologers outside the official team to challenge the declared times, citing various unexplained theoretical concepts unique to astrology. These contradictions caused anxiety among the general public and believers of astrology, leading to uncertainty and a loss of confidence in the auspicious times provided.

Ukraine is in trouble today because the EU’s aid package was blocked by Hungary, and no EU country is able to produce the munitions badly needed by Ukraine

There is a war in Ukraine? It seems to have been forgotten by everyone–except by Ukraine, Russia and their respective allies.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine in February 2022, many including myself expected it to be over in weeks. In my case, this was because, as much as I dislike Putin’s dictatorship, Russian superiority in armour, artillery, aircraft and manpower was so big it was hard to see how Ukraine could stop all those tanks rolling over the country’s eastern steppes and advancing into the country, encircling and destroying outnumbered Ukrainian forces.

### Racist policy of forced cremation

*2024-04-08 02:28:19* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Racist-policy-of-forced-cremation/4-760427) · `en`

The whole issue of forced cremation that shook the Muslim community in 2020/21 was entirely rooted in racism.

It is the Gotabaya Government which both piloted and enforced to the full measure this racist policy, aided by experts whom the President himself effectively appointed.

Now that it has been demonstrated, after a series of international setbacks for the Government and the erosion of public trust in Government leaders and experts, the question of tendering an open apology to the Muslim community and to those who opposed the policy tooth and nail as it was ruthlessly enforced has now come up.

As admitted, Thondaman’s Ministry of Water Resources has found out that the COVID-19 virus doesn’t spread through ground water. Perhaps, Ali Sabry’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs may have found out that the damage that this racist policy implemented by the Government, of which he remained an integral part (as Justice Minister), heaped on the country internationally was avoidable but horrendous.

If this is not a crime against humanity to some extent one wonders what crimes against humanity are – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

With reference to the subject news report titled “Thondaman calls for formal Govt. apology to Muslim community over forced COVID cremations” appearing on the front page of your widely circulated and read newspaper of Friday 5 April 2024, I wish to bring the following to the attention of your readers with regard to the article.

The apology from an individual on behalf of the Government which as a collective acted in contravention of prevalent and established ethical, scientific and moral grounds to selectively target a section of its own citizens indeed must not and should not be accepted as the decision to forcefully cremate COVID-19 dead during the pandemic was solely a political decision.

### How to miss five industrial revolutions

The signs of having gone through industrial revolutions are the country becoming wealthy, and population having a high level of per capita income

Sri Lanka did not have a complete set of Government institutions to maintain a corruption-free economy. This incompleteness later led to countrywide corruption and creating a generation of rent seekers whose primary objective was to profit from the Government, at the expense of the welfare of the general public. This should have been obvious to the political leaders and bureaucrats of Sri Lanka who oversaw the transition of political power from the colonial master. Thus, the need to import and adopt technology and the need to install the full set of institutions should have been a top priority of the country. In similar situations, countries like Japan and Singapore adopted correct strategies
