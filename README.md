While state agencies set equal pay, women in decision making roles were still low within them, Fernandopulle said.

A key ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged support to him on Wednesday and was set to attend a meeting to discuss forming a coalition government, boosting Modi‚Äôs chances of a record-equalling third term in office.

On Wednesday, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), a key regional player in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh which is in the alliance, said it stood firmly with Modi and his party.

### Sri Lanka has been allowed to boycott international law for more than 15 years - who have been atrocited international crimes against Eelam Tamils

*2024-06-05 12:00:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185354) ¬∑ `ta`

Sri Lanka has evaded international law for over 15 years, committing atrocities against the Eelam Tamils. The Tamil Eelam government calls for recognition to ensure accountability. ICC lawyer Karim Khan is commended for seeking the arrest of Israeli and Hamas leaders for war crimes. International legal experts affirm that no conflict can evade legal repercussions. Despite evidence of mass killings, no military personnel have faced charges. The UN highlights the failure of domestic efforts for justice, suggesting international mechanisms are necessary. The Eelam Tamils urge the ICC to indict Israeli and Hamas leaders, citing the court's recognition of Palestine's right to justice. They reject Sri Lanka's constitution based on sovereignty principles and assert their right to self-governance and prosecution of war crimes under the Rome Statute.

üü©

The recognition of legal Tamil Eelam will lead to accountability on the island of Sri Lanka, the Tamil Eelam government said.

The Transnational Tamil Eelam government praises the International Criminal Court (ICC) lawyer Karim Khan for a bold action for the arrest of Hamas and Israeli leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister, for crimes and war crimes against humanity.

We again underlined that international law and armed struggle laws apply to all, as the prosecutor Karim Khan said.. No army nor any commander can act without any punishment for crimes.

International legal experts, including former International International Criminal Court Judge Theodore Meron and Amal Clooney, have said in their statement, "No war can escape the hands of the law."

It is a painful fact that Sri Lanka has been allowed to boycott international law for more than 15 years, which has committed atrocities against the Eelam Tamils.

Edwards opted to bowl first on a wicket that was doing just enough and the likes of Tim Pringle and Logan van Beek feasted on a bit tentative Nepal line-up, bowling them out for 106.
