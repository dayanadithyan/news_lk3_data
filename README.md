### Increase in drug use in the North: Who are the source?

*2024-04-23 14:54:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181767) ┬╖ `ta`

Four youths in the North died from drug use, with heavy drugs implicated. Cases of heroin and cannabis were reported. Sri Lanka's strategic location in global drug trade, facilitated by maritime boundaries, contributes to the issue. Despite legal action, drug use remains prevalent, especially among the youth. The government's focus on the war context in the North and East may exacerbate drug issues.

ЁЯЯй

Four youths died due to drug use in the first quarter of this year in the Northern Province. They are all between the ages of 20 to 30 years.

In particular, a youth from Chavakachcheri has died during a drug treaty for celebrating his release as a youth from Chavakachcheri was released from prison on bail.

Others are dead due to the use of heavy drugs. There are no reports of drug use even after these deaths.

There were 29 cases of drugs in Jaffna, especially in the period from 2024.03.26 to 2024.04.16.. Two cases of 23.075 grams of heroin have been filed for the holding of 0.08 grams of ice.

In addition, 21 cases have been filed in connection with the use and business of cannabis and 21.299 kilograms of cannabis have been seized.. The drug issue in the North continues to be socially cancer, while police say that legal action has been taken against the arrested persons.
