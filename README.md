### Many Facets Of Madam Blavatsky: A Mystic? A Spy Or A Fraud?

*2024-07-08 17:21:37* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/many-facets-of-madam-blavatsky-a-mystic-a-spy-or-a-fraud/) · `en`

Madam Blavatsky’s name is not strange for Sri Lankans as one of the early stalwarts to aspire to the Buddhist resurgence in the late 19th century. In the backdrop of British-sponsored Missionary activities, her audacity to stand with the natives in a British colony illustrates her compassion for the Easterners who suffered under foreign subjugation. After the tragic end of the 1883 Kotahena riots, Blavatsky defended the Buddhists, when the colonial government tried to frame them to be the culprits. In an article she authored for “The Theosophist“, Blavatsky argued that the arrogant attitude of the Christian priests and their condescending remarks over Buddhism sparked the riots in 1883 and the following year she accompanied Col. Henry Olcott to London to report the grievances faced by the Sinhalese Buddhists to the Colonial Secretary.

As a top official who held numerous positions in public service, local government, and diplomacy, his career was a testament to his dedication to his country and its people. My admiration for Lionel began long before our personal encounters, rooted in his transformative tenure as the first Sinhala Government Agent in Jaffna during the 1970s. His service-oriented approach endeared him to the Tamil communities, illustrating his commitment to bridging ethnic divides and fostering unity.

### Sri Lanka leader hands over India-funded smart classrooms ahead of election

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe, emulating the island nation’s opposition leader, handed over smart classrooms to Southern Provincial state schools as he is eyeing to contest in a grand independent coalition.

Analysts see the move as a strategy to face a rising support for a similar project implemented by main opposition leader Sajith Premadasa who has been distributing smart classes and relevant equipment for schools across the country with funding he has not disclosed.

President Wickremesinghe distributed the digital equipment under an Indian grant project worth 300 million Sri Lanka rupees ($1 million) for establishing 200 smart classrooms with 2200 smart tablets being provided to school students in Southern Province.

The project aims at equipping 200 schools in the Province with necessary digital tools that would enable them to benefit from digital resources and materials across the globe, the Indian High Commission said in a statement.

### Surprise defeat for far-right in France in Macron’s snap election gambit

ECONOMYNEXT — President Emanuel Macron’s gamble in calling a snap poll somewhat paid off after a left-wing alliance secured the highest number of seats in the French parliament, effectively defeating an alliance led by the far-right National Rally.

The Economist reported that Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN)-led bloc, which was widely anticipated to top the voting, will now end up in third place, securing 134 to 152 seats. However, this is still a major win for the once-fringe party which only held 88 seats in the outgoing parliament, indicating the mainstreaming of its hard-right ideology.

A left-wing alliance led by Jean-Luc Melenchon is projected to have secured 171-187 seats after what CNN has called tactical voting in Sunday’s second round election. CNN noted that France will be left in political limbo after no party came close to winning an absolute majority.

### Presidential pardons: an unchecked executive power

*2024-07-08 11:07:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/presidential-pardons-an-unchecked-executive-power/) · `en`

A pardon is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary ‘as an act of grace’. In the Oxford Dictionary it is defined as an “action of forgiving or remission of the legal consequences of an offence or conviction”. Some argue that the power to grant a pardon is a check on the powers of the judiciary rectifying any miscarriage of justice. But this executive power unchecked could result in the abuse of power.

In recent times, President Sirisena granted two pardons – one within six months and the other within nine days of relinquishing office while President Gotabay Rajapaksa granted two pardons – one within four months of becoming president and the other seven months after he received a two thirds majority in Parliament.

ECONOMYNEXT – A coalition of civil society organisations comprising representatives from Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka is are urging South Asian countries to take immediate action on high levels of sexual violence and low conviction rates.

The South Asian Movement for Accessing Justice (SAMAJ) is advocating for “comprehensive legal reforms to close protection gaps in sexual violence laws, address flaws in criminal justice systems, and invest in holistic support services for survivors.”

“These reforms are crucial to providing women and girls with better protection and ending widespread impunity for perpetrators,” SAMAJ said in a statement.

“Many sexual violence laws in the region suffer from inadequate legal definitions that fail to encompass the full spectrum of sexual violence. Some penal codes contain provisions that discriminate against women and girls, and poor enforcement of laws further contributes to abuses going unpunished.”
