### Seven reasons why I would not vote for a socialist utopia

Effectively steering the economic agenda of an entire nation requires an entirely different skill set

There is a certain age that socialism sounds super sweet. Who wouldn’t appreciate a system in which everyone lives merrily, receives free education and healthcare, shares their food with others, and experiences a sense of community and compassion? Who would not want a highly paying government job whether you study hard or not?

In this ideal society, there are no grievances about the contributions made for the greater good. Individuals are duly recognised with bronze medals for their exemplary efforts. We hold admiration for the industriousness displayed in factories and fields, where the masses work diligently and joyfully express their solidarity through revolutionary songs. We applaud when a leader reminiscent of Lenin emphasises that the best things are for the children. Truly, this superlative utopia leaves no room for comparison.

The aim of these states is to partner with Sri Lanka and create a positive opinion in the eyes of the people and those in governance as they continue their tug-of-war with China

In the lead up to Sri Lanka’s Presidential election in October 2024, there have been numerous visits by foreign governments to create a good rapport with the various candidates. Visits by great powers to Sri Lanka appear to be a tradition before a national election or during global calamities. My analyses over the years indicate an increase in the frequency of interactions and their breadth during the visits.

In order to ascertain this tug-of-war, this article is divided into three sections: first, the QUAD visits; second, the Chinese engagements, and third Sri Lanka’s future in the Indian Ocean.

The importance of entrepreneurs as the backbone of our economy should be recognised and honoured

Sri Lanka has been through an unprecedented macroeconomic crisis with a complete economic meltdown since 2022 resulting from years of financial mismanagement, and the current global recession resulted from the scarring effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and many other factors. To date, the country indicates signs of stabilisation but, still faces challenges with elevated poverty levels, income inequality, and labour market concerns.

Given these challenges, the Government needs to carefully plan monetary and fiscal policies and implement growth-enhancing structural reforms to emerge from the current economic crisis, while laying the foundation for improving long-term green, resilient, and inclusive growth prospects. Future generations desperately require us to develop our country to give them a chance to live a comfortable life when it becomes their turn.

### Plantation workers' salary increase -Harini Amarasuriya

*2024-05-10 02:14:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183101) · `ta`

Harini Amarasuriya criticizes the government's plan to increase plantation workers' daily wage to 1700 rupees, arguing it's a deceptive move. She suggests changing the basic salary instead. The government's gazette notification, she claims, is a ploy to mislead workers, as plantation companies are likely to challenge it. She also criticizes an amendment aimed at protecting night-shift women workers, arguing it fails to address their real issues like transport facilities.

🟩

Gazette Notification on Plantation Workers' Salary Increase Action. National People's Power Member Harini Amarasuriya said the government should change their basic salary if they need to carry out a salary increase.

He said this while addressing the debate on the Parliament on Thursday (9).

The government has issued a gazette notification to increase the daily salary of plantation workers to 1700 rupees. This is the play that deceives workers. If the government is increasing the salaries of plantation workers, they must change their basic salary and thereby convert the base salary to 1700 rupees.

On the contrary. Salary Increase is a play -labeled play by the president on May 1st. Everyone, including the President and the Minister of Labor, know that plantation companies go to court against the gazette notification. They know that this cannot be implemented.

So the salary increase for plantation workers is a gazette notification to mislead the plantation workers and deceive them.
