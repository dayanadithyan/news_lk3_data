Former Inspector General of Police (IGP), Chandra Fernando says that it cannot be expected that the political groups who have engaged in violent political activities in the past will not resume such activities in the future.

He stated this while speaking during a press conference held today (13), with the participation of other retired high-ranking police officers including former IGPs and DIGs.

Fernando further stated that although the government carried out rehabilitation programmes to a large extent after the 1971 insurrection and though everyone believed that the insurrection would end with that, unfortunately, the violence returned in 1989 “destroying lives and properties in the country.”

“We then thought it was all over, but unfortunately, 91 houses were destroyed in one night on the 9th of May, 2022 by an organized group. Therefore when things like this happen, will this not happen in the future as well?” he said.

### An Efficient Train System Should Be The Number One Public Transport Priority

*2024-06-13 10:55:45* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/an-efficient-train-system-should-be-the-number-one-public-transport-priority/) · `en`

I write this because I love travelling by train and am very sad about the condition of Sri Lanka Railways and train travel in this beautiful island. In recent times, several of my planned train trips had to be cancelled causing great inconvenience due to sudden train service disruptions, including derailments, breakdowns and cancellations.

Train travel is both cheap and environment friendly. Trains carry a large number of passengers and hence cause lower Carbon emissions per capita than do cars. Public Transport, in general is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly for a country in a Debt trap and IMF austerity program.

Rather than rushing to buy expensive Electric Vehicles (EVs), for a costly Green Energy Transition promoted by various United Nations Agencies and Greenwash Corporations, the GOSL should urgently make Public Transport, particularly, investing in and upgrading the Sri Lanka Railways a top development priority at this time.

### IMF approves Sri Lanka review, calls for monetary policy for stability

ECONOMYNEXT – The International Monetary Fund has approved Sri Lanka’s program review allowing the disbursement of 330 million US dollars, while calling for monetary policy to be used only for stability.

“Monetary policy should continue prioritizing price stability, supported by a sustained commitment to refrain from monetary financing and safeguard central bank independence,” Kenji Okamura, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair said in a statement.

The call comes as inflationists are calling for rates cuts to support ‘growth’ and early noises are starting to be made about ‘positive real interest rates’ based on historical inflation.

Sri Lanka’s inflation is currently low as anchor conflicts have not yet re-emerged, though the operating framework of the monetary authority remains deeply flawed without a credible anchor, critics have said.

The deficiency in the constitution was highlighted in a report by  EconomyNext on Tuesday and later taken up during a government meeting at the highest levels, sources familiar with the issue said.

The constitutional error, which has persisted since April 2015, could allow an incumbent president to extend his term by less than a year without facing a referendum.

Former legislator and President’s Counsel Jayampathy Wickramaratne said the brief from the then government was to come up with a bill for a 19th Amendment which could be passed without a referendum.

“As a member of the team that drafted the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, I wish to make a clarification,” Wickramaratne said, adding that they were aware of the issue.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Planters’ Association said a government mandated wage hike which amounted to 70 percent, will be contested in court, as the island’s wages were double that of India.

Tea and rubber estates may have difficulties in servicing loans due to the wage hike.

“The PA emphasizes that wages must be intrinsically linked to productivity to ensure the sustainability of businesses and the livelihoods of workers,” the group said in a statement.

“Sri Lanka already grapples with the highest production costs, wages, and lowest productivity among all tea-growing nations.

“Notably, the newly gazetted wage is double that of India, creating significant cost disparities in the global market.

This unilateral increase affects not only the regional plantation companies but also over 400 private tea factories in Sabaragamuwa and the Southern province, smallholders employing external labor, and all rubber producers and factories, the statement said.

### Competition against the West Indies is decisive to New Zealand

*2024-06-13 01:48:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185957) · `ta`

In the R20 World Cup, New Zealand's C team faces the West Indies after losing to Afghanistan. A win against the West Indies could secure New Zealand's spot in the Super 8 round, enhancing their chances. Historically, New Zealand has performed well in World Cups, reaching the semi-finals or finals multiple times since 2015 but struggled against Afghanistan this year. The match against the West Indies is crucial for New Zealand, who leads 10-4 in international T20 encounters but faced a tie and loss in previous meetings. Both teams aim to advance to the Super 8 round, making this match pivotal.

🟩

The New Zealand C team, which lost its first match against Afghanistan, will oppose the West Indies in its second match in the R20 World Cup.

The tournament will begin at 6.00 am on Thursday (13).

If the West Indies wins the match, the fourth team will qualify for the Super 8 round, while New Zealand's Super 8 round chance will be questioned.

So in today's match, New Zealand will try to increase its Super round chance by defeating the West Indies.

New Zealand, which has revealed the best in the World Cup since 2015, has advanced to the semi -finals of 2015, 2019, 2019 and 2023 in 2016, 2021 and 2022. On 3 occasions, he played in the final game, but did not hesitate.

However, there is suspicion that New Zealand will leave the first round of Afghanistan by 84 runs this year.

So the rivalry against the West Indies will be a knock out of New Zealand.

On the other hand, the West Indies will also try to win the Super 8 round.
