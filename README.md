Digital transformation, often seen as the domain of ICT professionals, frequently falls short due to a lack of comprehensive business understanding among these experts. A study by Harvard Business School emphasised that digital transformation is not about technology and IT professionals in Sri Lanka declared at a conference that they could contribute only up to 20% to the success of such initiatives. When IT professionals lead, they excel in technology but may overlook broader business implications. Thus, non-IT managers must step into leadership roles for digital transformation projects, although they may face knowledge gaps in ICT.

### Importance of renewable energy for future energy security and economic growth

*2024-02-15 00:05:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Importance-of-renewable-energy-for-future-energy-security-and-economic-growth/4-758488) · `en`

It is time Sri Lankans considered in depth, the impact of energy on their day to day life and the national economy, as well as the sources of such energy. Leaving such matters entirely to the officials and the politicians to make all the decisions would only cause them to lament later on the hardships passed on to the consumers due to poor decisions, lacking in wisdom or vision for the future. It is increasingly evident that rampant corruption and deal making are in place as per comments made even by the Supreme Court from time to time as well as the findings of the Auditor General. The fact that no pressure is applied to follow up on these allegations and take action to bring the culprits to book, underscores both the lack of understanding and the apathy of the general public, that hitherto seem to believe they have no role to play.
