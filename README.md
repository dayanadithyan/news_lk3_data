A group of asylum seekers on an isolated British island territory have told UN investigators they feel unsafe and forgotten, as they reported sexual assaults and harassment of children, as well as self-harm and suicide attempts.

Inspectors from the UN’s refugee agency visited Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, to check on their welfare.

A draft report says that conditions there amounted to arbitrary detention.

The Foreign Office said the island was not suitable for migrants to live on.

Other than the migrant camp, the island is used as a UK-US military base. Thousands of troops are stationed there, usually on a one-year deployment, along with a smaller number of military contractors. For all allegations of sexual assault and harassment, the alleged perpetrators were other asylum seekers.

Civilian visitors are not allowed - and the island has officially had no resident population since the early 1970s when the UK relocated all the people living there so it could develop the base.

### "Arunachalam" is the first Tamil leader to fail in compliance politics

*2024-02-18 19:39:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/176696) · `ta`

After the 1931 election, two people were elected from the Tamil and Muslim side when the cabinet was formed. Berry Sundaram, the Minister of Labor and Makan Makar Transport Minister. But when the Cabinet was formed in 1936, it was a separate cabinet council. Fifty -fifty demands of GG Ponnambalam. In fact, even if the executive committee selects its chairman, he can only hold the post of Minister if the President accepts it. In this, the patriotism was the silence of the patriot.

The politics of the Jaffna youth Congress, which was moving this way, moved parallel to the politics of the Jaffna Congress until 1934.. The Jaffna Youth Congress boycotted the 1931 cosmic elections. The reason is that Donamur Yapu did not give Sri Lanka a complete independence. Due to this boycott, the election has not been held in all four constituencies of Jaffna. Many Sinhalese political leaders have retreated but later retreated. The Jaffna Youth Congress was left alone in this regard.

Our defeat was always implicit in the victory of others; our wealth has always generated our poverty by nourishing the wealth of others – the empires and their native overseers. In colonial and anti-colonial alchemy, gold changes into scrap metal and food into poison. ~ Edward Galeano[1]

The opening of Edward Galeano’s book looks at the historical origins of Latin America’s underdevelopment, the central theme being the genocide of the native population by the Spanish and Portuguese ‘civilising’ colonial project in the Americas. This involved hunger, overwork, communicable diseases, and massive damage to the cultures, flora and fauna of the continent. Echoes of this are found in the thirty year civil war in Sri Lanka and in the Palestinian struggle for self-determination.

Colombo, Feb 18 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka has the worst record among South Asian countries in blacklisting corrupt contractors in public procurement, according to a new report by Verité Research.

The report shows that Sri Lanka is the only country in South Asia that 1) does not recognise engaging in corrupt and fraudulent activities during procurement as a valid reason for blacklisting 2) has not blacklisted contractors that have defaulted on contractual obligations despite having the provisions to do so.

The first issue can be attributed to gaps in the procurement guidelines of 2006, which govern almost all public procurement in Sri Lanka — except in a few instances such as pharmaceutical procurement.

The report emphasises the importance of urgently fixing these gaps to combat corruption and restore fiscal governance.

“The United States does not support action on this draft resolution. Should it come up for a vote as drafted, it will not be adopted,” Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement on Saturday.
