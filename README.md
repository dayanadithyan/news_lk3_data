Norway, Ireland and Spain said Wednesday they are recognizing a Palestinian state in a historic move that drew condemnation from Israel and jubilation from the Palestinians. Israel immediately ordered back its ambassadors from Norway and Ireland.

It was a lightning cascade of announcements. First was Norway, whose Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St├╕re said тАЬthere cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition.тАЭ

Gahr St├╕re said the Scandinavian country will officially recognize a Palestinian state as of May 28. тАЬBy recognizing a Palestinian state, Norway supports the Arab peace plan,тАЭ he said.

Several European Union countries have in the past weeks indicated that they plan to make the recognition, arguing a two-state solution is essential for lasting peace in the region. The decision may generate momentum for the recognition of a Palestinian state by other EU countries and could spur further steps at the United Nations, deepening IsraelтАЩs isolation.

Tamil Tigers were led by men who had no long-term vision or strategic clarity; Prabhakaran led LTTE to a destruction no one had thought was ever possible

One, he said, was the decision by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 1990 to force the entire Tamil-speaking Muslim community to quit Sri LankaтАЩs north with just Rs. 150 and the clothes they were in.

Whatever else they possessed, they were told, had been earned in Tamil Eelam and so must be left behind. Overnight, tens of thousands of Muslims were pauperised and turned homeless.
