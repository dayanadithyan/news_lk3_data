(Reuters) - Palestinians prepared for Ramadan in sombre mood with heightened security measures by Israeli police and the spectre of war and hunger in Gaza overshadowing the normally festive Muslim holy month as talks to secure a ceasefire stalled.

Thousands of police have been deployed around the narrow streets of the Old City in Jerusalem, where tens of thousands of worshippers are expected every day at the Al Aqsa mosque compound, one of the holiest sites in Islam.

The area, considered the most sacred place by Jews who know it as Temple Mount, has been a longstanding flashpoint for trouble and was one of the starting points of the last war in 2021 between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls Gaza.

That 10-day conflict has been dwarfed by the current war, which is now in its sixth month. It began on Oct. 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, by Israeli tallies.

Colombo, March 10 (Daily Mirror)- President Ranil Wickremesinghe is opting to hold the Presidential election first while the Rajapaksas want the General Elections held first, National People's Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.

Speaking at the Colombo District Women's Convention, he said the President prefers the Presidential election held first than to the General Elections as he has no strong support at the grassroots level.

He said the Rajapaksas prefer the General Elections first as they deem that going for a Presidential election is disadvantageous to them as they have no strong candidate to contest for the Presidency.

"The SLPP knows Rajapaksas cannot be brought in again as a leader. Basil came to the country recently. But, he has no chance to contest for the Presidency. So, they think that the General elections is more advantageous to them," he said.

### Pope Francis’ ‘white flag’ comment is met by criticism from Ukraine and its allies

Ukrainian and allied officials criticized Pope Francis for saying that Kyiv should have the “courage” to negotiate an end to the war with Russia, a statement many interpreted as a call for Ukraine to surrender.

The foreign minister of Poland, a vocal ally of Kyiv, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the Vatican, both used World War II analogies to condemn the pope’s remarks.

And a leader of one of Ukraine’s Christian churches on Sunday said that only the country’s determined resistance to Moscow’s full-scale invasion, launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 24, 2022, had prevented a mass slaughter of civilians.

In an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI and partially released on Saturday, Francis used the phrase “the courage of the white flag” as he argued that Ukraine, facing a possible defeat, should be open to peace talks brokered by international powers.

Mar. 10 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka secured a thrilling series win over Bangladesh on Saturday when they clinched the third T20 courtesy of a stunning hat-trick from Nuwan Thushara, but the brilliant performance from the visiting Sri Lankan team was probably overshadowed by the split opinions on the 'timed-out' celebration.

Sri Lanka captain Wanindu Hasaranga, after lifting the T20 trophy at the end of the post-match presentation on Saturday, handed it to Dhananjaya de Silva, who seems to be the designated trophy holder for the team when they pose for photographs, and then, in a surprising turn of events, the whole Sri Lankan squad, including Niroshan Dickwella, who didn't even get a game, appeared to be pointing their fingers towards an imaginary watch they were wearing.

They explained that nearly 40% of the female employees, including pregnant women, face difficulties due to this, adding that the Central Mail Exchange is an eight-storied building, therefore making it a rather difficult task to move around mail bags.

Thus, the UPTUF warned that if the government fails to resolve the matter within a month, the trade union action will continue.

Colombo, March 10 (Daily Mirror)- The book released by Gotabaya Rajapaksa on an alleged Conspiracy to Oust him is the latest attempt by the “president who ran away” to paint an image of innocence,National Unity Alliance said.

A statement issued by the National Unity Alliance said  the seventh executive president was ousted by the people of Sri Lanka.

"The people highlighted his lack of equitable governance, his penchant for unchallenged power and his serious lack of accountability, responsibility and willingness to be portrayed as a racist apart from turning a blind eye towards corruption and the erosion of the rule of law.

He appeared to have completely forgotten the ideals of democratic ideals so cherished by all Sri Lanka. Gotabaya was ousted not just by the people - divine intervention came into play when he without rhyme or reason gave his name to the cremation of Muslims who perished due to Covid 19," the statement added.

### Ancient Values Influence Behaviour Centuries Later

From centuries, Chinese people held that the values of their ancestors should be respected – harmony, courtesy, wisdom, loyalty and filial piety. Esteem for ancient values has a hold on Chinese society even today. One interesting matter is protection of wildlife, nature reserves and a willingness to share space. How sad that in this country (SL) people have little regard for pristine wildernesses, forests and wildlife; we have little respect for the message of Arahat Mahinda. The Yellow River (Huang Ho) carries massive quantities of muddy brown silt that fertilises thousands of acres and accounts for its name (yellow). This cradle of Chinese civilisation, known as the Sorrow of China, because frequent flooding, gives rise to much devastation, but the contradiction has long been stoically accepted.

### Half number of girls, women do not include sanitary napkins in household expenditures

Colombo, March 10 (Daily Mirror) - Due to the affordability of sanitary napkins half the number of girls and women in Sri Lanka do not include sanitary napkins in their household expenditures, the Advocata Institute said.

They said the affordability of sanitary napkins and its significant impact on the welfare of girls and women in Sri Lanka has become more pronounced in recent years.

This is particularly evident due to the decline in their purchasing powers stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis.

Approximately 4 million Sri Lankans have descended into poverty since 2019, making the total number of Sri Lankans living in poverty approximately 7 million.

Therefore, it is necessary to examine the ramifications of the lack of affordability of sanitary napkins which has been worsened by the imposition of high taxes on sanitary napkins.
