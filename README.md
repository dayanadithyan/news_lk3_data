The MP said some 8,000 people participated in the protest but ultimately it was neither a protest nor a rally.

"People had to leave soaked after being attacked with tear-gas and water cannons," he said responding to a question during a media conference.

"There was good participation for the protest though some people who usually attend our rallies did not turn up this time. People have so many issues and we had to face difficulty in bringing them. However, there were around 7,000 to 8,000 people. Ultimately,it was neither a protest nor a rally and ended up with people having to leave getting tear-gassed and soaked due to water cannon attacks. If I had organised it, I would have done it somewhat skillfully," he said.

Sri Lanka's private loans have warned that if the government does not hold constructive negotiations with them on a goodwill basis, it will engage in all measures to stop the second installment of the International Monetary Fund.

Sources said that the number of private credits is very large.

A team of private lenders has told DailyMirr that if Sri Lanka does not negotiate with them, we will engage in all activities to stop the second -volume of the IMF.

They said this is the only way to negotiate with the Sri Lankan government.

The year 2024 is expected to be one of prosperity for Asia with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expecting the region to maintain its momentum in delivering two-thirds to global growth.

Providing a snapshot of the regional economic outlook, Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department noted that the region's prospects for a soft landing have improved.

”The good news is that we have revised growth upward for both 2023 and 2024,” he said addressing a press conference this week.

For 2023, the IMF estimates growth at 4.7 percent, compared to the 4.6 percent projection in October. China and India account for most of the upward revision. In China, growth was supported by higher spending on disaster reconstruction and resilience projects. In India, strong domestic demand underpinned another increase in our growth estimate.

The Fund has also upgraded the regional growth forecast for 2024 to 4.5 percent, from 4.2 percent in October.

Colombo (News 1st) – The Myanmar government has begun a crackdown on Chinese warlord families running scam centres in the Laukkaing province of Myanmar, foreign media reported. This is a different province to the one in which 56 Sri Lankans are known to be enslaved in online scam centres in Myanmar close to the Thai border.

The Myanmar military junta on Tuesday flew the leaders of three Chinese mafia families to Beijing on a special chartered flight. The three – Bai Suocheng, Wei Chaoren and Liu Zhengxiang – had been running a ‘scam city’ in the province of Laukkaing with the backing of the Myanmar junta since 2009.

But increasing pressure from the Chinese government, together with the weakening of the junta in losses to Myanmar rebel armies in far-flung regions of Myanmar, resulted in the junta turning over the warlords.

The price of Kirisamba paddy has fallen to Rs 120. Ponni Samba is sold in Colombo for 275 rupees. But the government has set 260 rupees as a control price. However, consumers are unable to get rice at that price.

But the paddy farmers for the country are purchased for 80 rupees. In the majority of 30 lakh metric tons of paddy will be harvested. It will get 20 lakh metric tonnes of rice. The need for rice per year is only 24 lakh metric tons.

### Sri Lanka rupee appreciates to 313.60/314.00 to US dollar after opening

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lankas rupee opened at 314.75/315.00 the US dollar, in the spot forex market Thursday, dealers said, with the central bank allowing the currency to appreciate amid a balance of payments surplus it has created, with appropriate monetary policy.

Sri Lanka’s rupee closed stronger at 315.50/70 to the US dollar.

Within the first hour of trading the rupee was quoted as strong as 313.30/314.00 to the US dollar, dealers said.

In a balance of payments surplus triggered by the sell-down of central bank held Treasury bills, the currency is under upward pressure and the central bank can decide at what rate to buy to stop appreciating.

Even if only a part of the liquidity from dollar purchases are mopped up, through domestic operations an overall balance of payments develops.

Sri Lanka’s central bank does not usually allow the exchange rate to appreciate in the credit slowdown that usually accompanies a currency crisis, though it did after the 2009 crisis.
