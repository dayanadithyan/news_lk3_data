The revenue to the government, including the grants, rose by a staggering 61.8 percent in January 2024. This is a result of the government raking in billions of rupees out of peopleтАЩs pockets to appease the International Monetary FundтАЩs revenue targets.

The government revenues and grants for January were Rs.283.19 billion, out of which Rs.257.57 billion was raised via taxes. This was 63.8 percent higher from the same period last year.

The staggering increase in the tax revenues in January compared to the same month in 2023 was predominantly due to the recovering economy which was supported further by the 3 percent increase in the value added tax rate from January 1, 2024 onwards.

Between then and now, there wasnтАЩt a single other tax imposed or raised except for the value added tax, and hence the bulk of the growth in tax income came from the recovering economy due to the normalising foreign currency inflows.

### Can Ranil  Wickremesinghe  Regain the Support of Tamil and Muslim Voters at the 2024 Presidential Elections?

*2024-05-20 03:18:00* ┬╖ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84070) ┬╖ `en`

Sri LankaтАЩs last official census was taken in 2012. According to that census, Sri LankaтАЩs majority ethnic community the Sinhalese comprises 74.9 % of the island nationтАЩs population.  Numerically, the second largest ethnicity is the Sri Lankan Tamils who are 11.1% of the population. The third largest ethnicity is the Sri Lankan Muslims or Moors who comprise 9.3% of the population. The fourth largest ethnic group is the Tamils of  Indian origin known as тАЬMalaiyagath ThamizharтАЭ (Hill Country Tamils) who are 4.1%.

The three numerical minorities namely the Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims and Indian Tamils together are 25.5% of the population. These three ethnic groups form the majority in some Sri Lankan districts. In other districts they are a substantive segment of the population. Since the people of all districts vote together in the Presidential elections, the entire island is transformed into a тАЬsingleтАЭ constituency with a 74.9% Sinhala majority and 25.5 % non тАУ Sinhala minorities.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said that the government failed to do so to the military, causing them to die in the Russian battlefield.

He said this while addressing an event in Galle Neluwa on Saturday (18).

It must be re -consider whether the military community has had to commit a proper duty after the victory of the thirty years of terrorist war.. Soldiers and their families are suffering from great difficulties and are facing an unbearable economic and social crisis.

Soldiers have gone to the lower level of the poverty line due to the lack of relief in the economic crisis, which has risen to the country.. So they have gone abroad in search of other income. Others have to go to Russia and go to the front of the battlefield.

### The presidential election will be ignored until the federal assurance is granted - the Tamil National People's Front calls

*2024-05-20 02:49:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183989) ┬╖ `ta`

It seems like you've shared a detailed perspective on the political and social dynamics surrounding the Tamil people's relationship with the Sri Lankan state, focusing on issues of rights, representation, and the impact of electoral processes on their struggle for recognition and autonomy. Your message highlights several key points:



1. **Boycott of Presidential Elections**: The idea of boycotting the Sri Lankan Presidential election as a means to assert the Tamil people's stance on their rights and demands.



2. **Compromise and Negotiation**: The call for the Sri Lankan government to engage in meaningful dialogue and negotiation with the Tamil people to address their grievances and concerns.



3. **Rejection of Sinhala Buddhist Hegemony**: The rejection of policies and structures that marginalize the Tamil people and promote Sinhala Buddhist dominance.



4. **International Recognition and Support**: The importance of international community involvement and support in addressing the Tamil people's plight.



5. **Historical and Current Injustices**: A recounting of historical injustices faced by the Tamil people, including forced displacement, denial of resettlement rights, and the lack of accountability for human rights abuses.



6. **Political Aspirations and Solutions**: The emphasis on self-determination, federalism, and the right to a political solution that recognizes the Tamil people's sovereignty and identity.



7. **Critique of Political Maneuvers**: A critique of attempts by certain political actors to manipulate the Tamil people's aspirations for personal gain or to further Sinhala Buddhist interests.



8. **Call for Unity and Collective Action**: The appeal for the Tamil people to unite and exert collective pressure through peaceful means to achieve their political and social objectives.



Your message underscores the complexity of the issues facing the Tamil people and the challenges they face in asserting their rights within the Sri Lankan state. It also reflects a deep-seated frustration with the current political landscape and a strong desire for change that respects and acknowledges the Tamil people's unique cultural, linguistic, and national identity.

The Tamil National People's Front (TNA) has called for a complete boycott until the unity of the Sri Lankan presidential election will be eliminated and the federal guarantee is granted.

The party said in a clarification report on the presidential election titled 'We will be thinking of the welfare of Tamil Nadu'.

In the Tamil nation, the Tamil Nadu state is acting as an enemy of the Tamil nation by continuing the Sinhala Buddhistization, militarization and systematic ethnic process through the construction of the ethnic groups.. The Sri Lankan government, which considers the Tamils to cause any crisis as long as the majority representation within the unity state structure is in their hands, is maintaining the interests of the Sinhalese nation, not considering the Tamil people as its enemies.
