However, he said that the Central Committee would convene on the 10th and 11th of this month to support the general candidate or to support the candidate who urged Samasti in election science.

When Sumanthiran said yesterday that Wickeswaran was unable to hold the Northern Provincial Council, Wickeswaran should be given the right thing to give our party the opinion of the party.

If the present situation is confused by the unity, there is a problem with bringing basic politics.

Mahinda Rajapaksa had asked the police to rely on Pillayan. That is why we have chosen the former Justice and demanded that the police authority be financed.

Scientists have made another major stride toward the long-sought goal of diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease with a simple blood test. On Sunday, a team of researchers reported that a blood test was significantly more accurate than doctors’ interpretation of cognitive tests and CT scans in signaling the condition.

The study, published Sunday in the journal JAMA, found that about 90 per cent of the time the blood test correctly identified whether patients with memory problems had Alzheimer’s. Dementia specialists using standard methods that did not include expensive PET scans or invasive spinal taps were accurate 73 per cent of the time, while primary care doctors using those methods got it right only 61 per cent of the time.

The results, presented Sunday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Philadelphia, are the latest milestone in the search for affordable and accessible ways to diagnose Alzheimer’s, a disease that afflicts more than 32 million people worldwide.

### The developing picture as elections approach

*2024-07-29 11:36:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-developing-picture-as-elections-approach/) · `en`

There’s a political poster that’s been splashed on the walls of Colombo. Black letters on a yellow background mean that the author or the party cannot be identified. It is obviously a teaser campaign. It comes with a promise, which of course is the bread and butter of all politicians. Apparently, ‘the lie will come to an end,’ and on the 29th, the name of the messiah who will take all Sri Lankans to some yet-to-be-named promised land will be revealed.

This is the season for that kind of thing, so the timing is not bad at all. After all, people are talking about elections these days. They are wondering if elections will be held soon and, if so, whether it would be a presidential or parliamentary election. They talk about candidates, those who have announced their intentions and those who might very soon.

### US Politics: Trump in trouble after Biden’s Sacrifice and Kamala Harris’s Surge

In one master stroke last Sunday afternoon, the beleaguered American President Joe Biden turned the tables on Donald Trump and the Republican Party. From his home in Delaware, Biden tersely announced that he was withdrawing from the race and endorsing his Vice President Kamala Harris to be the nominee of the Democratic Party for the November presidential election. If that was stunning, the even greater shock and awe is the speed and manner in which Kamala Harris has rolled out her campaign; secured her nomination within hours; energized the Party at every level; enthused the youth in their own network worlds; raised millions of dollars by the minute; and served notice to Trump that she is the prosecutor, he is the felon, and she knows his type.

### Bandaranaike, Chelvanayakam and the collapse of their Grand Collaboration

*2024-07-29 11:35:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/bandaranaike-chelvanayakam-and-the-collapse-of-their-grand-collaboration/) · `en`

The 1956 elections brought to the forefront of Sinhala-Tamil political divide two former classmates at St. Thomas’s College, SWRD Bandaranaike and SJV Chelvanayakam. SWRD rode to power as Prime Minister, heading the ideologically motley MEP coalition, on the well-orchestrated Sinhala Only wave. SJV and his Tamil Arasu Kadchi or Federal Party swept the elections in the North and East to present a defensive phalanx in parliament supplemented by non-violent protests outside parliament.

Yet there was more in common between the two men than what appeared on the surface as Sinhala-Tamil political confrontation. Just as there is more in common between the Sinhalese and the Tamils socially and culturally than what would appear to be the case on the surface of politics.

“The results cannot be hidden. The country has peacefully chosen a change,” Gonzalez said in a post on X at around 11 p.m. local time, before the results were announced.

Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado reiterated a call for the country’s military to uphold the results of the vote.

“A message for the military. The people of Venezuela have spoken: they don’t want Maduro,” she said earlier on X. “It is time to put yourselves on the right side of history. You have a chance and it’s now.”

### Why is mathematics considered difficult?

*2024-07-29 02:22:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/why-is-mathematics-considered-difficult-2/) · `en`

Mathematics is considered as one of the most challenging subjects by schoolchildren. A good number of students give up easily thinking that they are not up to taking up these challenges. Students’ struggles may arise due to a variety of reasons.

A common difficulty is the abstractness of the concepts. Unlike other subjects that are more concrete, mathematics deals with numbers and symbols that can be difficult to comprehend. Also, as mathematics involves multistep problems, the solutions may require several thought processes to come up with a solution. This requires staying actively focused on the given task. Some students find it difficult to maintain this focus, thereby struggle in the problem-solving process.
