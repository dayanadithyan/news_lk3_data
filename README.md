### Remembering Mervyn de Silva on his 25th Death Anniversary

*2024-06-21 03:51:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/remembering-mervyn-de-silva-on-his-25th-death-anniversary/) · `en`

When Mervyn de Silva left us on 22nd June 1999, it was not just the twentieth century that was drawing to a close. In retrospect one could sense, and now we know, that with his passing, an era in the literary history of Sri Lanka had ended. Because he was the last of a golden age of journalism, an illustrious tradition of English journalism in Sri Lanka that gave us H. A. J. Hulugalle, Jayantha Padmanabha, Tarzie Vittachi and Denzil Peiris. They were brilliant editors who provided us with not just world-class newspapers; they were also erudite men who helped build a Ceylonese literati that any society can be proud of.

I make no apologies for repeating what I have written before on my editor, my guru, my role model and my friend Mervyn de Silva, because all of it remains just as valid as it did a quarter of a century ago. The defining attributes of Mervyn and their importance bear repetition and deserve considered reflection.

Continuing from last year proceeds election politics. Two moves this week by the President of Sri Lanka have caused waves in Parliament and among citizens of this land. But Cassandra will not comment.

The announcement from the Elysee Palace came soon after the EU elections were over. Macron said he had heard the message for holding elections. “France needs a clear majority in serenity and harmony,” he said, adding that he could not resign himself to the far-right’s progress everywhere in the continent. He will continue as Prez since he has barely completed two years of his five-year tenure. It was seven years before change in 2002 to five years and only two consecutive terms are allowed.

Citing the Parliamentary Privileges Committee report, Bakeer Markar pointed out numerous irregularities in the bill’s submission process to the Parliamentary Drafting Office and the Attorney General’s Department.

“It is evident that this unfairness resulted from a deliberate failure to adhere to established procedures for bills presented by individual members,” Bakeer Markar said. He urged MPs to review specific sections of the report that highlight these injustices.
