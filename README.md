### The UPI revolution: Cashless digitised economy activated

*2024-02-20 00:45:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-UPI-revolution-Cashless-digitised-economy-activated/4-758654) · `en`

It’s time now for the cashless digitised economy revolution in Sri Lanka too

The long-term opportunity for Sri Lanka is to use this technology to drive digitised transactions among Sri Lankan consumers. This would be a win-win for all – consumers need not carry cash or cards, merchants can have much better control of their revenues and the Government will now be able to accrue greater revenue by channelling the unorganised cash sector into the formal economy

I became the first person to officially transact using UPI in Sri Lanka on 12 February 2024. In the presence of three heads of states/governments. Leaders of India, Sri Lanka and Mauritius watched the transaction and celebrated its success with applause.

So what is UPI? How does it benefit Indian consumers, merchants and its economy? And why is it such a big deal? And how can Sri Lanka benefit from its introduction here?

UPI is a payment gateway used in India that’s catapulting India from a primarily cash economy to a digital economy.

### Busting fake unions presents avenues for better progress

*2024-02-20 00:41:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Busting-fake-unions-presents-avenues-for-better-progress/14-758653) · `en`

For some union leaders, entry into a factory with wider membership promises better funding and position

The Sri Lankan apparel industry captured the spotlight over the past year, as reduced orders resulted in factory closures, lesser earnings and job losses. The drop in orders was consequent to a global demand dip stemming from COVID-19-led lockdowns. This was compounded by price competitiveness, with Sri Lanka trailing far behind nations like Bangladesh, Vietnam and China that also boasts significantly higher efficiency. Despite Sri Lanka’s high-cost base, the destination is a darling for global brands due to its high compliance standards and production quality. However, this will not suffice to grow the segment as other nations are catching up fast, especially with quality.

Medicinal drugs can be divided into three major categories depending on their route of administration to patients: oral, parenteral, and topical forms. The parenteral (par = beyond, enteral = intestines) means administration not involving the intestinal or oral route. The parenteral drugs can be further classified in to four types depending on the site of administration: intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intradermal drugs. The aim of this write up is to highlight the safety precautions involved in the manufacture of intravenous drugs as their quality, or lack of it, can be a matter of life or death for the patient.

Providing credit facilities under microfinance to the poor and underprivileged could be considered as a powerful tool in alleviating poverty

A new Micro Finance and Credit Regulatory Bill has been tabled in Parliament towards regulating the existing money lending business of various entities to protect borrowers from any unfairness. The proposed bill, it has been reported, will repeal the Microfinance Act No: 16 of 2016.

At present it has been revealed there are close to 11,000 institutions involved in lending for this sector and only five among them are registered. The remainder operate on their own without abiding by the rules and regulations imposed by the Regulators. Some of these entities involved in money lending charge exorbitant interest ranging from 40% to a staggering 200% as reported in the media.

### Scrapping the Executive Presidency; Hypocrisy to the Core

### The Judicial Power of the People and a ‘Presidential Interpretation’  of our Constitution

*2024-02-20 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-Judicial-Power-of-the-People-and-a-Presidential-Interpretation-of-our-Constitution/172-277340) · `en`

President Wickremesinghe is aware that in 2018, the Supreme Court, in a seven bench decision, decided that former President Sirisena had acted arbitrarily and unconstitutionally by dissolving Parliament prematurely. Consequently, Wickremesinghe was restored to the office of Prime Minister. Therefore, it is evident that the President cannot seek unquestioning loyalty to himself from all public officials and institutions in the exercise of what he personally considers are his powers and responsibilities.

“Since 1972 this country has known no Monarch, and the President has not inherited that mantle.

All his powers are limited by the provisions of the Constitution.”

The Friday Forum, an informal group of concerned citizens pledged to uphold the norms of Democracy, Good Governance, the Rule of Law, Human Rights, Media Freedom and Tolerance raised concerns on the Presidential Secretariat’s interpretation of Presidential powers.

### Abu Dhabi heralds Era of Religious Accommodation in Islamic West Asia

*2024-02-20 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Abu-Dhabi-heralds-Era-of-Religious-Accommodation-in-Islamic-West-Asia/172-277346) · `en`

Due to the demographic changes brought about by economic growth, the Islamic United Arab Emirates (UAE) is beginning to shed its traditional objection to the public practice of other religions, especially idol worship.

On February 14, Abu Dhabi heralded a new era of religious accommodation by allowing Hindus, a very large community of expatriates from India, to build a grand temple. Significantly, the land for it was donated by the UAE government. This could well be a harbinger of religious tolerance in Muslim-majority West Asia.

A few Hindu temples had come up in the past, with one even dating back to 1817, but the newest and the grandest of them all is the one which was consecrated on February 14 by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Abu Dhabi, a constituent of the UAE.

The UAE has 3.5 million Indians, the majority of whom are Hindus. Indian immigrants, who make up 30% of the UAE’s population, are the single largest ethnic community in the UAE.

We are not too late to bring this time-tested system home to protect both the farmer and the food security

Establishing a local futures exchange would mitigate problems of paddy farmers and political problems propelling out of falling market prices of paddy during harvesting time. Such a futures market could be used for all agricultural products not only to stabilise the prices but also to provide greater liquidity for the producer

Farmers face two main types of risks: production risk and price risk. The risk of production, or risk of return, concerns events of chance origin, related to the nature, to which the producers are exposed. These shocks are linked to either rainfall and climatic variations, invasions of insects, or the occurrence of diseases. Price risk due to price volatility refers to unexpected price fluctuations that are so large and rapid that it becomes impossible to meet expectations.

Colombo, Feb 19 (Daily Mirror) - If Sri Lanka is to adopt a nuclear energy generating project, then the country should first have a firm legal framework in place, was the opinion of an international atomic energy expert.

He said there are numerous factors to be considered when taking up a nuclear energy project in a country and the first is to establish a firm legal background.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) consultant and expert on nuclear energy Dr. Halil Avci said this while addressing a special forum of local environment authorities and atomic energy officials last week, a spokesperson from the Central Environment Authority (CEA) told the Daily Mirror.

“A country has to first decide whether it is to adopt nuclear power generation projects and consider various environment and other factors. But if they do then there should be a firm legal background,” Avci said.

ECONOMYNEXT – Employees of the State Pensions Department ask questions not within their remit, and make the rules up as they go, a government legislator has said.

“In some instances, the Department of Pensions asks questions that they do not have the legal right to ask, and therefore people do not get their pensions,” Chairman of the Sectoral Monitoring Committee for an Open and Responsible Government and Member of Parliament, Jagath Kumara Sumitraarachchi, said at a press briefing on Friday (16).

Sumitraarachchi alleged that certain employees of the department take the law into their own hands adding that there have been instances where government employees make up laws and slash pensions.

“In one instance, there was a husband and a wife who had not lived together, so the department had given a letter saying a pension could not be approved.”

“Public officials must not operate based on personal preferences,” Sumitraarachchi criticized the unethical professional conduct.
