“Nature builds no machines,” wrote Marx in a famous passage in the Grundrisse. They are “products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature.” Fundamentally, Marxism is the (socialist) theory and practice of industrial societies. Marx’s insights on the logic of automation is now drawing the attention of technology watchers who are both excited and concerned by the current phenomenon of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In the complex environment of human labour, labour-created, labour-saving and labour-replacing machinery and automation, and the mostly uneven industrial society at large, engineering education and research are a critical medium providing training to human resources and technical mastery over material resources.

In the face of escalating protests and violence, Sheikh Hasina, the Bangladeshi prime minister, faced a tumultuous end to her tenure. Despite calls for peace and attempts to negotiate with security forces and military officials, the situation spiraled out of control. Faced with overwhelming public opposition and internal conflicts within the government, Hasina eventually decided to flee her official residence. This decision came after a series of events including violent clashes, rising death tolls, and a failed attempt to secure her safety. Ultimately, the pressure from both the public and the military proved too great, leading to Hasina's departure from Bangladesh.

Hasina made the decision to leave at the right moment-he fled and entered his official residence in a few hours.

Sheikh Sina was invited to a meeting of the National Security Council on Sunday morning.

The meeting took place in a situation where protests against the prime minister have been on the rise as protests have taken place over the country for several weeks.

On Sunday alone, more than 90 people lost their lives. Many people were shot dead by security forces.

The BBC's Bengal service has received information that Hasina presented two solutions during a meeting with security officials.

*2024-08-10 08:56:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190711) · `ta`

Iraqi Parliament proposes lowering women's marriage age to 9 and men's to 15, sparking outrage from human rights groups. Critics warn of dire impacts on education, health, and wellbeing of young women. The bill suggests allowing individuals to choose between religious laws and civil court for family matters. If enacted, it could lead to marriages of 9-year-old girls and 15-year-old boys. UNICEF reports 28% of Iraqi women were married under 18, despite the legal age being 18. Women in Iraq are fighting against this bill.

🟩

The Iraqi Parliament has filed a controversial bill to reduce women's marriage age to 9 and the marriage age of male children to 15.

Human rights organizations and activists are vehemently opposed to this bill. They warn that this will have serious consequences of the education, health and well -being of young women.

The law states that marriage in Iraq should be at least 18 years old.

However, the new law proposed by the Iraqi Ministry of Justice will allow people to choose whether to follow religious rules for family matters or to adopt a civil court system.

If the law is passed, the nine -year -old girls and the 15 -year -old boys can get married.

UNICEF, a UN child organization, said it was married to 28 percent of women in Iraq even though it was 18 years old.

It is also reported that Iraqi women have launched a struggle against the current relaxation bill.
