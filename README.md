Exclusive class culture is a feature of Sri Lanka's free education.Thousands of teachers who receive the monthly salary and conduct exclusive classes and get millions of money.

The Ministry of Education has defined the number of students in a classroom.In the 40 -minute course, the teaching of a teacher should be understood and the environment should be existed in the classroom.

This is why the number of students is defined.Similarly, the number of teachers can only have physical qualifications and skills that teach in a classroom.

But the same teachers are the same teachers who teach about five hundred students from two to three hours.. Parents and the Ministry of Education do not question this. But the issues of the Finance Minister Ranjith Siyambalab Bittiya are thinking about the amount of parents spending on exclusive classes in our country.. Parents are allocating thirty percent of their children for exclusive classes, rather than the amount they spend on school education, he said.

### Watch: Super-slingy Thushara sends Jos Buttler’s off-stump flying, takes two in two on SA20 debut

Jan. 22 (wisden) - Nuwan Thushara, bowling with a super-slingy action, claimed two wickets in two balls to kick off an electric death spell on SA20 debut.

The 29-year-old, who has played six T20Is for Sri Lanka, is building a portfolio in franchise cricket, with today (January 21) marking his bow for MI Cape Town in South Africa’s SA20. Handed the new ball up against the formidable opening pairing of Jos Buttler and Jason Roy, he began with an exemplary yorker and mixed slower balls in as well, but was hit for three boundaries in his first two overs as Paarl Royals began strongly.

When he returned for the 18th over, Paarl Royals were 140-1 and aiming for an explosive finish, but Thushara had other ideas. His first ball zipped past Buttler’s outside edge to send off-stump cartwheeling, and his second left Fabian Allen hobbling, a vicious yorker smashing the West Indies international on the top of the boot. He was given lbw.

### Modi inaugurates Hindu temple on razed Babri mosque site

*2024-01-22 13:11:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Modi-inaugurates-Hindu-temple-on-razed-Babri-mosque-site/108-275492) · `en`

India, Jan 22 (BBC) - India's PM Narendra Modi has taken part in rituals to open a grand temple to popular Hindu god Ram in Ayodhya city.

The temple replaces a 16th-Century mosque razed by Hindu mobs in 1992. The demolition had sparked nationwide riots in which nearly 2,000 people died.

Thousands of invited guests, including top film stars, industrialists and cricketers, attended the event.

But some Hindu seers and most of the opposition boycotted it, saying Mr Modi was using it for political gains.

General elections are due in India in the next few months and Mr Modi's political rivals say the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be seeking votes in the temple's name in a country where 80% of the population is Hindu.

Critics have also accused the government of going overboard with what is essentially a religious celebration in a country which - according to its constitution - is secular.

### Social Web Site as the force that determines diplomacy beyond politics

*2024-01-22 12:34:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174477) · `ta`

Is it possible to mortgage the lives of millions of people in the name of development for the desires of Indians who seek revenge on the Maldives?

In the contemporary world where politics and diplomacy are determined by the basis for the ideas that are spread through social networks, these people cannot succeed.

This is because Indians and the Maldives do not have the number of influential numbers and energy on social networks.

It is imperative to see the problem of these people beyond the mirror of the Internet.

### Ron DeSantis ends 2024 campaign, endorses Trump over Haley

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis ended his fading presidential campaign on Sunday and endorsed Donald Trump just two days before the pivotal New Hampshire primary, leaving former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley as Trump’s last long-shot challenger for the Republican nomination.

DeSantis’ decision, less than a week after his deflating loss to Trump in Iowa despite an enormous investment there, caps a stunning fall from grace after DeSantis had been widely seen as Republicans’ most promising alternative to Trump ahead of the general election in November.

His departure sets up the one-on-one battle that Haley has coveted against Trump, the former president who has maintained an iron grip on the Republican electorate despite facing four criminal prosecutions. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all the cases.

The inauguration of the temple, which is still under construction, is dedicated to Hinduism’s most revered deity Lord Ram. It fulfills a demand made by millions of Hindus for over 100 years and delivers on a crucial campaign pledge from Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.

Ayodhya, once dotted with tightly packed houses and rundown stalls, has undergone an elaborate makeover in the lead up to the inauguration. Narrow roads have been turned into a four-lane pilgrimage route leading to the temple, tourists are arriving at a new airport and sprawling railway station, and major hotel chains are building new properties.
