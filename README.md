### Do you use the power to recover the flower of the flower?-The Blessed Chancellor

A controversy erupted when Sri Lanka's TS. I Company featured a Tamil symbol in its product, sparking accusations of cultural appropriation and political bias. Activists argue this reflects the country's chauvinistic politics towards Tamils. The incident, including the use of the symbol at a school event and concerns over potential legal action, highlights deeper issues of ethnic tension and political manipulation. Calls for unity among Tamil nationalists and a focus on electoral strategies are emerging as responses to these incidents.

"It is openly rooted to the politics of the Tamils ​​by uniting the flower of the flower," said Sathivale, a social justice activist and a national organization for the release of political prisoners.

Sri Lanka's leading footwear company TS. The I Company has recently posted a flower in one of its products marketed. It shows how much of Sri Lanka's chauvinist political bourgeoisie occupies and is publicly caught by one of the political identities of the Tamils ​​to trample the politics of the Tamils ​​by trampling and trampling the flower.. This is strongly condemned and the Tamil -conscious patriots must reveal the appropriate lesson.

“Are we going to continue with hugs, or are we going to apply the law to criminals?” Gálvez asked a cheering crowd. “Mexico wants peace, wants tranquility.”

Australia plans to boycott the UN General Assembly tribute to Iran's President Raisi, citing his human rights abuses. The move follows reports that Australia will also skip the US tribute to Raisi. The decision is backed by claims of Raisi's involvement in mass killings during Iran's 1988 prison massacres, with critics labeling him "Tehran's butcher."

Australia will boycott Ibrahim Raisi's tribute to the United Nations General Assembly.

According to reports, Australia will also boycott the Iranian president's tribute to the US.

The Guardian said it was sure that no Australian representatives would attend the United Nations General Assembly.

The Australian government has the moral duty to boycott the UN's today's event, which is a tribute to the many Iranians as Tehran's butcher, said the Liberal Party's Glyrey Sandler.

Australia should be supported by the innocent civilians under the Raisi government, so many of the victims are women.

US officials, who have said that Ibrahim Raisi is the worst human rights violations in Iran, have killed thousands of prisoners in 1988, they said they would boycott the tribute event.

### “Rob Or Perish” – A Grim Reality In Public Service?

With a heavy heart, I share two photographs of George Michael, a former Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism: one taken on his retirement day and the other published years later by the ministry’s chief accountant at that time. This heart-wrenching image, which circulated on social media earlier, calls for financial or other assistance to support him. This piece, which should have been written earlier, is not meant to generalize but rather to highlight why some public officials have become what they are today, which can be interpreted in both ways.

George Michael (name fondly mistaken to English singer and celebrity) served as Secretary to the Ministry of Tourism before his premature retirement in 2011, after being discarded into the pool while his superiors then were aiming to transform Sri Lanka into an ‘economic paradise’ like Singapore.
