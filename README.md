ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äî Trade unions representing Sri Lanka‚Äôs state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) have threatened to defeat a new electricity reform bill even if it is passed in parliament.

Trade unions held a demonstration against the bill Thursday April 25 near the parliament complex. Parallel protests were also organised in Galle, Tangalle and Hambantota.

General Secretary of the Ceylon Electrical Workers Union Ranjan Jayalal told reporters at the demonstration that

‚ÄúThis is bill that offers no benefits to CEB workers or to seven million CEB consumers but proposes to split the CEB¬† to a number of companies and offer them to foreign companies. Even if it is passed, we will defeat it outside parliament,‚Äù said Jayalal.

### Give cup of milk tea for Rs. 80: Asela Sampath

*2024-04-25 12:36:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Give-cup-of-milk-tea-for-Rs-80-Asela-Sampath/108-281355) ¬∑ `en`

Colombo, April 25 (Daily Mirror) - National Consumer Front Chairman Asela Sampath urged the canteen owners to provide a cup of milk tea for Rs. 80 from today while granting the concession of the reduced prices of imported milk powder to the consumers.

Addressing the media, he said the milk powder importers had decided to reduce the retail prices of their one kilogram and 400 grams of milk powder packets with effect from today due to the depreciation of the dollar in the world market.

"In the recent past, people used to avoid patronising hotels to have a cup of milk tea due to the increase in milk powder prices.

"Now the situation has changed, and again, people have the opportunity to have a cup of milk tea at a price of Rs. 80," Sampath said.

In a statement, the Spanish leader said he urgently needed to decide ‚Äúwhether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour‚Äù.

Mr S√°nchez said his wife would defend her honour and work with the judiciary.

The Spanish prime minister said he would make a decision on his future before the media on Monday 29 April, after reflecting whether it was worth remaining in office ‚Äúdespite the mud‚Äù that the right and far right were trying to turn politics into.

If this bill is not amended at the committee stage, it will impose significant costs of compliance on small businesses who are already under stress from the crisis

The Gender Equality Bill has been gazetted. It requires every public institution and private institution to appoint a senior official to be responsible for gender mainstreaming and gender equality (‚ÄúGender Focal Point‚Äù). That person is legally required to prepare a plan of activities targeting their areas of responsibility and report directly to the Council on a quarterly basis with a copy to Women Parliamentarians Caucus in Parliament (section 17).

If this bill is not amended at the committee stage, it will impose significant costs of compliance on small businesses who are already under stress from the crisis. It will also impose costs on State entities and large corporations, but the focus here is on small business which are least capable of meeting unfunded mandates.

A golden rule for leaders embarking on digital transformation is to educate themselves. This education is not merely academic; it is a necessary step in becoming conversant in the language of technology, a prerequisite for the formulation and execution of effective digital strategies ‚Äì adapted from Rewired, McKinsey, 2021.

We have never seen change like we experience today. In today‚Ä∫s VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world, corporate leaders find themselves rowing not in the calm waters but in the turbulent rapids of white-water rafting. The calm predictability of the past has given way to a landscape where constant change is the only constant.

Amidst this turbulence, one of the most significant drivers of change has been technology, whose capabilities are expanding at a staggering rate. There are three factors that create these ‚Äòdisruptive‚Äô trends, which need to be understood in the right magnitude and scale.

Sri Lanka is an island nation situated in a strategically important location in the Indian Ocean Region at the centre of maritime trade routes in between East and West, as well as in the middle of Africa, the Arab, and Eastern worlds and is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs location enables the country to provide quick and efficient global and regional connectivity to move cargo to and from Asia to the rest of the world. More than 60,000 ships ply this route annually, carrying two-thirds of the world‚Äôs oil and half of the global containerised traffic.

Sri Lanka, also located very close to all major ports in the Indian subcontinent, especially those of India, with the rising middle class, makes it a prime location that is able to provide fast and easy connectivity to the Indian subcontinent through its feeder network.

SJB presidential campaign manager Sujeewa Senasinghe and live-wire SM Marikkar accuse President Wickremesinghe of refusing the SJB its request of venue for May 1st and switching that preferred location to the JVP-NPP instead.

Is Ranil already a shareholder of the SJB, while simultaneously undermining it? Is he patronizing policy proxies in the SJB?

Sri Lanka defaulted on its external debt for the first time in its postcolonial history in April 2022.

The underlying analysis of the causes of the debt crisis itself is also flawed.

The Colombo District Court issued an interim injunction against Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from performing duties as the Acting Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) yesterday.

A similar injunction was also issued against the SLFP Acting General Secretary Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala.

The injunctions, in effect until 8 May, were granted considering a case filed by SLFP office bearers Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Duminda Dissanayake, and Mahinda Amaraweera.

Chandaka Jayasundara PC representing the plaintiffs told the courts that it is illegal and against the party‚Äôs constitution for the defendants to hold the positions.

Jayasundara noted that Rajapakshe‚Äôs membership status disqualifies him from holding any position within the SLFP, citing constitutional illegality in having a member of another party in such a role.

Additionally, Jayasundara highlighted that the Executive Committee convened on 21 April to appoint Rajapakshe was unlawful.
