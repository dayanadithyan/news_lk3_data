### Remembering Mervyn de Silva on his 25th Death Anniversary

*2024-06-21 03:51:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/remembering-mervyn-de-silva-on-his-25th-death-anniversary/) ¬∑ `en`

When Mervyn de Silva left us on 22nd June 1999, it was not just the twentieth century that was drawing to a close. In retrospect one could sense, and now we know, that with his passing, an era in the literary history of Sri Lanka had ended. Because he was the last of a golden age of journalism, an illustrious tradition of English journalism in Sri Lanka that gave us H. A. J. Hulugalle, Jayantha Padmanabha, Tarzie Vittachi and Denzil Peiris. They were brilliant editors who provided us with not just world-class newspapers; they were also erudite men who helped build a Ceylonese literati that any society can be proud of.

I make no apologies for repeating what I have written before on my editor, my guru, my role model and my friend Mervyn de Silva, because all of it remains just as valid as it did a quarter of a century ago. The defining attributes of Mervyn and their importance bear repetition and deserve considered reflection.
