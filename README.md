The President highlighted that his efforts, including discussions with world leaders to secure fertilizer subsidies, were instrumental in getting farmers back to their fields and boosting rice production in the country.

‚ÄúToday, promises are being made to lower fertilizer prices and erase farmers‚Äô debts. Yet, when farmers were in urgent need of fertilizer, those promises were not fulfilled. I ask Sajith and Anura, where were you then?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have worked to stabilize the country‚Äôs economy through tough and often unpopular decisions. I reopened businesses that had closed, and now we have achieved economic stability,‚Äù he said.

In 2023, the public sector wage bill was 3.4 percent of GDP down from 4.0 percent in 2022 and it rose to 3.6 percent in 2024, the statement said.

Under proposed increments it will rise to 3.8 percent in 2024 which will be below the 2022 level.

But tax revenue are expected to go to 15 percent, with motor vehicle imports also relaxed.

The salary hike would be made within the recurrent primary expenditure (before interest), of 12.7 percent of GDP.

As a result Sri Lanka would be able to run a primary surplus of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2025 under the IMF program.

It was not possible to increase the salary again in 2023 as Sri Lanka had to keep within the IMF program targets and it can only be done in 2025 as revenues improve, the Finance Ministry said.
