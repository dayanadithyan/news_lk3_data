### Sri Lanka to revive senior citizen interest subsidies?

But real interest rates have been high over the past twelve months, amid good monetary stability provided by the central bank.

Sri Lanka’s 12 month fixed deposit rate was 15.09 percent in June 2023 and headline inflation, according to the Colombo Consumer Price Index, was only 1.7 percent in the past 12 months, giving real interest rates of 13.39 percent to a person who deposited money last year.
