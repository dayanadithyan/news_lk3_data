Semasinghe noted that the Bill also facilitates issuing guarantees, on-lending, and entering into suppliers’ credit and financial lease agreements. A key feature of the Bill is the establishment of the Public Debt Management Office, which will oversee these activities and ensure effective management of the country’s debt.

### Canada stun Ireland by 12 runs in T20 World Cup

*2024-06-08 00:24:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Canada-stun-Ireland-by-12-runs-in-T20-World-Cup/108-284398) · `en`

(New York) - Canada won their first match at any Twenty20 World Cup when they stunned Ireland by 12 runs in a Group A game in New York on Friday.

Defending a target of just 138, the non-Test nation bowled and fielded expertly to hold Ireland to 125-7 from their full 20 overs.

Ireland collapsed spectacularly to 59-6 and come the last five overs they still needed 64 more runs to win -- a rate of more than 12 an over

George Dockrell (30 not out) and Mark Adair (34) reduced the target to 17 off the last six balls.

But Canada paceman Jeremy Gordon held his nerve superbly, conceding just three runs and dismissing Adair with the second ball of the 20th over when he held a skyed caught and bowled chance.

The 37-year-old Guyana-born Gordon finished with fine figures of 2-16 from his maximum four overs.

### Presidential election: Good and bad foreign meddling

The US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung meeting the officials of the Election Commission

What a big fuss would have been made by the embassies of Western countries had the Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Qi Zhenhong met with the members of the Election Commission (EC), as American Ambassador Julie Chung and several other Western diplomats had done recently?

Also, can we at least imagine a meeting between the Sri Lankan or Indian Ambassador to the United States and the election officials of the US, including those of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), to discuss the forthcoming US Presidential election? Answers to these questions would explain the world order that had been imposed by the West on others.

### The right to strike and motivated strikes

*2024-06-08 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-right-to-strike-and-motivated-strikes/172-284353) · `en`

For over the past 35 days, the non-academic staff of government universities in the country has been on strike. There is no doubt that the working class of this country is burdened with low salaries. In some instances, workers’ wages were reduced during the economic melt-down.

On June 6 the Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union of Sri Lanka Railways suddenly decided to go on strike. The trade union action according to the Union is being carried out over delays in second-class promotions of locomotive drivers and several other issues.

With the present cost of living far beyond the reach of a majority of workers, something needs to be done to correct the situation. Yet the country too is going through unprecedentedly bad economic times.

While most of the demands of the strikers are understandable, what the public find  difficult to agree with is the manner in which these strikes are called. Trade union action most always, inconveniences the public.

### Change is good: Provided it is for better and not for worse

*2024-06-07 23:56:50* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Change-is-good-Provided-it-is-for-better-and-not-for-worse/14-762802) · `en`

People’s aspiration and hope for a change was short lived and short changed, widening the mistrust between policy makers and electorate further

One fact remains as an acceptable analogy; which is, those who cannot cope with change will never be able to initiate change in any circumstances. This applies to all stakeholders including those who caused and contributed to the current crisis. Fair share of responsibilities fall on to the electorate who got carried away with populism engineered by few; with an ultimate aim of state and regulatory capture for their advantage leaving the country into a dire state grappling with debt. Therefore, capacity and capability to initiate that essential change is absent in the DNA of politicians who deceived their constituents

### Understanding Sinhala Buddhism: Lessons from the recent past

Review of Buddhism in Sinhalese Society 1750-1900: A Study of Religious Revival And Change by Kitsiri Malagoda, Colombo, Tambapanni Academic Publishers, 2023, 300pp. ISBN: 9786245529094

Sri Lankan Buddhists are spoiled for choice these days. Depending on where your faith lies and what tugs at your heart, it seems you can choose the flavour of Theravada Buddhism that suits you best: from the traditional temple Buddhism of the great sects of Kandy to the radical orthopraxy of ascetic Buddhism in remote forest monasteries, and from the devotional Buddhism of Mahamevna to the contrarian, eclectic mix of teachings at Umandawa, the variety can be dazzling—so much so that one could be excused for thinking that this lack of homogeneity is a sign of decay.

### How Argentina’s once great economy was destroyed? Lessons for Sri Lanka

*2024-06-07 23:46:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/How-Argentina-s-once-great-economy-was-destroyed-Lessons-for-Sri-Lanka/4-762794) · `en`

Argentina’s exemplary economic success took a wrong turn from 1946 when Juan Peron became president and he implemented economic policies to make Argentina self-sufficient

As Argentina was the fifth largest economy in the world in the early 1900s, Sri Lanka was one of the best economies in Asia and was referred to as the Switzerland of Asia. Sri Lanka’s downfall too was due to looking into import substitution starting in the mid 1950s. Sri Lanka went into a disastrous overdrive towards import substitution and self-sufficiency starting in 1970 which led to goods shortages and high prices and an economic crisis. Sri Lanka opened its economy in 1977. But the Sri Lankan economy has not remained fully open since then and many of the tough reforms were not done when Sri Lanka opened its economy leading to many lost economic opportunities for the country

### Unreleased Nawaz Commission report may hold key to acceptable Truth and Reconciliation Commission

The National Peace Council (NPC) in a statement said the unreleased Nawaz Commission report may hold the key to acceptable Trust and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).

During a recent visit to the North, President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that the Government would be establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to address human rights issues that arose out of the three-decade long war. He said that the legislation was nearly finalised with the main remaining question being whether the power to prosecute war crimes should be given to the commission or to a special court. The President said, “We’re deliberating whether the TRC should wield judicial authority or if a separate court should be empowered based on TRC recommendations. This decision is paramount, and I’ve tasked relevant ministers, in consultation with parliamentarians and ambassadors, to draft legislation for parliamentary review.”

“The world order and American actions in the world have deep wiring” ~ Ben Rhodes

On 2 June 2022 President Biden published an op-ed in the New York Times titled ‘How the US is willing to help Ukraine’ in which he declared that Russia’s action in Ukraine ‘could mark the end of the rules-based international order and open the door to aggression elsewhere, with catastrophic consequences the world over’. Later, in a press conference at the conclusion of the June 2022 NATO Summit Meeting in Madrid, he warned both Russia and China that the democracies of the world would ‘defend the rules-based order’(RBO). There was however no mention of international law. The term RBO is so frequently used by American political leaders, that it ‘seems to have become a job requirement for a top position in the US foreign policy apparatus’ as per analysts. US’ failure to invoke international law and instead to refer on most occasions to a ‘rules-based international order’ is not an omission, but deliberate.

### Weapon - Review

*2024-06-07 17:19:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185551) · `ta`

"Review: 'Weapon' features Sathyaraj, Vasanth Ravi, and others in a sci-fi tale where a serum turns a man into a superhuman. Despite engaging modern tech elements like AI, the plot lacks depth on its purpose and side effects. Sathyaraj shines as the superhuman, but the film misses opportunities for humor and clarity. Tanya Hope and Rajiv Menon deliver strong performances amidst a storyline that could benefit from more focus on social development and less on indiscriminate violence."

### “Minimum Estate Labour Wages” & Other Related Matters

President Wickremesinghe, drew much enthusiastic applause by his magnanimous promise of an increase of the daily wages of tea (and rubber) workers, to Rs. 1,700/= from the prevailing Rs.1,000/=.

Predictably, this has stirred a “Hornet’s nest,” in the form of protests from the Estate Management sector. It is not unusual for politicians to make rash promises from May Day platforms, which haven’t the faintest chance of implementation. Cheering crowds are the dream of most politicians. But an exalted position of The Presidency of a country, should dampen any craving for the fleeting applause of a mass gathering. On this score, the President has lost. Not a good omen for one aspiring to a further term of office.

The pitches used in the T20 World Cup matches played in New York have not been up to standard and ground staff are working on remedying them for the rest of the tournament, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Thursday.

The temporary Nassau County International Cricket Stadium has hosted two games so far, both of which were low-scoring encounters due to the nature of the drop-in pitch which has made batting extremely difficult due to the movement and bounce.

Fans expecting a run-fest were left disappointed when Sri Lanka were bowled out for 77 -- their lowest ever score -- against South Africa, while India bowled out Ireland for 96 in Wednesday’s one-sided contest.

“T20 Inc and the ICC recognise that the pitches used so far at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium have not played as consistently as we would have all wanted,” the ICC said in a statement.
