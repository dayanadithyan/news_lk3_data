India has just released its official consumption expenditure data for 2022-23, providing the first official survey-based poverty estimates for India in over ten years.

Biden said the U.S. airdrop would take place in the coming days but offered no further specifics. Other countries, including Jordan and France, have already carried out airdrops of aid into Gaza.

“We need to do more and the United States will do more,” Biden told reporters, adding that “aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough.”

At the White House, spokesperson John Kirby stressed that airdrops would become “a sustained effort.” He added that the first airdrop would be likely be military MREs, or “meals ready-to-eat.”

Biden told reporters that the U.S. was also looking at the possibility of a maritime corridor to deliver large amounts of aid into Gaza.

The airdrops could begin as early as this weekend, officials said.

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) announced that the Sapugaskanda refinery is to go for a planned shutdown for a statutory major turnaround after three years of operations.

While issuing a public notice they said the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery will cease operations for 45 days in early July 2024, more than three years since the previous turnaround in February 2021.

This is a mandatory requirement, in compliance with international norms, that qualifies the refinery for safe and reliable operations for a further three years.

Once the refinery is brought back on stream after the turnaround, it will be subjected to upgrades designed to increase its contribution to Sri Lanka's changing product requirements.

During the scheduled shutdown, the CPC will maintain a full capacity of crude to regain full throughput in the shortest possible time, along with a buffer stock of products for approximately twice the planned shutdown period to ensure continuous supply to customers.

### Sri Lanka to shut oil refinery for ‘turnaround’ maintenance

*2024-03-02 06:22:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-shut-oil-refinery-for-turnaround-maintenance-152743/) · `en`

**

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation said its refinery will be shut for 45 days for scheduled ‘turnaround’ maintenance, which is required every three years.

“This is a mandatory requirement, in compliance with international norms, that qualifies the refinery for safe and reliable operation for a further 03 years,” CPC said in a statement.

“Once the refinery is brought back on stream after the Turnaround, it will be subjected to upgrades designed to increase its contribution to Sri Lanka’s changing product requirements.”

CPC will maintain a buffer stock of double the demand of refined products during the shut down period.

Sri Lanka’s 50,000 barrels per day refinery produces a relatively large share of furnace oil and is more geared to refining light crudes. (Colombo/Mar02/2024)

### Elon Musk sues ChatGPT-maker OpenAI over Microsoft links

*2024-03-02 03:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/elon-musk-sues-chatgpt-maker-openai-over-microsoft-links/) · `en`

**

Elon Musk is suing OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, arguing it has breached the principles he agreed to when he helped found it in 2015.

The lawsuit – which has also been filed against OpenAI boss Sam Altman – says the firm has departed from its original non-profit, open source mission.

It says instead of trying to “benefit humanity” – as it was set up to do – it is focusing on “maximising profits” for major investor Microsoft.

The firm was created with the intention of building what’s known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) – AI that can perform any task a human being is capable of.

It was also set up as a not-for-profit company, meaning it would not aim to make money.

The lawsuit, which has been filed in San Francisco, states it was under these conditions, that Mr Musk agreed to found OpenAI, along with Mr Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman. He left three years later.

### January trade deficit widens to US $ 514mn

Earnings from merchandise exports record marginal decline of 0.8% YoY

Sri Lanka’s merchandise trade deficit in January widened to US $ 514 million, from US $ 445 million in the corresponding month of the previous year, due to a higher increase in imports.

The deficit has expanded even when compared with December 2023, where US $ 487 million was recorded.

The provisional data released by the Central Bank this week showed that the earnings from merchandise exports recorded a marginal decline of 0.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) to US $ 971 million in January 2024, compared to US $ 978 million in January 2023.

A decline in earnings was observed in industrial exports and mineral exports, while agricultural exports increased in January 2024.

“The decline in industrial goods exports in January 2024 compared to January 2023 was mainly contributed by garments, resulting from lower exports of garments to most major markets,” the Central Bank said.

### Water for Peace and Harmony

**

Most of us take water for granted. However, clean drinking water is essential for human life, and in these days of high temperature reaching 94°F, many people experience dehydration, and we need to drink about six litres of water a day.

Next month, the United Nations marks World Water Day, and the theme is ‘water for peace’. In a statement, the UN says, water can create peace or spark conflict. When water is scarce or polluted, or when people have unequal or no access, tensions can rise among communities and countries. More than 3 billion people worldwide depend on water that crosses national borders. Yet, only 24 countries have cooperation agreements for all their shared water.

As impacts of climate change increase and populations grow, there is an urgent need, within and among countries, to unite around protecting and conserving our most precious resource.
