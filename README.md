### World first epilepsy device fitted in UK boyтАЩs skull

*2024-06-24 11:38:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100061/world-first-epilepsy-device-fitted-in-uk-boys-skull) ┬╖ `en`

A boy with severe epilepsy has become the first patient in the world to trial a new device fitted in their skull to control seizures.

The neurostimulator, which sends electrical signals deep into his brain, has reduced Oran KnowlsonтАЩs daytime seizures by 80%.

His mother, Justine, told the BBC he was happier and had a тАЬmuch better quality of lifeтАЭ.

The surgery was carried out in October as part of a trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London when Oran - who is now 13 - was 12.

Oran, from Somerset, has Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a treatment-resistant form of epilepsy which he developed at the age of three.

Since then he has suffered several daily seizures ranging from two dozen to hundreds.

When we first spoke to OranтАЩs mum last autumn, prior to surgery, she explained how OranтАЩs epilepsy dominated his life: "It has robbed him of all of his childhood."

She told us Oran had a range of different seizures, including those where he fell to the ground, shook violently, and lost consciousness.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs central bank has been playing with swaps for some time and the agencyтАЩs 778 billion rupee forex loss in 2022 was directly related to swaps and other borrowings, which allows it to maintain an artificial policy rate.

Central bank swaps along with other doctrines like portfolio balance channels, are the foundation of modern age-of-inflation forex crises, default, outmigration and sudden soaring poverty.

As part of steps to prevent the next sovereign default by macro-economic policy, outlawing forex swaps will be a key measure that legislators can take.

The Nick Leeson style losses came not only from swaps but also IMF borrowings taken during an earlier flexible inflation targeting crisis and borrowings from India through the Asian Clearing Union, which have since been converted to a term facility.
