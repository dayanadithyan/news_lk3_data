*2024-05-17 02:00:59* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c0klkl0zdw7o) · `si`

Despite peace for 15 years post-war, villagers in Mullaitivu's Kokilai remain landless and impoverished, lacking basic amenities.

🟩

None contains none of this. 'We are in the Kokilai village from birth. But still no land license. "

15 years since the end of the war, "Kudamma's view"

We have reached the 15th consecutive celebration, over the decades of civil war.

However, the villagers of Mullaitivu, Kokilai told the BBC Sinhala service that they are still living as 'orphan'.

About 300 families live in this village and the majority are Sinhalese.

In the 1930s, this village of settlement had to leave the war, and to leave for a short period of time. Even though generations, they have not received a license or license for land today.

The people who live in fishing work have been built to provide kerosene to Kerosene, but it has not been opened today. The Kokilai said that there is no basic amenities in the village and no politician is looking into it.

### Lawmakers must note that stars in galaxy are dead - EDITORIAL

Sri Lanka is divided politically at present. Many years ago this country was divided in terms of race. Politics seems to be the cause of all this evil. Now we are told to prepare for a presidential election which is expected this year.

Exactly eight days ago (May 9) people of this country were reminded that two years had passed after the ‘Aragalaya’ (Protest) took place. Largely these protests were held in and around Colombo; some protests took place in other places outside Western province, but not with the same aggression and success. Talking about Colombo, there is a hotel put up near Galle Face, where the main protest took place. That hotel was opened on April 24 (2024) and among the invitees and special guests were individuals who the protesters wanted out of politics.

### Nakba continues amid Zionist newspeak

Palestinian protesters take to the streets of the West Bank city of Ramallah on Wednesday to mark the 76th anniversary of the “Nakba” or “Catastrophe”, which sparked the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in 1948. (AFP)

Nakba is indisputably a living testimony to the brutality of the beast among humans. The fact that it has been committed against victimised Palestinians for the past 76 years, again and again, is a damning indictment of the United Nations system. It is not a mere accusation to say that the United States, the United Kingdom, and their partners are as directly responsible as Israel for letting Nakba happen in 1948 and continuing it for 76 years with massacre after massacre and displacement after displacement. It is a fact.

### 1998 Bharathipuram killings and accountability for wartime atrocities

The killing of civilians and other atrocities were widespread during the three-decade war mostly in the North and the East. The Sri Lankan armed forces, police and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are alleged to be responsible for many such massacres according to eye witnesses and circumstantial evidence. It’s rare that the Sri Lankan armed forces and police have been held accountable through domestic courts for such killings. Below are some observations and reflections on such a rare case, based on reading the case and talking to families of victims.

Strong net profit growth in the final quarter of 2023-24 has enabled Teejay Lanka PLC to end the financial year on an optimistic note despite the impacts of the appreciation of the Rupee, which contributed to its 12-month results falling below those of the preceding year

Sri Lanka’s first multinational textile manufacturer has reported net profit of Rs. 549.1 million for the three months ending 31 March 2024, up 260% over the corresponding quarter of the previous year and a 15% improvement over the preceding quarter.

Despite an increase in sales volumes, the Group’s revenue for the quarter, at Rs 15.3 billion, was down 4% over the figure for the third quarter of the year and 12% lower than the revenue of the corresponding quarter of the previous year. This was due to the appreciation of the Sri Lanka Rupee.

### Restructure SriLankan Airlines – but no mandate for sale

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s official statement on the issue of the restructuring of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) has driven the usual suspects into a fit of rage. Instead of addressing the content of the statement through facts and rational argument, one Ranga Jayasuriya has gone on a hate-spewing tirade on Daily Mirror. Let us keep aside all the ad hominem fallacies in his article, including childish name-calling, fear-mongering and false accusations. Such immature personal attacks only support Mahinda’s stance.

Although Mahinda Rajapaksa speaks about all SOEs in general, Jayasuriya seems to have read it as impacting only SriLankan Airlines. Perhaps it is not because he has any money to be made in the proposed sale of the national carrier but because of his undying passion for turning loss-making SOEs into profit-making Privately-Owned Enterprises (POWs) in Sri Lanka… But let us look at his claims logically.

### For Sri Lanka the road to recovery is long and must stay the course

*2024-05-17 00:21:54* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/For-Sri-Lanka-the-road-to-recovery-is-long-and-must-stay-the-course/4-761890) · `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently emphasised the necessity of a new economic reform program for the country’s economic recovery

As Sri Lanka continues to recover from the recent crisis, this time last year, a mere 12 months ago, we saw the peak of Sri Lanka’s worst economic crisis since independence. The economic recovery partially remains hindered by slow growth in exports and low foreign direct investment (FDI), with export growth projected at a modest 5.27% from 2024 to 2028 and FDI below 3% of GDP. The country faces a significant challenge with a decade-long period of low productivity growth, averaging 1.4% annually, underlying major structural weakness in the economy, principally almost endemic policy inconsistency.

### Is Sri Lanka’s population truly declining amid economic crisis and COVID-19?

While short-term trends may indicate population decline, historical precedents suggest resilience and the potential for rebound

Despite concerns about declining population in Sri Lanka due to factors like reduced fertility, increased emigration, and rising mortality rates, short-term fluctuations do not necessarily signify long-term decline. Population dynamics are intricate, influenced by various factors. Even during slower growth periods, populations tend to increase due to past trends in fertility and mortality, known as population growth momentum. This article aims to provide a scientific understanding of how Sri Lanka’s population might evolve, going beyond short-term fluctuations and addressing misconceptions about population decline.

Rajapaksa told reporters on Thursday May 16 following a meeting at the SLPP headquarters in Colombo that 99 percent of the party share his views on the matter.

“It’s not just me, the majority of our party, 99 percent, are of this opinion,” he said, asked for comment on a recent statement he had made declaring his opposition to Sri Lanka’s ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed efforts to restructure a number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

The resumption of the passenger ferry service between Nagapattinam in India and the Kankesanthurai region near Jaffna in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka has been delayed again for an indefinite period, Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva has said.

The passenger ferry service between Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu and Kankesanthurai (KKS) suburb of Jaffna district, which was to resume on May 13, was delayed due to a “technical shortcoming”, de Silva said on Wednesday.

The nature of the “technical shortcoming” was not revealed by the minister.
