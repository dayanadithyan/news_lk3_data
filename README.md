Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a pivotal moment in its economic development trajectory. Raising the socioeconomic standing of the populace requires pursuing inclusive economic growth and more investment from the private sector. By examining crucial approaches, recognising obstacles, and assimilating global best practices, Sri Lanka may clear the path towards a future that is both affluent and just.

In 2024, Sri Lanka will be negotiating a challenging economic environment that includes persistent budgetary issues, efforts to stabilise macroeconomic circumstances, and the post-pandemic recovery. Remittances from foreign workers, advances in the tourism industry, and increased agricultural output have all contributed to the nation‚Äôs GDP growth. Nonetheless, enduring obstacles including the nation‚Äôs massive public debt, inflationary pressures, and fundamental economic shortcomings continue to provide formidable obstacles.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe in conversation with his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa in the presence of former President and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa at the ceremony to mark 27 years in politics by SLPP MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena at the Kalutara Public Ground on Saturday ‚Äì Pic by Pradeep Pathirana

‚ÄúAnybody who knows about capitalism knows that bankruptcy is an essential part of capitalism‚Äù (Joseph Stiglitz)

Bankruptcy, according to one definition, ‚Äúis a legal proceeding when a person or business cannot repay outstanding debts or obligations. It offers a fresh start for people who can no longer afford to pay their bills‚Äù. What is true for an individual is also true for a country. When Sri Lanka was in the grip of a historic economic crisis and when the Treasury was running out of foreign exchange to fund imports and service foreign debt, talk of an impending bankruptcy or near-bankruptcy started circulating within the financial circles both locally as well as internationally.

### If the strike is to be paid a salary hike, the Wet tax will be increased again

*2024-07-09 02:48:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187995) ¬∑ `ta`

Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardena announced that a proposed salary increase for striking workers would lead to a Wet tax rise from 18% to 20%-21%, stating the government couldn't afford such hikes. Despite union demands, a salary increase this year seems unlikely, but amendments to the 2025 budget may address salary reviews. The Treasury Secretary emphasized the financial strain of salary increases, suggesting a minimal tax hike and highlighting the impossibility of increasing the Wet tax beyond its current rate due to economic stabilization efforts. Senior Advisor Dr. RHS. Samaratunga noted the difficulty in increasing salaries this year but assured that allocations might be made in the next year's budget, with a special expert panel investigating salary issues.

The Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardena said that if the strike is to be paid a salary increase, the current 18% Wet tax will increase to 20% - 21% and the government cannot meet such a demand.

### Many Facets Of Madam Blavatsky: A Mystic? A Spy Or A Fraud?

Madam Blavatsky‚Äôs name is not strange for Sri Lankans as one of the early stalwarts to aspire to the Buddhist resurgence in the late 19th century. In the backdrop of British-sponsored Missionary activities, her audacity to stand with the natives in a British colony illustrates her compassion for the Easterners who suffered under foreign subjugation. After the tragic end of the 1883 Kotahena riots, Blavatsky defended the Buddhists, when the colonial government tried to frame them to be the culprits. In an article she authored for ‚ÄúThe Theosophist‚Äú, Blavatsky argued that the arrogant attitude of the Christian priests and their condescending remarks over Buddhism sparked the riots in 1883 and the following year she accompanied Col. Henry Olcott to London to report the grievances faced by the Sinhalese Buddhists to the Colonial Secretary.
