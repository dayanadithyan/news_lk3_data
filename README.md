We need to welcome foreign investment in meeting our energy demands and not subject them to selective outage

Recently, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara took to X, formally known as Twitter, to announce the conclusion of intense negotiation between the Government and Adani Group. Under this, the country will purchase power from wind plants built by the latter at 8.26 US cents a kilowatt hour for 20 years, to be paid in LKR on the prevailing exchange rate at the time of payment. “On the current exchange rate considered as, 1 USD = Rs 300, the cost of energy will be Rs 24.78 per kWh. The current average cost of energy in SL is Rs 39.02 per kWh,” the minister added on X.

India’s Adani group has proposed to invest about $ 740 million in the country to set up two wind power projects with a cumulative generation capacity of 484 MW. The tariff is by far the best the country has seen, as is evident from the given table.

### Tea and lack of empathy

*2024-05-29 00:10:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Tea-and-lack-of-empathy/172-283565) · `en`

For years, even before our country received independence, it was the income from the tea industry which formed the backbone of our country’s economy. Even after independence, it was the income from tea that provided the main export earnings that kept the economic wheels of the country turning.

Even today tea provides the third highest portion of the Lankan economy behind the earnings of expatriate workers and the textile trade.

Sri Lanka’s tea export earnings crossed US $ 1 billion for the first time in history in 2008. Sri Lanka is the first country to achieve this feat.

During the financial year 2022 to 2023, according to the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, export earnings from tea made up 12% of merchandise exports, an increase of 3.57 % year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to US$ 111.12 Mn in December 2023 compared to December 2022.

This is despite a drop in production in 2022 because of the industry being hit by a fertiliser shortage caused by an ill-advised agrochemical ban.

### From three-wheeler drivers to beach boys: Sri Lanka’s workforce transformation

*2024-05-29 00:09:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/From-three-wheeler-drivers-to-beach-boys-Sri-Lankas-workforce-transformation/172-283566) · `en`

To end the intergenerational degradation of the country’s youth, the government should create 250,000 university and vocational training opportunities. Else, we are doomed as a nation

For a country that takes pride in its free education system, Sri Lanka has done a miserable job in putting its human capital to productive work.

That is the story since the independence, but let’s leave the first three decades defined by quasi-socialist policies and skyrocketing fertility growths, which created enormous pressure on the state. But the story has not changed much since the economy was liberalized, and population growth is well under control- fertility growth now is barely at replacement level or less.

One might observe a few concerted areas where the bulk of jobs were made available for the Sri Lankan youth during the last four decades.

### Corporate head office – creator or destroyer of value in a conglomerate

*2024-05-29 00:07:33* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Corporate-head-office-creator-or-destroyer-of-value-in-a-conglomerate/4-762272) · `en`

The corporate centre of a conglomerate can be value accretive or value destructive to the conglomerate

The best parent companies are those which create more value than any other rival if they owned the same business. Such businesses are deemed to have parenting advantage. In the same way that business strategy gives rise to competitive advantage, it is the corporate level strategy of a conglomerate which gives life to the parenting advantage of a constituent subsidiary. A business will enjoy a parenting advantage only if a parenting opportunity exists. When a corporate parent identifies such opportunities and addresses them with actions which give a positive net present value it will improve the value of the business and, subject to the idiosyncrasies of the market, improve the market value of the parent’s share too

ECONOMYNEXT – The Maldives could take reciprocal action after Sri Lanka’s new system of outsourcing its visas, which requires the payment of “processing” and “convenience” charges of 26 dollars, even though the government does not collect any fees.

Maldivian authorities have reminded Sri Lanka of the long-standing bilateral agreement under which their citizens could travel freely between the two neighbours without any charges or bureaucratic barriers.

Maldivians, who consider Sri Lanka their second home, often spend more than a month in the larger country, but are now required to pay 26 dollars to VFS Global, which has controversially been contracted to handle Sri Lankan visas.

“The Sri Lankan government will not charge a fee, but Maldivians still have to pay VFS after applying online for a visa,” a Maldivian government official said in the capital, Male. “This violates the spirit of our agreement.”

Economic struggles and international scrutiny, including calls for war crime prosecutions, highlight ongoing challenges. President Ranil Wickremesinghe aims to address these by focusing on development and reconciliation, visiting the affected areas and promoting major projects. However, concerns over devolution and past rights violations remain, with the upcoming presidential election potentially influencing policy directions.

The fifteenth anniversary of the end of the war has clearly revealed that the war may have come to an end, but that the relevant issues did not end. There is a sense of practice outside the North and East, which was the domain of military operations. The memory of the war is going near. This situation has led to the hope that the government can pay attention to the economic downturn of the government, especially in the lives of the people who are still increasingly affected by other problems.

Under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, there was also the hope that he could win the international pressures from the Human Rights Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council as he had close ties with the leaders of the West.
