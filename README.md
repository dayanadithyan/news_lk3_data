### Spotlight On SCOTUS In The US. People Give The Finger In Pakistan

*2024-02-10 18:30:45* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/spotlight-on-scotus-in-the-us-people-give-the-finger-in-pakistan/) · `en`

In the US, Former President Donald Trump is facing multiple indictments, involving numerous charges, in multiple courts. Perhaps no American before him, let alone a former President, has been simultaneously implicated in so many litigations. At the same time, even as he is mired in a myriad of trials, Donald Trump has also put on trial the entire American political system.

The spotlight is now on SCOTUS, the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court has come under compulsion to make two consequential rulings – one on the disqualification of Trump by the State of Colorado to be a presidential candidate in 2024, on account of his involvement in the insurrection in Washington, on 6 January 2020, to prevent US Congress’s certification of the November 2019 presidential election results; and the other to deal with Trump’s claim to immunity from being indicted for criminal conduct in trying to prevent the same certification process.

### Hopes AKD makes positive statements on his tour and bring investors to country

He hopes that National People's Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) makes positive statements regarding his visit to India and understands the need of investors in Sri Lanka, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

Addressing the media, he said that whoever had invited AKD to India, had done a good thing.

"AKD might have gained a vast amount of experience over the need for investors in our country from any country in the world, including India. After experiencing the development of India's energy sectors, I don't think that AKD would get a chance to chase away the investors who are coming to the country.

"AKD dressed according to the European dress code, ignoring his traditional dress. I don't think his trade unions understand how he behaves," he said.

It is very common to see political parties visit India every month, but this is the first time that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is in India, he said.

### Critical Atlantic Ocean current system showing early signs of collapse - report

*2024-02-10 17:10:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97168/critical-atlantic-ocean-current-system-showing-early-signs-of-collapse-report) · `en`

A crucial system of ocean currents may already be on course to collapse, according to a new report, with alarming implications for sea level rise and global weather — leading temperatures to plunge dramatically in some regions and rise in others.

Using exceptionally complex and expensive computing systems, scientists found a new way to detect an early warning signal for the collapse of these currents, according to the study published Friday in the journal Science Advances. And as the planet warms, there are already indications it is heading in this direction.

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (the AMOC) — of which the Gulf Stream is part — works like a giant global conveyor belt, taking warm water from the tropics toward the far North Atlantic, where the water cools, becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean, before spreading southward.

### Unraveling The Complexity Of Racism, A Global Perspective – Patali & Modi

*2024-02-10 15:23:07* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/unraveling-the-complexity-of-racism-a-global-perspective-patali-modi/) · `en`

Racism, an age-old societal ill, has embedded itself in various corners of the world, manifesting in different forms and shades. It is a divisive force that no enlightened individual would willingly embrace. Unfortunately, racists exist in every society, often driven by a misguided belief that aligning with discriminatory ideologies is a means of survival.

A recent encounter with a photograph featuring Patali Champika Ranawaka and India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, sparked reflections on the accusation of racism. Criticisms arose, labeling both individuals as racists, but the context within which these allegations emerged unveils a nuanced reality.

Modi’s leadership in India has faced scrutiny, particularly concerning its impact on different ethnic and religious communities. While some may argue that his actions indicate racism, others assert that it stems from a sense of Nationalism. It is crucial to discern the thin line between nationalistic pride and discriminatory practices.

Moody’s downgraded Israel’s credit rating on Friday, citing material political and fiscal risks for the country from its war with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The impact of the conflict raises political risk and weakens Israel’s executive and legislative institutions, and its fiscal strength for the foreseeable future, said Moody’s, which had begun the review for a downgrade on Oct. 19.

The country’s rating was cut to “A2,” which is five notches above investment grade, while its credit outlook was kept at negative by Moody’s, meaning a further downgrade is possible.

The war between Israel and Hamas, which has raged since Oct. 7, is the latest in a conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that has rumbled on for seven decades and destabilized the Middle East.
