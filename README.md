### Reconciliation with no political solution does not believe

*2024-05-28 16:14:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184679) · `ta`

Despite the end of the war 15 years ago, unresolved issues persist, particularly in the North and East. Economic struggles and international scrutiny, including calls for war crime prosecutions, highlight ongoing challenges. President Ranil Wickremesinghe aims to address these by focusing on development and reconciliation, visiting the affected areas and promoting major projects. However, concerns over devolution and past rights violations remain, with the upcoming presidential election potentially influencing policy directions.

🟩

The fifteenth anniversary of the end of the war has clearly revealed that the war may have come to an end, but that the relevant issues did not end. There is a sense of practice outside the North and East, which was the domain of military operations. The memory of the war is going near. This situation has led to the hope that the government can pay attention to the economic downturn of the government, especially in the lives of the people who are still increasingly affected by other problems.

Under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, there was also the hope that he could win the international pressures from the Human Rights Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council as he had close ties with the leaders of the West.

ECONOMYNEXT – The Maldives could take reciprocal action after Sri Lanka’s new system of outsourcing its visas, which requires the payment of “processing” and “convenience” charges of 26 dollars, even though the government does not collect any fees.

Maldivian authorities have reminded Sri Lanka of the long-standing bilateral agreement under which their citizens could travel freely between the two neighbours without any charges or bureaucratic barriers.

Maldivians, who consider Sri Lanka their second home, often spend more than a month in the larger country, but are now required to pay 26 dollars to VFS Global, which has controversially been contracted to handle Sri Lankan visas.

“The Sri Lankan government will not charge a fee, but Maldivians still have to pay VFS after applying online for a visa,” a Maldivian government official said in the capital, Male. “This violates the spirit of our agreement.”
