Are MPs use parliamentary powers and privileges to repress media repression?

Members can express any idea in the Chamber of Principles of Parliament. It does not matter whether it is in court. It is a unique privilege of parliamentarians regarding freedom of speech.

This time the presidential election is more important than other presidential elections, said MP Professor Saritha Herath.

The presidential election is being held when the country needs to have a multi -dimensional change in the country.Ranil Wickremesinghe, on the other hand, is leading the tendency to socialize lies that I have saved from this position.

He said this at a media briefing held at the United People's Power Headquarters Office in Bidakottai on Tuesday (06).

He shows false issues on economic recovery.He is not the rest of the. He said he was a partner of this economic problem.

No one else has come forward to accept. So it is absolutely wrong to say that I accepted the post of Prime Minister. Sajith sent a letter with conditions. It doesn't matter. Sarath Fonseka expressed his choice. The last government did not listen. That's why he automatically accepted their post.

While it is too far-fetched for us to imagine reaching Indian standards, it consoles us to see RW taking some such initiatives in the current context under all odds he is handicapped with

Sri Lankan electors are awaiting a change from the status quo of a sluggish and slow-moving economy towards a more seriously planned progress. With fresh memories of extreme hard time sufferings of the recent past, only palliatively handled with haphazard responses to meet emergency situations, the body politic is hopeful of a dawn of an economy progressing under a planned pursuit of a clear vision.

### Rajapaksas  Backstabbing Ranil  Over the Presidential Candidacy Issue   Backfire  on the SLPP.

*2024-08-07 01:11:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84468) ¬∑ `en`

President  Ranil Wickremesinghe was cruelly bamboozled by the Rajapaksas early this week. The incumbent president was given false promises that the Medamulana clan-led ‚Äúpohottuwa‚Äùparty was firmly behind him in his bid to contest the forthcoming presidential poll. The note of discord struck by Namal Rajapaksa was lightly dismissed as being of very little consequence. The message conveyed was that Wickremesinghe should formally seek the suppo rt of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna(SLPP) for his candidacy and that it would be accepted and approved by the SLPP as a matter of course. But when Ranil did so, the carpet was yanked from under his feet.

### Demise of Rajapaksa power and triumph of Rajapaksaism

*2024-08-07 01:09:04* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Demise-of-Rajapaksa-power-and-triumph-of-Rajapaksaism/4-765215) ¬∑ `en`

The Rajapaksas have nothing to gain from a Ranil Wickremesinghe victory. He was never a Rajapaksa creature. He saved the Rajapaksas from popular fury and used their backing to implement his own politico-economic agenda. If he wins the Presidential election, he would go his way, irrespective of whether the Rajapaksas back him or not. So the Rajapaksas decided to cut their losses, a decision that makes sense from the perspective of familial power. For them, defeat and a stint in the opposition would be less ruinous than growing irrelevance under a victorious President Wickremesinghe. Their only way out was persuading President Wickremesinghe to publicly anoint Namal Rajapaksa as the next prime minister. They made the demand and he refused, because he is not Ranil Rajapaksa. With that correct refusal, the raison d‚Äô√™tre of the Wickremesinghe-Rajapaksa alliance vanished

When asked about the change, Kariyawasam said the party felt the head office was the best venue to make such an announcement.

### Ranil Rajapaksa was an Opposition-made myth. The Rajapaksas have nothing to gain from a Ranil Wickremesinghe victory. He was never a Rajapaksa creature.

‚ÄúThe king is dead, long live the king‚Äù (Traditional proclamation made following the death of a monarch indicating the continuity of the monarchy)

Mahinda Rajapaksa‚Äôs second presidential investiture was held two days after his 65th birthday, the twin occasions marked by grandiose displays of Rajapaksa power. The highlights of this political spectacle included a shipload of Buddhist monks voyaging from Galle to the Hambantota Rajapaksa Port, chanting the ‚ÄòSagara Piritha‚Äô, and the cooking of world‚Äôs largest milk-rice weighting 4,000 kg by 300+ chefs (relayed live on TV). Tuition-guru turned Education Minister Bandula Gunwardane ordered all school children to listen to President Rajapaksa‚Äôs ‚ÄòAddress to the Nation‚Äô.

Most of the courtiers who pledged eternal fealty to High King Mahinda during that spectacular week in 2010 are unlikely to grace his 79th birthday in 2024.

Ethnic minority TPA on Tuesday (06) pledged support to opposition leader Sajith Premadasa in the upcoming presidential poll, but declined to elaborate the conditions Premadasa has agreed with the party.

‚ÄúMany of us will be part of our cabinet and his administration,‚Äù TPA leader Mano Ganeshan told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo, referring to four legislators including him who addressed media.

However, he said the party has not demanded ‚Äúthe Sun and the Moon‚Äù and admitted that the party‚Äôs support is ‚Äúnot unconditional‚Äù.
