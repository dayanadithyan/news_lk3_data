Based on the information provided, it seems you are asking about the impact of social media on elections in Sri Lanka. Here's a summary of the key points:



1. Social media plays a significant role in influencing elections in Sri Lanka.



2. Candidates and their campaigns heavily utilize social media platforms to disseminate information and sway public opinion.



3. Disinformation and propaganda spread through social media can be difficult to detect and regulate.



4. The Election Commission faces challenges in monitoring and regulating social media content during elections.



5. Some experts suggest strengthening the Election Commission's human resources and technology capabilities to better address these issues.



6. Social media companies are being called upon to contribute to holding free and fair elections.



7. The Election Commission has implemented measures to suppress election-related content during the silent period before the election.



8. While social media may influence public opinion, it is not considered to directly determine voting outcomes on election day.



9. Younger generations are more active in spreading election-related content on social media platforms.



10. Traditional methods like banners and posters are seen as less effective compared to social media in modern election campaigns.



To answer your specific questions:



1. The generation most focused on by presidential candidates appears to be younger voters, particularly those active on social media platforms.



2. The Generation Z demographic is likely the primary target for many candidates due to their high social media usage and engagement rates.



Regarding the results of 8 presidential elections in Sri Lanka, I would need more specific information to provide detailed analysis. However, I can offer general insights:



1. Sri Lanka has experienced political instability and frequent changes in leadership since gaining independence in 1948.



2. The country has held eight presidential elections since its first democratic election in 1982.



3. The most recent presidential election took place in 2019, which saw Gotabaya Rajapaksa elected as president.



4. Prior to that, Maithripala Sirisena won the 2015 presidential election, defeating incumbent Mahinda Rajapaksa.



5. Other notable winners include Chandrika Kumaratunga (1994), Ranasinghe Premadasa (1989), and Junius Richard Jayewardene (1978).



6. The election system in Sri Lanka has evolved over time, with various reforms aimed at improving transparency and fairness.



To provide more comprehensive analysis of the election results, I would need access to specific data and historical records of each election.

### Janaka Ratnayake urges Sri Lankans to vote with reason

Eksath Lanka Podujana Peramuna Presidential candidate Janaka Ratnayake has urged Sri Lankans to make a rational decision at the polls on 21 September, asking them to vote with their minds rather than their hearts. In his address to the nation, Ratnayake emphasised his vision of rebuilding the country, rescuing it from its current economic challenges, and securing a better future for the children of Sri Lanka.

He recalled his time as the Chairperson of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), where he consistently advocated for the underprivileged. He alleged that his removal from this position was orchestrated by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Presidential candidate Namal Rajapaksa, and National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) Presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake working together.

However, despite these accusations all NPP MPs led by Dissanayake voted against the motion to remove him when it was brought to Parliament on 24 May 2023.

### Finance Ministry on Sri LankaтАЩs external debt service payments

The objective of the debt standstill was to create some space for Sri Lanka to commence negotiations for restructuring debt in a manner that would enable debt service to resume in the future

The Finance Ministry in a statement said it has observed that there is a perception in society that the prevailing economic stabilisation in Sri Lanka is entirely due to external debt not being serviced, and that once debt service resumes, economic instability will return. It is also unfortunate to note that this same narrative is being used to trivialise and undermine the necessity for the critical macroeconomic reforms that are in fact the actual drivers of economic stabilisation. In this context the Finance Ministry via this statement addresses some of these misperceptions and explains the correct position in this regard to the public.

Is it correct that Sri Lanka does not service any of its foreign debt following the announcement of the debt standstill in April 2022?

### Lasting legacy of a unique politician тАУ M. D. Banda

*2024-09-16 23:01:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/lasting-legacy-of-a-unique-politician-m-d-banda/) ┬╖ `en`

Fifty years is a long time, enough for most things to fade into obscurity. So, it is truly remarkable that the legacy of the late Mr. M.D. Banda continues to endure, even five decades after his passing on September 18, 1974. In a country where memories are often short-lived, the fact that M.D. BandaтАЩs name is still spoken with respect and admiration is indeed a testament to the profound impact he made on Sri Lanka.

What makes this all the more intriguing is that M.D. Banda was a rare politician, one who actively avoided the limelight and personal glorification. He never put his name on plaques or buildings, nor sought to be immortalized in monuments, despite spearheading countless development projects for the people. His greatness lies not in self-promotion, but in his remarkable deeds.

Right now he is doing the duo scene with former MoonstonesтАЩ guitarist Anura Herat.

In the past, he had a four-piece band, but the pandemic changed everything.

The Supreme Court has made clear that the abolition of the Executive Presidency cannot be done by an amendment to the 1978 Constitution; it can thus only be done by way of a new Constitution

A President directly elected for a fixed term is the Head of State and the Head of Government who exercises the executive power of the state.

The President exercises executive power with a Prime Minister and a Cabinet of Ministers drawn from Parliament and responsible to both Parliament and the President.

The Cabinet is collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament and may be dismissed by Parliament by a vote of no-confidence.

The President is responsible but not answerable to Parliament and may only be dismissed by Parliament by impeachment.

### How will 1.65 million Muslims vote on Saturday?

90% of the Muslim voters do not want to live under fears of racial riots

Statistically Muslims constitute only 9.3% of the national population. They are a close second to the Sri Lankan Tamil strength of 11.1% according to the 2012 Census. The statistical difference is only 1.8% unlike the figures before the July 1983 racial riots. The anti-Tamil pogrom led to Tamils emigrating from the island in noticeably large numbers. It must be added that Tamil migration increased the statistical percentages of both Sinhala and Muslim population in the country but not their real numbers.

In terms of the real number who are likely to go to polls placed at 75%, the number of votes cast by the Muslims would be around 1.2 million and Tamil votes around 1.4 million. The difference in the number of voters would be only around point 2 million or 200,000! The Upcountry Tamils, the third largest minority, who vote invariably independent of the Sri Lankan Tamils constitute 4.1% of the national population.
