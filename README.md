### Can you make a telephone conversation a telephone dialogue?

*2024-04-10 03:16:30* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c884zpej28jo) · `si`

Smartphones have transformed telephone conversations into dialogues, raising privacy concerns. Sri Lanka has seen telephone dialogue recordings impacting society and politics. Senior Attorney Kamal Wijesiri clarified that recording a friendly conversation is not illegal, but it violates moral obligations. The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka has rules against interfering with customer messages. Reporthood Organization, a US-based rights group, protects journalists' rights to record confidential conversations. Laws regarding telephone conversations vary globally, with no specific rule in Sri Lanka for recording. Senior Attorney Kamal Wijesira highlighted the moral responsibility in recording phone conversations, emphasizing that it's not wrong to share such conversations, but it's a moral offense to publish them without consent. Asela Waidyalankara, a cybersecurity specialist, suggested asking the other party for consent before recording a conversation, advocating for digital literacy to address these issues.

🟩

Smart Mobile phones today have become more popular not only among young children but also among the older community.

Smart mobile phones have become a very easy task, using the telephone conversation using various strategies in the past.. However, some telecom companies have avoided providing necessary facilities for certain regions of the world on privacy based policies.

With the advancement of technology, many of the society questions about the moral matters behind it, whether it is easy.

Repeated in Sri Lanka's recent years has led to the telephone dialogue recordings, not only socially but also politically but also politically.

Ranjan Ramanayake, who was appointed as a state minister, can bear the series of events with the telephone conversations with telephone conversations.

We have also seen occasions when some postings in social media are embarrassing various parties.

Senior Attorney Kamal Wijesiri said that it is not an illegal act of recording a telephone conversation.

### Expressway debts could take 160 years to settle despite profit: Minister

*2024-04-10 02:37:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Expressway-debts-could-take-160-years-to-settle-despite-profit-Minister/108-280516) · `en`

Colombo, April 10 (Daily Mirror) - Despite earning a yearly profit of Rs. 5 billion from expressways, Minister Bandula Gunawardana revealed that it might take at least 160 years to fully pay off the Rs. 800 billion loan used to build them.

Gunawardana explained that even if someone lived for 80 years, it would still be impossible to settle the debt. He emphasized that even if someone reincarnated multiple times and worked throughout each lifetime, the debt would persist.

To prevent financial collapse, Gunawardana stressed the importance of following protocols set by the World Bank (WB), IMF, and Asian Development Bank (ADB). He warned that failure to comply could lead to ruin.

To tackle the debt, the minister proposed transferring the expressway system and its assets to the government-owned Sahasya Investment Company.

This, he believes, is necessary to prevent innocent individuals from bearing the burden for the rest of their lives.

### A bloc to confront global debt crisis: What role for Sri Lanka?

*2024-04-10 01:58:21* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-bloc-to-confront-global-debt-crisis-What-role-for-Sri-Lanka/4-760536) · `en`

What proved to be particularly effective were the ways in which the IDEAs conference explored how powerful states and capitals reproduce a highly unequal global order with dramatic regional differences

Even if Sri Lanka is eventually able to “successfully” exit the IMF program, the question is, at what human cost? The paucity of discourse about a short to medium-term relief strategy to cope with the immiseration of working people during the depression is an indictment of our ruling class. But considering the views expressed at the IDEAs conference, it further reflects tremendous short-sightedness in ignoring the paradoxes that have provoked serious researchers elsewhere. They have considered the impact of debt crisis not only on the infrastructure gap but also on human development

Siva Senai leader Satchithanandam and those of his ilk are seemingly successful in the short term in their anti-Christian action. But in the long term their actions are succeeding in weakening Tamil nationalism by driving the Hindu-Christian wedge in between. In that sense Satchithanandan is accomplishing what the historic enemies of Tamil nationalism have been unable to do in the past – Divide Tamils! The sad irony in this is that Satchi himself was nurtured in the nursery of Tamil nationalism and regards himself as Tamil nationalist still

Current media coverage in Sri Lanka is heavily focused on the forthcoming Presidential elections. Though officially not announced yet, it seems a foregone conclusion that the presidential poll would take place later this year. Several potential candidates ranging from incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe to media magnate Dilith Jayaweera are tipped to be in the presidential fray.

The limits of state capitalism are visible worldwide, from China, Sri Lanka, Egypt, and Nigeria to Ukraine. Globally, state-owned enterprises’ assets are worth the equivalent of half the global GDP, while government-owned real estate is worth twice that amount. Decades of research, including from the IMF, have shown that government-owned businesses are, on average, one-third less productive than private firms. This is hampering financial sector reform and the efficient allocation of capital, leading to constrained economic development and growth.

### India loosens onion export ban to help neighbours

*2024-04-10 00:56:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/India-loosens-onion-export-ban-to-help-neighbours/56-760517) · `en`

India is gearing up to supply thousands of metric tonnes of onions to Sri Lanka and UAE, days after it approved limited exports of essential commodities to the Maldives.

According to the Hindustan Times, India has supplied 10,000 metric tons of onions over and above the agreed 14,400-ton cap.

The world’s largest global exporter of onions, India has either banned or limited export permits for the in-demand vegetable, as well as for rice, wheat flour, pulses, and sugar, since last December.

Subsequently, onion prices are believed to have risen dramatically in neighbouring countries that have depended on onion imports from India to meet their domestic demand. Through a “special quota” arrangement, the Indian Government recently allowed exports to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Bahrain, and Bhutan.

### New Year, tough times and animal abuse - E

We wish our readers a happy and bountiful New Year, as the country celebrates its cultural festival this month. On the 13th of this month, the two major communities in our country Tamils and the Sinhalese celebrate the Eastern or cultural New Year. Around the same time, our Muslim brothers and sisters celebrate Ramadan, while Christians celebrate Easter.

The ‘Adhi Vasies’- also known as the ‘Veddahs’ also celebrate the New Year or ‘Kona Mangalaya’ during this time. Within the month all communities celebrate.

This year too, since the Covid-19 pandemic hit our country in January 2020, New Year celebrations will be held on an austere basis. Over 500,000 persons lost employment due to the lockdowns imposed during that period.

Making a bad situation worse, the financial meltdown in 2022 led the country to announce it was bankrupt. The country was thus deemed not credit-worthy by the world’s financial institutions.

### Sri Lanka best  place for solo female travel and belittling country

*2024-04-10 00:01:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Sri-Lanka-best-place-for-solo-female-travel-and-belittling-country/172-280492) · `en`

The British travel magazine Time Out ranked Sri Lanka as the best place for solo female travel.

I have written in these pages that Sri Lankans, more than anyone else, have done a spectacular job in disparaging their country at home and abroad. The genesis of this particular penchant is multifaceted. Some are innately bitter, some are attention-seeking, and others seek validation. For certain others, this represents an escapism from an existential identity crisis. Most of them live in an eternal gripe. So whenever the country gets a positive mention, their egos are prickled, their heartbeat rises, and they resurface, like earthworms after the rain, to contest, talk trash and scandalize.
