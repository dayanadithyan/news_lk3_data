Colombo, March 30 (Daily Mirror)- India remains unresponsive to the request by Sri Lanka to allow an innocent passage through the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for its fishermen to enter the Arabian Sea, a top source said.

A Filipino villager has been nailed to a wooden cross for the 35th time to reenact Jesus Christ‚Äôs suffering in a brutal Good Friday tradition he said he would devote to pray for peace in Ukraine, Gaza and the disputed South China Sea.

On Friday, over a hundred people watched on as 10 devotees were nailed to wooden crosses, among them Ruben Enaje, a 63-year-old carpenter and sign painter. The real-life crucifixions have become an annual religious spectacle that draws tourists in three rural communities in Pampanga province, north of Manila.

The gory ritual resumed last year after a three-year pause due to the coronavirus pandemic. It has turned Enaje into a village celebrity for his role as the ‚ÄúChrist‚Äù in the Lenten reenactment of the Way of the Cross.

‚ÄúWhile I was walking, all I was thinking about was how Jesus felt while he was carrying his cross up until he was crucified,‚Äù Enaje told reporters. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell for how long I can do this since my body is also getting old.‚Äù

Seven more Filipinos were nailed to crosses in other villages in Pampanga.
