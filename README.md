### Switzerland to ban Hamas after Israel attacks

*2024-02-22 11:58:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97451/switzerland-to-ban-hamas-after-israel-attacks-) · `en`

Switzerland’s government said on Wednesday it wants to ban Hamas after the Palestinian militant group’s attacks in Israel last year which killed nearly 1,200 people and sparked a war in Gaza.

Bern said it was taking action after the attacks on October 7 which killed two Swiss nationals and resulted in nearly 250 people being taken hostage.

In response, Israel launched a military assault on Gaza that local health authorities say has killed nearly 29,000 Palestinians with thousands more feared lost amid the ruins.

The Swiss government said under the new legislation Hamas and “cover or successor organisations” as well as organisations or groups that act on its behalf or in its name will be banned.

The ban aims to punish Hamas for the October attacks as well as prevent the group using Switzerland as a safe haven or carrying out attacks in the country for example by making entry bans or expulsions easier to arrange.

### ’’Better if he did another job’’ - Hasaranga lashes out at umpire

Dambulla, Feb 22 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka's T20 captain lashed out at the umpiring during the third and final T20I against Afghanistan at Palekelle on Wednesday, claiming that a missed no ball call in the final over influenced his team's three-run defeat.

With 11 runs needed in the final three balls for Sri Lanka to win, a full toss from Afghanistan's fast bowler Wafadar Mohammad soared above the waist of all-rounder Kamindu Mendis, as he stepped out of the crease and attempted to heave the ball onto the leg side.

With the no ball not signaled, Kamindu Mendis pleaded with umpires Ravindra Wimalasiri and square leg umpire Lyndon Hannibal to review the call, but the umpires chose not to.

"To be honest, this is not something that can happen in an international cricket match. If it was just above the waist, then it's understandable, but had that gone a little higher, it would have hit the batsman on the head!" a visibly annoyed Hasaranga told journalists after the match.

Sri Lanka’s inflation expanded by 6.5 percent year-on-year in January, as the prices rose across almost all categories from the one-off impact from the higher Value Added Tax and supply chain disruptions caused by the weather-related conditions.

On a monthly basis, as measured by the National Consumer Price Index, the prices rose by 3.0 percent in January, from 1.4 percent a month ago, reaching the highest increase recorded in more than a year.

The prices measured by the broader consumer price index followed the closely watched Colombo Consumer Price Index released three weeks ago, which also had a reading of 6.4 percent for January, from 4.0 percent in December.

The recent price pressures aren’t surprising, as the authorities were expecting the price gauges to reach in the neighbourhood of 7.0 percent in both January and February.

### Abolishing the executive presidency – is time running out?

*2024-02-22 01:24:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Abolishing-the-executive-presidency-is-time-running-out/4-758749) · `en`

In this crucial election year, we need to ask ourselves why it is necessary to change the existing system – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Earlier this week, the President’s Media Division issued a statement to the effect that the next Presidential election will be held on schedule. What was the need for that statement? In terms of the Constitution, the President’s term of office ends not later than 18 November 2024. As far as I am aware, no Member of Parliament has given any indication that he or she intends to introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution to extend the term of office of the President, as required by article 83 of the Constitution. Such a Bill, if passed with a two-third majority, will also need to be approved by the people at a referendum. In the absence of any such move, what was the need for the President’s Media Division to assert the obvious? Was it to stifle the movement for restoring the parliamentary executive that now appears to be gathering wide public support?

*2024-02-22 01:23:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177003) · `ta`

The government should take immediate action to reopen the Ragama and Mahara schools closed following the Easter bombing. National People's Congress leader Rishad Bathiudeen said that the President should take steps to restore the ban imposed by the Ministry of Defense to bring the Arab Buddha into the country.

He said this while addressing the debate on the current state of the country held in Parliament on Wednesday (21).

The Secretary of the Ministry of Defense is still in force forbidding the Arab Buddha following the Easter bombing. So the Arab Mattarasas in the country are unable to bring the Arabic bottles.

Similarly, even tourists from Arab countries are unable to bring Arab books. The President should therefore take action to withdraw the letter to the Secretary of the Ministry as the Minister of Defense.

Nuwara Eliya’s extreme cold condition might make the less affluent locals shiver, but it is promoted as a holiday destination among the rich

If we turn the pages of time there were two groups which were clearly not involved in developing this nation by being involved with the work of past governments. One is the private sector and the other is the JVP which is the key party marshalling the NPP. The private sector preferred to mind its business and the JVP didn’t wish to team up with any government and get its hands dirty.

NPP Leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake has stated on numerous occasions that the alliance he leads will appoint as Heads of State Institutions, professionals with a proven educational background.
