Today while an impoverished nation stands marooned on a shore of despair, the duo remains unrepentant and unperturbed

Dissimilarities in dress and manner aside, they share more commonalities than usually recognised. Methods could vary, the goal is the same, power by any means. Power is not something new to them, for nearly 25 years now, they have headed alternate governments, if not directly, by proxy. They want more, a craving that cannot apparently be gratified. Going on their record, neither deserves power. Economically as well as socially, the country is on its knees today, hopeless, its institutions in shambles; surely in these 25 years, something could have been done to avoid this plight or in the very least, forewarned the country of the impending disaster

There have been 595 murders in 200 days in Tamil Nadu. Increased cannabis and drugs. Students will degrade young people if they do not prevent cannabis sales.

There are workers and experienced ministers for many years in DMK. But in the family party, DMK will not get the post of Deputy Chief Minister.

Bangladesh appeared calm on Monday amid a curfew, but widespread disruption of telecoms prevailed a day after the Supreme Court scrapped some quotas for government jobs that sparked protests this month that killed scores.

Clashes between protesters and security forces killed at least 139 people across the South Asian nation after the high court last month reinstated job reservations removed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina‚Äôs government in 2018.

On Sunday, however, the Supreme Court ordered that 93% of government jobs should be allocated on the basis of merit, against earlier quotas of 56% for groups such as families of freedom fighters, women, and people from underdeveloped areas.

There were no reports of violence or protests on Monday morning and media said curfew would be relaxed for three hours in the afternoon, extended from two hours the previous day, so that people could buy essentials.

The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a petition challenging a gazette notification by the Minister of Public that releases the Shriman Cultivation from the Vedithalthivu Reserve Zone.

The petitioners claim that the Minister of Public has issued a gazette notification to release the Shriman Cultivation from the Vedithalthivu Reserve Zone, designated as a reserve monastery.

The gazette notification stated that the Petitions referred to the provisions of the Wildlife and Flora Ordinance and that the migration birds and hydrologicals enter the forest zone.

Petitioners call on the Supreme Court to issue a gazette notification order to issue a gazette notification order since the biodiversity of the area is also influenced by biodiversity.

### Russia is the fourth economic force in the world

*2024-07-22 12:34:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189023) ¬∑ `ta`

In early June, the World Bank ranked Russia as the fourth-largest economy globally based on PPP, surpassing Germany due to cheaper gas and political instability. Russia's economic growth, initially lagging, surged post-Ukraine invasion, aiming for global dominance. Despite challenges, including sanctions and a shift towards militarization, Russia's economy boomed, with the World Bank tripling its growth forecast to 3.2%. However, Russia still trails India and China in size, with the shadow economy potentially underestimating its true GDP.

üü©

According to the World Bank's data, published in early June, the Russian economy has become the fourth developed country in the world based on Purchase- Power and Balance (PPP).

According to PNE report last August, Russia has already behind Germany to become the fifth largest economy. The cheapest Russian gas was cut off, and German has now been stagnant and suffered from recent political events and fell to sixth place in the World Bank rankings.

Purchase-Power-Balance (PPP) and Gross National Production Measurement is preferred by many economists. This is because it takes into account the difference between local prices and nominal prices.

The World Bank has upgraded Russia's ranking after reviewing its data. And Russia says that Japan has actually overtaken Japan in 2021 and has since retained the fourth place since.

Its earlier calculations were based on 2017 data, but these are now updated to reflect 2021 statistics.

### SriLankan Airlines still seeks foreign partner ‚Äì report

While Sri Lanka has scrapped plans to sell a stake in its national carrier, SriLankan Airlines, after foreign offers it sought didn‚Äôt meet up to expectations, government officials say they are pursuing an alternate route which still includes attracting investors to the debt-ridden airline.

‚ÄúWe are looking at an alternate proposal which would still be under the previous plan to invite investors. It‚Äôs sensitive at the moment but we hope to announce the new plan in two to three weeks,‚Äù said a source close to the negotiating team.

On Thursday, the government said it had dropped plans to sell a minority stake of 49 per cent of SriLankan Airlines, after none of the bidding entities that expressed interest in it was deemed ‚Äúworthy‚Äù.

‚ÄúInstead, the airline will undergo restructuring under an alternate plan,‚Äù stated Sri Lankan minister of ports, shipping and aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva. However, he did not share what the alternate proposal was.
