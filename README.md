The Democratic Party leader C. Vendan demands the release of Murugan, Robateayas, and Jayakumar, who were convicted in Sriperumbudur cases. The Eelam Tamils feel their justifications and demands for a homeland are ignored. The relationship between the Eelam Tamils and India has been strained, with the Sri Lankan Indian Treaty and its staff in Sri Lanka being based on mutual welfare and security. The tragic event of the Siripur Buddha has widened the gap. The Eelam Tamils urge the Indian Central Manila Government to release the convicted individuals.

Democratic Party leader C. Vendan said that Murugan, Robateayas and Jayakumar should quickly release the special camps and return their homeland.

The Tamils feel that India should understand the justifications and chambers of the Eelam Tamils after decades.

The socio -political and economic security relations of the Eelam Tamils and India are worthy of history.

The Sri Lankan Indian Treaty and its Staff in Sri Lanka were based on the accumulation of its full strength, considering the welfare of its region and the security of the Eelam Tamil.

Some of the bitter extraordinary events after that have been abandoned by the Eelam Tamils in the aftermath of the tragic event of the Siripur Buddha, which has finally created a gap in the relationship of the Indian Eelam Tamils.

We and our people think that the relationship between us and India has been abandoned.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that there is a general saying that the flowers should be taxed from the people who do not pay the flower.

He was speaking at a special statement in Parliament today (06).

Everyone admits that our country is in any economic stability today. But there are those who criticize our implementation of the program we implement without accepting so.. Some allegate that the public seems to be strong, but some complain that they don't feel it. It is said that the masses have unnecessary taxes on the taxes. The electricity bill, fuel prices have been increased.

There is usually a saying that the people should be taxed from the people. But we will never protect us that we don't keep that order.. That the flowers have to take the rons of romon.

This is a wonderful lesson for us. It is not possible that the rons were able to ignore the flowers in general. The situation is different. We go today. Recently, we had to cross the economic vast bridge. Go on a ride.

### Crucial Red Sea data cables cut, telecoms firm says

*2024-03-06 11:42:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Crucial-Red-Sea-data-cables-cut-telecoms-firm-says/108-278343) ¬∑ `en`

March 6 (BBC) - Several undersea communications cables in the Red Sea have been cut, affecting 25% of data traffic flowing between Asia and Europe, a telecoms company and a US official say.

Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications said it had taken measures to reroute traffic after four of the 15 cables were recently severed.

The US official said it was trying to find out whether the cables were cut deliberately or snagged by an anchor.

Last month, Yemen's internationally-recognised government warned that the Iran-backed Houthi movement might sabotage the undersea cables in addition to attacking ships in the sea.

The Houthis - who control much of western Yemen's Red Sea coast - denied last week that they had targeted cables and blamed US and British military strikes for any damage to them.

US and British forces have targeted Houthi weapons and infrastructure in response to the drone and missile attacks on merchant vessels passing through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
