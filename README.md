### Intended messages and their interpretation

*2024-02-26 12:40:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/intended-messages-and-their-interpretation/) · `en`

It is common for short clips of statements by public figures, often taken out of context, to go viral

Few things on social media go as viral as short clips of statements by public figures, often taken out of context. In platforms designed to capitalise on our shrinking attention spans, users rarely have the time or patience for context. Even if some may wish to trace a circulating video clip to its original, longer video source, it would have likely gone viral by then, prompting journalists to play catch up, although we may not report on it.

While it is hard to pin motivations based on short clips, the instant reactions they trigger can be interesting and telling. Among other things, they show us how an intended message and its interpretation can be very different while consumed on social media. A case in point is a remark made by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Mumbai, last month.

### Bangladesh court halts wild elephant adoption

Dhaka, Feb 26 (AFP) - A Bangladeshi court on Sunday barred the adoption of elephants from the wild, a move hailed by animal rights activists as a "landmark" order to help stop cruelty.

Rights groups said the high court order suspending licences will stop the torture of captive Asian elephants in the name of training.

"The high court today suspended all licences for the captive rearing of elephants," said Amit Das Gupta, deputy attorney general of the country.

Bangladesh was once one of the major homes for Asian elephants.

But poaching and habitat loss saw their number dwindle so much that they are now declared critically endangered in the South Asian country.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says there are nearly 100 captive Asian elephants in Bangladesh, nearly half the amount of elephants left in the wild in the country.

As logging and farming encroach on elephant territory, young animals are captured in the country's northern and southeastern hills.

### Sri Lanka central bank salary hikes show lack of accountability for its actions

*2024-02-26 08:17:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-salary-hikes-show-lack-of-accountability-for-its-actions-152064/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – The steep salary hikes of Sri Lanka’s central bank after the inflation the agency itself created, has drawn public and legislators’ ire, but the deeper problem is that it is yet another sign of the lack of accountability in the new monetary law.

Some legislators are upset that the Parliament’s control of public finances has been usurped by the ‘independent’ central bank.

But Sri Lanka’s central bank has a history of topping up pensions also to cover for inflation  – whether low or high  – while giving low interest loans for staff.

This is questionable because unlike other SOEs, the central bank itself is responsible for cutting rates and driving up inflation and interest rates to stabilize the currency after blowing a hole in the balance of payments.

The practice of transferring billions to defined-benefit pension staff funds when inflation and interest rates are down, can perhaps be excused as a reward for not triggering monetary instability.

The company revenue of Rs. 2,400 million at the World Trade Center, Colombo, was 14% higher than the corresponding period of last year, due mainly to higher rental rates. Revenue of Rs. 1,163 million was recorded from Residential Sales of Havelock City which was significantly lower than the corresponding period in 2022.

*2024-02-26 03:31:07* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c3g05zgw3w5o) · `si`

None contains none of the. Now the reservoir has bound. There is no need for the authorities. "

Fisheries Industry: 'Fish on paddy fields. Like the crash of the tsunami. '

The National Aquaculture Development Authority estimates that the reservoirs have been drifted away from the reservoirs due to reservoirs in January 2024.

According to the Senanayake Samudra, it has now reduced a yield of fish per day before spilling it, the fishermen said.

As a result, children's education has been hampered and unable to find the necessary costs for food, the fishermen said to the BBC Sinhala service.

However, there will take about another year to rebuild fish in the reservoirs.

Owing to a long persisted inward-looking economic policy, large unproductive public sector and unfavourable monetary and exchange rate policies, the country failed to develop a sufficiently large export-oriented industrial sector

Sri Lanka is celebrating 76 years of independence this year, and the country is just emerging from its worst ever economic crisis which erupted in 2022. With the support of the IMF Extended Fund Facility arrangement and debt restructuring, which aims to restore long-term public debt sustainability, the country is obligated to make certain structural economic policy reforms to avoid the repetition of a similar crisis in the future.

### Heatwaves and Dry Spell Warnings but no Remedial Alternatives - EDITORIAL

*2024-02-26 01:39:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Heatwaves-and-Dry-Spell-Warnings-but-no-Remedial-Alternatives-EDITORIAL/172-277681) · `en`

Sri Lanka is presently caught up in the middle of a heatwave. The Department of Meteorology had forecast the present spell of dry weather some months earlier. As is usual in our country, other than a few media outlets making passing mention of the forecast, neither the government nor the private sector has made plans to mitigate or counter the effects of the present spell of dry weather.

Even worse, the Meteorology Department authorities too are sending out mixed signals regarding the effects of the ‘heatwave’. On one hand, it warns the public to take protective measures by limiting exposure to the sun, recommends greater intake of liquids (water), etc, while at the same time claiming present conditions are merely statistics on a Heat Index.

### Navalny Died Trying to Politicise the Russians

*2024-02-26 01:34:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Navalny-Died-Trying-to-Politicise-the-Russians/172-277680) · `en`

The sudden, mysterious death of Aleksei Navalny, the charismatic Russian Opposition Leader imprisoned on trumped up charges, came as a shock to many. It’s not totally surprising, however, given the long list of Russians killed by gunmen or by poisoning over the past decade. They all have one thing in common, running afoul of the Kremlin (which is Vladimir Putin) for one reason or another.

The shadowy Yevgeny Prigozhin, Head of the Wagner Mercenary Group (with close ties to Putin) who led an armed rebellion against Putin from Ukraine in June 2023, died in a plane crash with top associates in August 2023.

Little noticed was the murder of Maksim Kuzminov, a Russian helicopter pilot who defected from the fighting in Ukraine. He was shot dead in February this year near Alicante in Spain. Spanish intelligence services accused the Kremlin of orchestrating the killing.

The reason for such mockery aimed at the recent taxes is the sheer disregard by the government for the two main principles of taxation, namely fairness and consistency

These days, tax has become the talk of the town, the laughing-stock and the attractive subject matter for cartoonists. The general public perceives it as a ‘legalized robbery’ executed by the state using rules and regulations, backed by the threat of legal consequences for non-compliances.

The reason for such mockery aimed at the recent taxes, is the sheer disregard by the government of the two main principles of taxation, namely the fairness (ability to pay) and consistency.

This perception of ‘legalized robbery’ is gaining momentum among the general public especially in the backdrop of the unparalleled financial crisis and sky-rocketing cost of living, while the income of the public has been drastically slashed.
