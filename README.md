Colombo, Feb 01 (Daily Mirror) -  Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SriLankan Airlines Richard Nuttall, who responded to concerns over flight delays, said though the delays were in line with the world averages, there are more delays than used to be because of technical issues.

He said it is common for every airline to have delays but whenever there is a delay here, people tend to report it as it is the end of the world.

“Every airline has flight delays. If Qatar Airways has a flight delay, it is not reported in the press in Qatar,” he said.

He said SriLankan’s on-time performance was better than the average of the Oneworld carriers.

“Every time I have an AOG (Aircraft on Ground), everything about the ability of that aircraft to fly again is governed by very strict manuals and checks and balances.

Palestinian civilians including children stage a demonstration in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, calling for continued international support to UNRWA. AFP

Peace-loving people worldwide are probably sick and tired of seeing and hearing the triumph of evil and injustice. Each time they hoped for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip so that the besieged people could breathe the air of melancholic freedom, they were dealt yet another blow by the war party.

The latest is what followed the International Court of Justice’s ruling on January 26. The world court ruled by a majority decision that Israel should “take all measures within its power” to prevent acts of genocide in the Gaza Strip. The court also ordered Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Although it stopped short of ordering a ceasefire, most jurists believe a ceasefire is implied.

State Minister, Sanath Nishantha died under tragic circumstances on January 25 (Thursday) and his funeral rites were performed on the 28th (Sunday). Massive crowds were there to mourn his death and most stages of his funeral received wide media attention.

Colombo, Feb 1 (Daily Mirror) - The internal committee of the All Ceylon Inter-Provincial School Children Transport Services Association has decided to take a collective decision to increase the school children's transport fares from today, Associations chairman E.H. Ruwan Prasad said.

He told the media that 10% of the existing transport fare will be increased for short-distance school services and 15% will be increased for long-distance school services.

"Therefore, the association requests the government to give a firm decision before implementing the new transport fares. With the increase in the fare, parents always have to suffer. We cannot stay silent with this fuel price increase. We can increase the school van transport fares along with the government's decision to increase fuel prices, but it is unfortunate to say that there is no procedure introduced by the government to reduce the prices," Prasad said.

### All Ceylon Private Bus Association

*2024-02-01 15:55:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175307) · `ta`

Increase bus fares by 10 percent for fuel prices. We will give the government 15 days. All Ceylon Private Bus Association President Gemunu Wijeratne said that if the tariff is increased, we will show our strength.

He was speaking at a media briefing held in Colombo on Thursday (01).

There is a huge problem in determining bus fares due to a change in fuel prices every month. Fuel prices have been increased with effect from yesterday.

We make requests to the government to revise the bus fare when fuel prices are increased.

The fuel fare increases every month. But it is practically impossible that the bus fare should be amended twice a year.

Amidst the cost of living, the price of vehicle parts has been increased manifold.

So we are sure that the bus fare should be increased this time. We cannot continue the service if we do not revise the cost of fuel costs.

The bus fare should be increased by 10 percent for the current fuel price.
