### 15 years after the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka - the war crimes are still not judged - International Human Rights Watch

*2024-05-16 11:00:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183662) ¬∑ `ta`

Fifteen years post-conflict, Sri Lanka's war crimes remain unjudged. Lakshmi recounts the horrors of the final days in 2009, describing the aftermath of the 26-year civil war between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE. The conflict ended with alleged massacres, torture, and disappearances, impacting hundreds of thousands of civilians. Despite international calls for justice, including from the UN Human Rights Council, accountability remains elusive, contributing to ongoing economic challenges and societal unrest.

üü©

Lakshmi remembers the day when the guns finally silenced in May 2009.

He had taken refuge in the sand in the sand. Hundreds of thousands of civilians, which were called Bunker, have been refugees on the coast.

They faced a series of bombs for several weeks in the area announced by the Army Security Zone.

Luxmi told us at a recent meeting that many were struggling to save their lives.

We were inside the bunker.

We have seen the blood flowing out and the body- we can never forget it, ‚Äùhe said.

The 26 -year war between the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Sri Lankan government is finally over on May 19, alleged that more than one hundred Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) surrendered.

The photos and videos of the state forces as their successes have shown the assassination of prisoners tied up by hands.

Lakshmi was taken to the interim camp where about 250 000 people were detained from suspected LTTE - he is still fearing his true name.

MPs seek to extend their insurance coverage to include family members, requesting an increase from one million rupees. This follows their authorization for concession vehicle licenses, discussed during a House Committee meeting. The move comes as they already cover their own insurance and that of the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, indicating willingness to pay more for family inclusion. The Speaker has urged the President to consider granting these permits, with the government potentially reviewing such concessions post-lift of the vehicle import ban.

üü©

A reliable source yesterday said that the MPs had requested that their family members be extended to one million rupees insurance for the inclusion of their family members following the authorization for concession vehicle licenses.

At the House Committee meeting held last Friday, MPs have heard this while urging the permission of the vehicle permit for the second time.

They are currently paying the amount of insurance of MPs and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. They are said to have tried to add their family members to it and agreed to pay an increased amount.

More. The Daily Mirror has reported that Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena has written to President Ranil Wickremesinghe to consider the grant of permits demanded by MPs.

The government is considering such concessions once the ban on vehicle imports is lifted.

The 23-year-old was suspended by Nepal's cricket association after his conviction late last year but remained at liberty after his sentencing to await the outcome of his appeal.

"I am grateful to everyone for all the support during this time," Lamichhane said outside the court, where he was greeted by cheering fans.

In this beautiful island nation of Sri Lanka, a shadow looms large, shaping much of the turmoil and instability that grips its society. This shadow is corruption, a pervasive issue that seeps through the layers of governance, eroding the trust between the people and their leaders, and undermining the foundations of social and economic development. The claim that corruption is the root cause of the social instability in Sri Lanka is not an exaggeration; rather, it is a reflection of a harsh reality. From FCID investigations to inquiries at local police stations to inquiries at immigration ‚Äì corruption persists!

Corruption in Sri Lanka manifests in various forms, from high-level political graft to everyday bureaucratic bribery. It affects everything from the simplest government transaction to the largest infrastructure projects. The impacts are profound and multifaceted, influencing not just the economic sphere but also the very social fabric of the nation.
