### Israel and Hezbollah trade heavy fire before pulling back, jolting a region braced for war

*2024-08-25 17:08:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101491/israel-and-hezbollah-trade-heavy-fire-before-pulling-back-jolting-a-region-braced-for-war) ┬╖ `en`

Israel launched a wave of airstrikes across southern Lebanon early Sunday in what it said was a preemptive strike on Hezbollah. The militant group responded that it had launched hundreds of rockets and drones to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders last month.

The heavy exchange of fire does not appear to have ignited a long-feared war, but the situation remains tense. Meanwhile, Egypt on Sunday is hosting high-level talks aimed at brokering a cease-fire in the 10-month-old Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, which diplomats hope will tamp down regional tensions.

The Israeli military said it struck because Hezbollah was planning to launch a heavy barrage of rockets and missiles toward Israel. Soon after, Hezbollah announced it had launched an attack on Israeli military positions as an initial response to the killing of Fouad Shukur, one of its founding members, in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last month.

### Men of note from the minorities

The names that come to mind include the brothers Ponnambalam Ramanathan and Ponnambalam Arunachalam and their kinsmen, Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy and Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy. They came from the same highly educated and successful families of Jaffna.

Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan had held the office of Solicitor-General under British rule and often acted as Attorney-General, a post reserved for officers recruited from abroad. He was a polished speaker, though in his old age he was inclined to be somewhat long-winded.

From the meticulous selection of auspicious dates to the inevitable family dynamics, these celebrations are a whirlwind of emotions and preparations.

The Ambani wedding was an exceptional example of this tradition, elevated to unprecedented heights. Spanning an astonishing seven months, it was a fairy tale-like spectacle characterized by opulence and grandeur. At its heart, however, was the solemn exchange of vows to be with each other for тАЬSaat JanamтАЭ between Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant, a testament to their enduring love.

In fact, this decision should come as no surprise.  There was little choice but to hold as the Bench did, relying on several precedents which have firmly established the predominant principle that, exercising the right of franchise is an inviolable right of citizens, it is a collective as well as an individual right. The Court found the President (also as Minister of Finance) responsible along with the luckless Elections Commission.

*2024-08-25 00:45:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/what-the-majority-want-from-a-new-government/) ┬╖ `en`

Now that the presidential election is round the corner and would be followed by a general election, the majority of law-abiding, patriotic, selfless and non-partisan people would want many changes in the system to bring this country back to where it was in the early nineteen fifties.

The first thing many are clamoring for is to abolish the executive presidency. This office has been a bane rather than a boon to this country and its people. It has only helped to enrich some who achieved this position. As we can remember, there were many previous occupants of this office who promised abolish it if they were elected, but reneged on their promise.

The powers attached to the executive presidency have been misused even by those with a good educational background and we have seen how the prerogative of the presidential pardon had been utilized to pardon murderers, drug dealers, child rapists, etc.

### Sajith and Anura Promise to Abolish the Executive Pesidency if they come to Powe; Reality is that people are not going to trust politicians who make such promises again.

There was a period when the abolition of the executive presidential system was a key issue at Presidential Elections. However, such a situation cannot be expected to arise again.

The politicians who promised to abolish the executive presidency have not only failed to do so after winning the election and assuming office as president, but have also taken action to increase their powers. Therefore, the reality is that people are not going to trust politicians who make such promises again.

However, now that the Presidential Election campaigns are heating up, talks of the abolition of the executive presidency have resumed. Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader Sajith Premadasa and National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake have promised on election platforms last week that if they win the Presidential Election and come to power, they will abolish the presidential system and bring back the parliamentary system.
