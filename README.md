### Lionel Wendt, Count de Mauny, David Paynter and Raman

*2024-02-03 21:09:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/lionel-wendt-count-de-mauny-david-paynter-and-raman/) · `en`

The self styled “Count”. De Mauny was born as Maurice Marie Talavande on March 21, 1886. The circumstances under which he left for Ceylon were controversial, some writers suggesting that he was compelled to leave France for misbehaviour with young men in his charge.

None of these rumours have ever been established, and to this day remain as rumours. According to William Warren, author of the book “Tropical Asian Style”, de Mauny was first invited to Ceylon in 1912 by SIr Thomas Lipton the tea magnate. He followed that up with several subsequent visits concluding with his purchase of an island off the coast of Weligama, which was only a rocky outcrop one and a half acres in extent and overrun with weeds.

### Memories of Geoff Weinman

*2024-02-03 20:47:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/memories-of-geoff-weinman/) · `en`

The news of the recent demise of Geoff Weinman after a long span of 93 years did not come as a surprise to me. I am saddened, nevertheless, as over the years, beginning from around 1957 I had enjoyed a very rewarding relationship with him.

He spent his last years in an Elders’ Home well cared for by its professional staff. I was in constant touch with him on a regular basis even after he emigrated to Australia until unfortunate circumstances made him incommunicado. Thereafter, it was a case of obtaining regular updates on his health from the professional staff of the Elders’ Home. Perhaps the last Sri Lankans to visit him there were two of my former teammates, long-time residents in Sydney, Dr. Shivantha Arudpragasam and Rex Perera, inseparable second-row forwards of my time!

Derived from chapter one, six and seven of the Natyasashtra, on the origin of drama, and published in The Monkey King And Other Stories, Canada 1995 and in Scarless Face And Other Stories, India 2006.

The great god of the Hindus is Lord Brahma and in ancient times the great book of the Hindus made up of many parts was called the Vedas which told the Hindus about life, through artistic methods. India is a very large place, and people just moved across land from one place to another, meeting other, different kinds of people as they went. Lord Brahma and his Hindus who started in the North of India began moving to the South, carrying with them the great books of the Vedas. The people of Lord Brahma moved right across the whole of Southern India and into the country now called Sri Lanka, for in those days the narrow and shallow sea that divides Sri Lanka from India was all land.

### Krishantha Cooray saved my life

Many have been my blessings over the past 15 years after a fresh lease of life afforded me in 2008. Spending quality time with my family including my grandchild more recently as well as attending spiritual retreats, with the latest ending on Australia Day long weekend, have been standouts.

Retreats are a time to reflect on life and the mysterious workings of God in one’s life. It was definitely the mercy of God that afforded me a fresh lease of life after my abductors were hellbent on literally silencing me after torture. God works on earth through angelic as well as human beings through their acts of goodness – the essence of God. At Christmas, the angels announced, “Glory to God on high and peace to men of goodwill”. Hence, a good person irrespective of their faith is already inclined towards God.

### Mathews, Chandimal centuries put Sri Lanka in control of Afghanistan Test

Centuries from Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal consolidated Sri Lanka's strong position on day two of their one-off Test against Afghanistan at the Singhalese Sports Club today.

Sri Lanka started the day with a 118-run deficit, but reached stumps on 410 for 6, and 212 runs ahead of the visiting team who toiled through much of the day with little success.

Such was the control and comfort Mathews enjoyed for a majority of his time at the crease in reaching his 16th century in the format, that it took a freak dismissal to end the former Sri Lanka captain's innings for 141.

In the final over of the day, Mathews swept hard at a poor delivery from Qais Ahmed, but hit the stumps on his follow through, to dislodge the bails.

Together with Chandimal, Mathews ground out the Aghanistan bowlers through the second session of play, which went wicketless.

The pair put on a 232-run partnership for the fourth wicket, before Chandimal was caught behind shortly after reaching his 15th Test century.
