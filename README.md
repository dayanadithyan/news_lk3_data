### UK lawmakers back landmark bill to gradually phase out smoking for good

The British government‚Äôs plan for a landmark smoking ban that aims to stop young people from ever smoking cleared its first hurdle in Parliament on Tuesday despite vocal opposition from within Prime Minister Rishi Sunak‚Äôs Conservative Party.

The bill, a key policy announced by Sunak last year, would make it illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone born after January 1, 2009. If passed, the bill will give Britain some of the toughest anti-smoking measures in the world. Authorities say it will create modern Britain‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst smoke-free generation.‚Äù

Under the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, children turning 15 this year or younger will never be legally sold tobacco. Once implemented ‚Äî officials are aiming for 2027 ‚Äî the legal age of sale that people in England can buy cigarettes will be raised by one year, every year until it is eventually illegal for the whole population.

### Addressing gender inequality key priority for Sri Lanka: ADB

*2024-04-17 04:24:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Addressing-gender-inequality-key-priority-for-Sri-Lanka-ADB/108-280806) ¬∑ `en`

As Sri Lanka looks to reach higher growth aspirations, addressing gender inequality is a key priority, the Asian Development Bank said.

In an economically active population of 8.5 million in 2022, female labour force participation in Sri Lanka was only 32.1 percent, down from 33.6 percent in 2018 prior to the economic crisis.

Key reasons for this include lack of safe and affordable childcare facilities, inadequate provision for flexible working hours, onerous household responsibilities and care duties socially imposed on women, and public transport inadequacies for women.

‚ÄúWhile the private sector has addressed these shortcomings to some extent, the government can tackle gender inequality through a more supportive framework for female labour participation by introducing flexible work hours and mandating equal pay, the ADB said in its recent outlook report.

Who is responsible for emerging religious extremism in Tamil North? Let me tell you, it‚Äôs the callously irresponsible Colombo resident Tamil leaderships. In democratic electoral politics, the strength of leaderships lies in how open and committed they stand against injustice and for democratic and fundamental rights. In Sinhala South, mainstream political leaderships took over majoritarian extremism. In post-war Tamil politics, established political leaders failing to stand with their people allows religious extremism.

According to the University Grants Commission (UGC), the second most expensive undergraduate degree program offered by state universities is the MBBS (after dental).

He expressed a desire for the public to have access to the relevant documents, including what he termed historical evidence dating back to the 12th century BC and the exchange of letters between India and Sri Lanka on the subject.
