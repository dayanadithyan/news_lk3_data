### நிகழ்நிலை பாதுகாப்பு சட்டம் : நீதிமன்றம் முன்வைத்த திருத்தங்களை அரசாங்கம் உள்வாங்கவில்லை - ஐக்கிய மக்கள் சக்தி

*2024-01-26 12:11:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174831) · `ta`

சபாநாயகர் நிகழ்நிலைபாதுகாப்பு சட்டத்திற்கு தனது அங்கீகாரத்தை வழங்குவதற்கு முன்னர் கட்சி தலைவர்களின் கூட்டத்தை கூட்டவேண்டும் என ஐக்கிய மக்கள் சக்தி வேண்டுகோள் விடுத்துள்ளது.

உயர்நீதிமன்றம் முன்வைத்த திருத்தங்கள்  சிலவற்றை அரசாங்கம் உள்வாங்கவில்லை என்பதால்  நிகழ்நிலை பாதுகாப்பு சட்டம் தொடர்பில் சபாநாயகர் கட்சிதலைவரின் கூட்டத்தினை கூட்டவேண்டும் என வேண்டுகோள் விடுக்க தீர்மானித்துள்ளதாக ஐக்கியமக்கள் சக்தியின் ஹர்சனராஜகருண தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

உயர்நீதிமன்றம் முன்வைத்த பரிந்துரைகளை நிகழ்நிலை பாதுகாப்பு சட்டம் உள்வாங்கவில்லை என்பதால் சபாநாயக அந்த சட்டத்தினை அங்கீகரிக்க கூடாது எனவும் ஐக்கிய மக்கள் சக்தி நாடாளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

உரிய திருத்தங்களை முன்னெடுக்காமல் சபாநாயகர் தனது அனுமதியை வழங்கினால் நீதித்துறைக்கும் சட்டவாக்கத்திற்கும் இடையில் மோதல் ஏற்படலாம்  எனவும் அவர் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

Russia, Jan 26 (Russia Today) - Moscow and New Delhi on Wednesday held detailed talks on reviving the Eastern Maritime Corridor (EMC) connecting Vladivostok in the Russian Far East and Chennai on India’s eastern coast.

The route, which was operational during the Soviet era, is the object of renewed interest from businesses in both countries amid an unprecedented surge in oil, coal, and fertilizer exports from Russia to India, as well as tensions in the Red Sea impacting existing shipping routes.

Speaking at a conference in Chennai, the Indian Minister for Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Sarbananda Sonowal, called the Eastern Maritime Corridor a “game changer” that would save up to 16 days of travel, significantly cutting freight costs. At present, most of the trade between India and Russia is conducted via the Mumbai–St. Petersburg sea route, which traverses the Suez Canal and takes 35-40 days.

### Sri Lankan faces charges in Thailand over pet lion joyride

*2024-01-26 11:48:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96740/sri-lankan-faces-charges-in-thailand-over-pet-lion-joyride) · `en`

Police in Thailand have arrested a woman whose pet lion was pictured going on a joyride in the streets of Pattaya.

A video that has now gone viral shows the chained lion cub seated in the back of a white, open-top Bentley.

The lion was being driven about by a Sri Lankan man who has since left the country, and is believed to be a friend of the woman, Sawangjit Kosoongnern.

While it is not illegal to own a lion in Thailand, it needs to be officially registered.

Authorities in Thailand said Ms Sawangjit claimed to have bought the animal from a Thai man in Nakhon Pathom province, who successfully facilitated its delivery to Pattaya.

However he failed to have his facility checked by officials before doing so, which made both the transfer and ownership of the animal illegal.

She is therefore facing charges of possessing a controlled wild animal without permission, which carries a penalty of a year’s imprisonment and a fine of up to 100,000 baht ($2,800; £2,200).

*2024-01-26 11:45:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174827) · `ta`

The unions have requested that the drug tests be carried out inside the school premises.

The trade unions have said that the investigations carried out inside the school premises can cause physical psychology.

The trade unions have requested that law enforcement authorities should not conduct any inquiries inside the school as the Public Security Ministry and the police are engaged in drug eradication in school areas and are engaged in the process of disrupting the business trade.

The students of Sri Lanka Asians Service Association, Mahinda Jayasinghe, said that such inquiries will be affected by their learning activities.

We have realized the need to eradicate drugs from schools but a complete plan can be eradicated by a complete plan, he said.

He also pointed out that such plans are being carried out in time to make them popular among the people for the needs of the rulers.

Alabama, Jan 26 (The New York Times) - Alabama carried out the first American execution using nitrogen gas on Thursday evening, killing a convicted murderer whose jury had voted to spare his life and opening a new frontier in how states execute death row prisoners.

The execution of the condemned prisoner, Kenneth Smith, 58, began at 7:53 p.m. Central time, and he was pronounced dead at 8:25 p.m. in an execution chamber in Atmore, Ala., according to John Q. Hamm, the state prison system’s commissioner.

The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the execution to move forward over the objections of its three liberal justices and concerns from death penalty opponents that the untested method could cause Mr. Smith to suffer.

### Sri Lanka to amend penal code to criminalise rape of young boys

*2024-01-26 11:12:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-amend-penal-code-to-criminalise-rape-of-young-boys-148746/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will introduce amendments to the Penal Code to make raping of male children a criminal offense.

Sri Lanka’s law does not effectively recognise male rape. Section 363(e) of the Penal Code of Sri Lanka specifically protects girls and fails to recognize that boys can be victims of rape.

The country is also looking to close loopholes in the law on the rape of females, the Cabinet of Ministers decided at this week’s meeting (24), a statement said.

At previous Cabinet meetings (held on 18.01.2021 and 28.06.2021) approval was given “to introduce amendments to the Penal Code to amend laws on constitutional rape of females mentioned in the Penal Code, to correct the shortcomings in the law of raping of females and to institute raping of male children as a criminal offense,” the Cabinet Decisions announcement read.

The Attorney General has now cleared the draft bill formulated by the Legal Draftsman.

### Gaza War: International Court of Justice may order Israel's military action

*2024-01-26 10:59:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174821) · `ta`

The International Court of Justice will present its verdict on the petition filed by South Africa, claiming that Israel is engaged in war crimes in Gaza.

There are reports that the United Nations court may order Israeli military operations in Gaza.

The two sides had made their arguments when the hearing of the petition filed by South Africa against Israel.

The verdict may be seen as political, despite the fact that the International Court of Justice is not required to implement the ruling of the International Court of Justice.

South Africa, which is vocal in support of the Palestinians, has appealed to Israel to court nine interim orders, including the suspension of its military actions.

### International Court of Justice set to rule on Gaza War today

Colombo (News 1st) – The International Court of Justice (ICJ) could order Israel to halt its Gaza offensive, in a sitting scheduled for Friday (26th) in The Hague, Netherlands.

The ICJ is the judicial body of the United Nations that decides on disputes between nations.  It comprises 17 judges from 17 nations, including one each from South Africa and Israel.

Judges are set to rule today on whether to order Israel to suspend its military campaign, as it responds to a case brought to the UN’s highest court by South Africa accusing Israel of state-led genocide in Gaza. The ICJ is set to rule on South Africa’s request for “provisional measures” against Israel over its alleged genocide in Gaza; the top UN court could order Israel to halt its offensive against the Palestinian territory.

The court will not rule today on whether Israel has committed acts of genocide. That process could take several years.

### Alabama executes a man with nitrogen gas, a first in the world

Alabama executed a convicted murderer with nitrogen gas Thursday, putting him to death with a first-of-its-kind method that once again put the US at the forefront of the debate over capital punishment. The state said the method would be humane, but critics called it cruel and experimental.

Officials said Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, was pronounced dead at 8:25 pm at an Alabama prison after breathing pure nitrogen gas through a face mask to cause oxygen deprivation. It marked the first time that a new execution method has been used in the United States since lethal injection, now the most commonly used method, was introduced in 1982.

The state had previously attempted to execute Smith, who was convicted of a 1988 murder-for-hire, in 2022, but the lethal injection was called off at the last minute because authorities couldn’t connect an IV line.

### Card payments’ merchant fee shouldn’t be borne by customers: CB Deputy Governor

Merchant fees which are at most times conveniently passed on to the customer should not be borne by the customer, the Central Bank asserted this week.

As per agreements inked between banks and vendors, the fee must be absorbed by the merchant himself.

Speaking on the issue, the Central Bank’s Senior Deputy Governor, Yvette Fernando said they have made aware the merchants at times who should bear the merchant fee which often gets added to the cost of purchase, and has made even the banks aware to pass on the message and to ensure that this doesn’t recur.

Although the practice has been known and in public for a very long time, no one or nothing has been done to address the issue. And it appears even the continuous awareness campaigns the Central Bank claims to have been conducting have not been followed by the merchants and even the banks.

A complete FTA of 14 chapters with the preamble and annexes has been prepared after nine rounds of negotiations.

The government hopes to improve trade and investment with Thailand which is one of the largest nations in South East Asia.

Sri Lanka has high levels of import duties and protectionism, which has kept local prices high and allowed domestic producers to exploit the public, critics say.

High tariffs also makes the economy inefficient and noncompetitive. (Colombo/Jan26/2024)

Colombo, Jan 26 (Daily Mirror) - Forty-eight-year-old Sanath Nishantha who hailed from Puttalam, left his house late on Wednesday to attend two weddings, one in Kurunegala and another in Chilaw.

While wishing his wife and four children goodbye, little did he know that he would never return.

At approximately 1 a.m. on Thursday (25) morning, while he was returning home on the Katunayake Expressway, his Land Cruiser met with a fatal accident as it rammed into a moving container truck.

His security officer, Police Constable Jayakody and Sanath Nishantha died on the spot. Their bodies were later transferred to the Ragama General Hospital.

SLPP Parliamentarian Sanath Nishantha entered parliament in 2015 and served as the State Minister of Water Supply under the present government. He was a staunch supporter of the Rajapaksas and always remained in the forefront when it came to defending them. However in his few years in politics, did the parliamentarian make his mark?

Jan -26 (Daily Mirror) - In a grim tale of addiction and desperation, Kattankudi Police nabbed two suspects yesterday, uncovering a significant stash of the illegal drug ICE and a shocking story of organ traf­ficking fuelled by addiction.

The raid, led by OIC G.gajanayake, netted a 32-year-old man caught with nearly 3 grams of ICE.

During interrogation, the suspect revealed a chilling truth: he had allegedly sold one of his own kidneys to fund his drug habit.

Both suspects were produced before Batticaloa Magistrate M.H.M. Hamza and remanded until February 6th.

### Sri Lanka’s financial crisis: Strategies for coping and thriving

People struggle to make ends meet due to rising costs of living and high taxes

Sri Lanka is currently facing a severe economic crisis, with many people struggling to make ends meet due to rising costs of living and high taxes. This is causing a strain on businesses, individuals, and senior citizens alike.

Several factors have contributed to Sri Lanka’s economic woes, including:

High levels of debt: The country’s foreign debt burden has ballooned in recent years, making it difficult to meet financial obligations.

Rising inflation: The cost of essential goods and services has steadily increased, outpacing wage growth and eroding purchasing power.

Currency depreciation: The Sri Lankan rupee has weakened significantly against major currencies, making imports more expensive.

Reduced tourism: The COVID-19 pandemic dealt a severe blow to Sri Lanka’s vital tourism industry, a major source of foreign income.

### Guns and Sri Lankan ‘Roses’ - EDITORIAL

*2024-01-26 00:38:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Guns-and-Sri-Lankan-Roses-EDITORIAL/172-275724) · `en`

Yesterday was a Poya Day (Duruthu Poya), and people placed flowers in front of Buddha statues all over the country, but we can safely say that roses have not been the favourite of Buddhists. This isn’t because roses are criminally expensive, but because this religion doesn’t have a close relationship with the ‘rose’. Buddhists prefer the lotus when an offering needs to be done; largely due to the lessons the flower symbolises.

But roses have entered our culture and quite secretly encroached the minds of peace-loving people as well as rebels and protesters. We remember in 2022 April (8) how a female undergraduate went in front of a barricade near the Sri Lankan Parliament and offered a rose to the Police, who were in their numbers to quell a protest. That gesture was ‘sweet’ like the rose itself, but those who love roses can love guns as well; in case you’re pushed to the wall and there is no solace from the law.

As Israel’s inhuman onslaught on the Gaza Strip continues, the talk of a two-state solution is being bandied about by world leaders, especially those from the Global South.

Though the two-state solution requires thorough scrutiny and resurrection, some see this as an attempt to deflect global attention from the Gaza horror, which has killed more than 25,000 people; 70 percent of them being women and children. Whether this horror is gross genocide will be known today when the International Court of Justice delivers its provisional order.

### We must boost country’s income, transitioning to positive economic trajectory - President

President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday (Jan.25) underscored his commitment to guiding the country’s progress in the coming years, drawing inspiration from the success of Biyagama.

Reflecting on his early political career in the Biyagama Constituency, where the region experienced notable underdevelopment, the President emphasized the positive impact of strategic economic decisions, particularly the establishment of the Biyagama Investment Zone. He noted that Biyagama’s rapid progress stands as a testament to those decisions.

The Head of State underscored his vision for replicating such success nationwide by leveraging the advantages of an open economy.

He expressed plans to establish new investment zones across the country, with the aim of significantly boosting the national economy.

Recalling his recent visit to Switzerland, President Wickremesinghe said world leaders were amazed to hear how rapidly Sri Lanka has turned itself around and how its once-bankrupt economy has rebounded.

### Plans, Teams & Mis-Steps

*2024-01-25 22:22:24* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/plans-teams-mis-steps/) · `en`

There is much hope placed on direct foreign investments (FDI) and tourism, as the sectors most likely to help hoist us out of our current financial mess. Are they properly thought out plans, mere fantasies, deceptions or added follies? It is wise for us to frankly and rigorously examine and recognize possible perils or false expectations ourselves, rather than leave it for  others to do so. Confidence lost, is not easily regained. All geese cannot pose as swans.

Foreign investors are not Santa Claus’s in disguise. They are hard-headed business experts, looking for opportunities to maximize returns for their clients and profits for themselves. This is quite legitimate, and it is naïve to think otherwise. They are certainly not here for our good. Not ‘altruism’, but ‘profit’ is the name of the game. Who can blame them, seeking rules that are fair and promises that are honoured? To think otherwise is stupid.

Batticaloa, a historically significant place in Sri Lanka, served as the backdrop for his message that transcends political boundaries and holds relevance not only for the nation but also for global political dynamics.

Amidst discussions about Patali’s political affiliations, his Batticaloa speech sheds light on his character and philosophy. *”Acknowledging past mistakes and expressing a commitment to move forward, Patali emphasized the importance of letting go of historical grievances”.*

His words echo a universal truth – dwelling on past pains, anger, and conflicts impedes progress. Instead, he advocates for forgiveness, urging society to collectively forge ahead.

### Meet The Brothers Size In A Local Backyard

*2024-01-25 21:38:05* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/meet-the-brothers-size-in-a-local-backyard/) · `en`

The Sinhala language production of The Brothers Size, premiered in December 2023, in a Kumbukgahaduwa backyard. Directed by Prasanna Mahagamage, it was enacted by Hiran Abeysekera, Danushka Dias, and Chamara Gamaathige.

This Sinhala production was one-of-a-kind, in multiple ways. It was a collective translation from English to Sinhala by the director and actors. The open theatre space called LOVEARTLOVE was an unconventional, unknown, residential space, away from the city centre and other familiar theatre locations. The play itself had an ambiguous English title transliterated in Sinhala. The e-flyer announcing the play, displaying an architectural drawing, announced irregular seating, and possibly standing spaces for the audience. A mysterious charm, amidst risk-taking. Was the focus more on entertainment, and coming together with ‘sexy theatre lovers’, and ‘BYOB… clinking glasses’ later, than a theatre enactment?

The United States remains concerned about the potential impact of Sri Lanka’s newly passed Online Safety Bill, Ambassador Julie Chung said on Thursday (Jan.25).

Taking to X (formerly Twitter), the US envoy in Colombo expressed dismay at passing the legislation in the parliament by majority vote without incorporating important input from key stakeholders, including civil society and tech companies.

The new law has come under fire for the problematic aspects of several clauses of the Bill, which threaten the freedom of expression, innovation and privacy.

Chung emphasized that the ‘vague and overly restrictive’ Online Safety Bill can hinder investment and development of a digital economy, undermining Sri Lanka’s much-needed economic growth.

On that account, the United States has urged the Sri Lankan authorities to prioritize transparency and ensure any legislation does not stifle the voices of its people.

### Judge proposes Spain’s Luis Rubiales face trial over Hermoso World Cup kiss

Spain, Jan 25 (BBC) - A Spanish judge has proposed that former football federation president Luis Rubiales should stand trial over the women's World Cup kiss involving captain Jenni Hermoso.

Mr Rubiales grabbed Ms Hermoso's head and kissed her during the presentation after Spain's victory in Australia.

She said the kiss was "not consensual", a statement denied by Mr Rubiales.

A judge has found there is enough evidence for the matter to proceed to trial.

During a hearing at the Audencia Nacional, or High Court, in Madrid, the judge described the kiss as "not consensual and... a unilateral and surprising initiative".

Prosecutors previously charged Mr Rubiales with sexual assault and coercion.

Penalties for such a kiss range from a fine to four years in prison.

The incident has involved several Spanish football executives including Ms Hermoso's former coach, a former marketing manager and the sports director of the men's team.
