It also makes the lords and ladies who run these establishments philanthropists for keeping over a hundred idle women on their payroll!

The police spokesman went on to add that raids were carried out on information¬† received from police intelligence reports.

A Filipino villager has been nailed to a wooden cross for the 35th time to reenact Jesus Christ‚Äôs suffering in a brutal Good Friday tradition he said he would devote to pray for peace in Ukraine, Gaza and the disputed South China Sea.

On Friday, over a hundred people watched on as 10 devotees were nailed to wooden crosses, among them Ruben Enaje, a 63-year-old carpenter and sign painter. The real-life crucifixions have become an annual religious spectacle that draws tourists in three rural communities in Pampanga province, north of Manila.

The gory ritual resumed last year after a three-year pause due to the coronavirus pandemic. It has turned Enaje into a village celebrity for his role as the ‚ÄúChrist‚Äù in the Lenten reenactment of the Way of the Cross.

Around 20,000 Filipino and foreign tourists flocked to San Pedro Cutud village in Pampanga province to witness this annual display of devotion, which the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines frowns upon.

Actors dressed as Roman soldiers whipped devotees carrying crosses and hammered three-inch nails through the hands and feet of three people led by Ruben Enaje, 63, who was crucified for the 35th time.

‚ÄúWhile I was walking, all I was thinking about was how Jesus felt while he was carrying his cross up until he was crucified,‚Äù Enaje told reporters. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell for how long I can do this since my body is also getting old.‚Äù

Seven more Filipinos were nailed to crosses in other villages in Pampanga.

### Rewriting Sri Lanka History Based On Scientific Findings

Mahawamsa which was first written by Bhikku Mahanama, has documented the history of Sri Lanka since the 3rd century CE. Though the record has been accepted as correct in most instances, there were discrepancies in para-history and protohistory. The concept of origin of Sinhala race as a result of union of a male lion with female human which is not biologically possible, is not acceptable. Also, the narrative regarding Lord Buddha making three unaided flying visits to Sri Lanka which is not feasible, is not tenable. This makes the early part of Mahavamsa text prone to be challenged. As for protohistory, Mahawamsa is largely silent. It does not say about the people who inhabited the land and their civilisation. Modern advances have exposed data contrary to entrenched beliefs.

### Cocoa prices rise to fresh records: Will we run out of chocolate?

Cocoa prices briefly surged to all-time highs on Tuesday, touching over $10,000 (‚Ç¨9,234.3) per ton, before settling back at $9,622 per ton on Wednesday morning, following disappointing harvests in key cocoa-producing countries such as Ghana and Ivory Coast. Cameroon, another cocoa-producing nation, has also been seeing much of the same conditions.

The crop also saw a 19.8% gain in the past week, as well as a 42.4% rise this month. In the past year, cocoa prices have jumped about 231%.

Cocoa is widely used in a number of chocolate products and confectioneries, with by-products such as cocoa nibs, cocoa butter, cocoa pod husks and pulp also being used for soft drinks, alcohol, vinegar, cosmetics, health supplements, fragrances and more.

However, due to chocolate being by far the most common cocoa product, the rising cocoa prices have led to more worries about higher chocolate prices, as well as a chocolate shortage.

When we elect people's representatives, they must be able to implement the pure politics.

The 13th Amendment should be implemented in a way that needs a full permanent solution to the national ethnic problem.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì In South Asia, women face similar hurdles when breaking into the male-dominated political arena, a webinar on Empowering Voices: Exploring the Political Landscape for Women in South Asia heard.

Across the region, more often than not, women are nominated to fill a seat falling vacant by the death of a male family member, as the party leadership made up of men is confident of winning on the ‚Äòsympathy vote,‚Äô or simply to fill a quota, and not for their qualifications and capabilities.

In Sri Lanka, despite a hard-won battle for a 25 per cent quota for women at the Local Government level six years ago, the drive to have more women at decision making levels continues. It is yet to be seen if the new electoral system at the provincial level will yield the results women seek. Representation of women in the Sri Lankan Parliament is a dismal 5.3 per cent (only 12 of the 225 MPs are women), Dr Sudharshani Fernandopulle, MP pointed out.

### Bunker demand surges in Sri Lankan ports as India grapples with supply shortages
