In Ratnapura, a shocking incident occurred at Thumbara Estate, where plantation workers were assaulted by management. Despite efforts from trade unions and political parties, solutions remain elusive. The victim, Suresh, and his wife, Kalachelvi, faced further intimidation after reporting the attack. Political leaders and civil groups condemned the incident, but the perpetrators were released on bail. This case highlights ongoing issues of worker exploitation and the lack of effective protection in Sri Lanka's plantation sector.

Trade unions and upcountry political parties are unable to provide permanent solutions to the worst attacks by plantation workers by plantation management.. Upcountry politicians feel that their duties are over and their duties are over.

The incident took place on the 6th of this month at the Thumbara Estate belonging to the Ratnapura Kiriyalla Police Division. The garden's worker and his assistants were shocked by the fact that the plantation manager and his assistants attacked the garden. Even in the twentieth century, there is no need for an example of the fact that plantation workers are being treated as clusters.

North Polar nations' failure to fund climate disaster prevention was highlighted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the World Water Summit in Bali. He urged taxing global tax evasion profits to fund climate efforts, emphasizing the interconnectedness of climate change and water crises.

üü©

President Ranil Wickremesinghe pointed out that the Global North Polar Nations, which are ready to finance the life -threatening of Ukraine, will withdraw funds to prevent the destruction of the climate.

The President stressed this on Monday (20) at the top session of the 10th World Water Summit at the Bali International Conference Hall in Indonesia.

The president also stressed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtaxing a 10% tax on the climate change fund, as the annual profit of global tax evasion assets is estimated at US $ 1.4 trillion.

The World Water Summit began on May 18 under the theme of "Water for Public Prostacy" in Bali, Indonesia. The conference was held to unite the leaders, experts, academics, entrepreneurs and policymakers.

### Growing disconnect of political elite and the President‚Äôs shrinking political options

*2024-05-21 02:44:37* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Growing-disconnect-of-political-elite-and-the-President-s-shrinking-political-options/4-762049) ¬∑ `en`

The present moment in Sri Lankan politics is one where the campaign strategies of the major political parties appear to be shifting to a new phase. As the possibility of elections gets higher, encounters among different political factions are entering a more intensified phase of confrontation. With the gears shifting, there appears to be little political movement and considerable ambiguity, which translates into voter confusion.

However, a deeper scrutiny of recent political events are indicative of three main tectonic shifts in the political landscape: excessive exercise of power by the establishment elite, the President‚Äôs increasingly shrinking political options with the Rajapaksas signalling possible departure, and the National People‚Äôs Power‚Äôs (NPP) mobilising a series of trade union strikes.

One of the most unpardonable deeds was to destroy a profit-making SriLankan Airline with a track record of accident-free flying. True it was CBK who successfully negotiated and brought in Emirates as a partner. The airline was running profitably with a foreign national as its head when MR assumed office as President.

### One more in the long line of rejections

The Sunday Times on 19 May carried the Foreign Ministry‚Äôs reactions on the OHCHR report on ‚Äòenforced disappearances‚Äô in Sri Lanka (https://www.sundaytimes.lk/240519/news/lanka-strongly-rejects-un-report-questions-its-mandate-and-timing-557860.html). It says Sri Lanka is rejecting the report.

This may be one more in the long line of rejections since the days of Gotabaya Presidency.

Interestingly, questions have been raised about the authority or mandate of the High Commissioner to issue such a report. But in their heady rush to reject the report, they may not have consulted important resolutions including the UNGA resolution establishing the post of High Commissioner.

These resolutions particularly stress the importance of the role of the High Commissioner as the voice of humanity on gross or grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Nevertheless, how the High Commissioner should express that voice and what format or method should be followed is left open.

The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has applied for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas‚Äôs leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, for war crimes.

Karim Khan KC said there were reasonable grounds to believe that both men bore criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity from the day of Hamas‚Äôs attack on Israel on 7 October onwards.

Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas‚Äôs political leader Ismail Haniyeh, along with the group‚Äôs military chief Mohammed Deif, are also wanted for arrest.

ICC judges will now decide whether they believe the evidence is sufficient to issue arrest warrants - something which could take weeks or months.

Chiefly YouTube, has emerged as the main mode of political communication overshadowing the traditional or ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù electronic media

The 2024 Indian parliamentary elections will be remembered for many reasons. They are the longest to date, stretching from April 19 to June 1.

They are taking place in the midst of acute unemployment, skyrocketing prices and lack of demand in the market.

An unprecedented amount of money is being spent amidst corruption charges.¬† Divisive issues of caste, religion and region are being racked up. Sex scandals are sullying the reputations of some of the high and mighty.

But in the midst of the darkness, there is a silver lining. Social media platforms, chiefly YouTube, have emerged as the main mode of political communication, overshadowing the traditional or ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù electronic media.

### Elections must be decided only by law - EDITORIAL

The elections in Sri Lanka are said to be conducted in a free and fair manner and according to the law. However, some laws have been promulgated in a manner that ruling parties can manipulate the law in their favour.

The Sri Lankan Constitution states ‚ÄúThe President of the Republic shall be elected by the people and shall hold office for a term of five years.‚Äù It again says ‚ÄúThe poll for the election of the President shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office.‚Äù

Accordingly, the Election Commission (EC) on May 9 announced that the Presidential polls will be held between September 17 and October 16, this year. The Commission‚Äôs announcement was based on the country‚Äôs law and hence election could not be held before that period or postponed for a date after it.

(AP) ‚Äî The chief prosecutor of the world‚Äôs top war crimes court said Monday he is seeking arrest warrants for leaders of Israel and Hamas, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over actions taken during their seven-month war.

While Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, do not face imminent arrest, the announcement by the International Criminal Court‚Äôs chief prosecutor was a symbolic blow that deepened Israel‚Äôs isolation over the war in Gaza.

The court‚Äôs prosecutor, Karim Khan, accused Netanyahu, Gallant, and three Hamas leaders ‚Äî Yehia Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh ‚Äî of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel.

Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders condemned the move as disgraceful and antisemitic. U.S. President Joe Biden also lambasted the prosecutor and supported Israel‚Äôs right to defend itself against Hamas.

During the final moments of Sri Lanka's internal conflict, children from families who surrendered to the military faced unknown fates. The UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights, Agnes Callamard, questioned what happened to them. This inquiry marks a significant moment as it occurred towards the end of Sri Lanka's Civil War. The year also sees parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka, crucial for determining the country's future direction and human rights protection. It's been 15 years since the war ended, and this visit aims to assess the human rights situation and explore how to uphold justice for victims. The resilience and determination of the survivors have deeply impacted, highlighting the need for every Sri Lankan to contribute to erasing this dark chapter.

### The Beautiful Terrible Signs: The Ongoing Saga Of Rheumatic Heart Disease

Every physician likely recalls an unforgettable moment from his or her clinical rotation as a medical student that profoundly impacted him or her, leaving an indelible mark. For me it was the encounter with a patient suffering from Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis in India. In fact, it was the presence of my larger-than-life clinical professor that made the moment even more memorable. His mesmerizing descriptions of the clinical signs, such as ‚Äúopening snap,‚Äù ‚Äúrumbling mid-diastolic murmur,‚Äù and ‚Äúpresystolic accentuation,‚Äù along with precise timing between the second heart sound and the opening snap, had elevated the experience to another level. However, amidst my fascination, I must confess, I had failed to recognize the true gravity of these signs‚Äîtheir reflection of extreme suffering on the part of the patient. It never even once occurred to me then that these captivating signs were, in fact, manifestations of medical failure, the root cause behind them.

‚ÄúAdditionally, there is the monetary policy review due next Tuesday so not a lot of buying interest overall.‚Äù

Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and seven others have been further remanded until June 03 by the Maligakanda Magistrate‚Äôs Court.

They are facing charges related to the import of substandard human immunoglobulin vials.

This order was issued when the relevant case was taken up before the Maligakanda Magistrate‚Äôs Court today (20).

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested.

The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker.

Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail.
