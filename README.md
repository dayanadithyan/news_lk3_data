*2024-07-15 16:39:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/188525) ¬∑ `ta`

Intellectuals in Sri Lanka call on the National People's Power to resolve the country's ethnic issue with a solution that gains northern majority trust, echoing the missed opportunity in 1947. They stress the importance of uniting leftist forces against racism and neo-liberalism, referencing the 1947 election where the LSSP could've won but didn't due to internal divisions. The plea is for the National People's Power to learn from past mistakes and lead effectively in 2024 elections, prioritizing a practical and widely accepted solution to the ethnic conflict.

üü©

A group of intellectuals and educators in Sri Lanka have appealed to the national people's power to come up with a solution that all ethnicities can accept to the ethnic problem of Sri Lanka.

The committee has also appealed to it to be a practical solution that can gain the confidence of the majority of the North.

The National People's Power is the main movement of the people's aspirations that emerged through the people's struggle in 2022.

This situation was similar to the situation that was seen during the 1947 Ceylon's first national election - we missed a precious opportunity.

Therefore, we urge you to win the forthcoming election and to address the national issues, including the ethnic problem that continues to create severe disagreements in the Sri Lankan community.

The unity of the people by uniting all the left -wing forces against racism and neo -liberation.

### The latest condition of children who were allergic to drugs

*2024-07-15 15:56:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/198838) ¬∑ `si`

Children admitted to Minnetale Hospital for drug allergies underwent investigations related to their condition. Twelve children affected by drug allergies were transferred to Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. The allergy was caused by two types of medications administered for vomiting and abdominal pain. Children aged 5-11 years were hospitalized due to this condition. All children have now received treatment and been discharged from the hospital after being monitored for 24 hours without any adverse effects. The director suspects environmental changes could also cause similar allergies. Some patients refused vasoconstrictor administration due to fear, but no one should be unnecessarily scared; efforts are made to administer vasoconstrictors as needed.

### FR petition filed over Presidential Election dismissed with costs

The Supreme Court has dismissed the Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed seeking an order to prevent holding of the Presidential Election as the 19th Amendment to the Constitution has not been properly passed in Parliament, subject to costs.

This verdict was issued when the relevant petition filed by Attorney-at-Law Aruna Laksiri was taken up for cosideration today (15) before a Supreme Court judge bench comprising Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, Justices Arjuna Obeysekara and Priyantha Fernando.

Accordingly, the court ordered the petition dismissed with costs of Rs 500,000 to be paid by the petitioner before July 31, 2024.

The petition argued that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was not properly passed in Parliament and therefore called for a referendum to ensure its proper passage.

The Election Commission and its members, the General Secretary of Parliament and the Attorney General had been named as respondents of this petition.

The High Court directed the Tamil Nadu government to respond to a petition investigating events surrounding Jayalalithaa's hospitalization due to ill health. The court's intervention was sought due to numerous discrepancies in the events that occurred during her stay at Apollo Hospital in Chennai. A request was made for a CBI investigation under the direct supervision of the High Court, following a petition filed by a member and lawyer of the AIADMK party. Despite recommendations from the Arumugasamy committee to investigate suspicions about Jayalalithaa's death, no action was taken based on the report. Additionally, there were allegations that incorrect information was disseminated regarding Jayalalithaa's body before her death announcement and that the hospital administration was criticized for this.

This initiative aims to boost tourism, which saw a 35% increase in arrivals, earning $24 billion in 2023, with projections indicating significant growth from Chinese, Malaysian, and Indian tourists by 2024.

### Sir Ponnambalan Ramanathan¬† (1851- 1930): The First Member for Ceylon

*2024-07-15 11:08:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sir-ponnambalan-ramanathan-1851-1930-the-first-member-for-ceylon/) ¬∑ `en`

In 1911 Sir Ponnambalan Ramanathan was elected to the educated Ceylonese seat in the Legislative Council at the age of sixty. The seat was so named because, even as late as 1910, the Governor did not think that Ceylonese in general were fit to exercise the vote. Ramanathan was elected to the seat largely by the votes of the Sinhalese. Admittedly, he was a brilliant speaker and had held the high office of Solicitor-General. He defeated Sir Marcus Fernando, a distinguished physician and a man of rare ability in many fields.

The 125th Anniversary of the birth of Ramanathan will fall on Friday April 16, 1976. As a young man he was a hard-working lawyer who was nominated a member of the Legislative Council at the age of 28 to succeed his uncle Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy as the ‚ÄòTamil member‚Äô. He had to give up his seat when he was appointed Solicitor-General.

In Sri Lanka, there have been over 220 murders in the past two years, with 22 occurring in just one year. A former Deputy Inspector General of Police highlighted the issue, stating that preventing such crimes requires a dedicated minister overseeing crime investigations. He also mentioned the prevalence of illegal liquor in Dambulla, where six deaths occurred due to law-breaking alcohol consumption. The city's open bars operate for four hours daily, contributing to numerous murders that go unreported due to police incapability to handle them legally.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs central bank was a net seller in forex markets in June 2024, official data shows, data shows after a build-up of excess liquidity from dollar purchases up to May.

The central bank sold 57 million US dollars to banks in June and did not buy any dollars, data shows, after buying 224.5 million US dollars and selling 32 million dollars in May.

There was a build-up of excess liquidity up to 200 billion rupees after dollar purchases in April and May.

Sri Lanka operates a so-called flexible exchange rate, which analysts says is not backed by consistent policy.

When there is higher import demand, usually due a pick up in private or state enterprise credit or both, the flexible exchange rate slides triggering a confidence shock in both importers and exporters.

Importers try to cover early and exporters try to delay, when the exchange rate weakens.
