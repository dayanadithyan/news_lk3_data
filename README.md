(AP) тАФ Hunter Biden was convicted Tuesday of all three felony charges related to the purchase of a revolver in 2018 when, prosecutors argued, the presidentтАЩs son lied on a mandatory gun-purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.

Hunter Biden, 54, stared straight ahead and showed little emotion as the verdict was read after jury deliberations that lasted only three hours over two days in Wilmington, Delaware. He hugged his attorneys, smiled wanly and kissed his wife, Melissa, before leaving the courtroom with her.

President Joe Biden said in a statement issued shortly after the verdict that he would accept the outcome and тАЬcontinue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.тАЭ

Now Hunter Biden and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the presidentтАЩs chief political rival, have both been convicted by American jurors in an election year that has been as much about the courtroom as about campaign events and rallies.

CoPF Chairman Dr. Harsha de Silva instructs letter to be sent to Finance Minister urging immediate attention

Dr. de Silva instructed that a letter be sent to the Finance Minister, urging immediate attention to this issue.

### Navigating troubled waters: Indo-Lanka fishing dispute and quest for sustainable solution

The maritime dispute between India and Sri Lanka over illegal fishing by Tamil Nadu fishermen in Sri Lankan waters in the Palk Bay, the Gulf of Mannar, and the Palk Strait has reached a critical juncture. Recent incidents of Sri Lankan authorities detaining Indian fishermen for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) have reignited longstanding tensions. This article will attempt to delve into the heart of the conflict simmering for many decades, explore the environmental and socio-economic impacts, and highlight the need for an urgent resolution that respects the livelihoods and traditions of Sri Lankan fishing communities in the northern, north-western, and north-eastern parts of the island while ensuring marine conservation.

### Could you believe crabs killing giant guitarfish?

*2024-06-12 01:16:58* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Could-you-believe-crabs-killing-giant-guitarfish/14-762951) ┬╖ `en`

Guitarfish, also known as shovelnose rays, are a species of ray that are named because of their guitar-shaped bodies. They belong to the order Rhinopristiformes, along with the wedgefish and sawfish. This group are also called shark-like rays due to their flattened body with pectoral fins fused to the sides of the head and a hind body that resembles a shark, with two dorsal fins and a caudal fin.

The Rhinopristiformes exhibit slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity, like many other rays and sharks. Such characteristics, alone or in combination, make fishes in this group vulnerable to extinction. The global IUCN Red List of threatened species reveals that species in the order Rhinopristiformes are amongst the most threatened marine fishes and over 70% of guitarfish are either threatened or data deficient.

### The many faces of impunity

*2024-06-12 00:32:18* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-many-faces-of-impunity/4-762932) ┬╖ `en`

Such impunity is possible because an absolute majority of victims are the most discriminated against people in Sri Lanka: Upcountry Tamils

Ten years: that was how long three State institutions didnтАЩt pay EPF and ETF monies to their retired and deceased employees.

Most victims of this act of criminal injustice suffered and died in silence. A few (about 2,000) filed court cases. The larger society, including the media, political parties and the labour movement, didnтАЩt know, didnтАЩt care.

This injustice happened in the only place it could have been perpetrated with legal, political, and societal impunity: the plantation sector. The culprits were the three State-owned plantation companies. The excuse was that these companies made losses. How many state-owned enterprises make profits? Do the loss-making ones (which include CEB, CPC, and Air Lanka) deny their employees EPF and ETF payments? What would happen if they even tried?

After two defeats to South Africa and Bangladesh, Sri Lanka are in must-win territory. They need victories against Nepal and the Netherlands, and also rely on at least one of those teams to beat Bangladesh to keep their hopes alive.

Speaking at an event on Monday June 10, Handunneththi said NPP representatives that met International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials had asked for time to resolve a number of issues faced by the public.

тАЬThere are three hatcheries established in Jaffna peninsula. Very soon we will establish in the other areas,тАЭ Devananda told reporters on Tuesday.

тАЬThey are like black gold,тАЭ Devananda said. There are тАЬa lot of farms, especially in the Northern Province. We are getting foreign exchange too.тАЭ

The invertebrate found on the sea floor is not commonly consumed by Sri Lankans, so they are being exported to countries like China, Devananda said.

тАЬSea cucumber, especially our people, they are not eating, it is in China, they are eating.тАЭ

Last year the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources told EconomyNext that a kilo of sea cucumber is valued at 20,000-30,000 rupees.

The speaker criticized the government's lack of a two-thirds majority in parliament, suggesting that the election commission holds the power to set the election date, which is expected to occur within a specific timeframe.

He was speaking at a media briefing held at the Colombo Opposition Office today (11), he added:

"These days, the government is on the side of the government to go on the side of the government to extend the term of the president in a year. We obviously should say the President had six years after the 1977. But in 2015, the government's term of the President has been reduced to 5 years as per the 19th Amendment. The 19th Amendment was not attended by Maithripala Sirisena's presidency at the time. He was released at 6 years. After five, he was able to stay 5 years old when I was five. Accordingly, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa becomes the President for five years.
