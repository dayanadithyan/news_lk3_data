### Apologetic Marxists:  Yanis Varoufakis and Techno-Feudalism

*2024-02-12 03:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Apologetic-Marxists-Yanis-Varoufakis-and-Techno-Feudalism/172-276783) · `en`

In 2015, Yanis Varoufakis was appointed Finance Minister of Greece by socialist Premier, Alexis Tsipras. The Euro debt crisis crippled Greece six months later, giving the once popular Premier the stark choice of a painful IMF bailout or being forced to quit the EU and facing economic and diplomatic isolation.

An academic and Marxist by orientation, Varoufakis vehemently opposed the IMF route, insisting on finding a solution locally. Initially, Premier Tsipras backed him, but opposition was overwhelming and he was forced to back down and opt for IMF.

Varoufakis quit in protest. Unlike in Sri Lanka, he didn’t join the opposition or try to exploit the vacuum for personal gain. A former academic who foresaw the banking crisis of 2008, he began writing provocative and insightful books analyzing how and where the world order went wrong. Today, he is hailed as one of the most radical, daring and innovative thinkers around.

### An Election’s A Brewing, Will We See JVP Policy Changes? - EDITORIAL

*2024-02-12 02:59:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/An-Elections-A-Brewing-Will-We-See-JVP-Policy-Changes-EDITORIAL/172-276782) · `en`

India’s invitation to the JVP/NPP and its leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake – popularly known as AKD – has made political watchers put on their thinking caps. Many seem to believe the Indian action indicates its belief that the JVP/NPP combine is in a position to capture power at the next General Election or even at the Presidential Poll.

The reality however is, that it is customary for the Indian government to extend such invitations to major political players of nations in its neighbourhood.

What is almost vulgar however is that some of our major political parties have gone a running to ask India to extend similar invitations to them as well!

### Generals & General Elections: Retired Military Officers in the Politics of SJB and JVP

*2024-02-12 02:50:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Generals-General-Elections-Retired-Military-Officers-in-the-Politics-of-SJB-and-JVP/172-276780) · `en`

“The follower is always far behind the winner” emphasizes the idea that those who follow, copy or imitate are usually not as successful or accomplished as the original trailblazer. This sentiment suggests that true success often comes from innovation, leadership, and being at the forefront of progress, rather than simply mimicking the actions of others.

When faced with the opportunity to assume leadership in government, Sajith Premadasa exhibited a hesitant approach. His initial reluctance to take over the reins became evident, creating a perception of indecisiveness. In contrast, when Ranil Wickremesinghe appeared poised to accept the responsibility, Sajith swiftly changed course, making a hurried message to the President’s House. However, his attempt was futile as he arrived too late to alter the unfolding events.

### Democracy and elections are the paradigm of Pakistan

The third case is interesting. The two were sentenced to seven years in prison in the case of a lawsuit filed by Imran and his wife, because it was wrong for the Islamic man to marry.

On the other hand, the court, which sentenced Imran to imprisonment, removed the sentence of Nawaz Sharif, who had been convicted of the Panama Papers corruption affair.

Nawaz Sharif cannot be involved in politics throughout the life span. The coalition government led by the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistan Muslim League, which toppled Imran from the regime, passed a law that would lead to a political disqualification of a politically disqualified law and created a situation where Nawaz Sharif could contest the election.

The Chinese media has also noted that New Delhi's narrow attitudes and visionary vision in dealing with China and its neighbors.

It must be remembered that those in New Delhi, who consider the Indian Ocean as the influence of India, is not a personal property, even if the public area outside the door of one's door is not a personal property. ”Also pointed out.

What China is trying to say to India through this is that the entire Indian Ocean is not belonging to India.

Therefore, the editorial of the Chinese Daily seeks to make New Delhi's editorial to New Delhi that it is not easy to close the doors in the Indian Ocean for Chinese research ships.

Another trick was that when Mahinda and Ranil clashed, Ranil Wickremesinghe's victory was prevented by boycotting the election.

These two tricks have been handled by the Tamil side in the past. It is important to note that CV Wigneswaran suddenly depends on Ranil, as the Tamil party is not going to decide what kind of tactic the Tamil party is going to handle in the coming presidential election.

Ranil is the one who can handle all the ways to defeat his enemy. Therefore, there is justification for the question of whether or trying to roll or divide the Tamil votes through Vigneswaran.

*2024-02-12 00:43:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/176142) · `ta`

"We have changed the world and politics after the time, so that we have changed," said Anuragumara Dissanayake, leader of the National People's Power and Member of Parliament.

He said that the country cannot function as a country, and we must go forward with the cooperation of all parties.

I had visited India on the official call of the Government of India. Sajith Premadasa, Mahinda Rajapaksa and Ranil Wickremesinghe have been confused about the Indian visit and have made several allegations.. We are not confused by the allegations.

At present, those who say that the opposition has nothing to do with us and them will be united when the official announcement of the election will be released.. As well as Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa, as in 2019.

### Sri Lankan rupee is more overvalued now than before the crisis

*2024-02-12 00:35:58* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lankan-rupee-is-more-overvalued-now-than-before-the-crisis/4-758346) · `en`

The value of the rupee will have to be at least partially restored if the country is to avoid stagnation and another currency crisis further down the road

One of the important issues that appears to have gone under the radar since the debt crisis of April 2022 is the overvaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee. This is in spite of the fact that many commentators argued that the overvaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee was an important contributor to the debt crisis (see CBSL, 2023; Athukorale and Wagle, 2023). To the extent that they pay any attention at all to the exchange rate, they argue that the sharp depreciation of the currency following the foreign debt default in April 2022 restored the competitiveness of the currency such that its value is presently “supportive of the country’s trade competitiveness” (CBSL, 2023, p. 194).

### Without a code of ethics and principles of morality, no meaning in social market economy

The prevention of the formation of monopolies is an important task of the Government under the social market economy ideals

Social market economy, or in other words ordoliberalism, is not a new ideal for either of the two warring parties in Sri Lanka. Wickremesinghe, when he sought political power in 2015, promised the electorate that he would establish an economic system based on the social market economy ideology once elected to power. He made a distinction in his social market economy ideology calling it a ‘highly competitive social market economy’. This addition was necessary to take care of the important role played by the export of goods and services in creating wealth for people

Family women have been badly affected by economic impact. The main problem with the mothers face is the main problem with the mothers.

The president can only refer to Parliament that we have recovered from the economic impact. He cannot mention among the people.

Can't expect better progress from those who have dumped the country to bankruptcy. This year will be decisive for those who have degraded the country.

During his stay in Israel, he came to know the plaintiff and the two developed an intimate relationship over a period of time. In April 2021, he was extradited to Sri Lanka, but later that year offered the plaintiff to bring her daughter to Israel illegally for 20,000 shekel.

The final results in Pakistan’s general election have put independent candidates backed by jailed ex-PM Imran Khan’s PTI party in the lead.

Independents won 101 of the National Assembly seats. BBC analysis shows 93 of them went to PTI-backed candidates.

That puts them ahead of ex-PM Nawaz Sharif’s PMLN who won 75 and it is unclear who will form a government.

As wrangling continues, independent candidates who did not win have flooded courts with vote-rigging allegations.

Both the PTI, which was blocked from taking part in the election, and Mr Sharif’s PMLN say they want to form the next government.

The result was a surprise as most observers had expected Mr Sharif’s party - widely seen as having the powerful military’s backing - to win, given Mr Khan had been jailed on charges ranging from corruption to having married illegally and his party was barred from the ballot sheet.
