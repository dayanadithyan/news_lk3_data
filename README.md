### There is no one who can get fifty percent of the presidential election - CV Wigneswaran

CV Wigneswaran, leader of the Tamil People's National Alliance, expressed concern over potential post-election riots due to the lack of a clear winner among Sinhala candidates, hinting at a divided electorate. He highlighted the competitive nature among Ranil, Sajith, and Anura, suggesting their parties could face significant losses, especially to the JVP. Wigneswaran predicted support for Ranil but noted potential shifts in alliances and voter sentiments.

CV Wigneswaran, the leader of the Tamil People's National Alliance and Member of Parliament, said that after the presidential election, riots erupted in the country.

He said this during a media briefing held in Jaffna on Wednesday (31).

I have a compassion for the country now. That is, there is a situation where riots may erupt after the election. There is no one who can get fifty percent of the Sinhala candidates.

But although many people say they are contesting in the election, Ranil, Sajith and Anura are the three war.

What kind of competition is going to happen between the three.If you ask what the party's role in this election is, I think that the party will be completely destroyed if an election comes back.

That is, it is my opinion that all their seats in the south will go to the JVP party.Their betrayal of this country is in the mind.

They have been raging in this country in particular, and they have raised themselves because of the war war.All of these are well known now.

He promises changes in the United People's Power regime to address these concerns.

Providing concessions to the importer and the burden to the national manufacturer must change the conditions.Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said that if the current government does not change this position, we will change it in the United People's Power regime.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said this while addressing a discussion with traditional coconut oil producers on Wednesday (31).

Although a government policy that contains double policies that protect the manufacturer and consumers is required, today, the government's unreasonable policy is very unreasonable to impose an 18 percent tax on the domestic manufacturer and remove the tax on the imported coconut oil manufacturer and protect a few.

Although the five -star hostels will be given the right place to the national manufacturers, the national manufacturers and the producers have not been encouraged and supported.

The Colombo Consumer Price Index fell 0.5 index points to 194.7 points in the month of July. The index is now slightly below the level seen in December 2023.

The central bank has generally kept the exchange rate stable, while collecting reserves and reducing its domestic assets to run deflationary policy. Exchange rate became volatile after a build up excess liquidity from dollar purchases in June.

The food and non-alcoholic beverage sub-index rose 0.1 percent in July after rising 2.8 percent a month earlier. The housing and electricity index fell 1.5 percent to 142.9 points.

Speaking at a media brief in the Health Promotion Bureau, Dr. Ananda Jayalal made this observation.

"Usually a meal is mainly intended to withstand disease, nutrition and disease. We calls drugs that heal diseases. Food cannot treat sickness. If anyone can heal any disease, you must really have permission from the main food authority. We see the names of various institutions, especially social media, especially the food is good for cancer. That propaganda often is wrong. A meal cannot be advertised that you can often heal a disease. If so, formal clinical data should be submitted to the Ministry of Health Ministry authority. It is illegal to do that. "
