### Politics and the Plantation Wage

*2024-07-01 11:00:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/politics-and-the-plantation-wage/) ┬╖ `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe chose the Ceylon WorkersтАЩ Congress May Day platform, in Kotagala, to announce the increase of the plantation workersтАЩ daily wage to Rs 1,700.00. An unexpected presidential fiat, delivered just a few months before a possible election by a potential presidential candidate, was made public from the political platform of a major plantation trade union, generally seen as pro-government. The self-evident political implications do not merit either debate or elaboration.

In a rational world, in any industry, the employer and the employee should arrive at a fair wage through a consultative process. The unsolicited intervention of a third force with an agenda unrelated to the interests of either party, is undesirable from all points of view. Still, there are precedents, when sitting presidents have mandated wage increases in the plantation sector, for patently political reasons, ignoring the possible toxic economic consequences.

R. Sampanthan, a key figure in Sri Lanka's Tamil National Alliance, passed away, leaving a significant void in Tamil politics. Known for his dedication to public service over a legal career, Sampanthan's diplomatic efforts were pivotal in the Tamil community's struggles. His loss is deeply felt, especially in the Trincomalee district, where he represented Tamil interests. A unifying force within the party system, his absence marks the end of an era in Tamil political history. Condolences pour in for his family, friends, and supporters, with prayers for his soul.

Former leader of the Sri Lanka Tamil National Alliance (TNA), Tamil National Alliance leader, former opposition leader and Trincomalee district parliamentarian R. Sampanthan's death. Parliamentarian

The loss of Annar is a disaster for the Tamil national political area. He is a great man who sacrificed his legal career and engaged in people's politics.

It must be remembered at this moment that he used his political sort of politicalism and experience as diplomacy on many occasions during the three kinds of struggle of the Tamils.

His loss, which was the ultimate belief in the Tamil representation of the Trincomalee district, is not compensated.

He is the only one who coordinated the historic party and the federation of parties that traveled in different currents, and in all his enabled times, his personality would not be shattered.

Our race today has lost a long -term experience of the political history of Sri Lankan Tamils.

The table illustrates the accumulated foreign currency inflow gap for Sri Lanka over the past five years compared to 2018, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Easter Sunday attacks. To emerge from the current crisis, it is crucial to strengthen and expand these verticals. According to the table, Sri Lanka has experienced a loss of about $ 26 billion over the past five years, compared to if it had maintained the same inflow numbers as in 2018 each year.

The impact from tourism over the past five years amounts to approximately $ 13.9 billion. During this period, the industry was severely affected due to a global tourism slowdown. Consequently, we failed to maintain hotel standards even at their previous levels. This has resulted in poor conditions of the facilities, pressing room rates down compared to regional competitors.

### Imputed Rental Income Tax is an additional burden

Many owners of houses (that are somewhat small) located in Colombo have given these on rent and have moved to more spacious houses in the suburbs.

This they are compelled to do when family members increase when their children get married. The rent received from these houses is not enough to pay the rent for the relatively bigger house. Inevitably they have to pocket out an extra sum of money to bridge the difference.

With the proposed imputed rental income to be implemented in mid-next year, this will become an additional burden for the home owners who have given their houses for a smaller rent and paying a bigger amount for the occupation of a larger house. Hope the President will rescind the move to impose the тАЬImputed Rental IncomeтАЭ for the above reason.

### Complaint filed against SIS over COVID-19 forced cremations

Activist Chirantha Amerasinghe filed a complaint against the State Intelligence Service (SIS) over the controversial forced cremations of COVID-19 dead. Amerasinghe and several others filed the complaint at the Sri Lanka Police Headquarters on Saturday.

Speaking to the media, Amerasinghe said the mandatory cremation policy was imposed to target the Muslim community in an attempt to oppress them.

He noted that while the Easter Sunday attack mastermind Zahran Hashim at one point could not find followers for his cause, the various attacks against the Muslim community helped him recruit over 35 members at the time.

Amerasinghe claimed that the SIS had informed the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) that COVID-19 could spread through water contamination. Based on this SIS information, he said he was detained by the police in 2020 after he posted on social media that there was no evidence of negative impacts from burying COVID-19 victims.

### Land Right to Workers: Who is the obstacle?

*2024-07-01 03:42:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187346) ┬╖ `ta`

The obstacle to granting land rights to workers includes internal government delays, opposition from companies owning plantation lands, and lack of political pressure. Despite Cabinet approval, policy preparation and company consent delay implementation. Political alliances and promises unfulfilled contribute to the complexity.

ЁЯЯй

There are no political pressures to grant land rights to workers. Reports suggest that other parties, including the PA, should not implement this to Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena.. This is one of the reasons why the Ceylon Workers Congress broke the alliance with Mahinda Rajapaksa.

The government is being successfully implemented by the government's permanent land providing scheme.. President Ranil Wickremesinghe goes to the country and gives land to the people who have been enrolled under the scheme.. But under his leadership, the plantation workers submitted by three ministers in the Cabinet are allowed to grant land rights.

Despite the approval of the Cabinet, the plan to provide land rights to the plantation people is not immediately implemented because it takes time to prepare a policy plan document.. Although the document is currently being prepared, the companies and some political parties have expressed their opposition to the project.
