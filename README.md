### Australia doubles foreign student visa fee in migration crackdown

*2024-07-01 16:06:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100221/australia-doubles-foreign-student-visa-fee-in-migration-crackdown) ┬╖ `en`

Australia said on Monday it had more than doubled the visa fee for international students, the latest move by the government to rein in record migration that has intensified pressure on an already tight housing market.

From July 1, the international student visa fee has risen to A$1,600 ($1,068) from A$710, while visitor visa holders and students with temporary graduate visas are banned from applying onshore for a student visa.

тАЬThe changes coming into force today will help restore integrity to our international education system, and create a migration system which is fairer, smaller and better able to deliver for Australia,тАЭ Home Affairs Minister Clare OтАЩNeil said in a statement.

Official data released in March showed net immigration rose 60% to a record 548,800 people in the year to Sept. 30, 2023.

The Sri Lankan parliament has been represented as the voice of the Tamil people for a long time in about five decades of political history and has been the leader of the international community for the rights of the Tamil people.. Sambandan is seen.

It is no exaggeration if Annar acted for the benefit of the people of the country on the basis of ethnic unity, integrity and reconciliation. There is no doubt that the loss of such a great leader has caused the Tamil people to be politically void. The death of Annar is a disaster for the people of Sri Lanka.

### Politics and the Plantation Wage

*2024-07-01 11:00:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/politics-and-the-plantation-wage/) ┬╖ `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe chose the Ceylon WorkersтАЩ Congress May Day platform, in Kotagala, to announce the increase of the plantation workersтАЩ daily wage to Rs 1,700.00. An unexpected presidential fiat, delivered just a few months before a possible election by a potential presidential candidate, was made public from the political platform of a major plantation trade union, generally seen as pro-government. The self-evident political implications do not merit either debate or elaboration.

In a rational world, in any industry, the employer and the employee should arrive at a fair wage through a consultative process. The unsolicited intervention of a third force with an agenda unrelated to the interests of either party, is undesirable from all points of view. Still, there are precedents, when sitting presidents have mandated wage increases in the plantation sector, for patently political reasons, ignoring the possible toxic economic consequences.

The loss of Annar is a disaster for the Tamil national political area. He is a great man who sacrificed his legal career and engaged in people's politics.

It must be remembered at this moment that he used his political sort of politicalism and experience as diplomacy on many occasions during the three kinds of struggle of the Tamils.

His loss, which was the ultimate belief in the Tamil representation of the Trincomalee district, is not compensated.

He is the only one who coordinated the historic party and the federation of parties that traveled in different currents, and in all his enabled times, his personality would not be shattered.

Our race today has lost a long -term experience of the political history of Sri Lankan Tamils.
