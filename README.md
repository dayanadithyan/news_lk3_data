"Western purple-faced langurs face threats from deforestation, dog attacks, and vehicle accidents, leading to deaths and injuries. Despite being protected, they're now seen as pests in urban areas."

ЁЯЯй

A primary and ecological expert said that Western purple -faced lanters, also known as the purple -faced leaf monkey, have been forced to get caught up in dogs, people and vehicle accidents due to deforestation in the city surroundings.

A recent post on social media revealed that three purple faces were shot dead near the Talangama Lake and that two animals were injured.

Specialist Professor Wolfgang Titus spoke to the Daily Mirror: "Purple -faced Langur trees are living in the trees. He said that the removal of the trees would only come to the ground when their paths were blocked.

It is against this backdrop that people in urban areas now feel the purple -facing leankers as a harmful insect.

Western purple -faced Langur is a species protected under Section 30 of the Plants and Plants Protection Ordinance (FFPO).It is an internationally dangerous animal by IUCN.

*2024-03-19 10:39:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179089) ┬╖ `ta`

Purple-faced Langer Monkeys, found in Western countries, face risks from dogs, humans, and vehicles due to urban deforestation. Recently, three were shot dead near Talangama Lake, and two injured. They're protected under Section 30 of the FFPO, but their presence in urban areas is concerning.

ЁЯЯй

Purple -faced Langer Monkeys found in Western countries, also known as purple -leaf -shaped monkeys, have invaded residential areas in search of food and rest due to deforestation in urban areas.

As a result, the monkeys are in danger of facing the risk of dogs, humans and vehicles, said Professor Wolfkang Ditus, a Smithsonian's animal behavioral analyst and ecological expert.

Recently, it was reported on social media that three purple faces were shot dead near the Talangama Lake and two of them were injured.

Monkeys living in trees with purple leaf -shaped face.

In this situation, people in urban areas now count the purple leaf -shaped monkeys, like the ruins that cause destruction in plants.

Purple -faced Langur Monkeys found in Western countries are a species protected under Section 30 of the Plants and Animals Protection Authority (FFPO).

He said it was estimated by the International Union for Natural Protection (IUCN) that this is a nearby race.

### Explosive тАЩdevil cometтАЩ returns for 1st time in 71 years

*2024-03-19 10:38:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Explosive-devil-comet-returns-for-1st-time-in-71-years/108-279140) ┬╖ `en`

A rare and massive comet with a devilish nickname is set to pass by Earth for the first time in 71 years and may be visible during the highly anticipated April 8 total solar eclipse, according to NASA.

Officially named comet 12P/Pons-Brooks, the cryovolcanic comet is known as the "devil comet" due to its formation of two "horns" made up of ice and gas and periodic explosions.

Comets are made up of dust, frozen gases, ice and rocks bound together following the formation of the solar system, NASA says.

The devil comet is heading for its next perihelion passage, when it will reach its closest point to the sun and shine the brightest, on April 21, according to NASA. The agency says this astronomical event coincides with the April 8 total solar eclipse in North America, which will shadow parts of the United States from Texas to Maine when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth.

### To whom and to support the upcountry parties?

*2024-03-19 10:34:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179092) ┬╖ `ta`

The upcountry parties' role and support are a topic of debate. National parties are forming alliances, with the Tamil Progressive Alliance and Ceylon Workers Congress showing shifts in their political stances. The TNA has signed an agreement with Sajith, focusing on social justice and land rights, raising questions about the government's responsibilities. The CWC's support for President Wickremesinghe over the UNP indicates a shift in alliances. The TNA's demands, including housing, salaries, and land rights, highlight the government's obligations. The situation suggests a complex political landscape with shifting alliances and demands for social justice.

ЁЯЯй

Questions about whether the first to come to the parliamentary election or the presidential election is in the minds of the people of the country. National parties are busy creating alliances. The people of the country know that no coalition other than the national power of the people. This is why Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is avoiding joining anyone in his alliance, is on the verge of not joining with whom.

In this case, what is the point of the upcountry political parties. The Tamil Progressive Alliance, which is already a coalition, is working in favor of the Sajith -led United People's Power. The Ceylon Workers Congress initially supported the coalition of many parties called the PA. Now, it is directly supporting President Ranil Wickremesinghe. For that, the CWC cannot be assumed to support the United National Party.

Crisis and despair push us to learn rapidly and that is true of debt crisis as well. But whom do we learn from and whom do we work with to find solutions to the crisis?

The IMF team in all their pomp are again visiting Sri Lanka. Their tutelage continues to be the same for us as many other countries in debt distressтАФausterity, repaying creditors and promoting free markets.

*2024-03-19 01:40:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179081) ┬╖ `ta`

Patients at Batticaloa Teaching Hospital's Cancer Division accuse hospital of negligence due to frequent radiation machine breakdowns, forcing patients from Trincomalee, Ampara, and other areas to wait days for treatment.

Patients who went to the hospital for treatment at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital Cancer Division gathered in front of the hospital on Monday morning (18), accusing the hospital of the hospital.

It is customary for more patients to treat the disease from Trincomalee, Ampara and other parts of the country for the treatment of the hospital.

In this case, the radiation engine is often damaged and the person who is not here is unable to get treatment on the day since it is not here from Jaffna or Colombo.

As a result, the hospital has to go to the hospital in the morning and wait till night and get treated for the night.

Therefore, the machine should have been appointed here as the machine is often damaged and the patients have to wait until the engineer is dark or three days later.

Therefore, the hospital administration focused on this and obtained a solution to this.

Although there is growing public disillusionment with party politics in a democracy and a renewed cry for a different system of governance, the majority support for party politics remains

Whilst there has been no grave damage to Sri LankaтАЩs democracy, to date, because of the activities of political parties, there are tell-tale signs of the emergence of cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men who are using party power in testing the limits of the Constitution.

### Mitigating climate-related sovereign risk to accelerate action on the climate emergency

https://www.asiapathways-adbi.org: Climate change poses a serious threat to the development of countries and can have material impacts on sovereign risk. Sovereign risk refers to the probability that a country may not be able to pay its debts. However, since the global financial crisis, interactions between fiscal balances, public and private debt, and the financial sector have proven to be very complex. Sovereign risk reflects this complexity.

For example, the devastating floods in Pakistan in 2022 were caused by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains and faster melting of glaciers. They killed more than 1,700 people, left half a million homeless, and cost around $30 billion. The events led to MoodyтАЩs revising downward PakistanтАЩs sovereign credit rating by one notch, citing amplified liquidity and debt sustainability risks alongside falling foreign exchange reserves.

### Trump unable to get $464m bond in New York fraud case, his lawyers say

*2024-03-18 22:33:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/international/Trump-unable-to-get-464m-bond-in-New-York-fraud-case-his-lawyers-say/107-279090) ┬╖ `en`

New York, March 18 (BBC) - Donald Trump's lawyers have said finding a bond to cover the $464m (┬г365m) judgement in his New York fraud case is a "practical impossibility".

A judge ordered Mr Trump to pay the penalty in February for falsely inflating the value of his assets.

Mr Trump offered to post a smaller bond of $100m while he appeals, but that request was denied.

In a filing on Monday, his lawyers said they had approached 30 companies to back the bond without success.

"The amount of the judgement, with interest, exceeds $464m, and very few bonding companies will consider a bond of anything approaching that magnitude," his lawyers wrote in the nearly 5,000-page filing.

They are asking a judge to put the judgement on pause while Mr Trump appeals against the decision.

"The practical impossibility of obtaining a bond interferes with defendants' right to appeal," his lawyers said.

Mr Trump's two eldest sons also must pay millions of dollars in the case.

### Gunmen kidnap at least 87 in NigeriaтАЩs Kaduna state

Gunmen in Nigeria have kidnapped at least 87 people, including women and children in Kaduna state, residents and police said on Monday, in a fresh attack after an armed gang seized 286 students and staff from a school in early March.

Kidnappings by criminal gangs demanding ransom payments have become an almost daily occurrence in Nigeria, especially in the north, with authorities seemingly powerless to stop them.

Kaduna police spokesperson Mansur Hassan confirmed the incident in Kajuru Station village on Sunday night but could not give a figure of those missing. He said security agents had been deployed to try to rescue the villagers.

Tanko Wada Sarkin, a village head, said 87 people were taken.

тАЬWe have so far recorded the return of five people back home who fled through the bush. This attack makes it five times that these bandits are attacking this community,тАЭ he told Reuters by phone.
