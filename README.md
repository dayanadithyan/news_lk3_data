### Govt to introduce imputed rental income tax due to failure to implement property tax?

Wasantha Athukorala, a professor in the Department of Economics and Statistics at the University of Peradeniya, alleges that the government is working to introduce an imputed rental income tax, as the government failed to prepare plans for the implementation of a property tax by April 2025, as proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Furthermore, Prof. Athukorala expressed that if a property tax is implemented in the country, all ill-gotten gains will be exposed.

It was announced that Sri Lanka will likely introduce an imputed rental income tax, as part of the ongoing revenue mobilization efforts. The new tax comes as a substitute for the property tax, as the introduction of the property tax and the gift and inheritance tax by 2025 encountered delays, due to constitutional restrictions on sharing revenues between the central and local authorities and the lack of adequate information on property values.

### HOW NOT TO RUN AN ELECTION (1956)

*2024-06-16 11:29:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/how-not-to-run-an-election-1956/) ┬╖ `en`

As a Returning Officer, I played only second fiddle to the Government Agent, who was actually in charge of the Parliamentary Elections at the district level. However I was given definite duties: first, for staffing the polling booths with government staff officers; second, for supervising the actual process of elections in the polling booths; and third, for counting the ballots once the voting was done.

My first job was difficult because many Sinhalese officers in those days were reluctant to come so far to a Tamil-speaking district. This was long before the Tigers became the major political or military force in those districts. I was able to overcome this difficulty because some of my Sinhalese friends shared my interest in jungles and lagoons, and they were eager to come as polling officers to the Eastern Province. I had to officially get them to staff the polling booths; but unofficially, I had also to look after them and provide social activities for them.

### On demeaning Anura Kumara Dissanayake

*2024-06-16 11:27:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/on-demeaning-anura-kumara-dissanayake/) ┬╖ `en`

In Sri Lanka, Tamil politics took a dramatic turn this week when Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake visited members of the Tamil National Alliance. According to media reports, Premadasa has promised to implement the 13th Amendment, while Dissanayake has vowed to revisit issues like devolution and power sharing.

This is not as shocking a development as one may assume; far more shocking developments have taken place in Sri Lankan politics. Nor should it surprise anyone it is taking place months before a presidential election, arguably the most crucial in recent years, is to be held.

Both Premadasa and Dissanayake are veteran political stalwarts; both have been in active politics since the early 2000s. There is something cynical about the whole matter, but perhaps what is most cynical is that the TNA itself has accepted these visits and engaged with these delegations.
