“I am not someone who expected to get into politics, but throughout my university life, and afterwards, I supported various political parties and figures hoping for one thing, and that is the hope that they will, some day, make the country that we love, a better country. But, we were continuously, let down, so as a result, ultimately we decided that we ourselves would come and make that change. That is what we are here for,” he stated.

### An immensely changed world order

If I have said it once I have said it a dozen times: The global status quo is undergoing dramatic changes and the post-WW2 arrangements signified by the following markers are being transformed.

· The post-war economic boom and the welfare state are finished.

· China has become a powerful economy and will overtake America in about a decade

· The uncontested global hegemony of US Imperialism is winding down

· The hegemony of the US$ as the global reserve currency is fading

· The unipolar world of the last 50 or so years is changing into a multi-polar world

· The new economic alignment BRICS+ is assuming great importance

· The South China Sea has become a contested strategic sphere

· The Middle-East and Palestine/Israel have become a boiling cauldron

· Russia has become assertive and assumed a new strategic role

· The Global South is shedding the leadership of US Imperialism

I will discuss some of these points in my essay today and in my usual style keep it short.

### Dilmah and Sport: Making a tea and cricket connection and sponsoring Sri Lanka Cricket

Our Sri Lankan cricket team stunned the cricketing world when they won the One Day Cricket World Cup in 1996, defeating the more fancied Australian team in the final.

Whilst at that time, along with the rest of the country, I rejoiced in exploits of our cricketers, especially explosive batsmen like Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, the thought of associating Dilmah with cricket, or any other sport, had not occurred to me. Clearly, cricket had become the number one sport in Sri Lanka and one in which we could compete on equal terms with the best that the rest of the world could offer. Our World Cup victory proved that. So perhaps it did make sense to link that sport with Ceylon Tea, which is the island’s premier export and that which identifies this country globally.

### Sri Lanka sets 161-run target for Afghanistan in first T20I

Dambulla, Feb 17 (Daily Mirror) - In the inaugural T20I match at Dambulla today, Sri Lanka posted a challenging total of 160 runs for Afghanistan to chase down.

Despite early setbacks, skipper Wanindu Hasaranga's resilient innings of 67 runs provided a much-needed boost to the Sri Lankan innings.

Opting to bowl first after winning the toss, Afghanistan's decision seemed justified as they struck early, dismissing opener Pathum Nissanka cheaply.

Sri Lanka were four wickets down for just 55 runs when Hasaranga walked in.

Hasaranga's aggressive approach, featuring three sixes and seven boundaries, propelled Sri Lanka's total to a competitive score.

For Afghanistan, Fazalhaq Farooqi was the pick of the bowlers, picking up three wickets for 25 runs. Naveen-ul-Haq and Azmatullah Omarzai also chipped in with two wickets each.

Thousands of demonstrators have gathered in Senegal’s capital, Dakar, demanding swift presidential elections.

It comes after the country’s top court blocked President Macky Sall’s attempt to postpone the election, originally scheduled for this month.

Mr Sall’s last minute decree, backed by parliament, had triggered a political crisis in Senegal, once regarded as a bastion of democracy in West Africa.

On Saturday, opposition supporters held signs demanding a “Free Senegal”.

It is the first rally allowed by authorities since Mr Sall’s announcement two weeks ago.

“Today’s watchword is mobilisation,” said presidential candidate Malick Gakou on the march.

He told the AFP news agency there was “no room for error any longer” and elections must be organised in March in order for the handover of power between President Sall and his successor on 2 April - when the president’s second term in office is set to expire.

### Israel’s Gaza Campaign Is the Gravest Moral Crisis of Our Time

The crisis in Gaza shows those nations that should be defending international law and humanitarian values to be openly betraying their commitments.

I write this essay as a senior American Buddhist monk of Jewish ethnicity who has been deeply distressed by Israel’s military assault on the population of Gaza. I see this campaign as perhaps the gravest moral crisis of our time. The blistering bombardments, the ever-mounting death toll, the deadly blockade of vital essentials, the annihilation of innocent human lives—all these events sear the moral consciousness like a red-hot iron and demand a loud shout from the depths of the soul: “For God’s sake, stop it!” Indeed, in its own discreet tones, the International Court of Justice has issued such a shout, yet it seems to have fallen on deaf ears.

### ABOLISHING THE EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY -IS TIME RUNNING OUT?

*2024-02-17 20:20:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/abolishing-the-executive-presidency-is-time-running-out/) · `en`

Earlier this week, the President’s Media Division issued a statement to the effect that the next presidential election will be held on schedule. What was the need for that statement? In terms of the Constitution, the President’s term of office ends not later than 18th November 2024. As far as I am aware, no member of Parliament has given any indication that he or she intends to introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution to extend the term of office of the President, as required by article 83 of the Constitution. Such a Bill, if passed with a two-third majority, will also need to be approved by the people at a referendum. In the absence of any such move, what was the need for the President’s Media Division to assert the obvious. Was it to stifle the movement for restoring the parliamentary executive that now appears to be gathering wide public support?

### Recollections of Law, Order and Discipline in the good old days

In an advanced state of age one cannot often remember the name of a person whose face is very familiar or for that matter, sometimes, what was eaten at dinner the previous evening. A younger friend recently said that when asked for the registration number of his car, he had to take a look at it from his office window.

Strangely however, some events, significant or not in school and thereafter going back decades, come readily to mind. For instance Mr. P A Buultjens (a most outstanding cricketer in his day) claimed in his civics class in Form II in Trinity College that all man needs to live well were food, clothing and shelter. When then did education, health care, transport and other needs like security, human rights, entertainment come to be added to the list?

### Transformation, Reinvigoration and Reinvention: The Art and Life of George Keyt (1901 – 1993)

The material for this article has been drawn from the recently published work, George Keyt. The Absence of a Desired Image by SinhaRaja Tammita-Delgoda (Taprobane Collection, Sri Lanka 2023)

Modernism appealed to Keyt’s temperament, liberating him as a man and an artist. Confined and stifled by the morals and conventions of the day, he had already broken with its social codes. Modern art and its innovation opened up a new path for him. Enabling him to be free, to be different and to be himself, it gave him the tools to interpret the new world and the new life he had carved out for himself.

A revolutionary painter is one who wantonly breaks rules in order to liberate his expression from the bonds of academic art. Why must they do this? In order to create new forms…

According to the National Museum of the Royal Navy, prior to its current mooring in Hartlepool, this illustrious ship sailed more than 100,000 miles worldwide.
