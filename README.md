Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of starting a fire on the grounds of Europe‚Äôs largest and now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Sunday, with both sides reporting no sign of elevated radiation.

The U.N.‚Äôs International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog, which has a presence at the vast six-reactor facility, said its experts had seen strong, dark smoke coming from the northern area of the plant in southern Ukraine following multiple explosions.

‚ÄúThese reckless attacks endanger nuclear safety at the plant and increase the risk of a nuclear accident. They must stop now,‚Äù IAEA chief Rafael Grossi warned in a separate statement, without attributing blame for the attack.

The fire comes less than a week after Ukraine‚Äôs forces launched their largest incursion into Russian territory since the war-start in 2022, a surprise move that has brought conflict into a new phase, after weeks of Moscow‚Äôs battlefield gains.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs state pensioners will be paid 6,000 rupees in October after an increase of 3,000 rupees from September was shot down by the Elections Commissions, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

The cabinet decided to pay the 3,000 rupee allowance to 700,000 pensioners effective September.

But the elections commission opposed it as an election was declared, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

As a result, a 6,000 rupee payment would be made with arrears in October. From November 3,000 rupees would be added to the pension, he said.

Earlier this year a 2,500 rupee allowance was given to pensioners.

Unlike unemployed graduates who are hired without actual vacancies, many of Sri Lanka‚Äôs current pensioners were in government service working for small salaries.

In the 1980s and early 1990s when the central bank and macro-economists busted the currency incessantly without a credible anchor for money, they got very low real wages.

*2024-08-12 03:49:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190850) ¬∑ `ta`

Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa, a candidate from the National Democratic Front, criticizes the high cost and potential misuse of democracy in Sri Lanka's upcoming presidential election. He argues that the process, which requires significant financial investment and allows for numerous candidates, undermines the democratic process and the right to vote. Rajapaksa also addresses concerns about the involvement of the President's brother in the race, suggesting it could be an attempt to promote the President, which he deems illegal. Despite these criticisms, Rajapaksa asserts his position as the official leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, emphasizing his popularity among party members.

üü©

It is legal to contest as a presidential candidate. The President should be ashamed. The National Democratic Front presidential candidate Wijeyadasa Rajapakse said he should quit the presidential competition.

He was speaking at a press conference held in Colombo on Sunday (11).

So far, 27 people have been controlled to contest the presidential election. This is an act of abuse democratic rights. Candidates who have been controlled cannot get 500 votes. The ballot becomes blue as the candidates increase. This creates a confrontation of ordinary people when voting.

It costs 25 million rupees to get a candidate's name on the ballot. There are 27 candidates so far. If so, let's find out how much money it costs. This is a waste of people's money.

### The two Chief  similarities between Sri Lanka‚Äôs 2022 ‚Äòyouth aragalaya‚Äô and Bangladesh‚Äôs youth uprising in 2024

*2024-08-12 03:30:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84516) ¬∑ `en`

Those who unwisely murmur ‚ÄòBangladeshi people power a la Sri Lanka‚Äô in assessing the ‚Äòsecond liberation‚Äô of Bangladesh following the jubilant toppling of fifteen year one-party rule by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by thousands of youth earlier this month, must restrain their enthusiasm in no small part.

The 2022 youth protests in Sri Lanka precipitating the flight of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the collapse of his Government has led to significantly different outcomes in this country as compared to evolving ‚Äì and still volatile ‚Äì developments in Bangladesh.

In essence, there are only two similarities. First, both Hasina and Rajapaksa, consumed by their monstrous political egos, refused to believe that the ‚Äòhordes‚Äô were literally at the door of their respective ‚Äòpalaces‚Äô until the eleventh hour.

Addressing the media, he criticised the idea of several parties with little to no voter base announcing a common candidate, calling it unacceptable. ‚ÄúThere is no need for a common candidate.

State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday reassured the public that the Finance Ministry can support Presidential polls with any number of candidates.

He said the increase in the number of candidates for this year‚Äôs Presidential election will not pose a financial problem. Speaking to the media after an event in Yatiyanthota, the State Minister emphasised that the Government is prepared to cover the costs associated with the estimates presented for the election.

Siyambalapitiya noted that the expenditure estimate for the Presidential polls has not yet surpassed the Rs. 10 billion limit set for the event.

However, he acknowledged that if the number of candidates grows significantly, it could lead to additional expenses. ‚ÄúFor instance, if the ballot paper needs to be extended by another page to accommodate all candidates, the cost of one candidate could increase by around Rs. 100 million due to the need for more ballot boxes and other logistical requirements,‚Äù he explained.

### No one can build the PA;Ranil's success is the country's victory - Wimalaweera Dissanayake

*2024-08-11 23:29:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190845) ¬∑ `ta`

Wimalaweera Dissanayake supports Ranil Wickremesinghe for the upcoming election, emphasizing his leadership during the economic crisis. She highlights Ranil's selfless dedication to the nation over his political future. Despite challenges, including the unfeasibility of building a united front, she advocates for Ranil's victory as crucial for the country's recovery.

üü©

No one can build the Sri Lanka PA. President Ranil Wickremesinghe should win the upcoming election.

While the country was opposed to the worst economic crisis, none of the heroes who are currently speaking of the government have been responsible for the government. The country was on fire. President Ranil Wickremesinghe took the country without considering his political future.

The ruling and opposition parties must remember that no one can do election campaigns if the Age of 20122 is present in the year 20122.

I will be happy if the PA wins, but it is impossible to practice. No one can build public Peramuna. President Ranil Wickremesinghe should win the election. If he wins, the country will win.

The firm structure for recovering from the economic crisis has now been implemented.

A nation desirous of surviving and prospering should necessarily embrace ‚Äòinnovation and creativity‚Äô

The innovation inputs consist of five broad categories, namely, institutional structure, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication and business sophistication. In innovation outputs, there are two categories, namely, knowledge and technology and creativity. In all these categories, Sri Lanka‚Äôs performance as an innovative economy has been far from the desired. It also opens a wide policy corridor for Sri Lanka Government to adopt for implementation if it is really interested in building its knowledge base and its application in business

### Presidential Hopefuls Should Give Top Priority To Make Sri Lanka A Creative Economy ‚Äì Part I

There is a long list of Presidential hopefuls, but the voters will focus on five or six of them. From among them, one will be elected as the leader to steer the country to progress and prosperity. However, if they are to deliver prosperity to people, they should adopt policy strategies to accelerate economic growth at an unparalleled level of 8-9% annually over the next 25 years. This requires Sri Lanka to generate new inventions which should be commercially produced for the local as well as for global markets through innovations.

Hence, inventions and innovations should receive the highest priority of those aspiring to win the forthcoming Presidential election in their policy strategies. This article series will provide the needed guidance to those Presidential hopefuls. It is an updated and a modified version of a previous paper written by the author for the Association of Professional Bankers.

Modern economies should be aptly termed innovation or creative economies
