LTTE chief Prabhakaran came to believe over time that he had the divine right to do away anyone he considered an impediment to his separatist project

Tamil Tigers were led by men who had no long-term vision or strategic clarity; Prabhakaran led LTTE to a destruction no one had thought was ever possible

Weeks before the Tamil Tigers got military obliterated, a despondent Pottu Amman, the LTTE intelligence chief, confided to some of his startled colleagues that there were three main reasons why the prolonged armed struggle for an independent Tamil Eelam appeared to be crawling to its very end.

One, he said, was the decision by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 1990 to force the entire Tamil-speaking Muslim community to quit Sri Lanka’s north with just Rs. 150 and the clothes they were in.

Whatever else they possessed, they were told, had been earned in Tamil Eelam and so must be left behind. Overnight, tens of thousands of Muslims were pauperised and turned homeless.

I concluded a recent article on renewable energy saying, “the conversation should continue, but in a more sober, evidence-based manner” (https://www.ft.lk/columns/Electricity-sector-Without-investment-we-will-be-in-the-dark-again/4-761485). I was surprised by the ferocity of the response that went beyond countering my arguments (https://www.ft.lk/columns/Electricity-sector-What-Rohan-Samarajiva-didn-t-say/4-761731).

I had stated, “we can be happy that environmental impact assessment is considered non-negotiable in Sri Lanka.” I was accused of wanting to get rid of environmental impact assessments and wanting to violate the Constitution and the laws of the land. But this is not unusual in these polarised and untrusting times: if someone questions my position however politely, it must be because that person is an apologist for some perfidious foreign entity.

### Red alert for Govt. to secure skilled workforce in construction industry

It is not surprising that the construction industry has shrunk in the last four years by 65-70%. Due to this, industry professionals, quantity surveyors, architects, engineers, etc. are leaving the country. We believe that, by now, a few thousand professionals have left the country. More than this, the biggest issue we are facing is losing the skilled workforce in the country. We can see a light at the end of the tunnel by potentially starting a few projects in the country by 2025. However, the biggest problem that we will face next is that we have no skilled workers to do the construction work.

Sri Lankan skilled workers are famous in the world for our superior performance and skill. Without work, they are leaving the country and working in other industries.

*2024-05-22 05:05:20* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Sri-Lanka-rejects-alleged-genocide-claims-by-Canadian-Prime-Minister/56-762096) · `en`

These unfounded allegations relate to the conclusion of the armed separatist terrorist conflict waged by the LTTE in pursuit of a separate State, contrary to the principles of the UN Charter. The LTTE is a listed terrorist organisation in 33 countries worldwide, including in Canada.

### National consumer prices rise 2.7% in April as both food & non-food prices remain soft

Central Bank largely expected to keep rates unchanged next week as previous cuts doing their work

Consumer prices measured nationally rose by 2.7 percent in April from a year ago, slightly higher from 2.5 percent in through March as the non-food prices rose somewhat faster.

However, the prices still came down by 0.9 percent in April measured on a monthly basis, supported by decline in the prices of both food and non-food prices from a month ago.

Sri Lanka’s inflation has consistently been on single digit levels since July last year as the global commodities prices came down while the supply chains which lost balance during the pandemic came into better balance while the Central Bank made the monetary policy bone crushingly tight causing demand to trim.

The national food prices rose by 3.3 percent in the year through April, slowing from 5.0 percent in March but the prices measured monthly fell 1.4 percent, at a slower pace than the 2.1 percent decline between February and March.

### Common transportation to persons with disabilities is 'desired'?

*2024-05-22 02:12:02* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/cjlleegyy40o) · `si`

It seems like you've shared a detailed account of discussions and concerns related to accessibility issues in public transportation systems, particularly focusing on the experiences and challenges faced by individuals with disabilities in Sri Lanka. This includes issues such as inadequate seating arrangements, lack of priority access, and the overall neglect of accessibility standards in public transport.



From the narrative, several key points emerge:



1. **Accessibility Challenges**: Individuals with disabilities face significant barriers in accessing public transportation, including difficulty in boarding and disembarking, lack of designated seating, and insufficient space for mobility aids.



2. **Government Response**: There appears to be a disconnect between the government's intentions (as indicated by the allocation of funds and the establishment of committees) and the actual implementation of accessible transportation solutions. The narrative suggests that while efforts have been made, they may not be sufficient or effectively addressing the core issues.



3. **Community Engagement**: The involvement of individuals like Isuru and Tikiri highlights the importance of personal stories and advocacy in bringing attention to these issues. Their firsthand experiences underscore the urgency of improving accessibility in public transportation.



4. **Future Directions**: Suggestions for improvement include the introduction of specialized buses for individuals with disabilities, better training for drivers and conductors, and the integration of technology (like information centers and screens) to enhance navigation and communication for passengers with disabilities.



5. **International Standards and Collaboration**: The mention of international conferences and the revision of local regulations to align with international standards indicates a broader recognition of the need for accessible transportation. Collaborative efforts, such as those involving the Indian High Commission, show potential pathways for addressing these challenges.



To address these issues comprehensively, a multifaceted approach would likely be necessary. This could involve:



- **Policy Reform**: Ensuring that laws and regulations are not only in place but actively enforced to mandate accessibility in public transportation.

- **Infrastructure Development**: Investing in infrastructure that supports the needs of individuals with disabilities, including accessible entryways, seating areas, and restrooms.

- **Education and Training**: Providing education and training for transportation staff to ensure they are equipped to assist passengers with disabilities.

- **Technology Integration**: Utilizing technology to improve accessibility, such as real-time information systems and communication tools for passengers with hearing impairments.

- **Community Engagement**: Continuously engaging with communities affected by these issues to gather feedback and advocate for improvements.



Addressing accessibility in public transportation is a complex issue that requires sustained effort and collaboration across various sectors. It's clear that while progress has been made, there remains much work to be done to ensure that everyone, regardless of ability, can safely and comfortably use public transportation in Sri Lanka.

Several key stakeholders pointed out that the MRR would unfairly favour certain hotel categories while detrimentally affecting the industry as a whole.

May 21 (AFP) - Mitchell Starc struck three early blows to help Kolkata Knight Riders storm into the IPL final with a eight-wicket thrashing of Sunrisers Hyderabad in Ahmedabad's searing heat on Tuesday.

Two-time champions Kolkata bowled out Hyderabad for 159 as Starc returned figures of 3-34 in the first play-off - qualifier 1 - at the world's biggest cricket stadium.

Starc, a left-arm quick, once again justified his price tag from the December auction after he became the most expensive buy in IPL history when Kolkata got him for $2.98 million.

The figure quickly broke a record after Hyderabad brought Pat Cummins for $2.5 million in the same auction and later made him captain.

Venkatesh Iyer, on 51, and skipper Shreyas Iyer, on 58, remained unbeaten in Ahmedabad as Kolkata achieved their target with 38 balls to spare.

Hyderabad will have another shot at making the final when they clash with the winner of the eliminator in the second qualifier on Friday in Chennai.

### Matheesha Pathirana becomes most expensive player in LPL history

Young Sri Lankan fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana became the most expensive player ever in a Lanka Premier League (LPL) auction Tuesday when he was grabbed by Colombo Strikers for a record $120,000.

The 21-year-old – who has an unorthodox slinging delivery style – broke the $92,000 mark set by Dilshan Madushanka in last year’s edition of the T20 tournament.

Colombo Strikers bought Pathirana after matching Galle Marvels’ bid with their Right To Match option.

In an interesting turn of events, the Dambulla franchise began the bidding at USD 70,000 after Matheesha Pahitrana entered the bidding at his base price of USD 50,000.

However, Galle Marvels raised the stakes and took it to USD 100,000 straightaway. To avoid retention from Colombo Srikers, Galle even increased their own bid to USD 120,000 but their effort went in vain.

### Reflections On Solar Consciousness & Unity: A Message For Vesak Day 2024

*2024-05-21 18:30:25* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/reflections-on-solar-consciousness-unity-a-message-for-vesak-day-2024/) · `en`

As we celebrate Vesak Day on May 23, 2024, reflecting on the recent past, notably April 14, offers us a profound connection to our cultural and spiritual heritage. This day, commemorated by Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka and by many others across India and other countries, marks the Solar New Year, when the Sun transitions from Pisces to Aries. This celestial shift is deeply rooted in the concept of solar consciousness, a vital element in the ancient traditions of Sri Lanka.

The significance of Rāvanā in the context of solar consciousness cannot be overstated. Seen as the last of the ancient solar beings, Rāvanā’s name itself, deriving from ‘Rā,’ connects him to the Sun, symbolizing his divine origin and his influence on the region’s mythological history. The celebration of the Solar New Year on April 14 ties back to these narratives, emphasizing rebirth and renewal, themes that are equally relevant as we observe Vesak.
