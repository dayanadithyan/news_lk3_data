The government has decided to import a total of 1,000 buses and vans to improve the transportation facilities provided to tourists.

Accordingly, in a bid to boost the tourism sector, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to a proposal presented by the Minister of Tourism and Lands to import 750 vans and 250 buses.

As per the proposal, 6-15 seater vans, as well as 16-30 seater (small) buses and 30-45 seater (large) buses are planned to be imported, without any special tax relief.

The government says that, although it is considered a custom in the tourist industry that vehicles engaged in the industry for tourist transportation should not be used for more than 6 years, it is apparent that the condition of the vehicles used in the industry is not satisfactory and sufficient.

In a statement, it added that the fame earned by Sri Lanka as a prominent tourist destination is tarnished due to the usage of age-old vehicles as a result of the limitation of vehicles and essential spare parts.

"We can only think of completing expressways after the debt restructuring process of the Road Development Authority (RDA) is completed," he further said.

Moreover, he said there is no truth in handing over the daily operations and management of highways to a private company.

The Ministry had approved the transfer of daily operations and management of expressways from the Road Development Authority (RDA) to a state-owned company called Sahasya Investments (SIL).

SIL is a 100 percent state-owned company under the Treasury and the RDA.

### World Bank concerned over potential reform fatigue in Sri Lanka’s election year

ECONOMYNEXT — With elections coming up in Sri Lanka, the World Bank is concerned that reform fatigue could set in, leading to potential policy reversal, particularly with regard to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), a World Bank official said.

Senior Country Economist for the Maldives and Sri Lanka Richard Walker told EconomyNext that the World Bank is specifically concerned about SOE reforms as progress in that area has not been as rapid as hoped despite considerable macroeconomic gains made since the country’s worst financial crisis in decades.

“Maybe we haven’t seen it progress as far as we’d hoped. In terms of trying to put in place a much better framework to ensure better governance and options for private participation, that hasn’t moved as fast we’d hoped,” Walker said on the sidelines of an event held in Colombo on Tuesday April 02 to launch the World Bank’s Development Updates for Sri Lanka and South Asia.

### Sri Lanka’s mothers should avoid foreign employment: Minister

*2024-04-02 17:31:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-mothers-should-avoid-foreign-employment-minister-157200/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Mothers of infants should avoid working abroad, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Women’s Affairs, Geetha Kumarasinghe, has said.

“A mother should stay with the child till the child is two years,” Kumarasinghe said. “To whom are they going to give the responsibility? To the grandparents? To the husband? No, it is the mother who does that. You have to look after the child.”

At an event for International Women’s Day last month, Kumarasinghe said she was in favor of requesting mothers with children under two to refrain from foreign employment.

However, Minister of Labor and Foreign Employment, Manusha Nanayakkara has rejected this recommendation.

“Parental responsibility belongs to both the mother and father,” Nanayakkara told EconomyNext. “Why should restrictions apply to mothers and not to fathers?”

However, Kumarasinghe was adamant that Sri Lankan ‘culture’ dictated that women were the sole provider of childcare, or unpaid care work.
