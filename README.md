### A Machiavellian exercise?

*2024-07-19 23:25:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-Machiavellian-exercise/4-764497) · `en`

Why is the Government now, nine years later, without any issue having been raised by the Supreme Court or by any other court or tribunal, or in Parliament, or in any other forum, seeking to amend the Constitution for the sole purpose of replacing the words “six years” in Article 83 with the words “five years”?

In the 16th century, the Florentine diplomat Niccolo Machiavelli, in his book “The Prince”, outlined ruthless ways to achieve and retain political power. The events of the past two weeks lead one to wonder whether attempts are now being made to give practical effect to some of those techniques in this country.

### Post-Aragalaya challenge to minorities

That uprising exposed at last the vacuity of SBM as a constructive national ideology and signalled the need for a model of governance that would deliver those ideals

The 2022 Aragalaya was a landmark event in Sri Lankan politics. It was the harbinger for a new era in which the old political culture and governance with all its accoutrement would be thrown out and a new system of governance free of all past evils would be put in place. It was therefore an opportunity for the minorities who had suffered continually and immensely in the previous era to welcome this occasion. Instead, and shockingly, they are caught in a quandary and appear to have become saboteurs of the new and guardians of the old era.
