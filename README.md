World leaders refused to accept the ominous beginning as a harbinger of darker, more dangerous times ahead.

### When “Aiyo” Sirisena accused India’s RAW of plotting to assassinate him

“Putting your foot in your mouth” is a figurative expression about a person saying or doing something that should not be done or not have been said, especially if it embarrasses the person concerned or someone else. Among those who frequently put their feet into their mouths are politicians of all kinds and hues and from all parts of the world.

Sri Lanka the miracle of Asia is second to none in this sphere. From “Apey George” George E de Silva of Kandy in the past to CV Wigneswaran of Jaffna in the present, there have been several politicians in this resplendent Island who are famous for this. However the greatest of all politicians in this respect arguably is Pallewatte Gamaralage Maithripala Yapa Sirisena who served as the sixth executive president of Sri Lanka from 2015 to 2019. Such is his reputation for doing or uttering inappropriate things that Sirisena has acquired the prefix “Aiyo”. Many refer to him as “Aiyo” Sirisena nowadays.

### Countering NPP’s rise: Emerging political alliances and election strategies

The National People’s Power’s (NPP) current election campaign aiming for the presidential election has a strong momentum. The confident body language of its leadership is one indicator of this. Their rallies are well-attended and there appears to be a strong bottom-up support. The NPP’s seemingly growing electoral prospects have propelled it to being in the centre of political discourse, and this has led other political parties/factions to be on the defensive.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP, the main party within the NPP) is known for launching its election campaigns prematurely. This is why, despite their rallies being well-attended and their anti-establishment discourse being attractive to people in general, their popularity has not translated to votes, never having gone more than 5% at a general election so far. However, this trope may not hold as firmly this time.

“We too live in a time when political structures we inhabit are fluid and perhaps on the cusp of great and potentially dangerous changes.” – Richard Whatmore (The end of enlightenment)

Namal Rajapaksa had his crowning as crown prince last week. The SLPP titled the Tangalle meeting, “Let’s begin the Battle from Hambantota”. Battle to return the Rajapaksas to power under a President Namal, if not in 2024, then in 2029; or someday. In the propaganda images, young Namal is foregrounded, kurahan shawl and all, against a backdrop of Mahinda and Basil Rajapaksa. The new trinity. The SLPP going through generational change. Torch of leadership passing from father and uncle to son/nephew. The SLPP is the only Lankan party founded to enthrone a family. It can renew itself only by staying the same.

This Online Safety Act will have a huge impact on the freedom of expression of Sri Lankan citizens

In 2018, “EUROPOL” headquartered in Hague, Netherlands, a key organisation established to prevent and combat serious internationally organised crimes, cybercrime and terrorism, had clearly defined the difference between cyber-dependent crimes and cyber-enabled crimes. As defined by them, any crime that can only be committed using computers, computer networks or other forms of information communication technology was named as cyber-dependent crimes and traditional crimes facilitated by the Internet and digital technology were categorised as cyber-enabled crimes. So, there are two categories of cybercrimes and these definitions are internally accepted.

Sri Lanka’s sovereignty over Kachchativu, according to the narrative, was never in doubt and it was in fact the Kachchativu issue that decided the demarcation of the maritime boundary between Sri Lanka and India

The book relates how laws were brought to confine fishing to areas within the boundary of each country

There were also reports of illicit immigrants from South India using the Kachchativu Festival to enter Sri Lanka

The sovereignty of Kachchativu Island which Sri Lanka had exercised throughout history is once again disputed by India. This is despite India having withdrawn the claim- that it owned this island- with the presentation of facts to the Government of New Delhi some years ago.  However, the island, barren and uninhabited most of the year, had remained a contentious issue for over a hundred years.

### Sri Lanka to import 1,000 vehicles to improve tourism sector transportation

*2024-04-02 22:10:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98383/sri-lanka-to-import-1000-vehicles-to-improve-tourism-sector-transportation) · `en`

The government has decided to import a total of 1,000 buses and vans to improve the transportation facilities provided to tourists.

Accordingly, in a bid to boost the tourism sector, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to a proposal presented by the Minister of Tourism and Lands to import 750 vans and 250 buses.

As per the proposal, 6-15 seater vans, as well as 16-30 seater (small) buses and 30-45 seater (large) buses are planned to be imported, without any special tax relief.

The government says that, although it is considered a custom in the tourist industry that vehicles engaged in the industry for tourist transportation should not be used for more than 6 years, it is apparent that the condition of the vehicles used in the industry is not satisfactory and sufficient.

In a statement, it added that the fame earned by Sri Lanka as a prominent tourist destination is tarnished due to the usage of age-old vehicles as a result of the limitation of vehicles and essential spare parts.

"We can only think of completing expressways after the debt restructuring process of the Road Development Authority (RDA) is completed," he further said.

Moreover, he said there is no truth in handing over the daily operations and management of highways to a private company.

The Ministry had approved the transfer of daily operations and management of expressways from the Road Development Authority (RDA) to a state-owned company called Sahasya Investments (SIL).

SIL is a 100 percent state-owned company under the Treasury and the RDA.
