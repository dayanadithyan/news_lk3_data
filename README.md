BritainтАЩs new Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Saturday he would scrap a controversial plan to fly thousands of asylum seekers from Britain to Rwanda in his first major policy announcement since winning a landslide election victory.

The previous Conservative government first announced the plan in 2022 to send migrants who arrived in Britain without permission to the East African nation, saying it would put an end to asylum seekers arriving on small boats.

But no one was sent to Rwanda under the plan because of years of legal challenges.

At his first press conference since becoming prime minister, Starmer said that the Rwanda policy would be scrapped because only about 1% of asylum seekers would have been removed and it would have failed to act as a deterrent.

тАЬThe Rwanda scheme was dead and buried before it started. ItтАЩs never been a deterrent,тАЭ Starmer said. тАЬIтАЩm not prepared to continue with gimmicks that donтАЩt act as a deterrent.тАЭ

France's election sees high voter turnout, with the radical RN party expected to gain the most seats, potentially leading to a hung parliament and impacting President Macron's power. Despite concerns about extremist influence post-WWII, political unity aims to prevent such an outcome.

ЁЯЯй

The people of France have begun voting in the election, which is expected to win a historic success.

The voting has begun with polls that the party will not get a majority, but the radicalist party, the RN, will win the most seats.

If no party has a majority in the election, the Hanging Parliament in France may be formed ahead of the Olympic Games, and the power of President Emanuel Micron may be greatly affected.

Following the winning of Marine Leben's RL, after the winning vote last Sunday, there was fears of the ruling of extremists in France after World War II.

However, political parties, including the Left, have joined hands to avoid this situation.

Polls suggest that the extremists will capture more seats but 289 seats for the majority will not be available.
