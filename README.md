ECONOMYNEXT — The buses and vans that Sri Lanka plans to import for the tourism sector will be a year old, as opposed to brand new vehicles that would cost more, and also subject to tax as usual, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

Siyambalapitiya told reporters that the country’s rapidly recovering tourism industry needs to follow the same global standards which don’t allow for vehicles more than six years old.

“In 2020, vehicle imports were stopped due to the foreign exchange crisis in the country, since our biggest forex expenditure was for vehicle imports. But we allowed for some imports under special circumstances from time to time. For example, to meet the needs of the health ministry and other ministries. Now the tourism industry is faced with such an essential need,” he said.

“The vehicles we already have are aging, and they’re also not enough. So the cabinet decided to allow the import of 250 buses and 750 vans specifically for the tourism industry,” he said.
