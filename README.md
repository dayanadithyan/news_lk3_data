Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry has applauded the United Kingdom’s decision to uphold the proscription of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) as a terrorist organisation.

In a statement posted on the social media platform X, Sabry highlighted the LTTE’s international network’s strategy to influence foreign governments into lifting the ban. “The LTTE’s international network’s approach and strategy is to get foreign Governments to de-proscribe the LTTE so that they could revive the LTTE,” Sabry wrote.

The UK Proscribed Organisations Appeals Commission, an independent court headed by a high court judge and supported by two retired senior diplomats, ruled against the de-proscription of the LTTE. The decision was made on 21 June confirming that the UK will continue to maintain the LTTE on its list of banned organisations.
