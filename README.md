According to Tim, he fell victim to a scam at a local restaurant, where he was charged an exorbitant Rs. 1,000 for a single Ulundu Vadai and a cup of plain tea.

In his YouTube video titled "Avoid this man in Kalutara, Sri Lanka," Tim recounted his experience. He traversed Kalutara on his own three-wheeler, soaking in the sights. Upon parking, he was approached by a Sri Lankan individual who offered to take him to a place called 'Wadani Villas Saivar Kade' for an authentic Sri Lankan food experience.

The friendly local guided Tim to the restaurant, where he was served an Ulundu Vadai and plain tea, despite not planning to dine initially. As Tim enjoyed his meal, the host suggested tourist spots, which Tim politely declined, opting to explore independently.

### Elections could dent Sri Lanka‚Äôs recovery: ADB

*2024-04-12 22:09:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Elections-could-dent-Sri-Lankas-recovery-ADB/108-280661) ¬∑ `en`

Colombo, April 12 - Sri Lanka's recovery could be stalled by abrupt policy changes after elections later this year even as the economy showed signs of stabilising, the Asian Development Bank warned Friday.

The island nation weathered an unprecedented financial crisis in 2022 that forced a foreign debt default as well as food and fuel shortages that prompted months of unrest.

It secured a $2.9 billion rescue loan from the International Monetary Fund last year, with President Ranil Wickremesinghe hiking taxes and cutting generous subsidies to restore the government's ruined finances.

But the ADB said presidential polls due by October could weaken the commitment to austerity measures.

"Risks to the outlook tend to the downside," the bank said in its latest forecast on Sri Lanka's economy.

Among them, the most important is uncertainty associated with the upcoming elections, including any possible impact on fiscal policy and reform implementation."

The ‚Äúuncertainty‚Äù over the impending elections in Sri Lanka will cause a possible downward trend in the country‚Äôs economic outlook, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said.

The island nation is set to face a presidential election in the last quarter of this year, while the parliamentary election is due mid-next year.

However, political uncertainty prevails in the country as opposition parties have pledged to reverse the current IMF-linked reforms, which have proved to be unpopular with the masses.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has steered the recovery programme by going into a bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a USD 2.9 billion facility, maintains that the island could once again face economic collapse if the IMF programme reforms are not adhered to.

### Germany eases gender change rules

*2024-04-12 21:59:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Germany-eases-gender-change-rules/108-280660) ¬∑ `en`

Germany, April 12 (BBC) - The German parliament has passed a law making it easier for citizens and residents to legally change gender.

It's also introducing hefty fines - in specific circumstances - for disclosing someone's prior registered name or gender without consent.

Previously, changing your registered gender required a doctor's certificate and the approval of a family court.

Now over-18s can change to male, female or diverse, a third gender option that already exists under German law.

Three months on from a request for such a change, applicants will then have to appear at a registry office in person.

You can also request that no details regarding your gender are registered at all.

The intentional and harmful disclosure of someone's prior name or legal gender could attract a fine of up to ‚Ç¨10,000.

However, there are exceptions - for example if it's a legal requirement due to court proceedings or police investigations.

*2024-04-12 20:17:00* ¬∑ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-grow-1-9-pct-in-2024-despite-tax-hikes-adb-158412/) ¬∑ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka is expected to grow 1.9 percent in 2024, and speed up to 2.5 percent in 2025, as the island recovers from a contraction last year, the Asian Development Bank said.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs currency collapsed in 2022 after two years of aggressive macro-economic policy where money was printed to boost growth and taxes were also cut, throwing large section of the population into poverty and pushing up inflation.

‚ÄúIn Sri Lanka, growth will rebound to 1.9 percent in 2024 and 2.5 percent in 2025 from the 2.3 percent contraction in 2023,‚Äù the ADB said in its Asian Development Outlook report.

‚ÄúThis will be driven by rising output in services, resumption in industrial projects, and continuous reform aimed at improving the business climate.

‚ÄúStill, tax increases will dampen the recovery in private consumption and investment.‚Äù

### Biden urged to ban China-made electric vehicles

April 12 (BBC) - President Joe Biden has been urged to ban imports of Chinese-made electric cars to the US.

The chair of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Sherrod Brown, wrote "Chinese electric vehicles are an existential threat to the American auto industry".

His comments are the strongest yet by any US lawmaker on the issue, while others have called for steep tariffs to keep Chinese electric vehicles (EV) out of the country.

In February, the White House said the US was opening an investigation into whether Chinese cars pose a national security risk.

"We cannot allow China to bring its government-backed cheating to the American auto industry", Senator Brown said in a video on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.

Senator Brown, who is a Democrat from the the car-producing state of Ohio, is seeking to win a fourth term in office in November's election.

The White House did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.

The Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) says its daily revenue has gone up by approximately Rs. 25 million owing to the special bus service set in place for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year season.

Since 5 April, the SLTB has been deploying at least 200 additional buses to facilitate the people who are returning to their hometowns for the festive period.

As a result, the state-owned bus service provider‚Äôs daily income saw an increase to the tune of Rs. 25 million over the past few days, according to SLTB Deputy General Manager Panduka Swarnahansa.

However, the commuters complained that they were inconvenienced due to the inadequate number of long-distance buses in operation to accommodate the high volume of passengers.

Meanwhile, the Road Development Authority (RDA) said the income generated by the expressways has gone up by at least 10% during the festive season, adding that it is expected to further increase in the coming days until 15 April.

### Sri Lanka Yukthiya operations leading addicts to seek Ayurveda high

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì A shortage of drugs due to the Yukthiya crackdown has led some addicts to look for alternative medicines, State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody said.

‚ÄúThe shortage of pharmaceuticals has led some individuals addicted to drugs to turn to certain alternative medicines within the indigenous medical system, Jayakody said at a press briefing last week.

Sri Lanka allows cannabis to be used in the manufacture of ayurvedic medicine. Raw materials in Ayurvedic medicine include several parts of the cannabis plant, as well as abin (Papaver somniferum Linn), in herbal remedies.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that over-the-counter products available at shops that sell ayurveda products (sinhala beheth) provide varying degrees of relaxation or stimulation.

Jayakody said a written notification has been sent to Public Security Minister Tiran Alles and the Inspector General of Police regarding the challenges faced by the indigenous medical sector due to operation ‚ÄòYukthiya‚Äô.

### Taylor Swift‚Äôs music back on TikTok after dispute

April 12 (BBC) - Taylor Swift's songs are back on TikTok following a dispute that led her label to stop licensing its content to the app.

Her music's return on Thursday comes ahead of the release of her new album, The Tortured Poets Department.

Universal Music pulled songs by its artists in January, including Rihanna and Ariana Grande, citing a licensing dispute.

While many of her songs - including You Belong With Me and Cruel Summer - are again available for users to add to their videos, music belonging to Universal's other artists has still not been relisted.

That may be because unlike other artists, Swift owns the copyright to her music under the terms of a 2018 deal with Universal. Some reports speculated Swift reached a separate deal with TikTok.

"Swifties" - Taylor Swift fans - took to the platform to share their delight at her music returning.

"OMG this made my whole year," wrote verified user Jessica Golich, adding that users would "have the whole new album to play with".

### Vietnamese billionaire sentenced to death for $44bn fraud

Vietnam, April 12 (BBC) - Behind the stately yellow portico of the colonial-era courthouse in Ho Chi Minh City, a 67-year-old Vietnamese property developer was sentenced to death on Thursday for looting one of the country's largest banks over a period of 11 years.

It's a rare verdict - she is one of very few women in Vietnam to be sentenced to death for a white collar crime.

The decision is a reflection of the dizzying scale of the fraud. Truong My Lan was convicted of taking out $44bn (¬£35bn) in loans from the Saigon Commercial Bank. The verdict requires her to return $27bn, a sum prosecutors said may never be recovered. Some believe the death penalty is the court's way of trying to encourage her to return some of the missing billions.

The habitually secretive communist authorities were uncharacteristically forthright about this case, going into minute detail for the media. They said 2,700 people were summoned to testify, while 10 state prosecutors and around 200 lawyers were involved.

In the upcoming presidential election, initiatives to stop a common candidate on behalf of Tamil political parties.

At present, those who are expected to field in the presidential election do not reveal themselves as compassionate on any issues, including a solution to the ethnic problem of the Tamil people.

Therefore, supporting the Candidates of South Sri Lanka without any basics is an inappropriate endeavor. It is a suitable approach that all the Tamil parties unite and stop the general candidate.

I am in principle compliance with that effort. However, it is very important that the party needs to take a decision on the issue of the Sri Lankan Tamil party.

Colombo, April 12 (Daily Mirror) - The Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) today claimed that the National Transport Commission (NTC) has failed to provide sufficient buses for people to leave from Colombo.

The Association's Secretary Anjana Priyanjith claimed that people have to wait at the private bus stand for more than three hours to get their buses.

During previous years the NTC had discussions with private bus associations to arrange buses without inconveniencing commuters, he said.

"Earlier, we were advised to assign short-distance buses to long-distance services to meet the demand. But this time no such decision has been taken. Therefore, people have to wait many hours at the bus stand to get their transport facilities", Priyanjith said.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) said that sufficient buses were assigned for people to get to their villages.

Diplomat Dayan Jayatilaka advises Tamil parties to engage with main rivals, Sajith and Anura, amidst Sinhalese and Buddhist communalism. He suggests against stopping a Tamil general candidate, noting the lack of public support for such a move. Despite the historical tributes by Tamil parties in presidential elections, the current attempt to unite behind a common candidate faces challenges due to differing political tendencies and the absence of unanimity. Jayatilaka emphasizes the importance of addressing long-term issues with Sajith and Anura, drawing parallels with Catalonia and Kurdishland, and advocates for strategic decision-making to leverage the current political climate.

Diplomatic Dayan Jayatilaka has said that the Tamil parties, Sajith, should carry out talks with the main rivals, as the time when the Sinhalese and Buddhist communalism, which have long been politicized at home, have been appropriate.

He also pointed out that while the political tendency of the Tamils is going on, the attempt to stop a Tamil general candidate will not be appropriate.

He said this while commenting on the Tamil political parties, which are based on the North and East, have taken a public candidate in the upcoming presidential election.

The Tamil people have carried out various tributes in the past in the presidential election. However, the tricks have not received enough reactors to the Tamil people.

Against this backdrop, Tamil political parties are trying to stop a common candidate on their next presidential election.

It is a possible strategy if all parties come forward to work together on this issue.
