### The government should use the pressure on Israel - Mujibur Rahman

*2024-05-15 03:18:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183563) ┬╖ `ta`

He said this while addressing the adjournment motion on the current state of Palestine held in Parliament on Tuesday (14).

All the heads of state who ruled Sri Lanka have supported Palestine since the early days. Despite our political disagreements with Mahinda Rajapaksa, he was firm on the Palestinian issue.. Similarly, Ranasinghe Premadasa took steps to evict the Israeli office in our country.

The President is starting a fund for Palestinian people and raising money. But when he rallies money to Palestine, there may not be children in Palestine, where there are no people.. There are things that can be pressed.

Sri Lanka's handling of Tamil issues contrasts sharply with its stance on Palestine.

Imtiaz Pakir Makar accuses media of covering up the Palestinian crisis, likening it to the apartheid era.

He said this while addressing the debate on the proposal on the present stage of Palestine in Parliament on Tuesday (14).

The forces that saved the South African apartheid regime, in the same manner, are still trying to cover up the injustice and repression of Palestinian soil, and go against the mandate of the people of the world, and seek refuge for the separatist and inhumane rule.

Although the mighty media is covered, the reality of Palestine is almost exposed to the community through social media.

### Lankan mercenaries fighting in Russo-Ukraine war - EDITORIAL

Media reports have been circulating of Sri Lankan ex-military personnel being involved in the Russo-Ukraine conflict. With the war raging in Ukraine, many Ukrainian males of military age have fled to neighbouring EU countries to avoid military service. It should not be unexpected that recruiters would seek battle-hardened military men from foreign lands.

Our country with a large number of battle-hardened troops either idling in camps or having deserted military service is therefore a soft target for foreign recruiters. All they needed were locals with insider knowledge and capacity to help them recruit.

According to media reports a former Major General and an ex-sergeant have been among their local point men.

In the aftermath of the war, former veterans have had all their special allowances cut. They now depend on their basic wage.

Mahinda Rajapaksa thrives in a sense of inviolability and a culture of┬а impunity fostered by the very system that sustains their political┬а existence.

Like the rest of his ilk in this part of the world, Mahinda Rajapaksa overstayed his welcome in the power. He ran the economy to the ground as he did with the national carrier, which he re-nationalized out of a fit of rage after its Emirates management refused to deplane fee-levying passengers to make room for his entourage.

He tried on a dynastic power grab that went spectacularly wrong, ending in the worst-ever financial crisis since the independence.

But, like every crook and conman in Third World politics,┬а Mahinda Rajapaksa thrives in a sense of inviolability and a culture of impunity fostered by the very system that sustains their political existence.

The construction of the phase from Kottawa to Pinnaduwa- of the project titled тАШExpressway Network of Sri LankaтАЩ- was completed in 2011. During its construction, a medical student died as a result of a minor collapse of a bridge on the expressway in 2008. This incident sparked widespread concern regarding the quality and reliability of this expressway facility. Although the concept of expressways was relatively new to Sri Lankans at that time, there was significant discourse regarding passenger safety; particularly in the event of a bridge or culvert falls apart while the facility is being used for travel. Investigations later confirmed that the cause of the collapse was the improper construction of the bridge.

The other beams at a 45 degree angle are unaffected by the collapse of one beam

### A Call To Comrade Anura Kumara Dissanayake: Time To Reflect & Adapt

I write these words with a sense of urgency and anticipation, believing that the time has come to reflect and adapt. The seeds you sow knowingly or unknowingly have reaped a bitter harvest of division and discontent among the people of our Nation. Your brand of politics has had a lasting impact on our society, characterized by its bitterness and divisiveness. From the turbulent events of 71 to the unrest of 88 and 89, the scars of past conflicts continue to haunt us. The stagnant narrative of 76 years of curse and rejection of 225 has perpetuated, casting a shadow over our collective aspirations.

Your ability to mobilize support and empower people to your cause cannot be denied. The meetings last May showed the strength of your organization. But this energy, though powerful, is not without its dangers. It serves as a warning not only to you but to the entire nation.

### If Tamil Eelam was origin

*2024-05-14 21:26:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183560) ┬╖ `ta`

Tamil Eelam, if it had originated, could have evolved into a South Asian Israel, akin to the transformation of Palestine. Wimal Weerawansa, a Sri Lankan parliamentarian, suggested the US's interest in ending the LTTE war was influenced by Israel. The comparison draws parallels between the struggles of Palestinians and Tamils, highlighting the international community's role in conflicts. The narrative also touches on the failed attempts by Britain to establish Tamil Eelam within Sri Lanka, contrasting it with their success in Palestine. The mention of the US's involvement, including a Marine Squadron visit to protect LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, and the use of veto power at the UN to support Sri Lanka, underscores the complex international dynamics in these conflicts.

ЁЯЯй

If the war with the LTTE did not end, Tamil Eelam would have been originated in South Asia. It would have been transformed into Israel.. National Freedom Front leader and parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said that the US is tears to end the war by providing Israel and ending the war.

He was speaking at a debate on the adjournment motion on the Palestinian Affairs Affairs in Parliament on Tuesday (14).

Palestinians have been badly affected by the inhuman attack of Israel. We are worried about the present situation of the Palestinians.

When World War II intensified, the Great Britain signed a deal with the Jews to end the war. The Jews urged the British to have a country or kingdom after the end of the war.

Tamils live in the world. They are based on South Indian Dravidian language so that they are giving them a unique country within Sri Lanka, giving them a great British fake independence.

### Trends that Tamils and Muslims voted in the past presidential elections

*2024-05-14 20:24:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183559) ┬╖ `ta`

The upcoming 2024 presidential election in Sri Lanka is shaping up to be a significant event, with the potential for a close contest among the main contenders. The Sri Lanka Elections Commission has announced the election dates, and while the specific candidates have not been officially announced, the media has speculated on potential contestants, including Anura Kumarathisanayake from the Janata Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the National People's Power.



The election is expected to be a triangular contest, with the votes of the Sinhalese community, the largest majority in Sri Lanka, potentially being split among the main candidates. This could lead to a situation where no candidate secures the 50% required to win outright in the first round, necessitating a second round of voting.



The votes of minority communities, including Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims, and Indian origin Tamils, are crucial in this context. These communities, while constituting a smaller percentage of the total population, are significant in certain districts and could potentially sway the outcome of the election.



Historically, the votes of these minority communities have played a pivotal role in past presidential elections. For instance, in the 1999 election, Chandrika Kumaratunga's victory was attributed to a wave of sympathy following an assassination attempt, which also affected the outcome of the 2005 election. The 2015 election saw a significant shift, with the winning candidate, Maithripala Sirisena, receiving fewer Sinhalese votes but securing a majority among non-Sinhalese voters.



The 2019 election saw a return to a more traditional voting pattern, with Gotabhaya Rajapaksa securing a majority among Sinhalese voters, despite receiving significant support from minority communities.



As the 2024 election approaches, the role of minority communities, particularly the Sri Lankan Tamils and Muslims, will be crucial. Their support could potentially decide the outcome, especially if the Sinhalese votes are divided among the main candidates. The historical voting patterns and the strategic importance of minority communities in past elections suggest that their support could be decisive in the upcoming election.



In conclusion, the 2024 presidential election in Sri Lanka is expected to be a closely contested affair, with the votes of minority communities potentially playing a pivotal role in determining the outcome. The historical context and the strategic importance of these communities in past elections underscore their significance in the upcoming contest.

ЁЯЯй

The Sri Lanka Elections Commission announced last week that the 2024 presidential election will be held on September 17 and October 16. The Elections Commission has repeated the matter already known. Although the exclusive date has not been announced, the election is possible to be held in late September or early October.

Many will compete for the presidency as in the past. While some have explicitly expressed their desire to contest the election, the names of other people who are contesting are published in the media.But, only the three are the main contestants with the opportunity to win. Janata Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). ) / The leader of the National People's Power is Anura Kumarathisanayake.

"Based on the reported population data, liquor licenses were issued 16 years ago. The government's approach doesn't involve promoting the use of legal alcohol; instead, it focuses on regulation through tax hikes and implementing new license fees. The overarching goal seems to be enhancing state revenue while simultaneously curbing the proliferation of illegal alcohol," the State mMnister said.

*2024-05-14 17:43:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183546) ┬╖ `ta`

Modern thermal radiation therapy, like Endovenous Laser Therapy, offers relief for varicose nerve issues, affecting many who work long hours. This treatment involves a small procedure to heat and eliminate the infection in the affected nerve area, improving blood flow and reducing discomfort. It's a welcome solution for patients, offering quick recovery and minimal downtime.

ЁЯЯй

Many of us continue to work for more than five to eight hours a day. Most of them have a varicose nerve infection in their ankles and foot.

If this is easy to describe, the blood is pumped from the heart of all parts of our body with a balanced force.

Because of this, the blood that spreads throughout the body comes back to the heart. The blood vessel system is naturally in our body that we have one path to the body from the heart and another path to the heart from the other part of the body.

In this case, the blood that runs up to the quarter of the area is contaminated, and when they are weak, the contaminated blood is stagnant when they are weak, or when they are weak, or weak, due to various disturbances or due to various disturbances or exclusive blood vessels.. This causes the skin in the quarter and ankle area in the end. It also makes the nerves and causes discomfort and sickness.
