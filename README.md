Parliamentarian C says that the presidential election is beneficial to the Tamil people. V.. Wigneswaran said.

тАЬThe postponement of the presidential election is beneficial to the whole country. Especially for the Tamils.

As for this presidential election, no candidate can get more than 50 percent of the votes. So they will try to get the votes of the minority people.

At the same time, when no one gets more than 50 percent of the votes in the presidential election, the political stability in the country will be left.

There are already economic crises in the country. If there is no political stability, the country will face the worst economic setbacks.

In addition, there will be a situation where large funds will be spent on the election. That too will affect the country's economy тАЭ.

The anti-Tamil pogrom of July 1983 is an unforgettable chapter in the post-independence history of Sri Lanka.  The catastrophic events of that dark month  drastically affected  the lives of large numbers of Tamils in Sri Lanka.

As a Sri Lankan Tamil journalist, Black July did have an effect on me in both personal and professional capacities. Furthermore my family тАУ like thousands of other Tamil families тАУ was also affected and displaced during those turbulent times.

Although I have been writing  extensively about Black July in the past, I did not write about those happenings from a personal perspective  for many,many years.

I  refrained for a long time  from writing about the impact of Black July on our family for two reasons. Firstly I was spared the full blast of that violence because I was not in Colombo then. I was on assignment to cover the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) party convention in Mannar.

I did not realize that he had another doctor at home until one day he called me to say that one of his sons has read on the Internet of the side effects of a drug that I had prescribed, and asked me what I thought he should do.

CeylonтАЩs native medicinal practitioners did not all come from a single social class anymore than did her astrologers.

On the other hand, there was the Veda Menike, a female relative of mine, the daughter of an Adigar, who apart from being a competent ayurvedic doctor, had a good knowledge of Pali and Sanskrit and was at home with ola manuscripts.

Living in Kurunegala town at the beginning of the 20th century, we also had a family doctor who came with his shiny instruments in a buggy cart. There were, as far as I can remember, two motor cars in Kurunegala at the time. Neither the doctor or any member of my family possessed one.

In 1971, after the failed Marxist uprising against the state, the government introduced the rule that anyone applying for a government job should get a report (a тАШchitтАЩ) from the local political agent of the government. This rule especially applied to young men and women, as the government distrusted the youth because of their involvement in the insurrection.

Soon after graduating from the University of Peradeniya in 1972, I applied for a vacancy at the Agrarian Research and Training Institute (ARTI) for a research and training officer (rural sociology). I visited the political agent, who lived in Hendala, to get a chit. The agent was an Ayurvedic doctor who was also a justice of the peace and a member of the Town Council (He was known as тАШMember Mahatmaya.тАЩ). He cordially received me in the verandah of his small house. He was in a sarong without a shirt or a vest. A heavy leather belt with a large buckle was around his belly over the sarong.

She was born as Mary Irwin, in Ontario, Canada (1873-1962). She had a medical degree from Canada, but opted to work as a medical missionary in Ceylon. Later, after the mission did not approve of her marriage to a native Ceylonese, she ceased to be a missionary worker and settled into a medical practice in Colombo. Her patients were mainly women, mainly Muslim women who preferred to have a female doctor. Although she was white and foreign-born, it was remarkable that she was able to bypass the white-colonial structure in Ceylon and identify directly with its native people.

### THE FAILURE OF TEACHING RELIGION IN SCHOOLS

To quote. тАЬReligion should be the motor of life, the central heating plant of personality, the faith that gives joy to activity, hope to struggle, dignity to humility and zest to living.тАЭ Upliftment is the keynote. Yet Religion has been the cause of the most appalling bloodshed and strife . The most horrendous wars have been fought in the name of religion and rivers of blood have flowed while idiots quarreled over the words of god-like men who must have been appalled by the distortion of their messages to humanity. So let us agree that religion DIVIDES and most certainly does not UNITE.

I am at a loss, therefore, to understand, WHY our Education Planners insist on religion being taught in schools? Religion continues to be a divider even in our little island. In schools that contain pupils of all faiths, students are split up whenever it is time for that period in religion. Language is already a divisive factor yet we purposely add yet another subject to compound the folly.

### 19A controversy: Jayampathy Wickramaratne  responds to PresidentтАЩs accusation

PresidentтАЩs Counsel Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne has revealed that during the drafting of the 19th Constitutional Amendment, the terms of the President and the Parliament were proposed to be reduced from six to five years, however, the decision was made to retain the possibility of extending these terms to six years, as any further changes would necessitate a referendum.

Dr. Wickramaratne stated this in a statement released today (20) in response to the public apology made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday (19) for the alleged oversight involving the senior attorney.

In his statement, PresidentтАЩs Counsel Dr. Wickramaratne points out that the former government took the decision that the entire drafting process of the 19th Amendment should be carried out on the basis that the Bill should not be placed for approval at a referendum, in keeping with then President Maithripala SirisenaтАЩs electoral pledge.
