ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka is planning to lift withholding tax on interest income below 100,000 a month to help older citizens who depend on interest income as interest rates fall, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

With deposit rates falling to around 9 percent from an earlier 16 percent, elderly persons who depend on interest get less income, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

‚ÄúWe are now planning to put in place a mechanism to lift withholding tax from retirees who earn interest below 1,000 rupees a month,‚Äù he said in statement.

It is likely to cost up to 40 billion rupees to pay interest subsidies to banks to give senior citizens interest of 16 percent when market rates fall.

The government still owed banks interest subsidies on previous years senior citizen interest subsidies, Siyambalapitiya told opposition leader Sajith Premadasa in parliament Thursday.

While Jayanthi Kamage was working in his work, his email came to a message from the University of London.

The 43 -year -old Sri Lankan woman's journey as a long -term journey will defile her journey. The trip has lasted several kilometers.

Kamage told us that when he was working as an audit assistant in Sri Lanka, Singapore has twice as much income than the salary.

Three years after he began his law, he left Sri Lanka for money for his education.

If she was very sure of her childhood, she was ready to face any crisis caused by her going abroad.

Kamage, the supervisor of the company, who is currently working on the refinery, said this was a very long task.

He said that I know that there is a way to be in the words of the words, but there is a way that my feelings are.

Kamage had been blindfolded for several days-he had difficulty in learning.

I did not buy a lipstick or cosmetics, he says.
