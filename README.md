### Sri Lanka settles USD 60 million Iranian oil debt with tea

Sri Lanka Tea Board has announced that USD 60 million of the USD 251 million owed by Sri Lanka to Iran for fuel imports since 2011 has been paid through tea exports. This initiative follows a strategic agreement signed between the Sri Lankan and Iranian governments to use tea exports as a method of settling the debt, the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries said in a statement.

The payments arrears for fuel imports were accumulated over several years due to various economic challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic’s severe impact on the economy, European sanctions imposed since 2011, the collapse of the tourism industry following the Easter attacks, and the overall economic downturn, which led to a shortage of dollars hindering the payment process, the statement added.
