### 70,000 soldiers killed or injured in Russia in 2 months!Ministry of Defense of British Defense

*2024-07-16 22:29:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/188613) ¬∑ `ta`

In the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Britain's Defense Ministry reports significant casualties among Russian forces, estimating 70,000 soldiers killed or injured in just two months. The report details heavy losses, particularly in attempts to seize Ukraine's Karkiv region, with daily fatalities exceeding 1,000 in May and June. Despite capturing territory in eastern Ukraine, Russia's inability to sustain tactical victories and the poor training of its troops are highlighted as key factors contributing to these losses. Western analysts suggest that while small-scale attack tactics offer minor gains, they do not facilitate broader operational successes, indicating a high cost-benefit ratio for Russia's military strategy.

üü©

Britain has reported that 70,000 soldiers of Russia have died or injured in the last two months of the Ukraine war.

The British Defense Ministry said in a military intelligence report released last weekend.

The British Defense Ministry said that the daily losses of the Russian soldiers (deaths and injuries) were 1,262 in May and it was 1,163 in June.

The Ministry said that 70,000 Russian soldiers may have died or injured in only 2 months.
