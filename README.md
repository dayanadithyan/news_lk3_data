*2024-02-27 12:29:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177414) · `ta`

The Navy has banned fishing activities in the waters near the Vihara in the Jaffna - Madagal Sambilu (Jambukkoli Pattinam) Vihara, the area's fishermen said.

In 2013, after the Navy banned the fishermen from fishing in the seas behind the Sangamitha Vihara in the Sambilathur area, the Marines allowed the fishermen to engage in the area after being taken to the attention of the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

In this case, the Naval Officer, who is currently in charge of the area, has announced that he should not engage in fishing in the back of the Vihara.

The fishermen in the area say that if the fishermen are engaged in fishing, the Marines are chasing them away from the area.

Ahmed al -Qubeeri only survived the bomb that completely destroyed his family.

When 103 relatives were killed in the bombing of his house in Gaza, he was caught in Jericho occupied from his home on the west.

In those days, Israel's siege was unable to see his wife and three children.

He spoke to them by telephone, and he spoke to his wife Sirin on December 8, where the attack was attacked.

She knew that she would die, and if she had something wrong, I would not have to say that if she had done something wrong, I would not have to say that.

His wife and three girls were killed by a bomb that hit his cousin's house.

The bomb was killed by Ahmed's mother and his four brothers, including their family and relatives.

Ahmad is in a state of disrepair, which is unacceptable.

Ahmed, who is unable to get the bodies of his children, is still talking about it.

My girls are like a little bird and I feel like I am in a dream. I still can't think of what happened to them.

### Sri Lanka police chief appointment against constitution: Opposition Leader

ECONOMYNEXT – The appointment of Sri Lanka’s new police chief Deshbandu Tennakoon is against the constitution as the decision lacked required votes at the Constitutional Council, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Monday (26) appointed Deshbandu Tennakoon as the 36th Inspector General of Police (IGP) of the country after the Constitutional Council (CC) cleared the official who along with three other police officers were asked by the Supreme Court to compensate 2 million rupees in a fundamental rights case last year.

“CC didn’t approve IGP’s appointment. Votes: 4 for; 2 against; 2 abstentions. At least 5 votes are required for a decision,” Premadasa said in his X (Twitter) platform.

“Speaker has a casting vote only in case of a tie. 4/2 is not a tie! Constitution is being blatantly violated for the second time. Shame on you speaker!”

Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena was not reachable for a comment on the Opposition Leader’s claim.

### Dozens killed in attacks on mosque, church in Burkina Faso

Dozens of people have been shot dead at a mosque on the same day that a church was attacked, say the authorities in Burkina Faso.

It was during early-morning prayers that the gunmen surrounded the mosque in Natiaboani town.

“The victims were all Muslims, most of them men,” a local resident told the AFP news agency.

More than a third of Burkina Faso is currently under the control of Islamist insurgents.

The attackers are suspected to be Islamist fighters who also targeted soldiers and a self-defence militia stationed locally that same day.

Local media describe (in French) a huge invasion by hundreds of machine gun-wielding militants on motorbikes.

Unverified reports on social media suggest the death toll from the mosque attack could be much higher than the count given by officials.

Natiaboani, where those attacks happened, is in Burkina Faso’s troubled eastern region where multiple armed groups operate.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday he hopes to have a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza start by next Monday as the warring parties appeared to close in on a deal during negotiations in Qatar that also aim to broker the release of hostages.

The presence of both sides for so-called proximity talks - meeting mediators separately but in the same city - suggested negotiations were further along than at any time since a big push at the start of February, when Israel rejected a Hamas counter-offer for a four-and-a-half-month truce.

Biden said he hoped a ceasefire would start within days. “Well I hope by the beginning of the weekend, by the end of the weekend,” he said, when asked when he expected a ceasefire to start.

“My national security adviser tells me that we’re close. We’re close. We’re not done yet. My hope is by next Monday we’ll have a ceasefire,” Biden told reporters during a visit to New York.

Announcing the appointment, the President’s Media Unit (PMD) said the appointment was made under the powers vested in the President under Articles 41 and 61 of the Constitution.

According to the PMD, President’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake presented the appointment letter to Tennakoon at the President’s office.

Despite widespread objections by the Catholic Church, Civil Society groups and other parties, Tennekoon was appointed as the Acting IGP on 29 November 2023 by President Ranil Wickremesinghe after months of failing to appoint an IGP in March 2023 year which was when the former IGP C.D Wickramaratne was due to retire.

Wickramaratne was forced to remain in service until mid-November, due to the inability of relevant parties to find a suitable candidate for the post.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa levelled accusations against President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday, alleging that the appointment of Senior DIG Deshabandu Tennekoon as the Inspector General of Police was done in violation of the Constitution and without the necessary approval from the Constitutional Council.

Contrary to reports suggesting that the Constitutional Council had sanctioned Tennekoon’s appointment, Premadasa dismissed the assertions.

Taking to X (formerly Twitter) Premadasa said the Constitutional Council has not duly approved Tennekoon’s nomination as the IGP.

Premadasa said that during the Constitutional Council’s deliberations, four votes were cast in favour of Tennekoon, while two votes were against, and two members abstained. He highlighted that for the Constitutional Council to reach a conclusive decision, at least five votes are necessary. Premadasa further noted that the Speaker is not entitled to vote unless it’s to break a tie.

### Tamil Leader, Sritharan - the New Target of Racist and Majoritarian Communalists

*2024-02-27 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Tamil-Leader-Sritharan-the-New-Target-of-Racist-and-Majoritarian-Communalists/172-277760) · `en`

MP Sritharan has clearly stated his vision is NOT for the setting up of a separate state

Ever since Mr S. Sritharan was elected leader of the “Federal Party” or the “Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi” (ITAK), numerous articles with a racist bent have begun appearing in a number of ‘national news outlets’ in Colombo.

The articles have a common thread running through them - Sritharan’s visit to the LTTE war heroes’ cemetery in Killinochchi - and their (nationalist writers) interpretation of the symbolism of that visit.

One of these Prophets of Doom even went to the extent of giving a time-line when the next round of bombings would hit the country! In their myopic vision, Sritharan’s visit exposed him as an apologist of the LTTE and an unmitigated separatist. He is now being paraded via the media as an enemy. Most of these writers’ knowledge and interaction with the new ITAK leader is superficial.
