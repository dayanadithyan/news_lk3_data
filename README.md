### Avurudhu, Ramadan and Easter Sunday amid a crumbling economy

*2024-04-06 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Avurudhu-Ramadan-and-Easter-Sunday-amid-a-crumbling-economy/172-280265) · `en`

The trio of festivals-the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Ramadan and Easter Sunday fall within a short time of each other. The deadly Easter Sunday massacre of innocent civilians in churches and hotels in 2019 hit one of our biggest exchange earners badly.

The Easter Sunday bombings also marked the beginning of a dark era that saw the crumbling of our country’s economy which had just begun to take off after the near three-decade-long terrorist war was brought to a close.

President of the Cultural Triangle Hoteliers Association in May 2019, told the Anadolu Agency that foreign tourist arrivals plunged by a staggering 70.8% in May, followed by 57% in June and 46.9% in July, compared to 2018.

Tourism is one of the largest foreign exchange earners in the country.

### Karuna loses Eastern battle but Prabhakaran loses Eelam war

*2024-04-06 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Karuna-loses-Eastern-battle-but-Prabhakaran-loses-Eelam-war/172-280268) · `en`

The once-powerful Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) waged war against the Sri Lankan state for over thirty years. The LTTE known popularly as the Tigers was the determining force in Sri Lankan politics for nearly two decades. The decline of the LTTE began in 2004 when its Batticaloa and Amparai district  special commander Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan  alias “Col” Karuna led an eastern tiger revolt against the LTTE supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran. Although “Col” Karuna - also  known as “Karuna  Ammaan” - was defeated militarily by the LTTE, subsequent events demonstrated that the Eastern split weakened the LTTE considerably and ultimately led to its downfall in 2009.

### A terrorist attack senselessly politicized

*2024-04-06 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/A-terrorist-attack-senselessly-politicized/172-280266) · `en`

However, it must be the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) that is  most happy about the implication of India in the incident, as it had been accused for the past three years of the crime

Despite former President Maithripala Sirisena seeming to have landed in hot water over his recent statement on the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks, so long as his motive is not clear one should not jump the gun to call him a fool.

Sirisena while talking to media in Kandy claimed on March 22 that he knew who really carried out the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks and that he was prepared to disclose the information if the judiciary ordered him to do so. The Sunday Times reported that on questioning by the CID he had stated that India was behind the attacks. He had claimed that an Indian diplomat whom he named had not only confessed to him about the attacks but also the reason.

These remarks were made by Dr. Arambepola during her participation in a press briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (05).

Every year, accidents stemming from the unsafe handling of fireworks mar the festive season. Thus, a plea is made for vigilance and caution with loved ones during this New Year period.

Additionally, in the preceding season, concerted efforts were made to raise awareness about dengue prevention. Gratitude is owed to health departments and media outlets for their significant contributions. Notably, compared to previous years, there has been a marked reduction in both dengue cases and fatalities.

### Michael Tissera the rare ‘gentleman cricketer’

When people who have the same first name meet up, there’s name-related humour. The more, the merrier, obviously, especially if they are good friends and enjoy friendly banter. Today I am thinking of three people who share the name Michael: Michael Tissera, Michael Sproule and Michael De Zoysa, all three who played cricket for St. Thomas’ College, Mt. Lavinia. The first of course is the bigger name associated with the gentleman’s game.

Today I remember these three gentlemen sending everyone into fits of laughter as they talked among themselves, each referring to the others by name. It went something along the following lines: ‘Yes Michael, as I was telling Michael…but Michael, when I explained to Michael, Michael kind of agreed, but then again Michael…’ And it went on!

### The Lasantha Wickrematunge legacy: Remembering his life and influence

5 April would have been the 66th birthday of one of the country’s most beloved, renowned journalists and human rights defenders Lasantha Wickrematunge who was assassinated at the age of 50. Many have been inspired by the work of this legendary figure. He was a fearless activist and fighter for a democratic Sri Lanka during the 26-year bloody civil war and he went on to win the hearts of millions of our countrymen for his unwavering pursuit of racial equality and human rights in our homeland.

I first met Lasantha when I was 14 years old in 2000. My family had just moved to Nugegoda for a short period and we lived one road down from his home. The boys around our area would often gather to play cricket outside after school and everybody in our neighbourhood would always point at his house and proudly boast to any visitors as to who our neighbour was.

In an era of escalating climate risks and impacts, the global financial system stands at a crossroads

In an era of escalating climate risks and impacts, the global financial system stands at a crossroads. Existing structures and frameworks are facing serious challenges in adjusting to a changing global environment in ways that acknowledge and address the imperatives of climate justice, equity, and the needs of developing countries. The urgency of reform or improvement has been highlighted by several recent initiatives and proposals, such as the Bridgetown Initiative 2.0, the Paris Pact for People and Planet, the V20 Accra-Marrakech Agenda, or the Ubuntu Initiative, and featured prominently in the climate negotiations as well.

### Racist politics raising its ugly head?

*2024-04-05 23:19:00* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Racist-politics-raising-its-ugly-head/4-760364) · `en`

On Saturday 30 March 2024 in a YouTube message, Sujeewa Bandara, former Secretary to the ousted President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, claimed that the people who gathered at the Mirihana house of Gotabaya seeking to remove him from power as president were not Sinhalese but Muslims.

This is absolute nonsense, calculated mischief and bankrupt politics. Video clips of the event show there were no Muslims there but all Sinhalese. Thus the statement, on the eve of presidential or general elections, seems to be aimed at rousing Sinhalese against Muslims – perhaps to come to power as they had done since the island’s independence in 1948.

Fortunately for Sri Lanka, Sinhalese have woken up and openly dismiss racist politics. All what they want is solution to their burning day-to-day economic problems caused by racist politics.

### Mannar Wind Farm Project: Another folly like Sinharaja logging project on the horizon?

A wind farm consisting of 30 towers generating 100MW (Phase 1 – Thambapawani) was established on the southern coast of Mannar Island in 2020, with financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The widespread criticism of this project due to its positioning within one of the main bird migratory corridors in the Asian region (detailed elsewhere in the article) was largely overlooked or ignored due to the economic priorities that prevailed at the time, as it happened with the now infamous Canadian-funded Sinharaja Mechanised Logging Project of the 1960s and 70s.

### Proportion of Tamil youth in public institutions, tri-forces must be increased: AKD

Jaffna, April 05 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that both Sinhala and Tamil people have a right to interact with the State in their own languages, NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that the proportion of the Tamil youth in public institutions, tri-forces and important sectors should be increased.

Speaking at the Northern Provincial Conference of Ceylon Teachers Service Union yesterday, he said it was vital to defeat the racial political culture in the country on behalf of the future generation.

"Our main political stream has adopted rival politics so far. Sinhala people in the South were organised against the North. Tamil people in the North were organised against Sinhala people in the South. We need to put a stop to this racial political culture. That is for our future generation," he said.

Dissanayake appealed to Tamil politicians in the North saying that if they were really concerned about the issues faced by the Tamil people, they need to unite.

KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian officials claimed Friday they used a barrage of drones to destroy at least six military aircraft and badly damage eight others at an airfield in Russia’s Rostov region, while Russian defense officials claimed they intercepted 44 Ukrainian drones and that only a power substation was damaged in the attack.

The assault appeared to be one of Kyiv's biggest air attacks in the war, coming as its forces step up their assaults on Russian soil. The Associated Press could not independently verify either side's claims.

Russia has escalated attacks on civilian infrastructure, including Ukraine’s power plants, in recent weeks, signaling a new and potentially dangerous phase in the conflict as both sides struggle to achieve significant advances on the ground.

The overnight attack targeted a military airfield near Morozovsk in Russia and was conducted by Ukraine’s Security Service in cooperation with the army, Ukrainian intelligence officials told the AP.

Many speculate what the State of the Nation would be today if Lasantha Wickrematunge were alive. I have thought about it too. But, then I know. If it were not on that fateful day, the 8th of January 2009 it would have been another day. It is said that the greatest aphrodisiac known to man is the power of man over man. Lasantha had to be killed for one man’s power over all men in Sri Lanka. He may be power hungry, yet be a coward who would use minions to do such a dastardly crime for some petty gain, but the Boss would convince himself that he didn’t do it. He may even be cowardly enough to go overseas to convince himself that he was away from the country when the murder was being perpetuated.

Lasantha would have been 66 years young today. Did he not have a right to see his family grow? tousle his children’s hair? That was not even a thought that crossed a narcissist’s mind. Who was Lasantha? Just another man.

### ‘No ground’ for India’s request for return of Kachchatheevu: Minister Douglas

The statements coming out of India on “reclaiming” Kachchatheevu island from Sri Lanka have “no ground”, the Sri Lankan Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda has said.

The senior Sri Lankan Tamil politician’s comments came days after the Narendra Modi government targeted the Congress and its ally the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu accusing them of overlooking national interests in the ceding of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka in 1974.

The BJP has also been targeting the two parties for not ensuring the rights of the fishermen wanting to fish in waters around the Katchatheevu island.

“It is the election time in India, it is not unusual to hear such noises of claims and counterclaims about Kachchatheevu,” Devananda told reporters in Jaffna on Thursday, 4 April.

“I think India is acting on its interests to secure this place to ensure Sri Lankan fishermen would not have any access to that area and that Sri Lanka should not claim any rights in that resourceful area”, Devananda said.
