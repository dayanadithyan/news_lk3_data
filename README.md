### Sri Lanka BOP surplus to June 2024 running slightly behind last year

ECONONYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s balance of payments is still strongly in surplus in 2024 under the current interest rate structure, but is running slightly behind 2023, official data show.

Sri Lanka had recorded a BOP surplus (as defined) of 1,761 million US dollars by June 2024, down from 1,957.6 million dollars a year earlier.

Broadly, the BOP surplus is an improvement in net international reserves, and is a reliable figure unlike numbers like ‘current account’ balances which can be subject to large errors.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has run deflationary policy to collect reserves.

Under IMF programs, a central bank is able to collect reserves soon after hiking rates and contracting domestic credit, but misses reserve targets as the economy recovers and a narrow call money rate is targeted with excess liquidity on mathematical formulae (real interest rates or growth), critics have said.

*2024-08-09 06:07:51* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Adapting-concepts-of-Islamic-Finance-to-an-effective-debt-restructuring-mechanism/4-765311) · `en`

Islamic Finance (IF) is based on the Shariah principles which are interpreted via Quran and Sunnah. It is operated currently globally not only in Muslim countries, in other Western and Eastern countries which are based on conventional banking principles. Hence, it is imperative to analyse how the IF can be adopted as a global financial system in order to address most of the current economic hazards in the world.

In Islam, it highly considers that the resources are needed to fulfil the material requirements of both individual and society. The high concern and knowledge on these ethical principles are directed to the personal and societal justice and tranquillity which is the way to the fair financial system. Especially, in the event of handling the distressed customers in the financial institutions, the principles of IF can be successfully adapted.

### Pavithra to back RW for Presidency

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Ratnapura district stalwart Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi will back President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the upcoming Presidential election.

In a statement, Wanniarachchi who is also the Irrigation, Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation Minister said she had arrived at the decision to support Wickremesinghe after lengthy discussions with party members, social activists, and other parties.

Over 92 Government MPs have already declared their support for Ranil Wickremesinghe, openly defying the SLPP’s decision to nominate Namal Rajapaksa as its Presidential candidate. This growing faction of MPs, including Pavithra Wanniarachchi, signals a significant split within the party, as many choose to back Wickremesinghe’s independent candidacy over the SLPP’s official nominee.

Your account underscores the significant technological advancements and strategic adaptations that have shaped contemporary warfare.

In the north, the Russians made good progress until they reached the Ukrainian capital, Kiiv, where the air force tried to capture the Antonov Airport. Here, the strong Ukrainian resistance stopped them in their ways and eventually pushed them backwards.

In the south, the Russian forces attacked the port of Mary, as the Russians were deeply infiltrated and crossed the Dinipper River, crossing the Dinipper River before they were stopped by high forces outside Mikola.
