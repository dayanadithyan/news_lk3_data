Political commentators also stated that the general election and the presidential election will depend on the way Tamil political parties will be supported.

These conditions may be very different with the political leadership that is known to the North and East as well as the plantation.

The support of the Ilangaitamil Auru Kachchi party and support of the Muslim parties will be the same.

The reason is that the TNA leader appears to be the leader of the TNA and the leader of the Tamil National Alliance.
