Colombo, May 10 (Daily Mirror) - Speculation is rife in political circles that the Election Commission announced the plan for the conduct of the presidential election interpreting the Constitution in a bid to suppress any internal political discourse for a possible snap general election, Daily Mirror learns.

There are talks that President Ranil Wickremesinghe might consider a general election ahead of the presidential election in case the government fails to secure the next tranche of the IMF Extended Fund Facility.

However, the Election Commission announced the legal provisions for the conduct of the Presidential election including the timeframe for taking polling to preempt any hush-hush project for a general election.

### Seven reasons why I would not vote for a socialist utopia

*2024-05-10 05:39:47* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Seven-reasons-why-I-would-not-vote-for-a-socialist-utopia/4-761621) ¬∑ `en`

Effectively steering the economic agenda of an entire nation requires an entirely different skill set

There is a certain age that socialism sounds super sweet. Who wouldn‚Äôt appreciate a system in which everyone lives merrily, receives free education and healthcare, shares their food with others, and experiences a sense of community and compassion? Who would not want a highly paying government job whether you study hard or not?

In this ideal society, there are no grievances about the contributions made for the greater good. Individuals are duly recognised with bronze medals for their exemplary efforts. We hold admiration for the industriousness displayed in factories and fields, where the masses work diligently and joyfully express their solidarity through revolutionary songs. We applaud when a leader reminiscent of Lenin emphasises that the best things are for the children. Truly, this superlative utopia leaves no room for comparison.

The aim of these states is to partner with Sri Lanka and create a positive opinion in the eyes of the people and those in governance as they continue their tug-of-war with China

In the lead up to Sri Lanka‚Äôs Presidential election in October 2024, there have been numerous visits by foreign governments to create a good rapport with the various candidates. Visits by great powers to Sri Lanka appear to be a tradition before a national election or during global calamities. My analyses over the years indicate an increase in the frequency of interactions and their breadth during the visits.

In order to ascertain this tug-of-war, this article is divided into three sections: first, the QUAD visits; second, the Chinese engagements, and third Sri Lanka‚Äôs future in the Indian Ocean.

The importance of entrepreneurs as the backbone of our economy should be recognised and honoured

Sri Lanka has been through an unprecedented macroeconomic crisis with a complete economic meltdown since 2022 resulting from years of financial mismanagement, and the current global recession resulted from the scarring effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and many other factors. To date, the country indicates signs of stabilisation but, still faces challenges with elevated poverty levels, income inequality, and labour market concerns.

Given these challenges, the Government needs to carefully plan monetary and fiscal policies and implement growth-enhancing structural reforms to emerge from the current economic crisis, while laying the foundation for improving long-term green, resilient, and inclusive growth prospects. Future generations desperately require us to develop our country to give them a chance to live a comfortable life when it becomes their turn.

### Plantation workers' salary increase -Harini Amarasuriya

*2024-05-10 02:14:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183101) ¬∑ `ta`

Harini Amarasuriya criticizes the government's plan to increase plantation workers' daily wage to 1700 rupees, arguing it's a deceptive move. She suggests changing the basic salary instead. The government's gazette notification, she claims, is a ploy to mislead workers, as plantation companies are likely to challenge it. She also criticizes an amendment aimed at protecting night-shift women workers, arguing it fails to address their real issues like transport facilities.

üü©

Gazette Notification on Plantation Workers' Salary Increase Action. National People's Power Member Harini Amarasuriya said the government should change their basic salary if they need to carry out a salary increase.

He said this while addressing the debate on the Parliament on Thursday (9).

The government has issued a gazette notification to increase the daily salary of plantation workers to 1700 rupees. This is the play that deceives workers. If the government is increasing the salaries of plantation workers, they must change their basic salary and thereby convert the base salary to 1700 rupees.

On the contrary. Salary Increase is a play -labeled play by the president on May 1st. Everyone, including the President and the Minister of Labor, know that plantation companies go to court against the gazette notification. They know that this cannot be implemented.

So the salary increase for plantation workers is a gazette notification to mislead the plantation workers and deceive them.

### How filmmakers and lawmakers view people‚Äôs trust - EDITORIAL

Sri Lankans may be wary of trusting their instincts given their bad experiences with politicians. This is a country where the majority of the citizenry hasn‚Äôt had the fortune of receiving a university education. Hence, for some of them, trust must be built on instinct.

This instinct is the tool people relied on when electing Gotabaya Rajapaksa as president. He was the last Executive of this country who was elected through the vote of the people. The instinct in people that this president would deliver proved the former horribly wrong.

This is a country where its regime initiates programmes in a hurry and then repents. The latest is the new visa system where users are subject to paying higher fees. The new visa portal- which operates online- replaces the old system where visas were issued more efficiently through an Electronic Travel Authorization system. Now there is all-round criticism aimed at the new visa system.

Fitch Ratings yesterday announced it has affirmed the rating on SriLankan Airlines Government-Guaranteed bonds at ‚ÄòC‚Äô.

The US$ 175 million government guaranteed 7 percent unsecured bonds are due 25 June 2024.

The rating on the bonds is driven by the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee of the government of Sri Lanka (Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating: ‚ÄòRD‚Äô).

SriLankan Airlines bonds are rated at ‚ÄòC‚Äô, factoring in Fitch‚Äôs view of average to below-average recovery prospects following a default, in line with the agency‚Äôs Corporates Recovery Ratings and Instrument Ratings Criteria, and Country-Specific Treatment of Recovery Ratings Criteria.

The bonds of issuers that are very close to default show little distinction between ‚ÄòRR4‚Äô and ‚ÄòRR6‚Äô recoveries. Therefore, Fitch has not assigned a Recovery Rating to the bond.

It is reported that if the current increased sea temperature lasts a month, the coral reefs around Sri Lanka will be at risk.

The newly appointed Director General of the National Water Research Research Development Management (Nara), Dr. KK Arulanandan, said this to an English media.

The temperature of the sea should be fluctuated at 27-28 degrees Celsius for the formation of coral reefs.

He pointed out that if the current increased temperature lasts a month or more, coral reefs are expected to be destroyed.

When the heat of seawater increases more than usual, corals lose their color and begin to bleed. This will help you know the destruction of coral reefs. If the coral reefs are destroyed, a large number of marine life, including fish, will be affected. ‚Äù. Remble

The legality of a non-citizen serving as a political party secretary in Sri Lanka is unclear due to the lack of legal reference requiring party officers to be citizens. The Elections Commission hasn't verified citizenship status, suggesting that the situation of Diana Gamage, a non-citizen secretary, doesn't significantly impact the party's legality.

"The Elections Commission has not been able to check whether officers of political parties are Sri Lankan citizens. There is no legal reference to that it is needed. I do not think that the post of Mrs. Diana Gamage is a serious interruption to the legalization of the party. "
