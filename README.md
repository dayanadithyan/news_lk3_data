As part of its efforts to protect Sri Lanka's wild elephant population, the CEB is urging the public to report any instances of illegal connections to fences or wires by dialing 1987.

This initiative highlights the growing concern over the threat posed by such practices to the country's iconic wildlife.

The CEB acknowledged a decrease in elephant deaths from electrocution compared to previous years, with only 50 reported fatalities in 2023.

*2024-01-17 16:56:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96486/hrcsl-makes-key-recommendations-for-bill-on-commission-for-truth-unity-and-reconciliation-)*

The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has made five key recommendations pertaining to the Bill on the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka, which was published by way of gazette notification on 29 December 2023.

In a letter addressed to the President, the HRCSL recognized the well-established human right to truth under international law, emphasizing its crucial role in transitional justice.

However, it asserted that the promotion of this right should be aligned with the advancement of other transitional justice pillars, including accountability, reparations, and preventing the recurrence of past injustices.

1) Without delay, a high-level committee should be set up under the Presidential Secretariat, comprising pertinent experts and representatives from victim groups and civil society. The primary responsibility of this committee is to oversee the implementation of all positive recommendations from prior truth-seeking mechanisms, including the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC).

2) Programmes that inform the country as a whole about the findings of previous truth-seeking mechanisms should be carried out.

3) Establish a strong, impartial entity for investigating and prosecuting serious human rights violations and crimes, promptly providing it with essential resources and access to expertise, including international perspectives as needed.

4) Transitional justice in Sri Lanka should address both armed conflicts and civil disturbances, including insurrections, delving into their political and socioeconomic roots for a holistic national reckoning.

5) The Presidential Secretariat should serve as the host for any transitional justice mechanism in Sri Lanka, providing it with the utmost status and significance.

*2024-01-17 16:54:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96485/police-fire-tear-gas-and-water-cannons-at-iusf-protest-)*

In a statement, CEB’s media spokesperson Eng. Noel Priyantha highlighted that Sri Lanka has recorded a staggering 474 deaths of wild elephants in 2023, out of which at least 50 were reported to have died after being electrocuted by illegal power lines.

Raising concerns about the rapidly receding number of wild elephants in Sri Lanka, he underscored the importance of conserving this endangered species.

The spokesperson said the CEB has already taken measures to prevent illegal tapping into power lines and sought public assistance in its efforts to curb wild elephant deaths.

### Court Blocks University Student Protests in Colombo

*2024-01-17 16:21:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/17/court-blocks-university-student-protests-in-colombo/)*

### Sri Lanka achieves Hepatitis B control – WHO

*2024-01-17 16:12:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/17/sri-lanka-achieves-hepatitis-b-control-who/)*

COLOMBO (News 1st): Sri Lanka and the Maldives have achieved hepatitis B control, the World Health Organization announced on Wednesday (17) after an expert panel verified that the two countries have had consistently high coverage of hepatitis B vaccine doses in infants and a low prevalence of the deadly disease, corroborated through serological surveys conducted recently in both countries.

“I congratulate and commend Maldives and Sri Lanka on their achievement which once again demonstrates the earnest efforts being made by the health leaders and officials, health workers and the people of these countries towards health and well-being of communities,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director WHO South-East Asia.

The Expert Panel for Verification of Hepatitis B Control in WHO South-East Asia Region reviewed childhood immunization data from Maldives and Sri Lanka that showed consistent over 90% coverage with Hepatitis B vaccine doses provided during infancy for past many years. The experts also reviewed the findings of national surveys conducted among children in 2022-2023, in these countries.

“Based on the evidence presented to it, the Expert Panel concluded that the standards required for verification of Hepatitis B control have been met in both these countries and hence recommended that this important public health target has been achieved in Maldives and Sri Lanka”, said Dr Supamit Chunsuttiwat, chairperson of the Regional Expert Panel for verification of Hepatitis B control in South-East Asia.

The two countries join Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Thailand, who achieved the same feat in 2019.

Preventing Hepatitis B infection in infancy substantially reduces chronic infections and cases of liver cancer and cirrhosis in adulthood.

Hepatitis control continues to be an important public health initiative in the South-East Asia Region of WHO that comprises of 11 countries and is home to a quarter of the world’s population. The Region has an estimated 60 million people living with chronic hepatitis B and 218,000 dying every year of hepatitis B and C. Of the persons eligible for antiviral treatment only about 10% know their status and less than 5% of them are on treatment.

In 2016, the South-East Asia Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group endorsed a regional goal of hepatitis B control with a target of reducing hepatitis B prevalence to less than 1% among children aged at least 5 years.

Hepatitis B vaccine, as a part of the pentavalent vaccine, has been included in the national childhood immunization schedule of all countries of the Region, with three doses of this vaccine provided to children during their first year of life. Eight countries of the Region also have a policy of providing a birth dose of Hepatitis B vaccine to the newborn babies.

The Region made good progress in improving immunization coverage of the pentavalent vaccine until 2019. However, there was a decline in the coverage in several countries of the Region in 2020 and 2021 following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Intensive efforts in countries have resulted in the revival of childhood immunization coverage to pre-pandemic levels in several countries and the WHO and UNICEF estimates for 2022 show that the overall coverage of 3rd dose of pentavalent vaccine has recovered to the pre-pandemic level of 91% in the Region, a sharp increase from 82% coverage level reported in 2021.

Dr Khetrapal Singh said that countries also need to focus on improving the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose which continues to have a relatively slow uptake with an estimated coverage of only 58% in the Region in 2022. One of the key barriers for achieving high hepatitis B vaccine birth dose coverage remains the high proportion of home deliveries, that do not allow timely access of the Hepatitis B vaccine to these newborns, she said.

Inequities in immunization service delivery, suboptimal awareness and/training of health staff at birthing facilities; particularly in terms of false contraindications and/or fear of adverse events following immunization also contribute to sub-optimal coverage of Hepatitis B vaccination coverage, the Regional Director said.

The control of hepatitis B through immunization is a priority for our Region. Achieving the control goal is a critical step as we progress towards elimination of mother to child transmission of the hepatitis B virus, she said.

WHO’s “triple elimination initiative” encourages countries to simultaneously commit to such elimination together with HIV and syphilis – further pushing the agenda for integrated service delivery.

"Hepatitis must be prevented and treated. In addition to vaccination, continued efforts are needed to scale up other preventive measures such as safe injection, safe blood and infection prevention and control,” the Regional Director said.

### JVP’s Wasantha Samarasinghe files FR petition against Anti-Terrorism Bill

*2024-01-17 16:07:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96483/jvps-wasantha-samarasinghe-files-fr-petition-against-anti-terrorism-bill)*

President of the Inter-Company Employees’ Union Wasantha Samarasinghe has filed a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition before the Supreme Court, seeking a court order declaring that certain provisions of the proposed Ant-Terrorism Bill are unconstitutional.

Naming the Attorney General as the respondent in his petition, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) politburo member claimed that the Bill, presented to the Parliament by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, allowed for the unwarranted arrest and detention of persons by the Sri Lanka Police, Army and the Coast Guard, even in the absence of a reasonable cause.

He explained that this violated numerous constitutional fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom.

Samarasinghe therefore states that if the proposed Bill were to be passed, it must be approved by a two-thirds majority in Parliament, followed by a referendum.

The proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill, which will replace the current Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) was presented before the Parliament on 10 January, by Justice Minister Rajapakshe.

On 05 September 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to publish the Anti-Terrorism Bill, which was revised in accordance with the suggestions and opinions received by different parties in the government gazette, and to table the bill in parliament for passing.

Although the original draft bill had been published in the government gazette on 22 March 2023, it was later revised and re-drafted in consideration of all the opinions and suggestions received by the Ministry of Justice by various interested parties in this regard both locally and internationally.

### Sri Lanka cinnamon farmers GI-certified with IFC support

*2024-01-17 16:00:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-cinnamon-farmers-gi-certified-with-ifc-support-147598/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is implementing geographical indication (GI) for cinnamon, where the country has a 90 percent market share, with 45 farmers and processors being formally recognized in a initiative supported by Washington-based International Finance Corporation, the agency said.

Sri Lanka cinnamon obtained GI certification in 2022 with support from the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). The certification provides a competitive advantage, helping increase market differentiation, and allowing for a premium price from the consumer.

“To better position and promote high quality exports of Ceylon Cinnamon, the IFC … recognized the first batch of Geographical Indication (GI) certified Ceylon Cinnamon growers in the country,” the IFC said in a statement. (Press Release – Ceylon Cinnamon GI Event)

“We want to better position this unique spice for the authentic, quality it brings by reaching across high-value global markets,” said Alejandro Alvarez de la Campa, Country Manager for IFC Sri Lanka and Maldives.

As part of the project, market research provider Euromonitor International carried out an assessment to identify high-value markets for Ceylon Cinnamon. Australia, Brazil, Germany, UK and the USA were identified as potential markets.

The initiative was supported by the European Union (EU), the Sri Lanka Standards Institution, the Industrial Technology Institute and the Department of Cinnamon Development. (Colombo/Jan17/20204)

### Parliament Eyes Expanded Economic Zone in Indian Ocean

*2024-01-17 15:25:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/17/parliament-eyes-expanded-economic-zone-in-indian-ocean/)*

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Sri Lankan Parliament's Sectoral Oversight Committee on International Relations is exploring the potential of exploiting resources beyond the country's current exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

During a recent meeting on January 9, 2024, the committee, chaired by MP Akila Ellawala, focused on the National Oceanic Affairs Committee Secretariat (NOACS), an agency under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responsible for maritime matters.

Dr. N.P. Vijayananda, the current chairperson of NOACS, presented to the committee the possibility of utilizing a sea area up to 250 nautical miles beyond the existing 200-nautical-mile EEZ for economic activities.

This area falls under the continental shelf jurisdiction as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Dr. Vijayananda emphasized the need for regional cooperation, particularly with India, to access this area. He highlighted the region's potential for fuel exploration and its significance for Sri Lanka's marine biodiversity.

Committee Chair Ellawala expressed the need for swift action in pursuing this opportunity.

He stated that the committee intends to request the relevant minister to expedite negotiations with neighboring countries and coordinate efforts with the Ministry of Defense.

### Sri Lanka’s Prison Population Sees Significant Rise

*2024-01-17 15:17:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/17/sri-lanka-s-prison-population-sees-significant-rise/)*

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Sri Lankan prison system has witnessed a recent increase in its inmate population, according to a statement released today by Prison Media Spokesman Gamini B. Dissanayake.

As of now, approximately 32,000 individuals are incarcerated in Sri Lanka's prisons.

In response to this rise, Dissanayake outlined efforts to manage the growing population.

He announced that convicts sentenced to one or two months for various offenses will be directed to Pallansena Prison Camp.

This move aims to ease the pressure on larger prisons and optimize resource allocation.

Furthermore, Dissanayake noted that some convicts are being sent to prison labor camps and open air prisons.

### Nurses Union Strike Disrupts Services in Parts of Sri Lanka

*2024-01-17 15:11:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/17/nurses-union-strike-disrupts-services-in-parts-of-sri-lanka/)*

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Government Nurses Union (GNU) launched a 24-hour strike today protesting what they deem an unfair disparity in allowance increases for doctors.

Union Secretary Ajith Ratnayake confirmed the strike will continue until 7 am tomorrow.

The move stems from a recent decision by the President to increase doctors' allowances by Rs. 35,000, a decision that other healthcare professionals feel unfairly excludes them.

Colombo National Hospital witnessed seemingly unchanged routines, while Gampaha District General Hospital reported normalcy in daily operations.

However, nurses at Matara General Hospital fully supported the strike, leaving patients impacted. This pattern continued in the north, with disruptions reported at both Kilinochchi District General and Vavuniya General Hospitals.

The union's primary grievance surrounds a recent allowance increase granted solely to doctors.

Ratnayake contends that such disparities are unjustifiable and detrimental to the entire healthcare system.

### Colombo port sees jump in traffic amid Red Sea tensions

*2024-01-17 15:02:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/17/colombo-port-sees-jump-in-traffic-amid-red-sea-tensions/)*

(Reuters) – Sri Lanka's Colombo port has seen a big jump in container volumes in recent weeks as vessels steering clear of tensions in the southern Red Sea have found it a convenient transit point, officials said on Tuesday.

Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have since November attacked ships in the Red Sea, part of a route that accounts for about 12% of the world's shipping traffic, in what they say is an effort to support Palestinians in the war with Israel.

In response, some shipping companies have instructed vessels to sail around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, a slower and more expensive route.

Due to Colombo's strategic location, stopping at the port gives ships convenient access to the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia, said Lal Weerasinghe, a senior official at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).

"When ships come past South Africa, Colombo is the first hub they meet…Singapore is further away. So this is the easiest port to access," Weerasinghe said.

Port of Colombo is a key port between Africa, the Middle East and East Asia and handled 6.94 million 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU) in 2023, a 2% jump for the year, SLPA data showed. In December, TEUs jumped 15% on year.

Over the last four to six weeks, shipping lines requested more berthing windows at the port's three terminals and transhipment volumes from neighbouring India also grew, two terminal operators said.

"We typically handle about 5,000-5,500 TEUs (per day) but since late last year there has been an increase of about 1,000 TEUs per day," said Weerasinghe.

"We were forced to decline requests from about four shipping lines to increase traffic because it would cause delays for existing customers."

As much as 50% of the uptick is from Mediterranean Shipping Company, the leading container shipping company, Weerasinghe added.

Shipping companies are also increasingly using Colombo as a relaying port, sometimes offloading their entire cargo to a different ship, he added.

Vessel calls have risen at other Colombo port terminals too.

"There is a lot of transhipment from India. We are hoping increased traffic will help Colombo port edge closer to double-digit growth in the first quarter," said an official from a privately-run terminal.

He declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media.

### Sri Lanka manufacturing, services expand in Dec in festive demand: PMI

*2024-01-17 14:40:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-manufacturing-services-expand-in-dec-in-festive-demand-pmi-147560/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s manufacturing has expanded for the second month in December 2023, and service maintained strong growth, driven by holiday demand and tourism, based on a Purchasing Managers’ Index compiled by the central bank.

The manufacturing PMI was 52.7 above the 50 points, but slightly the 57 point, expansion seen in November.

“The increases in New Orders and Production were driven by the manufacture of food & beverages sector with the seasonal demand,” the statement said.

“However, New Orders and Production in manufacture of textiles & apparel sector declined during the month, which mainly contributed to the decline in Employment as well.”

Expectations for the manufacturing activities for the next three months were positive.

“However, the firms are concerned about the impact of tax revisions from January 2024, and the shipping disruptions due to the unrest in the Red Sea,” the statement said.

The Services PMI was 58.9 percent, also sharply above 50, and close to 59.4 points in November.

“Accordingly, significant improvements were observed in business activities related to other personal service activities, transportation and accommodation, food and beverage sub-sectors, amid the festive and holiday seasons, and tourist arrivals reaching its peak,” the statement said.

“Further, wholesale and retail trade subsector showed a strong growth due to seasonal sales. Meanwhile, financial services also improved further in line with the increase in lending activities.” (Colombo/Jan17/2024)

### Human immunoglobulin scandal: Seven accused including ex-Health Secretary further remanded

*2024-01-17 14:29:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96481/human-immunoglobulin-scandal-seven-accused-including-ex-health-secretary-further-remanded)*

Seven suspects including the former Secretary to the Ministry of Health, Janaka Chandragupta, were further remanded on Wednesday (Jan.17) over the controversial procurement of substandard human immunoglobulin vials.

As such, on the orders of Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court, the seven accused were put behind bars on remand until January 24.

Chandragupta was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on December 18, when he arrived at the premises to record a statement substandard human immunoglobulin scandal.

On December 14, Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama had declared that the actions of the former Secretary of the Ministry of Health pertaining to the process of purchasing the batch of ‘substandard’ human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were deemed suspicious.

Thus, the magistrate also ordered that all responsible parties be arrested and produced before the court irrespective of their positions, for the administration of justice over the providing of substandard medicine to the public.

Several high-profile arrests have been made thus far in connection with the case, including that of the former Secretary of the Ministry of Health, the Director of the Health Ministry’s Medical Supplies Division and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the relevant company which is said to have imported the batch of substandard Immunoglobulin vials by forging documents.

### Education of children directly impacts overall success of the nation – Saman Ekanayake

*2024-01-17 14:22:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96480/education-of-children-directly-impacts-overall-success-of-the-nation-saman-ekanayake-)*

President’s Secretary Mr. Saman Ekanayake underscored the pivotal role of education in shaping the lives of children, emphasizing that it is the sole pathway to their success. He highlighted that the successful completion of education leads to the formation of informed citizens, directly impacting the overall success of the nation.

President’s Secretary, Mr. Saman Ekanayake, made this statement during his participation in the ceremony held recently to inaugurate the provision of a fully equipped library to Konkadawala Vidyalaya, Navagaththegama.

These remarks were expressed during Mr. Ekanayake’s participation in a ceremony, where a fully equipped library was provided to Konkadawala Vidyalaya, Navagaththegama.

With the guidance of President’s Secretary Mr. Saman Ekanayake and the support of Chinese financial assistance, two fully equipped libraries were established at Konkadawala Vidyalaya, Navagaththegama, and Duwa Junior College, Negombo, facilitated by the intervention of the President’s Office.

Each library, costing Rs. 02 million, is stocked with essential books for students ranging from grade 6 to grade 11. The primary aim of this initiative is to assist rural students facing economic challenges, fostering a future generation enriched with knowledge.

During his speech, Mr. Ekanayake shared that the idea of providing libraries to these schools stemmed from a conversation with the Chinese Deputy Ambassador to Sri Lanka, who expressed the possibility of supporting a Rs. 04 million project. He selected two schools, reflecting on the potential impact these libraries could have on the education of children attending these institutions over the next decade. Mr. Ekanayake, drawing from his own experiences of receiving primary education in a similar small school, emphasized the importance of supporting these children’s education to pave the way for their future.

He shared a poignant story about the Chinese Deputy Ambassador’s father. ‘To the best of my knowledge, the father of the present Chinese Deputy Ambassador, who is in attendance today, worked as a farmer. In the eighth grade, the Chinese Deputy Ambassador’s father insisted that he join in planting activities, leading to significant back pain after an hour of labour. Upon sharing this discomfort with his father, the advice given was, “If you don’t excel in your studies, you may find yourself compelled to engage in this occupation.”

Embracing that valuable lesson, the Deputy Ambassador has risen to the position of Deputy Ambassador today, operating on an international stage. This success underscores the vital message that children should internalize — education stands as the sole means to triumph in life. It is imperative to recognize that, without education, the future holds uncertainties not just for the individual children but also for the prosperity of the entire nation’.

The event was attended by State Minister Arundika Fernando, Member of Parliament Dr. Kavinda Jayawardene, Chinese Deputy Ambassador to Sri Lanka YANWAI ZHU, officials from the Ministry of Education, Principals, teaching staff, parents and a group of students.

The Government of Sri Lanka has called for Expressions of Interest (EOIs) for the divestiture of Litro Gas Lanka Ltd. (LGL) and the Litro Gas Terminal Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. (LGTL).

According to the State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit, the divestiture is slated to be completed through a two-stage competitive bidding process, with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP (DTTILLP) serving as the Transaction Advisor.

As such, all interested parties are invited to access the Request for Expression of Interest document from the following website: https://www.treasury.gov.lk/web/sru-entities-to-be-divested/section/litro-gas-lanka

With a market share of 85%, LGL is the largest supplier of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) in Sri Lanka, and engages in the importing, filling, distribution and sale of LPG in Sri Lanka.

LGL operates an LPG filling plant in Kerawalapitiya with a filling capacity of 1,600 MTs/day, while a second filling plant located at Mabima is under construction.

Meanwhile, LGTL provides bulk storage and pipeline facilities for LPG, with their key storage facility strategically located in Kerawalapitiya, with a capacity of 8,000 MT.

It is also to be noted that surplus land is available at Kerawalapitiya for further expansion of both, LGL and LGTL.

Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva commended the economic reform endeavors pursued by Sri Lanka during a meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

She emphasized the importance of the IMF Board approving the first review of Sri Lanka’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program in December 2023, characterizing it as a recognition of the country’s significant reform initiatives.

Georgieva expressed her positive expectations on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), stating that the reforms undertaken by Sri Lanka are beginning to yield positive results.

“Very good meeting with Ranil Wickremesinghe at WEF24. IMF Board approval of the First Review of the EFF program in December was a recognition of the important reforms Sri Lanka has pursued. These reforms are starting to pay off,” she tweeted.

Meanwhile, Pakistan’s caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar also met with President Wickremesinghe on the sidelines of the Forum.

There were “opportunities for investments in renewable energy, agriculture modernization, tourism, IT and infrastructure development through public-private partnerships,” Ranil Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by his media division.

Wickremesinghe is in Switzerland to attend the 54th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum.

Forthcoming laws and commissions would enhance market access, foster trade and investment and ensure the competitiveness of the island’s economy, he told potential foreign investors.

Wickremesinghe sought to reassure them by mentioning the removal of restrictions and ongoing economic reforms.

He pointed out the country’s ongoing and pending FTAs with Singapore, Thailand, India and China, its initiatives to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and the benefits of GSP Plus for access to European markets.

Representing the Sri Lankan business community at the event were John Keels Holdings Chairman Krishan Balendra, Commercial Bank CEO/MD Sanath Manatunge, Colombo Stock Exchange Chairman Dilshan Wirasekara, Janashakthi Insurance Deputy Chairman Prakash Schaffter, Sri Lanka Ports Authority Chairman Keith Bernard, Aitken Spence Joint Deputy Chairpersons/MDs Stasshani Jayawardena and Parakrama Dissanayake, Galle Face Group Chairman Sanjeev Gardiner, Sri Lankan Airlines Chairman Ashok Pathirage, People’s Bank Chairman Sujeewa Rajapakse, and ⁠Dialog Axiata CEO Supun Weerasinghe.

### Sri Lanka discusses economic ties, EDR with India envoy

*2024-01-17 12:00:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-discusses-economic-ties-edr-with-india-envoy-147549/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s State Minister of Finance met with the Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha to discuss cooperation on economic concerns.

“Engaged in fruitful discussions on fostering mutual economic partnerships between our two countries, collaborative initiatives aimed at enhancing economic ties and progress on debt restructuring process,” State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said on X.

So far India has executed over a billion US dollars of projects in the island.

Investors from India, Jio Platforms Ltd and Pettigo – a unit of Reliance industries, have expressed interest in buying Sri Lanka Telecom. India’s Airtel already has a mobile unit in Sri Lanka’s telecom sector.

India is already involved in the country’s ports sector. The Adani group is building a container terminal in Colombo Port.

Sri Lanka blocked a Chinese power sector investment in the North, reportedly under Indian pressure.

The government has also temporarily halted foreign research ships after strong security concerns raised by neighbour India after the visit of two Chinese research vessels.

Political analysts say India has influence in the Sri Lankan election given it is closely connected with ethnic minority Tamils especially those who came down to the island nation from India as plantation workers during the British rule. India is involved in many housing projects for this group.

### High Posts Committee approves 5 top appointments including PUCSL chief

### China’s population drops for second straight year despite efforts to boost birth rate

*2024-01-17 11:39:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96472/chinas-population-drops-for-second-straight-year-despite-efforts-to-boost-birth-rate-)*

China’s population dropped by 2 million people in 2023 in the second straight annual drop as births fell and deaths jumped after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the government said Wednesday.

The number of deaths more than doubled to 690,000. Demographers were expecting a sharp rise in deaths because of COVID-19 outbreaks that started at the end of the previous year and continued through February of last year. The total population stood at 1.4 billion, the statistics bureau said. China, long the most populated country in the world, dropped into second place behind India in 2023, according to U.N. estimates.

The number of births fell for the seventh year, reflecting a fall in the birth rate that is a long-running economic and societal challenge for China. The population is aging steadily, which could slow economic growth over time and challenge the nation’s ability to provide for a larger elderly population with fewer workers.

The number of births fell by 540,000, which was less than in previous years. About 9 million babies were born in 2023, half of the total in 2016. All the figures are estimates based on surveys and do not include Hong Kong and Macao. China conducts a full census every 10 years.

China, which once sought to control population growth with its one-child policy, is now facing the opposite problem. The government has sought to encourage births since easing the policy over 2015 to 2016 to allow a second child and then a third child in 2021, but with little success.

People are marrying later and sometimes choosing not to have children. Even those that do often have only one child because of the high cost of educating children in cities in a highly competitive academic environment. The population of women of child-bearing age has also fallen.

The working-age population, defined as those between 16 and 59 years old, fell to 61% of the total population, continuing a gradual decline. The proportion of those aged 60 and older ticked up to 21%. The official retirement age in China is 60 years old for men and 50 or 55 for women.

It is not clear how many people died from COVID-19 because of the sudden end to China’s “zero-COVID” restrictions in December 2022. The government has reported about 80,000 COVID-related deaths from December to February but experts believe it is much higher. Studies have estimated it could have reached 1.4 million or 1.9 million deaths.

The drop in population is expected to be less this year, because of the waning effects of the pandemic and the fact that it is the year of the dragon, considered an auspicious year to have children, an expert said at a forum earlier this week, according to the China Daily, an English-language state-owned newspaper.

But Yuan Xin, a professor at Nankai University and vice-president of the China Population Association, added that “the downward trend in China’s total population is bound to be long-term and become an inherent characteristic.”

### உச்சம் தொட்ட காய்கறி விலைகள்

பண்டிகைக் காலத்தின் பின்னர் மரக்கறிகளின் விலை குறைவடையும் என முன்னறிவிக்கப்பட்ட போதிலும், உண்மையில் விலைகள் இன்னும் உயர்வாகவே காணப்படுகின்றன. பெரும்பாலான காய்கறி வகைகளின் விலை இப்போது ஒரு கிலோகிராம்  ரூ.1,000ஆக இருப்பதுடன், கரட் மற்றும் பீன்ஸ் அதிகபட்ச அளவை எட்டி கிலோ ரூ.1,200 ஆக பதிவாகியுள்ளது.

நேற்றைய தினம், நாட்டில் அதிக விலையில் பதிவு செய்யப்பட்ட காய்கறி விலையாக பேலியகொடையில் உள்ள புதிய மெனிங் சந்தையில் ஒரு கிலோ கரட் ரூ. 1,400 ஆக பதிவாகியது.

அதிகரித்து வரும் விலைகள் காய்கறி நுகர்வு குறைவதற்கு வழிவகுத்துள்ளது, பல நுகர்வோர் இந்த விலையில் அவற்றை கொள்வனவு செய்வதற்கான இயலாமையை வெளிப்படுத்துகின்றனர்.

ஏறக்குறைய அனைத்து காய்கறி வகைகளின் விலைகளும் அதிகரித்து, நிதி சவால்களை உருவாக்குவதாக மக்கள் தெரிவிக்கின்றனர்.

தற்போதைய சந்தை விலையில் பீன்ஸ் விலை ரூ. கிலோ 1,000. ஆனால், மற்ற காய்கறிகளின் விலையில் ஏற்ற இறக்கம் ஏற்பட்டு, பச்சை மிளகாய், தக்காளி போன்றவை முறையே கிலோ ரூ. 800 மற்றும் ரூ.350 ஆக குறைந்துள்ளது.மறுபுறம், எலுமிச்சை விலை கிலோ 500 ரூபாய் வரை அதிகரித்துள்ளது.

இதற்கிடையில், நாடு முழுவதும் உள்ள  சுற்றுலா விடுதிகள் மற்றும் விருந்தினர் விடுதிகளை நடத்தும் வணிக சமூகம், காய்கறிகளின் விலை உயர்வு தொழில்துறையை பாதித்துள்ளமை குறித்து கவலை தெரிவித்தனர்.

நுவரெலியா பொருளாதார மத்திய நிலையத்தின் வியாபாரிகள், மரக்கறிகளின் விலைகள் விண்ணை முட்டும் அளவிற்கு உயர்ந்துள்ளதாகவும், இதனால் கொள்வனவுகளில் பாரிய வீழ்ச்சி ஏற்பட்டுள்ளதாகவும் தெரிவித்தனர்.

கரட் கிலோ ரூ.2000, முட்டைகோஸ் ரூ.680, வெண்டைக்காய் ரூ.680 என விலை போனதை சுட்டிக்காட்டினர்.

சில்லறை சந்தையில் இதுவரை இல்லாத வகையில் விலையேற்றம் ஏற்பட்டுள்ளதாகவும், கிடைக்கும் காய்கறிகள் தரமற்றதாக இருப்பதாகவும் அவர்கள் சுட்டிக்காட்டினர்.

The Education Ministry has announced the dates to commence the second phase of the third term of government and government-approved private schools.

Accordingly, the second phase of the third school term is scheduled to begin on February 05 (Monday).

However, commencement of the second phase of the third term has been pushed back after Paper I and Paper II of the 2023 Advanced Level examination’s Agricultural Science subject was annulled and a new date was set for the test.

The Examinations Department said the new exam date and time would be as follows:

Time: Paper II (from 08:30 a.m. to 11:40 a.m.) / Paper I (from 01:00 p.m. to 03:00 p.m.)

On January 12, the Examinations Department decided to cancel the A/L exam’s Agricultural Science I & II question papers, due to reports that several questions of the paper had been leaked prior to the exam.

Two days later, the Agricultural Science teacher, 52, of a popular government school in Ampara was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in connection with the incident. Subsequently, a 38-year-old man who had served as the peon of the chief of the exam centre at the Moratuwa Maha Vidyalaya was also arrested over his suspected complicity.

### Sri Lanka Receives 117 Tonnes of Sunflower Oil

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Russian Federation has delivered 117 tonnes of sunflower oil to Sri Lanka as humanitarian assistance. The donation, handed over by Russian Ambassador Levan S. Dzhagaryan, was received with gratitude by Sri Lankan officials.

"This is the second batch of vegetable oil we have provided to Sri Lanka since September last year," Ambassador Dzhagaryan said during the handover ceremony. "We hope to continue our support, not only to the friendly people of Sri Lanka, but also to other countries in need across Africa and Asia."

The Ambassador acknowledged the ongoing challenges facing Russia, including international sanctions. He emphasized, however, that "thanks to the government's policies and President Putin's leadership, the Russian Federation has overcome many difficulties and emerged as Europe's top economy and the world's fifth, behind China, the United States, India, and Japan." He added, somewhat surprisingly, "It sounds a bit ironic, but thanks to the sanctions, we have boosted our domestic production and are moving forward under my president's guidance."

The sunflower oil donation comes amid a difficult period for Sri Lanka, with the country grappling with an economic crisis. The aid is aimed at supporting Sri Lankan households facing food shortages and rising prices.

### ණය ප්‍රතිව්‍යුහගත කිරීමේදී ගිවිසුම් දෙකක්

*2024-01-17 11:01:43 - [adalk](https://www.ada.lk/breaking_news/ණය-ප්‍රතිව්‍යුහගත-කිරීමේදී-ගිවිසුම්-දෙකක්/11-407592)*

රට ගොඩ නැගීමට ජනපති ගෙන යන වැඩ පිළිවෙළ හැර වෙනත් විකල්පයක් නැහැ

අඩපණ වූ සංවර්ධන කටයුතු පෙබරවාරි මාසයේ යළි අරඹනවා – පාර්ලිමේන්තු මන්ත්‍රී වජිර අබේවර්ධන.

රට යළි ගොඩනැගීම වෙනුවෙන් ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා ගෙන යන වැඩපිළිවෙළ හැර වෙනත් විකල්පයක් නොමැති බවත් එබැවින් සියලු පක්ෂ බේද පසෙකලා එම වැඩපිළිවෙළ සාර්ථක කර ගැනීමට දායක විය යුතු බව පාර්ලිමේන්තු මන්ත්‍රී වජිර අබේවර්ධන මහතා පැවසීය.

පෙබරවාරි මාසයෙන් පසු ලෝක බැංකුව, ජාත්‍යන්තර මූල්‍ය අරමුදල, ආසියානු සංවර්ධන බැංකුව මෙන්ම මිත්‍ර රටවල් සමඟ රට ඉදිරියට ගෙන යාමට අවස්ථාව උදා වී තිබෙන බවත් එය කඩා කප්පල් කිරීමට ඇතැම් පාර්ශ්ව දරන ප්‍රයත්න හඳුනා ගනිමින් ඒවා පරාජය කිරීමේ වගකීම ජනතාව සතු බවත් මන්ත්‍රීවරයා අවධාරණය කළේය.

පාර්ලිමේන්තු මන්ත්‍රී වජිර අබේවර්ධන මහතා මේ බව සඳහන් කර සිටියේ ‘ස්ථාවර රටකට සැවොම එක මඟකට’ මැයෙන් ඊයේ (16) ජනාධිපති මාධ්‍ය කේන්ද්‍රයේ පැවති ප්‍රවෘත්ති සාකච්ඡාවට එක්වෙමිනි.

එහි දී වැඩිදුරටත් අදහස් දැක් වූ පාර්ලිමේන්තු මන්ත්‍රී වජිර අබේවර්ධන මහතා මෙසේ ද පැවසීය,

ශ්‍රී ලංකාව වැනි දේශපාලන පක්ෂ 75ක් පමණ ඇති රටක් ලෝකයේ තවත් නැහැ. ඒ අනුවයි අප රටේ බෙදීම් නිර්මාණය කර තිබෙන්නේ. එය රට තුළ අසමගියක් නිර්මාණය කර තිබෙනවා. නිදහසින් පසු මෙරට ඇති වූ බොහෝ විනාශයන්ට ද එම තත්ත්වය හේතු වූවා. මෙම පක්ෂවලට මුදල් ලැබෙන්නේ කෙසේද ? වියදම් කරන්නේ කව්රුන් ද යන්න පිළිබඳව සොයා බැලීමට කිසිදු ක්‍රමවේදයක් නැහැ. එබැවින් ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා විසින් මෙම පක්ෂ මැතිවරණවලදී මුදල් වියදම් කරන ආකාරය සොයා බැලීමට හැකියාව ලැබෙන පනතක් පාර්ලිමේන්තුවේ සම්මත කර තිබෙනවා.

ඒ වගේම ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතාට මේ වන විට ලෝකයේම අවධානය යොමුව තිබෙනවා. ඒ වසරකුත් මාස හයක් තුළ අන්තයටම වැටී තිබූ රට යළි සංවර්ධනයේ මාවතට යොමු කළ නිසයි. ඒ වෙනුවෙන් ජනාධිපතිවරයා සෑම විදෙස් සංචාරයක්ම ඵලදායී ලෙස යොදා ගත් බවද සිහිපත් කළ යුතුයි.

ඒ වගේම මේ වන විට රට ගොඩ නැගීම වෙනුවෙන් ක්‍රියාවට නංවා තිබෙන්නේ 2020 දී පරාජය වූ අපගේ පක්ෂයේ ප්‍රතිපත්ති ප්‍රකාශනය බව පැවසිය යුතුයි. එසේ නම් ජනතාව මතක තබාගත යුතුව ඇත්තේ අද වන විට හිඟයකින් තොරව ඉන්ධන, විදුලිය, ගෑස් ඇතුළු අත්‍යවශ්‍ය ද්‍රව්‍ය භුක්ති විදින්නේ ඔවුන් විසින් පරාජය කළ ප්‍රතිපත්ති ප්‍රකාශනය ක්‍රියාවට නැංවීමෙන් බවයි. අද රට සාමාන්‍ය තත්ත්වය පත්ව තිබෙන්නේ එම ලියවිල්ල නිසා බව ඔබ සිහිතබා ගත යුතුයි.

එදා අප විසින් ටෝකියෝ සම්මේලනයට ඉදිරිපත් කළ “යළි පුබුදමු ශ්‍රී ලංකා” ග්‍රන්ථයේ ඇතුළත් කරුණු අද රජය විසින් ක්‍රියාත්මක කරමින් සිටිනවා. මේ රටේ දේශපාලනය කරන සියලු දෙනාම එය කියවා ගත යුතුයි.

අප තවදුරටත් එකිනෙකා විවේචනය කර ගැනීමෙන් ඵලක් නැහැ. අන්තයටම පිරිහුණු රට යළි ගොඩ නැගීමට ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා ගෙන යන වැඩපිළිවෙළ හැර වෙනත් විකල්පයක් නැහැ. අද ජනතාව පෝලිම් නැති යහපත් ජීවිතයක් ගත කරමින් සිටින්නේ එම වැඩපිළිවෙළ නිසයි. එබැවින් සියලු පක්ෂ මේ සමඟ එකට සිට ගත යුතුයි. මේ යන ගමන කවුරුන් විසින් හෝ වෙනස් කළොත් එහි වගකීම ඔවුන් විසින් දැරිය යුතුයි. දෙශපාලන වාසි වෙනුවෙන් ඇතැම් අවස්ථාවල සිදු කරන යම් යම් සාවද්‍ය ප්‍රකාශවල වගකීම ද එම පාර්ශ්ව විසින් දැරිය යුතුයි.

ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා 2022 වසරේදී වගකීම භාර ගන්නා අවස්ථාව වන විට මේ රට තුළ කිසිවෙකුටත් දේශපාලනය කිරීමේ හැකියාව තිබුණේ නැහැ. කිසිම සංවර්ධන කාර්යයක් කිරීමට කිසිවෙකුටත් ශක්තියක් තිබුණේ නැහැ. වසර තුනක් අතපසු වූ එම සංවර්ධන ක්‍රියාවලි ලබන පෙබරවාරි මාසයේ සිට යළි ආරම්භ කිරීමට හැකියාව මේ වනවිට ලැබී තිබෙනවා.

නමුත් මෙම රටේ සංවර්ධන ක්‍රියාවලිය අඩපණ කිරීම සඳහා ද ඇතැම් පාර්ශ්ව උත්සාහ ගනිමින් සිටිනවා. ඒ පිරිස් මේ දිනවල වැඩ වර්ජන රැල්ලක් දියත් කර තිබෙනවා. එය ලෝකය පුරා ප්‍රචාරය කිරීමෙන් මෙරට පැමිණෙන සංචාරයකයින් ප්‍රමාණය අඩු කිරීම ඔවුන්ගේ ප්‍රයත්නය වී තිබෙනවා . එමඟින් රටේ ආර්ථිකය බිද දැමිය හැකියි. ඒ හමුවේ රටට හිමි විය යුතු ඩොලර් බිලියන ගණනක් අහිමි වීමේ අවධානමක් පවතිනවා.

තවද ණය ප්‍රතිව්‍යූහගත කිරීම සඳහා ජපානය මෙන්ම පැරිස් සමාජය ඇතුළු මෙරට ණය හිමි රටවල් සමඟ එක් ගිවිසුමක් ද, චීනය සමඟ තවත් ගිවිසුමක් ද අත්සන් කිරීමට නියමිතයි. ඒ සමඟ පෙබරවාරි මාසයෙන් පසු ලෝක බැංකුව, ජාත්‍යන්තර මූල්‍ය අරමුදල, ආසියානු සංවර්ධන බැංකුව, ජයිකා ආයතනය මෙන්ම මිත්‍ර රටවල සහයෝගය ඇතුව රට ඉදිරියට ගෙන යාමට අවස්ථාව උදා වෙනවා. එය කඩාකප්පල් කිරීමට ඇතැම් පාර්ශ්ව උත්සාහ කළ හැකියි. එවැනි ප්‍රයත්නයන් හඳුනාගෙන ඒවා පරාජය කිරීම ජනතාව සතු වගකීමක් වනවා.

### ණය ප්‍රතිව්‍යුහගත කිරීමට ප්‍රධාන ණය හිමියන්ගෙ ප්‍රතිපත්තිමය එකඟත්වය

අනාගතවාදී දැක්මකින් යුතුව ශ්‍රී ලංකාව නව ආර්ථික ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ ක්‍රියාවලියෙහි නිරතව සිටිනවා

අනාගතවාදී දැක්මකින් යුතුව ශ්‍රී ලංකාව නව ආර්ථික ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ ක්‍රියාවලියෙහි නිරතව සිටින බව ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා සඳහන් කළේය.

ණය ප්‍රතිව්‍යුහගත කිරීමේ ක්‍රියාවලියේදී ශ්‍රී ලංකාව සාර්ථක ප්‍රගතියක් අත්කරගෙන ඇති බවත් ප්‍රධාන ණය හිමියන් ඒ සඳහා ප්‍රතිපත්තිමය වශයෙන් එකඟත්වය පළ කර ඇති බවත් ජනාධිපතිවරයා පැවසීය.

2023 වර්ෂයේ දෙසැම්බරයේ දී ජාත්‍යන්තර මූල්‍ය අරමුදල විසින් ශ්‍රී ලංකාවට අදාළ වැඩසටහනෙහි පළමු සමාලෝචනය අනුමත කිරීම මගින් 2024 වර්ෂයේදී ශ්‍රී ලංකාවට ස්ථාවරත්වයේ සිට යථා තත්ත්වයට පත්වීම සහ වර්ධනය දක්වා ප්‍රවේශ වීමේ වේදිකාව සැකසී ඇති බව ද ජනාධිපතිවරයා පෙන්වා දුන්නේය.

ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා මෙම අදහස් පළ කර සිටියේ ශ්‍රී ලංකා ආයෝජන මණ්ඩලය සහ ස්විස්-ආසියානු වාණිජ මණ්ඩලය එක්ව සංවිධානය කරන ලද ව්‍යාපාරික හමුවකට ඊයේ (15) ස්විස්ටර්ලන්තයේ දී එක් වෙමිනි.

ස්විස්ටර්ලන්තයේ දී පැවැත්වෙන ලෝක ආර්ථික සමුළුවේ 54 වන වාර්ෂික රැස්වීමට සමගාමීව මෙය සංවිධානය කර තිබු අතර, ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ ආර්ථික ප්‍රකෘතිය සම්බන්ධයෙන් අත්කර ගෙන ඇති සැලකිය යුතු ප්‍රගතිය සහ අනාගත වර්ධන අපේක්ෂාවන් පිළිබඳව ජනාධිපතිවරයා මෙහිදී කරුණු පැහැදිළි කළේය.

විවිධ දුෂ්කරතා මධ්‍යයේ වුවද ශ්‍රී ලංකාව ජාත්‍යන්තර මූල්‍ය අරමුදලේ වැඩසටහන තුළ සැලකිය යුතු කාර්ය සාධනයක් අත් කර ගෙන ඇති බවට පසුගියදා ජාත්‍යන්තර මූල්‍ය අරමුදලේ නියෝජිත කණ්ඩායම හමු වූ අවස්ථාවේ දී සිදු කළ ප්‍රකාශයද මෙහිදී ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා සිහිපත් කළේය.

ජාත්‍යන්තර මූල්‍ය අරමුදල සමඟ සහයෝගීතාවයෙන් ණය ප්‍රතිව්‍යුහගත කිරීමේ කටයුතු සාර්ථකව සිදු කරන බවත්, ණය හිමියන් සමග කටයුතු කිරීමේදි එවැනි සහයෝගීතාවක් අවශ්‍ය වන බවත් ජනාධිපතිවරයා අවධාරණය කළේය.

විදේශීය සෘජු ආයෝජන ඇතුළු ආයෝජන, අපනයන සහ සේවා හරහා රටේ ආර්ථිකය ප්‍රවර්ධනය කිරීමට රජය කටයුතු කරමින් සිටින බව ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා පෙන්වා දුන්නේය.

මෑත කාලීනව ශ්‍රී ලංකාව මුහුණ දුන් ආර්ථික අර්බුදය හේතුවෙන් ව්‍යාපාර, කුඩා ව්‍යවසායන් මෙන්ම සමස්ත ජනතාව කෙරෙහි අහිතකර ප්‍රතිවිපාක ඇතිවු බව සඳහන් කළ ජනාධිපතිවරයා ව්‍යාපාර සඳහා ඇති බාධක මෙන්ම විදුලිය සහ ඉන්ධන සැපයුම සඳහා ඇති බාධක ඉවත් කිරිම සඳහා 2022 සහ 2023 වර්ෂවලදී සිදුකළ ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ පිළිබඳව ද සඳහන් කළේය.

එමෙන්ම, ආනයන සීමා ලිහිල් කිරීම, විදේශ ප්‍රේෂණවල ද්‍රවශිලතාව නැවත යාථා තත්ත්වයට පත් කිරීම මෙන්ම 1977 වසරෙන් පසුව ප්‍රථම වරට ප්‍රාථමික ගෙවුම් ශේෂයේ අතිරික්තයත් වාර්තා කිරීමට හැකි වූ බව ද සඳහන් කළේය.

2023 වර්ෂයේ තුන්වන කාර්තුවේ සිට මුල්‍ය ස්ථාවරත්වය ඇතිවීම, උද්ධමනය සැලකිය යුතු ලෙස පහළයාම සහ සෘණ ආර්ථික වර්ධනය ආපසු හැරවීම වැනි ධනාත්මක දර්ශක පිළිබඳ ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා මෙහිදී පෙන්වා දුන් අතර 2023 වර්ෂයේදී ප්‍රාථමික අයවැයෙහි අතිරික්තයක් අත්කර ගැනීම කැපී පෙනෙන වර්ධනයක් සනිටුහන් කිරීමක් බව ද ප්‍රකාශ කළේය.

සිංගප්පූරුව, තායිලන්තය, ඉන්දියාව සහ චීනය සමඟ අවසන් වූ සහ ඉදිරියේදී එළැඹීමට නියමිත නිදහස් වෙළෙඳ ගිවිසුම් සහ අනෙකුත් දකුණු ආසියාතික රටවල් සමඟ පවතින වෙළෙඳ අවස්ථා පුළුල් කර ගැනීමේ සාකච්ඡා පිළිබඳව ද ජනාධිපතිවරයා මෙහිදී සිහිපත් කළේය.

කලාපීය විස්තිරණ ආර්ථික හවුල්කාරිත්වයට (RCEP) ඇතුළත් වීම සඳහා ශ්‍රී ලංකාව සිදු කර ඇති මුලපිරීම මෙන්ම යුරෝපීය වෙළෙඳපොළ වෙත ප්‍රවේශ වීම සඳහා GSP+ මඟින් සැලසෙන ප්‍රතිලාභ සම්බන්ධවද ජනාධිපතිවරයා පෙන්වා දුන්නේය.

පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්තිය, කෘෂිකාර්මික නවීකරණය, සංචාරක ව්‍යාපාරය, තොරතුරු තාක්ෂණ සහ යටිතල පහසුකම් සංවර්ධනය සඳහා රාජ්‍ය-පෞද්ගලික හවුල්කාරිත්වයන් ඇතිකර ගැනීම තුළින් ආයෝජනය කිරීමේ අවස්ථා පවතින බව ද ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා පැවසීය.

වෙළඳපල ප්‍රවේශය වැඩි දියුණු කිරීම, වෙළඳාම සහ ආයෝජන ප්‍රවර්ධනය කිරීම සහ ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ ආර්ථිකයේ තරඟකාරිත්වය සහතික කිරීම අරමුණු කරගනිමින් ක්‍රියාත්මක වීමට නියමිත නීති සහ කොමිෂන් සභා පිළිබඳව ද ජනාධිපතිවරයා සඳහන් කළේය. ආයෝජන සඳහා සීමාවන් ඉවත් කිරීමට සහ ආර්ථික ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ සඳහා තමා අඛණ්ඩව කැප වන බව ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා විදේශීය ආයෝජකයන්ට සහතික විය.

### Urgent Call For Action: Sri Lanka Must Enact The Long-Awaited Animal Welfare Bill

*2024-01-17 10:56:32 - [colombotelegraphcom](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/urgent-call-for-action-sri-lanka-must-enact-the-long-awaited-animal-welfare-bill/)*

In a country where the penalty for the cruel killing of a dog stands at a meager Rs.100, the urgency for comprehensive legislation to protect animals has never been more evident. Sri Lanka stands at a crossroads, holding within its grasp the power to usher in a new era of compassion and justice for its four-legged citizens. The proposed Animal Welfare Bill, which garnered cabinet approval in 2022 after 15 years of advocacy, is a beacon of hope that must not be allowed to fade into legislative obscurity.

The existing Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance, a century-old, 3-page relic, falls woefully short of addressing the complexities of contemporary animal welfare issues. It is a document out of sync with the times, unable to provide the robust legal framework needed to safeguard animals from abuse and cruelty. In a commendable move, the Animal Welfare Bill, gazetted on 07.02.2022, seeks to replace this outdated ordinance, offering stronger, more comprehensive provisions that reflect the evolving understanding of animal rights.

Regrettably, despite receiving cabinet approval and being hailed by animal welfare activists as a significant step forward, the Bill has languished without making its way to Parliament for enactment. The question on the minds of concerned citizens echoes loudly: How many more years must pass before Sri Lanka takes decisive action to protect its animals?

The need for urgency cannot be overstated. Animal abusers continue to act with impunity, emboldened by the absence of a robust legal deterrent. A mere Rs.100 fine for the cruel killing of a dog is not only a mockery of justice but also a disheartening signal that the value of animal lives remains grossly underestimated.

The citizens of Sri Lanka, along with impassioned animal welfare advocates, unite in their call for the swift enactment of the Animal Welfare Bill. It is not merely a matter of introducing legislation but an imperative to create a legal foundation that empowers authorities to take decisive action against those who inflict harm on innocent animals. The delay in enacting this crucial Bill only perpetuates the vulnerability of animals and erodes the moral fabric of the nation.

Sri Lanka has an opportunity to showcase its commitment to compassion, justice, and progress by enacting the Animal Welfare Bill without further delay. Let this be the moment when the nation rises above outdated norms, sending a resounding message that the welfare of animals is a priority and that cruelty will no longer be tolerated. The time for action is now, and Sri Lanka must seize this opportunity to shape a future where animals are afforded the protection they rightfully deserve.

### Supreme Court deems Duminda Silva’s presidential pardon invalid

*2024-01-17 10:54:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96470/supreme-court-deems-duminda-silvas-presidential-pardon-invalid)*

The Supreme Court has declared former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s decision to grant presidential pardon to former MP Duminda Silva, convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra, as invalid.

The relevant court order was issued by a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court when several petitions filed by the late Premachandra’s wife and daughter, Sumana and Hirunika Premachandra and former Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) Attorney-at-Law Ghazali Hussain, was taken up in court this morning  (17 Jan.).

The judge bench was presided over by Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and consisted Justices Gamini Amarasekara and Arjuna Obeysekara.

Thus, the Commissioner General of Prisons was instructed by the Supreme Court to take the relevant measures necessary so as to impose the impending sentence against Duminda Silva, adding that former President Gotabaya had failed to follow the proper legal procedure when granting the said amnesty.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court ordered the Commissioner General of Prisons to take steps to implement the sentence previously imposed on this petitioner.

### President Affirms Commitment To Two-State Solution In Palestine – A comment

*2024-01-17 10:48:21 - [colombotelegraphcom](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/president-affirms-commitment-to-two-state-solution-in-palestine-a-comment/)*

I refer to the above headed front page news report in the Daily News of 12th January 2024 and wish to express my views:

1. By prescribing a two-State solution to the current armed conflict between Israel and Palestine, the President exposes his double standards in solutions to the Israel/ Palestine national question and our own Tamil National Question. This is not saying a Two-State solution in Palestine is undesirable and be rejected. Both questions are identical, the Palestine and the Tamil National question in Sri Lanka. If the question is the same, then naturally it follows that the solutions to both should be the same. The difference is that the President and every Sri Lankan Government, since the beginning of the Tamil National question in 1956, have been stubbornly negating a workable solution to the Tamil National question, leave aside a Two-State solution. Furthermore, the Tamils have a far more deep rooted history in Sri Lanka than the Jews and Islamic Palestinians, in Judea. The Tamils are original inhabitants of Sri Lanka, from prehistoric times, when Sinhalese and their Sinhala language did not even exist.

2. National leaders should rule by principles and not by subjective self interests of one’s racial identity. If the President is driven by principle to prescribe a two-State solution to the Israel/Palestine question, then the same principle should be applied to a similar situation in Sri Lanka. Principles are universal in character. Principles are independent and stand on their intrinsic right, and not subject to vagaries of time, place and persons.

3. In respect of the Tamil national question the President negates the law of principle and even denies the complete implementation of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord by not devolving to the North East Provincial Council that was established, both Land and Police powers, under a Unitary Sri Lankan State. The minority Tamils have not claimed for a two-State solution, which the President is committed to Israel/Palestine question. The Tamils are not seeking for a separate State. What the Tamils are seeking is a North East con-federal State within an undivided Sri Lanka. President is committed to a Two- State or Two-Country solution to the Israel/Palestine conflict but not willing to commit even to consider a Federal State to the Tamils within an undivided Sri Lanka. This exposes his double standards in principle. This is despite the Tamils having had a Northern Tamil Kingdom from historical past up to the time of arrival of the Colonial Power, the Portuguese in 1505.

4. It is clear as crystal that what drives the President is not the lopsided commitment to a Two-State solution to Israel/Palestine conflict, but self-interested opportunity to woo the Muslim community for votes at the impending Presidential elections.

5. The Presidents and Governments of Sri Lanka are doing exactly the same thing what the Israel is doing in Palestine by expanding and colonizing land in Palestine, by keeping the Armed forces in occupation of the North Eastern region and applying pressure and intimidation to the remaining Tamil population to leave the land by emigration, accompanied by parallel Sinhalisation and Buddhisisation of North East, to establish a Sinhala Buddhist domination, hegemony under a complete Unitary Sri Lankan State.

6. Since the Tamils are the inhabitants of Sri Lanka from pre-historic times and the Sinhalese and their language evolved only in 7th century CE, the President should evince far greater commitment for a con-federal State solution for our own Tamil problem at the door step, without a separate State solution ,than be preoccupied with a distant Palestine problem. It seems the President has far greater altruistic concern for the Jewish and Palestinian people than for the Lankan Tamil people. To be a Statesman, principled action is a necessary quality.

### BREAKING: Supreme Court Declares Duminda Silva Pardon Unlawful

*2024-01-17 10:45:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/17/breaking-supreme-court-declares-duminda-silva-pardon-unlawful/)*

COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka's Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that the presidential pardon granted to former MP Duminda Silva by ex-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was unlawful.

Silva, alongside four others, was convicted in 2016 by the High Court for the 2011 murder of politician Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra.

All five received the death penalty, a verdict later upheld by a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court.

However, following his election victory in 2019, Gotabaya Rajapaksa unexpectedly granted a pardon solely to Silva.

Three separate fundamental rights petitions challenging the legality of the pardon were subsequently filed with the Supreme Court.

The fundamental rights applications were filed by Hirunika Premachandra, her mother Sumana Premachandra, and Former Human Rights Commissioner Ghazali Hussain, PC.

After careful consideration, the bench, comprising Justices P. Padman Surasena, Gamini Amarasekera, and Arjuna Obeysekera, unanimously concluded that the pardon process was flawed and therefore unlawful.

### Navy apprehends 18 Indian fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters

Sri Lanka Navy has apprehended 18 Indian fishermen who were poaching in Sri Lankan waters off Mannar on Tuesday evening (Jan.16).

In an operation mounted off the coast of Mannar by the North Central Naval Command, the naval personnel had impounded 2 Indian fishing trawlers with 18 fishermen aboard.

The apprehended Indian fishermen and the poaching trawlers have been brought ashore to the Thalpadu Pier in Mannar and they are due to be handed over to the Talaimannar Fisheries Inspector for onward legal action.

The Navy conducts regular patrols and operations in Sri Lankan waters to curb illegal fishing practices by foreign fishing trawlers, taking into account the consequences of these practices on the livelihood of local fishermen and the marine resources of the country.

### Reforms starting to pay off! Kristalina tells Ranil in Davos

COLOMBO (News 1st); International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva met with Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and took the opportunity to praise the country's economic reform efforts.

Georgieva highlighted the significance of the IMF Board's approval of the first review of Sri Lanka's Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program in December 2023. This approval, she stated, "was a recognition of the important reforms Sri Lanka has pursued."

Expressing optimism about the progress made, Georgieva further declared, "These reforms are starting to pay off!"

At a separate event on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, President Ranil Wickremesinghe offered a cautiously optimistic outlook on Sri Lanka's economic recovery, highlighting progress in debt restructuring and praising the IMF's recent program review.

Wickremesinghe described his surprise when a visiting IMF team acknowledged Sri Lanka's "over-performance" in tackling the ongoing economic crisis.

He underscored the severity of the crisis, stating that "it affected all adversely," and reiterated the importance of the debt restructuring agreement reached with the IMF.

"There is no other way out for Sri Lanka," Wickremesinghe emphasized, acknowledging the crucial role in facilitating negotiations with the country's creditors.

According to Wickremesinghe, all of Sri Lanka's official creditors have agreed in principle to restructure debt in line with the IMF's target requirements. The next hurdle lies in finalizing discussions with commercial creditors.

The successful completion of the IMF's first program review in December 2023 further emboldens Sri Lanka's optimism.

Wickremesinghe said this achievement is a turning point, paving the way for the economy to shift from stabilization to recovery and growth in 2024.

He emphasized the need for continued commitment to IMF-backed reforms and reiterated the importance of transparency and accountability.

### SriLankan Airlines misses another coupon on its 2024 bond - report

SriLankan Airlines Ltd. missed a third coupon payment on its dollar bond due later this year, according to a filing on Tuesday.

The company said a further event of default would occur because it doesn’t intend to pay the coupon due on Dec. 25, having already missed payments in December 2022 and June 2023.

The airline’s board intends to communicate further with the holders of these notes, it said.

The bond with semi-annual payments matures on June 25 this year, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.

The airline recently extended the deadline to seek investor interest for its sale. Selection of pre-qualified bidders is now set for mid-February instead of end-January, according to a notice posted on the Finance Ministry website earlier this month. It didn’t give a reason for the postponement.

Sri Lanka has been looking to sell its national airline at least since mid 2022, with President Ranil Wickremesinghe then saying the country’s poorest people who’ve never flown shouldn’t be saddled with its losses. The carrier serviced 126 destinations in more than 60 countries prior to the pandemic.

### Govt. nursing officers on 24-hour token strike today

*2024-01-17 08:59:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96466/govt-nursing-officers-on-24-hour-token-strike-today)*

The Government Nursing Officers’ Association has launched an island-wide 24-hour token strike with effect from 7:00 a.m. today (Jan.17).

Commenting in this regard, the national organizer of the association Sudath Jayasiri explained that the nursing officers decided to resort to a one-day token strike as the discussions held with the Health Minister and the State Minister for Finance were unfruitful.

Meanwhile, several other health trade unions that engaged in a token strike on Tuesday (Jan.16) have temporarily called off their trade union action at 6:30 a.m. this morning.

The president of Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) Upul Rohana, however, has vowed to resume the trade union action if the authorities fail to address their problems within a week’s time. He said around 100,000 health workers including all paramedical services, hospital secretaries, administrative officers as well as health administrative assistants, minor staff and 75 other trade unions of the health staff would join this island-wide strike.

### Sri Lanka’s Colombo Port sees jump in traffic amid Red Sea tensions

*2024-01-17 08:28:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96465/sri-lankas-colombo-port-sees-jump-in-traffic-amid-red-sea-tensions)*

Sri Lanka’s Colombo port has seen a big jump in container volumes in recent weeks as vessels steering clear of tensions in the southern Red Sea have found it a convenient transit point, officials said on Tuesday.

Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels have since November attacked ships in the Red Sea, part of a route that accounts for about 12% of the world’s shipping traffic, in what they say is an effort to support Palestinians in the war with Israel.

In response, some shipping companies have instructed vessels to sail around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, a slower and more expensive route.

Due to Colombo’s strategic location, stopping at the port gives ships convenient access to the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia, said Lal Weerasinghe, a senior official at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).

“When ships come past South Africa, Colombo is the first hub they meet...Singapore is further away. So this is the easiest port to access,” Weerasinghe said.

Port of Colombo is a key port between Africa, the Middle East and East Asia and handled 6.94 million 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU) in 2023, a 2% jump for the year, SLPA data showed. In December, TEUs jumped 15% on year.

Over the last four to six weeks, shipping lines requested more berthing windows at the port’s three terminals and transhipment volumes from neighbouring India also grew, two terminal operators said.

“We typically handle about 5,000-5,500 TEUs (per day) but since late last year there has been an increase of about 1,000 TEUs per day,” said Weerasinghe.

“We were forced to decline requests from about four shipping lines to increase traffic because it would cause delays for existing customers.”

As much as 50% of the uptick is from Mediterranean Shipping Company, the leading container shipping company, Weerasinghe added.

Shipping companies are also increasingly using Colombo as a relaying port, sometimes offloading their entire cargo to a different ship, he added.

Vessel calls have risen at other Colombo port terminals too.

“There is a lot of transhipment from India. We are hoping increased traffic will help Colombo port edge closer to double-digit growth in the first quarter,” said an official from a privately-run terminal.

He declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media.

### Qatar, France broker deal to get aid, medication to civilians, hostages in Gaza

*2024-01-17 07:53:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96464/qatar-france-broker-deal-to-get-aid-medication-to-civilians-hostages-in-gaza)*

(Reuters) - Qatar and France have brokered a deal with Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to deliver urgent medication to some 45 Israeli hostages held by the group in Gaza in return for humanitarian and medical aid for the most vulnerable civilians.

The two countries said the aid would leave Qatar for Egypt on Wednesday before being taken across the Rafah border crossing.

Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said in a statement the deal would mean “medicine along with other humanitarian aid is to be delivered to civilians in the Gaza Strip, in the most affected and vulnerable areas, in exchange for delivering medication needed for Israeli captives in Gaza.”

He did not give details on how much aid or what aid would be delivered to civilians.

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said two Qatari Air Force planes were to land on Wednesday in Egypt with medicines purchased in France based on an Israeli list.

Earlier, Philippe Lalliot, head of France’s foreign ministry crisis centre which organises aid efforts, said negotiations had been going on for weeks and the initial idea had come from the families of some of the Israeli hostages.

Specific medical packages for several months, which were put together in France, would be delivered to each of the 45 hostages. The International Committee of the Red Cross will coordinate on the ground.

France still has three nationals held in Gaza, but none of them are in urgent need of medication, Lalliot said.

### MIDDLE EAST WAR: Iran strike in Pakistan kills 2 children. Iran says it was a militant base

*2024-01-17 05:32:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/17/middle-east-war-iran-strike-in-pakistan-kills-2-children-iran-says-it-was-a-militant-base/)*

Colombo (News 1st) – Yet another new dimension opened in the Middle East crisis late Tuesday as Iran bombed what it said was an anti-Iran Sunni militant base in Pakistan. The Pakistani government said two children were killed and three more children wounded, foreign media reported.

Iran's state-run IRNA news agency and state television said that missiles and drones were used in the strikes in Pakistan to target the Jaish al-Adl militant group. Press TV, the English-language arm of Iranian state television, attributed the attack to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.

The drone and missile strike was in Balochistan’s Panjgur district, about 50km inside Pakistan. The Jaish al-Adl militant group has staged several attacks in Iran.

Pakistan’s foreign ministry condemned the strikes and warned of serious consequences. “Pakistan strongly condemns the unprovoked violation of its airspace by Iran which resulted in the death of two innocent children while injuring three girls. This violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty is completely unacceptable and can have serious consequences” the statement said.

Just a few hours earlier, Iran struck what it said were Mossad sites in the town of Erbil in the Kurdish-controlled region of northern Iraq. The Iraqi government has condemned the attacks and said there are no Mossad bases in Iraq.

Meanwhile, US forces carried a third set of strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen late Tuesday, hours after a Greek merchant ship was hit by a ballistic missile in the Red Sea, and a US cargo ship was also hit by a missile.

In Gaza, fighting continued to rage, with a tentative deal reached for Qatar to send in a shipment of medicines.

The UN in a statement late Tuesday said that almost the entire population of Gaza is going hungry and said Israel is “destroying Gaza’s food system and using food as a weapon against the Palestinian people”.

### ICJ says new Bill to establish “Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation” lacks credibility

*2024-01-17 05:10:44 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/ICJ-says-new-Bill-to-establish-Commission-for-Truth-Unity-and-Reconciliation-lacks-credibility/14-757436)*

The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) in a statement said it considers the Government’s proposed Bill to establish a Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation unlikely to advance accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims and survivors of the 26-year-long armed conflict that ended in 2009 and involved widespread atrocities.

The ICJ is concerned that the lack of consultation with victim communities and the continued neglect of their demands deprive the Bill of legitimacy.

A draft Bill on Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation was gazetted on 1 January 2024, to establish the Commission, amidst a climate of impunity for past human rights violations and abuses and intimidation of victim communities in the north and east of the country.

“Considering the repressive political climate in Sri Lanka, and the absence of the conditions that are necessary to ensure the success of the proposed Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation, the Bill appears to be more of a legislative manoeuvre aimed at deflecting the attention of the Human Rights Council and removing Sri Lanka from further scrutiny rather than a genuine accountability measure,” said ICJ’s Asia Director Melissa Upreti.

The Bill suffers from a lack of transparency regarding the consultation process and non-acceptance by victim communities.

If adopted, it would empower the Attorney-General to prosecute cases where the Commission makes a finding of responsibility for an offence. The ICJ is concerned that in the past the Attorney-General’s office has assumed potentially conflicting dual roles of legal advisor for the State and prosecutor of offences allegedly committed by State officials. The ICJ has previously noted how the Department had mishandled cases relating to serious human rights violations and abuses which has contributed to a climate of mistrust. The ICJ recalls that the years since the end of the conflict have been marked by near total impunity for conflict era crimes, owing to the failure of the Attorney-General’s Department to act to hold to account those responsible for serious crimes under international law.

The Bill provides that appointments to the Commission will be made by the President upon the recommendation of the Constitutional Council. The ICJ has previously noted that the governing party holds a majority in the Constitutional Council and that a majority of members are parliamentarians with only three members appointed from outside. Further, a representative of the smaller political parties (including parliamentarians representing the north and east) is yet to be appointed to the Council. The ICJ is concerned that these arrangements are conducive to creating a Commission that lacks independence and may be subjected to political pressures and considerations in carrying out its work. The situation is exacerbated by the Constitutional Council approving the appointment of the current Acting Inspector General of Police who had in December 2023 been held directly responsible for torture by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka.

The Bill would further authorise the proposed Commission to seek the assistance of the police to conduct investigations and liaise with the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses, which in turn depends on the police to provide support for the protection of victims and witnesses. However, a number of police officials have allegedly been responsible for recent cases of torture and ill-treatment and extra judicial killings. The Government’s failure to initiate thorough and impartial investigations into these cases and to bring perpetrators to justice has deepened the public’s mistrust of the police and prosecuting agencies.

Successive UN Human Rights Council Resolutions on Sri Lanka have called for the establishment of transitional justice mechanisms with the active participation of all stakeholders, including women who have been at the forefront in leading victim demands for accountability, particularly for cases of enforced disappearance. Yet, protesting mothers and female family members of the disappeared are routinely detained, intimidated or put under surveillance and their voices suppressed.

The Bill lacks also provisions that are gender responsive and makes the establishment of mechanisms and procedures to address women’s concerns discretionary.

Existing transitional justice institutions such as the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) and the Office for Reparations have been ineffective. As underscored by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the OMP has failed to earn the trust of victims and their representatives. As recently observed by the High Commissioner, there has been little to no development regarding cases of past human rights violations and abuses.

“The victims of Sri Lanka’s 26-year armed conflict, replete with atrocities, have been forced to wait too long to learn the truth about their loved ones and to be granted justice. When the UN Human Rights Council considers a new resolution on Sri Lanka later this year, it must avoid blind acceptance of Sri Lanka’s flawed transitional justice process and institutions and adopt an approach that genuinely puts the interests of victims and survivors first,” added Upreti.

The draft Bill provides for the establishment of the Commission with a Head Office based in Colombo and Regional Offices as necessary (clause 2). The Commission will have between seven to twenty-one members, who are to be appointed by the President upon recommendation by the Constitutional Council (clause 3). The term of the Commissioners is five years (unless removed earlier) and the President can extend their term on a yearly basis for an additional two years (clause 9). The Commission may conduct public or closed sittings as necessary (clause 7).

The stated objectives of the Commission are to investigate, inquire and make recommendations in respect of complaints or allegations or reports relating to damage or harm caused to persons or property, loss of life or alleged violation of human rights which occurred during the conflict in the Northern and Eastern Provinces between 1983 to 2009 or connected to such period or its aftermath and has a mandate to promote truth telling and make recommendations for reparations, and non – recurrence (clause 12). If it appears to the Commission that an offence under any Sri Lankan law has been committed it may refer the matter to the relevant law enforcement or prosecuting authorities for further investigation and necessary action (clause 13 (zd)). The Commission does not have the mandate to determine civil or criminal liability of any person (Clause 16 (1)) and instead the onus is on the Attorney-General to institute criminal proceedings regarding an offence in Court based on material collected by the Commission (clause 16 (2)).

The Bill also provides for the establishment of a Victim and Witness Protection Division (clause 28) and a Data Management Division (clause 29). The Commission may also appoint any mechanisms and procedure to address requirements related to women, children, persons with disabilities and disadvantaged groups and advisors relating to specific issues (clause 30).

The Bill also provides for the appointment of an advisory panel to advise the Commission on matters referred to the Panel (clause 32). This panel is to consist of a minimum of ten members appointed by the President on the Commission’s recommendation. Clause 39 of the Bill states that within one month of the interim report of the Commission being published the President shall appoint a monitoring committee to implement the findings of the report. Clause 40 states that such Committee be comprised of 11 members, of which six members are to be recommended by the Constitutional Council while the others are members ex-officio. Ex-officio members include the Secretaries of the Ministries of Defence, Justice, Law & Order, Finance, Public Administration & Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment or their nominees.  The Committee is expected so submit bi-annual plans evaluating the implementation of recommendations of the TUR Commission and other previous Commissions of Inquiry.

Clause 49 of the Bill states that the Commission can defer its investigation regarding any disappearance of a person/s if requested to do so by the OMP until such time it can be resumed without compromising inquiries conducted by the OMP.

In September 2023, the ICJ joined eight other international human rights organizations in expressing their grave reservations about the proposed Truth, Unity and Reconciliation Commission and setting out prerequisites to be addressed before appointing any new Commission. The concerns relate to Sri Lanka’s legacy of failed commissions, lack of a conducive environment and confidence building efforts, lack of meaningful consultations with victim communities, the failure of domestic transitional justice institutions, and the blocking of prosecutions. None of these concerns have been addressed to date, which bring into question the newly proposed Commission’s likelihood of serving as an effective mechanism for accountability.

### Commission for Truth, Unity, and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka- A Bill

*2024-01-17 05:09:10 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Commission-for-Truth-Unity-and-Reconciliation-in-Sri-Lanka-A-Bill/4-757435)*

As long as impunity prevails, SL will achieve neither genuine reconciliation nor sustainable peace - UN Deputy High Commissioner of Human Rights

The Government has published a Bill to establish the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka in the Gazette of 29 December, 2023 that was issued on January 1, 2024.  The Foreign Affairs Minister discussed this initiative with a group of civil society, and it was once again discussed during the preparation of the Bill.

We had Presidential Commissions of Inquires such as, the Udalagama Commission in 2006 to investigate and inquire into alleged serious violations of human rights arising since 1 August, 2005; the C.R.De Silva Commission in May 2010 on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation (LLRC); and the Paranagama Commission in August 2013 to investigate Complaints of Abductions and Disappearances, in respect of the armed ethnic conflict that ended in 2009.

All these commissions were established under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, by the President. However, the recommendations were hardly implemented.

The following was stated by the UN Deputy High Commissioner of Human Rights during the oral update at the 53rd session of the Human Rights Council in June 2023.

“The announcement of plans for a Truth Commission or similar reconciliation mechanisms requires attention. Sri Lanka has witnessed too many ad hoc commissions in the past that failed to ensure accountability. The Office on Missing Persons has not achieved the results that provide satisfaction to victims. What is needed is a coherent plan that connects the different elements of truth, redress, memorialisation, accountability and creates the right enabling environment for a successful and sustainable transitional justice process. Accountability remains the fundamental gap in attempts to deal with the past. As long as impunity prevails, Sri Lanka will achieve neither genuine reconciliation nor sustainable peace.”

Under the recommendations of the UNHRC resolution A/HRC/51/5 in October 2022, it was stated as follows:

“Prepare a comprehensive strategy on transitional justice and accountability, with a time-bound plan to implement outstanding commitments, including taking steps in relation to the establishment of a credible truth-seeking mechanism and an ad hoc special court, as well as security sector reform and vetting, and re-energise the Office on Missing Persons and the Office for Reparations to ensure that they can discharge their full mandate independently and effectively.”

The LLRC recommended conducting investigations and prosecuting offenders and justified it as follows:

“It is also the obligation of the Government to clear the good name and protect the honour and professional reputation of soldiers who defended the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka and particularly the many thousands of soldiers who perished carrying out their combat duties cleanly and professionally against a widely condemned terrorist group that used most inhumane tactics in combat. Offences if any, of a few cannot be allowed to tarnish the honour of the many who upheld the finest traditions of service.”

Therefore, the intention of the Government is to address all outstanding issues that were repeatedly emphasised by many. It is a switch from presidential commissions of inquiries of which the implementation of the recommendations was not acceptable, to a Parliamentary Act with wider scope and a mechanism of implementation of the recommendations.

The objective of the Sri Lankan Bill according to Section 12(1),is that the Commission shall investigate, inquire, and make recommendations in respect of complaints, or allegations, or reports relating to damage or harm caused to persons or property, loss of life or alleged violation of human rights anywhere in Sri Lanka, that were caused in the course of, or reasonably connected to, or consequent to the conflict that took place in the Northern and Eastern Provinces during the period 1983 to 2009, or its aftermath.

In Section 12(2) it was stated that subject to the provisions of subsection (1), the mandate of the Commission includes several points that were described in sub sections running from (a) to (l).

Sub section (h)(xii)  is as follows: “Investigating and making recommendations in respect of the allegations of damage or harm caused to persons or property or loss of life or alleged violation of human rights referred to in subsection (1), including making findings in regard to those responsible for the commission of the alleged violations and abuses referred to in subsection (1), including those who advised, planned, directed, commanded or ordered such atrocities.”

The Commission can refer matters to the relevant law enforcement or prosecuting authorities of Sri Lanka for further investigation and necessary action, where it appears to the Commission that an offence or offences punishable under the Penal Code(Chapter 19) or any other law of Sri Lanka has been committed (Section 13 zd).

According to Section 16(2), it shall be lawful for the Attorney-General to institute criminal proceedings in a designated court of law in respect of any offence based on material collected in the course of an investigation or inquiry or both, as the case may be, by the Commission established under this Act. This content was also in Section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Act No 16 of 2008.

Therefore, the provisions of the Bill are in line with the thinking of the UNHRC and LLRC in relation to accountability.

In South Africa, The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established by the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act No 34 of 1995. The main objectives of the South African Commission was to establish the complete picture of nature, causes and the extent of gross violations of human rights during the specified period, facilitating the granting of amnesty to persons who make full disclosure of the relevant facts,  establishing and making known the fate of victims by granting them an opportunity to relate their own account of violations, and compiling a comprehensive report with recommendations to prevent the future violations of human rights.

We can discern that the objective of the Sri Lankan Bill is fundamentally different to the South African Act. In South Africa no party has denied that atrocities were committed and both parties to the conflict admitted that. South Africa wanted to heal their wounds and move forward. Hence, the concept of revealing the truth followed by amnesty came in.

The term of the commission is five years and it could be extended by another 2 years. The provisions of the Bill are action oriented. The criticisms of the fate of the previous Presidential Commissions of Inquiries were addressed in the Bill and remedial actions taken.

After submitting the interim reports biannually or the final report to the President, the Commission should release those to the media in all three languages and within 21 days the President should table it in Parliament (Section 15).  Within one month from the date of publication of the first interim report, the President shall establish a Monitoring Committee to monitor and facilitate the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission (Section 39).

The Monitoring Committee shall consist of five ex-officio secretaries to specific ministries and six members recommended by the Constitutional Council and appointed by the President. The Committee shall submit bi-annual reports to the President every six months, evaluating the efforts of the Government and the efforts of any other person or body concerned to implement the recommendations of the Commission and other previous Commissions of Inquiry and the President shall table such reports in Parliament not later than two weeks from the receipt of such report (Section 40).

Finally, Parliament may take cognisance of the recommendations based on interim reports or the final report, as the case may be, and pass such resolution it may consider necessary to promote national unity and reconciliation (Section 16).

It seems the President and the Government are making reforms in a slow and steady manner not only in the economic front but also in the political front, although there are widespread concerns about some of the actions of the President. Once the President attempted to implement the 13 Amendment to the Constitution in full. There was criticism against him that attempting unpopular reforms on both fronts simultaneously would be detrimental in a future election. However, it appears this is not a concern for him.

### DAT and Tit for Tat fight for equality

*2024-01-17 05:05:39 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/DAT-and-Tit-for-Tat-fight-for-equality/4-757434)*

Last week, according to media reports all Government hospitals were almost completely closed. Except for sensitive and crucially important places like the Apeksha cancer hospital, the Lady Ridgeway children’s hospital, Emergency admissions and Cardiac treatment, all others were reported closed from Tuesday to Friday and came back to normalcy by Saturday morning. Not due to lack of medicines or other necessities, but due to a string of work stoppages by all hospital staff other than the medical doctors.

They were all protesting against the Government’s decision to double the Rs.35,000 per month DAT allowance of medical doctors to Rs.70,000, ignoring all others in the health sector. Health sector trade unions including nurses, paramedics, ophthalmologists, family health and even public health inspectors demanded an increase in their allowances by Rs.35,000 per month. Paramedics were reported as having threatened to go on a continuous strike, “if the Government fails to address the issue.” That was to say, they want the issue settled with a Rs.35,000 increase in their take home pay.

They justify their demand on the grounds that, if medical doctors cannot survive the increase in the cost of living with their present take home salary and PP income, if they need such increase in their take home pay with the DAT allowance doubled, then none in the health sector would survive with their present salaries. Most in lower categories do not even have a “take home pay” as large as that of the increase of DAT allowance to Rs.70,000 said a hospital staff, when I queried about their demand for an equivalent to the DAT increase. A trained Government nurse with five years’ service would get only Rs.46,000 I was told.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge is on record saying, there is no justification in demanding an increase equivalent to that of DAT by others. He asked where on earth support staff in the judicial system gets wage increases similar to those given to Judges. That argument by the GMOA boss against salary increases for others in the health sector cannot be compared to that of Judges by any means. Judges do not have overtime pay as doctors do. Nor do Judges indulge in private practice as doctors do. Doctors in Government service enjoy both overtime pay and PP, in total violation of medical ethics and morals. Aluthge’s argument thus exposed the nauseating ego and the selfish mindset of the GMOA. DAT by itself is no legitimate allowance, the GMOA forced the then Government to accept at the expense of innocent patients in Government hospitals held captive. Not only DAT, every salary increase and privilege the medical doctors enjoy has been at the expense of these patients.

I believe, people should know what DAT is that they would have to shoulder with the massive increase announced. DAT is an exclusive monthly allowance paid to Government medical doctors in hospitals. DAT stands for “Disturbance, Availability and Transport”. It is about medical doctors being called while off duty to attend to warded patients in the hospital he or she is posted in. What the GMOA says is, if medical doctors are “disturbed” when off duty and called to attend to a patient and if they make themselves “available” despite being off duty, they should be paid for all that and that is the DAT allowance.

There are around 13,000 medical doctors attached to hospitals out of the 17,000 plus medical doctors in Government service. Of them, only about 11,000 take care of patients in hospital wards and OPDs.

Technically they are the only medical doctors who should be qualified for DAT. Qualifying for DAT does not necessarily mean they have to be paid the DAT allowance every month. According to its explanation DAT is for doctors that make such visits. How many medical doctors are disturbed on an average and make themselves available for such calls during a month? Does it mean a single visit a month would qualify a doctor to have the now increased monthly DAT allowance of Rs.70,000?

DAT has no criteria. It carries with it a consciously camouflaged aberration in implementation. Though expressed as “off duty hospital visits” DAT is a lump sum monthly allowance. There are no calculations possible for single visits in DAT. Therefore, no individual records of frantic calls for doctor visits to hospitals are necessary. DAT monthly allowance was approved by the Treasury on principle and it is now doubled from this January as approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. I would therefore, not be surprised if all 17,000 plus Government medical officers are paid DAT, including those released from service for trade union work or for funded projects.

There is illegitimacy and immorality in most privileges that Government medical officers (GMO) enjoy. Perhaps in the whole world, 17,000 plus Government medical doctors remain the only public sector that enjoy the right to be on duty without recording their time of arrival for duty and departure, but have the right to claim overtime. They definitely are the only unique profession in public service who have the right to claim overtime payments based on their personal entries made in their own private diaries.

It has now become a practice for GMOs to demand anything they wish holding the innocent patients to ransom. The demand to double the DAT was no different. This being a year of election aspirations the Government was hesitant in antagonising them, regarding them as “social influencers”. But that may not be the case with paramedics and supporting staff, who are not thought of as “social influencers”. That would by implication make this DAT increase an “election graft”. We know of election budgets, price reductions, samurdhi benefits and such that come as election grafts. What we do not know or do not want to know is most such Government decisions should be brought to Parliament and debated before implementation, if they are not proposals included in the Annual Budget approved by Parliament, for the simple reason, the Constitution holds Parliament as the sole authority on public finance.

This should therefore apply to the DAT increase that is about public finances. If all 17k plus GMOs are to be paid  DAT, the burden on the already economically hunched people would be a colossal sum of about Rs. 14.5 billion this year alone. Therefore, on principle Parliament should know what categories of medical doctors are paid DAT. Are medical doctors in health administration paid DAT? Should it be a flat monthly allowance, instead of a “payment on visit”? What would the Annual Budget be, if DAT is paid on visits? Should not these details be made available to Parliament for this massive sum to be approved and allowed?

Why all that should be brought to Parliament for approval is for the people to know how their heavily overtaxed money is disbursed and for what. It is about transparency and accountability that is at present absent. It is about holding political leaderships in Government accountable to the people. It is also about de-politicising such decisions that lack policy and principles and therefore, allows for political patronage.

In conclusion, let me therefore, say this for future consideration. Except on two rare occasions, when the President Kumaranatunge and the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Governments under worker pressure increased private sector salaries by Rs.1,000 and 2,000 respectively on “budgetary relief allowances” Governments cannot technically decide salary increases for the private sector employees, who are also taxpayers, mostly as contributors to the 80 % indirect tax. This has left a yawning income disparity between the larger majority of the private sector workers and the public sector. Yet it is this private sector employee and not the public sector employee that earn the much needed “dollar income” to the country on which others live as comfortable as they could be. It is therefore important to have a system that would allow respectability and reasonable treatment for the private sector employees too in decision making. Trade unions should therefore demand a “National Labour and Employment Policy” to be adopted in Parliament that would establish an independent “National Wages Commission” wholly responsible to Parliament to decide on wage demands and increases of both public and private sectors. The Labour and Employment policy should seriously consider a “six-hour working day in a five-day working week” for employees to have adequate free time for recreation and entertainment. It is now an accepted fact that employees with job satisfaction and free time are far more productive than the present day highly overworked employees. The “National Wages Commission” should announce an annual “Minimum National Living Wage” that for sure would have to be above Rs.75,000 per month this year, if based on numbers in the latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HI&ES) of the Census and Statistics Department.

But I doubt, the politicised public sector trade unions including the GMOA would go for such a proposal. For they will not be able to use political patronage and muscle power as they do now to push Governments to decide for them.

### International commercial mediator training and accreditation program in Sri Lanka

Initiative via collaboration between UDecide Mediation platform and SAGE Mediation Singapore

To expand the opportunities for Sri Lankan professionals to equip themselves with international mediation skills, UDecide mediation platform in collaboration with Sage Mediation, will be launching the first of its kind International Commercial Mediator Training and Accreditation program in Sri Lanka.

The program was specially developed by Sage Mediation, an international mediation firm based in Singapore, and will be led by its CEO Aloysius Goh. Completion of the workshop will set participants on the path to achieving accreditation under the Singapore International Mediation Institute, as well as the Swiss Chamber of Commercial Mediators. This first iteration will be available at a special concessionary rate marking Sage Mediation’s commitment to promoting high-quality mediation practices around the world.  UDecide Mediation Platform and Sage Mediation, is inviting professionals from diverse sectors to make use of this rare opportunity to equip themselves with international mediation skills to provide high-quality amicable dispute resolution services in Sri Lanka and outside.

The United Nations Convention on Mediation (Singapore Convention on Mediation), is an endorsement of the suitability of mediation for commercial dispute resolution worldwide. Sri Lanka signed the Convention on Mediation in 2019 and ratified the same on 10 January 2024. Against this backdrop, Sri Lanka now, more than ever, needs highly trained and qualified mediation professionals.

*2024-01-17 04:39:10 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/business/2023-tea-crop-improves-marginally/34-757420)*

Production increases at all elevation levels except for low-grown compared to 2022

Sri Lanka’s tea crop improved marginally in 2023, reflecting the struggle for recovery after detrimental policy decisions and climate change.

The cumulative production for the year 2023 was 256.04 million kilos, registering an increase of 4.20 million kilos compared with 251.84 million kilos in 2022.

Data analysed by Forbes and Walker Research said all elevations have shown positive variances in the year 2023 aside from the low-grown elevation in comparison with the corresponding period of 2022.

However, it noted that compared to 299.49 million kilos in 2021, cumulative production of 2023 shows a decrease of 43.45 million kilos. On a cumulative basis, all elevations also show a decrease over the corresponding period of 2021.

High-grown elevation produced over 57.4 million kilos up by 2.50% year-on-year (YoY) whilst, medium elevation production was 41.29 million kilos up by 6.27% YoY and green tea production was at 2.28 million kilos up by 26.17% YoY. The low-grown elevation crop was down by 0.07% YoY to over 155 million kilos.

Sri Lanka was optimistic that the tea output will exceed 260 million kilos by the end of 2023 recovering from the 26-year low in 2022.

In December 2023, tea production increased mere 0.51% YoY to 19.81 million kilos vis-à-vis 19.71 million kilos of December 2022.

Forbes and Walker Research confirmed that in December all elevations except for the low grown have shown an increase in comparison with the corresponding period of 2022. However, it said compared to 20.52 million kilos of December 2021, the production of December 2023 still shows a decrease of 0.71 million kilos.

High-grown elevation produced over 4.46 million kilos up by 1.62% YoY whilst, medium elevation production was over 2.9 million kilos up by 2.38% YoY and the production of green tea was at 180,806 kilos up by 8.17% YoY. The low-grown elevation crop was down by 0.42% YoY to over 12.25 million kilos.

Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman Niraj de Mel outlining plans for 2024 insisted on the need for a strategic, unified approach to achieve common industry objectives, emphasising the importance of collaboration over working in isolation.

### Health Minister promises talks on allowance parity amidst TU strike

*2024-01-17 04:34:42 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/news/Health-Minister-promises-talks-on-allowance-parity-amidst-TU-strike/56-757418)*

Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana yesterday assured health trade unions that he would engage in a special discussion with the Ministry of Finance regarding their requests for an allowance comparable to the Rs. 35,000 granted to doctors recently.

Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana provided this assurance while engaging with representatives from health trade unions at the Ministry of Health yesterday. The discussions aimed to address the demands raised by a coalition of at least 72 health service trade unions, excluding doctors, who initiated a 24-hour token strike on the same day.

The unions initiated the strike with a demand for the inclusion of the Rs. 35,000 allowance, which is currently extended to doctors, for all individuals within the entire health services sector.

Due to the island-wide strike, the Government was forced to deploy the military to ensure the normal functioning of state-sector hospitals as health-sector workers only engaged in essential duties and emergency services.

Pathirana also extended an invitation to representatives of the trade unions to participate in the special meeting with the Ministry of Finance, a proposal that their leaders accepted. The Minister assured he would fight to ensure the rights of health sector employees and highlighted the commendations received by Sri Lanka’s health service.

### மருத்துவர்களின் சம்பளம் 35000 ரூபாவினால் அதிகரிக்கப்பட்டதா ?

*2024-01-17 04:32:00 - [virakesarilk](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174105)*

அரசாங்க சேவையில் உள்ள மருத்துவர்களின் சம்பளம் 35,000 ரூபாவினால் அதிகரிக்கப்பட்டதாக அறிவிக்கப்பட்டதையடுத்து ஏனைய சுகாதார தொழில் சங்கங்கள் தமக்கும் 35,000 அதிகரிப்பு தரவேண்டுமென 2 நாள் பகிஷ்கரிப்பில் ஈடுபட்டதும் அதன் பின்னர் இப்போது 16ஆம் திகதி முதல்  மீண்டும் தொழிற்சங்க நடவடிக்கையை ஆரம்பிப்பதாக அறிவித்துள்ள நிலையில் இது தொடர்பான உண்மை நிலையை ஆராய்வதே இந்த கட்டுரையின் நோக்கம் ஆகும்.

ஊழலினால் ஏற்பட்ட பொருளாதார வீழ்ச்சிக்கு பின்னர் பதவிக்கு வந்த அரசியல் தலைமைகள் சர்வதேச நாணய நிதிய பரிந்துரை என்ற பெயரில் 100,000 ரூபாய்க்கு மேல் மாத சம்பளம் பெறும் அரசாங்க ஊழியர்களின் மீது அதிகரித்த  வரி விதித்த நிலையில், அரசாங்க மருத்துவர்களின் சம்பளத்தில் சராசரியாக 35,000 ரூபா வரியாக கழிக்கப்பட்டது. ஏனைய நாடுகளுடன் ஒப்பிடும்போது இலங்கையில் குறைந்தளவு சம்பளம் பெறும் மருத்துவர்கள், சம்பளம் குறைக்கப்பட்ட இந்த செயலால் அதிருப்தி அடைந்து ஆயிரக்கணக்கில் நாட்டை விட்டு வெளியேற தொடங்கினார்கள்.

இதனால் பல வைத்தியசாலைகள் செயலிழந்துள்ள நிலையில் கலக்கமடைந்த ஆட்சியாளர்கள் இதை ஈடு செய்ய- அதாவது அண்மைக்கால வரி விதிப்புக்கு முன்னர் இருந்த நிலைக்கு வைத்தியர்களது சம்பளமாகப் பெறும் தொகையைக் கொண்டு வருவதற்கு 35,000 வழங்க- தீர்மானித்து விட்டு அதை தான் 35000 ரூபாய்களினால் மருத்துவர்களின் சம்பளம் அதிகரிப்பதாக கண்துடைப்பு செய்கிறார்கள்.

உதாரணமாக ஒரு மருத்துவ நிபுணரின்  சம்பளம் வரியினால் 40000 ரூபாய்களினால் குறைக்கப்பட்டு இருந்தது. இப்போது 35000 ரூபாய் வருமான அதிகரிப்பு என்று கூறிக்கொண்டு மேலும் வரிவிதிப்பை மொத்த சம்பளத்தில் அதிகரிப்பார்கள். இதனால் உண்மையான அதிகரிக்கும் அளவு 25 000 ஆக இருந்தாலும் வரி விதிப்புக்கு முன்னர் இருந்ததை விட அவர்  இன்னும் 15000 குறைவாகவே பெறுவார்.

இதேவேளை வரிவிதிப்புக்கு உட்படாத சம்பளத்தை பெறும் மருத்துவ ஆய்வுகூட தொழில்நுட்பவியலாளர்கள்  (MLT) மற்றும் போராட்டத்தில் ஈடுபடும் ஏனைய தொழில் சங்க  உறுப்பினர்கள் உயர்தரத்தில் 3 பாடம் சித்தியுடன் 1 அல்லது  2 வருடத்துக்கு மேற்படாத மாதாந்தக் கொடுப்பனவுடன் கூடிய சுகாதார திணைக்கள பயிற்சி நெறிகளை முடித்துவிட்டு தமது பணிநியமனங்களைப் பெற்றுக்கொண்டுள்ளனர்.

இடைநிலை சுகாதார  ஊழியர்களான இவர்கள் தங்களை தாங்களே சுகாதார நிபுணர்கள் என்று அழைத்துக் கொண்டு, உயர்தரத்தில் சிரமப்பட்டு  படித்து அதிகளவு புள்ளிகளை பெற்று எதுவித மாதாந்தக் கொடுப்பனவுகளும் இன்றி 5 வருடம்  மருத்துவ  பீட அடிப்படைக் கற்கைகளை நிறைவுசெய்த பின்னர் 1 வருடம் உள்ளகப் பயிற்சி பெற்று வேலைக்கு அமர்த்தப்பட்டுள்ள மருத்துவர்களுக்கு சமனாக,  வரிக்கு உட்படாத தமது சம்பளத்தையும் 35000 ரூபாய்களினால் அதிகரிக்குமாறு கேட்பது எப்படி நியாயம் ஆகும்?

மேலும் நாடு வெள்ள அனர்த்தம் மற்றும் டெங்கு பரவல் காரணமாக  ஒரு பேரழிவை   எதிர்நோக்கும் நேரத்தில் இவ்வாறான அநியாயக் கோரிக்கைகளை முன்வைத்து போராடுவது சுகாதார ஊழியர்களின் ஒழுக்க நெறிக்கு பொருத்தமானதா ?

இன்றைய வாழ்க்கைச் செலவு  அதிகரிப்பு, அனைத்து ஊழியருக்கும்  அதிகரித்த சம்பளத்தை வழங்குவதை நியாயப்படுத்தி உள்ளது. ஆனால் சர்வதேச நாணய நிதியத்தின் பரிந்துரையான அரச செலவீனங்களை குறைப்பது என்பது பொருளாதாரத்தில் முன்னேறி வரும் ஏனைய நாடுகளை போல பாதுகாப்பு செலவீனங்களை குறைப்பது மூலமாக அடையப் பட்டிருக்க வேண்டும். ஆனால் பாதீட்டில் அண்ணளவாக  50% செலவை பாதுகாப்புக்கு ஒதுக்கிவிட்டு அதை சரி கட்டுவதற்கு அரச ஊழியர்களின் மீதான வரியை அதிகரிப்பது அவ தந்திரமாகும்.

வைத்தியர்களுக்கு வழங்கப்பட்டது போல சம்பள உயர்வு தமக்கு வழங்கவேண்டும் என்று கேட்கும் தொழில் சங்கங்கள் கூட பாதுகாப்பு செலவை குறைக்க வேண்டும் என்ற கோரிக்கையை வெளிப்படுத்தவில்லை என்பது கவனிக்கத்தக்கது.

அரச ஊழியர்களை செலவுகளை குறைத்து சிக்கனமாக இருக்க உபதேசிக்கும் அரசியல்வாதிகள் தொடர்ந்தும் ஊழலில் ஈடுபட்டு அதிகரித்த செலவுகளை ஏற்படுத்துகிறார்கள். சில தினங்களுக்கு முன்னர் கூட  மகிந்த குழுவினர் வரி செலுத்துவோரின் பணத்தில் கப்பலில் பயணம் செய்து களியாட்டம் நடத்தினார்கள்

பாதுகாப்பு செலவை ஆட்சியாளர்கள் அதிகரித்த நிலையில் வைத்திருப்பதற்கு இலங்கை மீது அந்நிய  .நாடுகள் எதுவும் படை எடுக்கவில்லை. வல்லரசுகள் இலங்கை மீது படையெடுக்க தேவையுமில்லை. ஏனென்றால் இலங்கை மக்களை சுரண்டி வல்லரசுகளுக்கு வருமானம் தரக்கூடிய  அனைத்து வியாபாரங்களுக்கும்  ஒத்துழைக்க ஆட்சியாளர்கள் தயாராக இருக்கின்றனர் .

அப்படி இருந்தும் அதிகரித்த பாதுகாப்பு   செலவு ஏன் ஏற்படுகிறது என்ற கேள்விக்கான பதிலை தமிழர்கள் அதிகமாக வாழும் பகுதிகளில் குவித்து வைக்கப்பட்டுள்ள ஆயுதப்படையினர் மூலமாக அறிந்து கொள்ளலாம். கடந்த காலங்களில் இடம்பெற்ற தவறுகளை நேர்மையாக ஏற்றுக் கொண்டு பாதிக்கப்பட்டவர்களுக்கு நிவாரணம் வழங்கி இனங்களுக்கு இடையில் நல்லிணக்கத்தை ஏற்படுத்தி ஒன்றுபட்ட இலங்கைக்குள் கௌரவமான ஒரு தீர்வை வழங்குவதன் மூலமாகவே  ஆயுதப்படையினரை அங்கிருந்து அகற்ற முடியும்.

எது எப்படி இருந்தாலும் பாதுகாப்பு செலவீனத்தை குறைப்பதாலும்  ஊழல் மிக்க அரசியல்வாதிகளில்  இருந்து நாட்டை மீட்டு எடுத்தால் மாத்திரமே வைத்தியர்களுக்கு  கண்துடைப்புக்காக வழங்கிய தொகையை விட அதிக சம்பள அதிகரிப்பை பெற முடியும் என்பதை அனைத்து அரசாங்க தொழிற்சங்கங்களும் உணரவேண்டும். அந்த நிலை ஏற்படுவதற்கு உரிய அழுத்தத்தை அனைத்து  தொழிற்சங்கங்களும் ஒன்றிணைந்து  பிரயோகிப்பதே சகல இலங்கையர்களும் தத்தமது சம்பள உயர்வை பெற்றுக்கொள்ளவும் நாட்டை பொருளாதார சீரழிவில் இருந்து நிரந்தரமாக மீட்டெடுக்கவும் உதவும் சாத்தியமான வழியாகும்.

துரித புதுப்பிக்கத்தக்க எரிசக்தித் திட்டம் இந்த முழு முயற்சியின் ஒரு முக்கிய அங்கம் என்றும், இது எரிசக்தி பாதுகாப்பிற்கான பாதையில் இன்றியமையாத நடவடிக்கை என்றும் ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்ரமசிங்க தெரிவித்தார். (a)

### CEAT helps keep Suwa Seriya ambulances on the road

*2024-01-16 23:10:00 - [islandlk](http://island.lk/ceat-helps-keep-suwa-seriya-ambulances-on-the-road/)*

The 322-strong fleet of ambulances operated by the Suwa Seriya Foundation will continue to fulfil its humanitarian mission in Sri Lanka with tyres supplied by CEAT Kelani Holdings as the preferred tyre supplier.

CEAT Kelani recently renewed its commitment to Suwa Seriya, undertaking to provide tyres for five ambulances free of charge and to provide the others at a special price that is marginally above the cost of production.

Suwa Seriya runs a minimum of 25,000 kms a day to save lives. CEAT Kelani has undertaken to produce customised ‘Rhino Plus’ tyres with the Suwa Seriya number 1990 on the side walls of the tyres to identify them as belonging to the ambulance service.

“The Suwa Seriya ambulance service has saved many lives, and we are happy to be able to help the Foundation make a substantial saving on the price of tyres, thereby ensuring that the service is not curtailed due to escalating costs,” CEAT Kelani Chief Operating Officer Shamal Gunawardene said. “These tyres are designed and built for reliability and excellent handling in local conditions, ensuring a safe drive for users.”

The Suwa Seriya Foundation was established in Sri Lanka in July 2016 with the support of the Government of India. It provides free pre-hospital care emergency ambulance services to any person in Sri Lanka, offering 24-hour emergency medical services with a team of nearly 1400 people. The Foundation has achieved an average response time of 14:38 minutes, rescuing and assisting people in accidents and emergencies quickly and competently.

The CEAT brand originated in Italy and is backed by German manufacturing technology and extensive research and testing facilities in India and Europe. CEAT Kelani Holdings currently manufactures half of Sri Lanka’s pneumatic tyre requirements, exports about 20 per cent of its production to 16 countries and plays a significant role in helping the national economy conserve foreign exchange by reducing dependence on imported tyres.
