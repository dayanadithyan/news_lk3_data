Corruption is found in northern education. I see the procedure in the North as a destruction of Northern education, without being punished for the accused officers.

There are no qualified secretaries in the four ministries in the North and there are problems in making administrative decisions.

Some are trying to put them aside and have the opportunity to hire eligible people.

It is doubtful whether the Northern Governor is overlooking such activities or whether he is behind such activities.

Therefore, the Northern Province Governor should take appropriate action as the Northern Education Corruption is deteriorating.
