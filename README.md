### Kusal Mendis secures visa to USA after delay

*2024-05-21 11:31:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Kusal-Mendis-secures-visa-to-USA-after-delay/108-283048) ┬╖ `en`

May 21 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lankan cricketer Kusal Mendis, whose visa was delayed for travel to the USA for the T20 World Cup, is finally set to depart after receiving approval for his visa.

Despite the rest of the squad having already left for the USA, Mendis' visa was held up at the US Embassy in Colombo for several days due to incomplete documentation.

The delay was attributed to Mendis' failure to submit several required documents to the embassy.

Earlier, in response to reports that Kusal Mendis' visa was denied, CEO Ashley de Silva said that Mendis' visa was not denied and that he would join the team before the warm-up games.

Sri Lanka is scheduled to play two warm-up matches ahead of the ICC MenтАЩs T20 World Cup 2024, commencing on May 28.

Their first warm-up game against the Netherlands will take place on May 28 at Broward County Stadium in Florida. They will then face Ireland in their second warm-up game on May 31 at the same venue.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs household debt has risen during an economic crisis, and less literate female borrowers in particular were hit by loan agreements they had signed without the ability to understand their legal implications UNDP Resident Representative Azusa Kubota said.

A recent multidimensional vulnerability report by the United Nations Development Program in collaboration with the Oxford University found that the lack of financial literacy among borrowers, particularly women-headed households, contribute to their vulnerability.

тАЬWomen, often, were forced into signing agreements in a language they did not understand. They did not know their rights or responsibilities, nor the terms of borrowing,тАЭ Kubota said, speaking at the launch of the Financial Literacy Roadmap of Sri Lanka.

In the absence of basic financial literacy they were often forced into poor financial decisions, she said.

### CB has enough dollars to prevent rising dollar value

*2024-05-21 10:59:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/CB-has-enough-dollars-to-prevent-rising-dollar-value/108-283046) ┬╖ `en`

Colombo, May 21 (Daily Mirror) - The value of the US dollar and the Sri Lanka Rupee is determined by the supply and demand. If the value of the dollar rises significantly, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has sufficient dollars to control it, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siambalapitiya said.

The Minister made this statement to the media after a programme held in Dehiowita yesterday.

The value of the US dollar is rising rapidly due to several foreign banks operating in the country buying US dollars from the financial market and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka from the banking system.

Due to the continuous release of dollars to the financial market in the previous years┬а to keep the value of the US dollar at the limit of Rs. 200, our dollar reserves were exhausted. Also, after allowing the dollar and the rupee to float, the value of a dollar suddenly increased to Rs. 380.

### Netanyahu denounces bid to arrest him over Gaza war

May 21 (BBC) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has angrily condemned the International Criminal Court's prosecutor for seeking arrest warrants for him alongside Hamas's leaders over alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict.

Mr Netanyahu said he rejected with disgust that "democratic Israel" had been compared with what he called "mass murderers".

Mr Netanyahu's comments have been echoed by US President Joe Biden, who said there was no equivalence between Israel and Hamas.

The chief ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Netanyahu and his Defence Minister Yoav Gallant bore criminal responsibility for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

The ICC is also seeking a warrant for Hamas's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, for war crimes.

Israel and the US, its key ally, are not members of the ICC, which was set up in 2002.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ The outstanding achievement of inflationist macro-economists in Sri Lanka and elsewehere is their ability to elect a new government, usually socialists or nationalists if liberals were in power, after driving countries into currency crises or asset bubbles after cutting rates for тАШgrowthтАЩ.

Stabilization programs, despite greater inflation and more hardships being stopped, provide fertile ground for fringe elements to come to power even as economies start to recover.

No liberal government, with free trading aspirations, can now survive in a country where forex shortages are created by spurious economic doctrines founded on statistics, backed by the International Monetary Fund more often than not.

Sri LankaтАЩs post-independence currency troubles emerged soon after the central bank was set up in 1950.

At the time Fed was firing a commodity bubble, by purchasing Liberty bonds (in what would now be called yield curve targeting) pushing up Sri LankaтАЩs export prices until 1951.

The present moment in Sri Lankan politics is one where the campaign strategies of the major political parties appear to be shifting to a new phase. As the possibility of elections gets higher, encounters among different political factions are entering a more intensified phase of confrontation. With the gears shifting, there appears to be little political movement and considerable ambiguity, which translates into voter confusion.

However, a deeper scrutiny of recent political events are indicative of three main tectonic shifts in the political landscape: excessive exercise of power by the establishment elite, the PresidentтАЩs increasingly shrinking political options with the Rajapaksas signalling possible departure, and the National PeopleтАЩs PowerтАЩs (NPP) mobilising a series of trade union strikes.

In an effort to support blended finance projects focused on climate change adaptation and mitigation, Sri Lanka proposed a 10 percent levy on the annual profits of global tax evasion assets deposited in tax havens.

The annual profits are estimated at US $ 1.4 trillion per annum.

The proposal was made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the 10th World Water Forum, held in Bali, Indonesia, yesterday.

He noted that the levy can be enforced by imposing sanctions, similar to those imposed on the Russian banks and financial institutes, which fail to implement the levy. The monies raised by these levies are to be made available to be utilised by the blended finance projects on climate change adaptation and mitigation.

The Global Blended Finance initiative is a supplement to the loss and damage funds тАУ not an alternative. Wickremesinghe stressed these two measures must work in tandem.

This may be one more in the long line of rejections since the days of Gotabaya Presidency.

Interestingly, questions have been raised about the authority or mandate of the High Commissioner to issue such a report. But in their heady rush to reject the report, they may not have consulted important resolutions including the UNGA resolution establishing the post of High Commissioner.

These resolutions particularly stress the importance of the role of the High Commissioner as the voice of humanity on gross or grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Nevertheless, how the High Commissioner should express that voice and what format or method should be followed is left open.

The 2024 Indian parliamentary elections will be remembered for many reasons. They are the longest to date, stretching from April 19 to June 1.

They are taking place in the midst of acute unemployment, skyrocketing prices and lack of demand in the market.

An unprecedented amount of money is being spent amidst corruption charges.┬а Divisive issues of caste, religion and region are being racked up. Sex scandals are sullying the reputations of some of the high and mighty.

But in the midst of the darkness, there is a silver lining. Social media platforms, chiefly YouTube, have emerged as the main mode of political communication, overshadowing the traditional or тАЬmainstreamтАЭ electronic media.

The elections in Sri Lanka are said to be conducted in a free and fair manner and according to the law. However, some laws have been promulgated in a manner that ruling parties can manipulate the law in their favour.

The Sri Lankan Constitution states тАЬThe President of the Republic shall be elected by the people and shall hold office for a term of five years.тАЭ It again says тАЬThe poll for the election of the President shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office.тАЭ

Accordingly, the Election Commission (EC) on May 9 announced that the Presidential polls will be held between September 17 and October 16, this year. The CommissionтАЩs announcement was based on the countryтАЩs law and hence election could not be held before that period or postponed for a date after it.

On numerous occasions President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said he was elected president to get Sri Lanka out of its economic morass and will do his utmost to fulfill that obligation. This has led to much speculation regarding the presidentтАЩs intentions with regard to conducting presidential elections prior to achieving economic success. The truth of the presidentтАЩs utterances with regard to his commitment to resolving the economic crisis is to be plainly seen in his determination to push ahead with unpopular economic policies. He has been unrelenting in sticking to higher tax rates than the masses of people can afford and to the privatization of state owned enterprises. Both of these policies are unpopular to the point of jeopardising his bid to be re-elected at the forthcoming presidential election, but the president has stuck by his convictions.

(AP) тАФ The chief prosecutor of the worldтАЩs top war crimes court said Monday he is seeking arrest warrants for leaders of Israel and Hamas, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over actions taken during their seven-month war.

While Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, do not face imminent arrest, the announcement by the International Criminal CourtтАЩs chief prosecutor was a symbolic blow that deepened IsraelтАЩs isolation over the war in Gaza.

The courtтАЩs prosecutor, Karim Khan, accused Netanyahu, Gallant, and three Hamas leaders тАФ Yehia Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh тАФ of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel.

Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders condemned the move as disgraceful and antisemitic. U.S. President Joe Biden also lambasted the prosecutor and supported IsraelтАЩs right to defend itself against Hamas.
