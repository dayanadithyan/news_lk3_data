### The Kaithady Explosion that Rocked the LTTE on Valentine’s Day

*2024-02-10 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-Kaithady-Explosion-that-Rocked-the-LTTE-on-Valentines-Day/172-276711) · `en`

The 14th of February 1987 remains an explosive date in the  annals of contemporary military history. A well-laid plan by the LTTE –  known popularly as the ‘Tigers’ – to attack the Navatkuli Army Camp on  Valentine’s Day went awry, due to the accidental explosion that killed  43 and injured 51 persons

Prabakaran wanted his cadres to re-draw plans and attack  Navatkuli again. But while preparations were in progress, the soldiers  expanded the camp area further by taking over the Andriesz factory and  the Thamby Walavu Coconut grove. The water problem faced by the Army was  solved.

The H-hour struck. The water bowser was substituted, and then filled with water at Kaithady, but the Tigers found to their dismay that in spite of their elaborate preparations, they had neglected one aspect. They had not tried filling their duplicate bowser with water, prior to the actual switching of both. When the water was filled, the outer pipes of the explosive laden bowser began leaking

### Tax files for everyone impractical to be done- Champika Ranawaka

*2024-02-09 23:55:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Tax-files-for-everyone-impractical-to-be-done-Champika-Ranawaka/108-276685) · `en`

Colombo, Feb 09 (Daily Mirror) - MP Patali Champika Ranawaka, leader of the United Republic Front underscores the impracticality of preparing tax files for every citizen of Sri Lanka.

He highlights the considerable time and manpower required, indicating that it takes approximately half an hour to process a single tax file while considering all requisite criteria.

With only nine officers tasked with this responsibility, the daily processing capacity is limited to 144 files, making the processing of millions of files a daunting and time-consuming endeavour.

He  contends that prioritising the collection of unpaid taxes from the 1272 defaulters identified by the Inland Revenue Department should take precedence over opening new tax files for every individual. However, he criticises the lack of action taken by the current government in this regard, resulting in an undue burden on the populace and the adoption of impractical measures.

Feb. 9 (Daily Mirror) - An inevitable win for Sri Lanka was only delayed by Afghanistan’s sixth wicket pair, Mohammad Nabi and Azmatullah Omarzi, who both cracked tons and shared a 242-run stand, as it turned out to be insufficient and too late.

Afghanistan, in their massive run chase of 382 runs, put themselves in deep trouble as they lost their top five wickets with just 55 on the scoreboard and ended up with a score of 339 for 6 to give Sri Lanka a win by 42 runs in the first of the three-match ODI series played at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium today and take a 1-0 lead.

Earlier in the day, Pathum Nissanka was on fire whilst running riot as he sent the Afghanistan bowlers on a leather hunt by slamming an unbeaten knock of 210 runs in only 139 balls, which included 20 boundaries and eight towering sixes, to become the first Sri Lanka batsman to slam an ODI double ton to help Sri Lanka, invited to take first lease of the wicket, to end with a formidable score of 381 for 3.

For the Government’s supporters, the evidence of “recovery” amounts simply to citing the absence of long queues for fuel and sky-high inflation

According to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Government he leads and his supporters, Sri Lanka has recovered from severe economic crisis. In reality, however, this “recovery” is a deepening of the economic crisis which is embedding extreme, near irreversible levels of deprivation and inequality in Sri Lankan society. This article interrogates Sri Lanka’s elite establishment, which is cheering on the Government, and its responsibility for the unfolding societal catastrophe.

### Israeli PM orders military plan to evacuate Rafah and defeat Hamas

*2024-02-09 23:48:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97153/israeli-pm-orders-military-plan-to-evacuate-rafah-and-defeat-hamas) · `en`

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Israel’s military on Friday to draw up a dual plan to evacuate Palestinian civilians from the crowded southern Gazan city of Rafah and to defeat the last Hamas fighters there.

His office announced the move as pressure mounted on Israel over its threat to launch a ground assault on Rafah, the last refuge for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are trapped in the city after fleeing fighting elsewhere.

U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday Israel’s response to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas militants was “over the top” and Washington said it would not support any military operation mounted in Rafah without due consideration for civilians.

Aid groups said there would be a high Palestinian death toll if Israeli forces stormed Rafah, and warned of the growing humanitarian crisis in the city, on the coastal enclave’s border with Egypt.

A particular question pertains to why the ICJ has not indicated a specific provisional measure ordering Israel to cease fire

With regard to the Order delivered by the International Court of Justice indicating Provisional Measures against Israel in the case brought by South Africa under the provisions of the UN Genocide Convention, questions galore on different aspects addressed. A particular question pertains to why the ICJ has not indicated a specific provisional measure ordering Israel to “cease fire”.

It is important to refer to Article 51 of the UN Charter for guidance in this context.

“Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”

President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s statement in Parliament on Wednesday that “resolution of the economic crisis lies not in a political but economic and scientific solutions” is incorrect.

We need to categorically state that the economic crisis has a well-defined identifiable disproportionately large political component.

Incompetent corrupt democratically elected politicians taking unscientific and economically incorrect political decisions to meet their short and long term political goals which were justified and sustained by a cohort of absolutely incompetent cohorts of ‘yes sir’ spineless Government officials who were political appointees.

As such the solution to the current economic crisis is bringing about an immediate change in the mode and style of governance and government by politicians and bureaucrats through a process of elections where the people decide their political and economic future.

The inquiry found Mr Biden “wilfully retained and disclosed” classified files, but decided not to charge him.

Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Hur determined Mr Biden had improperly kept classified documents related to military and foreign policy in Afghanistan after serving as vice-president.

The scathing 345-page report, released earlier in the day, said the president’s memory had “significant limitations”.

Mr Hur interviewed the 81-year-old president over five hours as part of the inquiry.

### Indian state passes uniform marriage legislation opposed by Muslims

Northern Uttarakhand state lawmakers passed the legislation on Wednesday and its approval by the state governor and the Indian president is seen as a formality before it becomes law in the state. Muslim leaders and others oppose the Uniform Civil Code initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu Nationalist party saying it interferes with their own laws and customs on such issues.

India, the world’s most populous nation with more than 1.4 billion people, is comprised of around 80% Hindus and about 14% Muslims. Muslims accuse Modi’s right-wing nationalist party of pursuing a Hindu agenda that discriminates against them and directly imposes laws interfering with their faith.

Pakistan, Feb 09 (Independent) With results from Pakistan’s election trickling in slower than normal, candidates backed by former prime minister Imran Khan’s party appeared to be doing better than expected, as he was seen neck-and-neck with the favourite Nawaz Sharif.

Preliminary election results normally emerge within a few hours in Pakistan but were hit by long delays overnight, only adding to existing fears of poll rigging.

The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had announced results of just eight of the 265 contested seats in parliament on its website by morning.

Mr Sharif’s PML-N is leading in four seats while members of Mr Khan’s PTI party who ran as independents won three seats, and the Pakistan Peoples Party of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari got just one.

The election commission cited an unspecified “internet issue” for the long delay of more than 13 hours of counting the votes as the PTI party alleged that the “overwhelming mandate of the people of Pakistan is being stolen”.
