### Just think about us

*2024-06-03 21:58:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/197353) · `si`

A powerful entity transforms into a vast, harsh body of water, capable of devastating human lives. Despite its cruelty, it embodies the essence of life: breath, birth, emotions, protection, and warmth. Amidst the rain, individuals reflect on their achievements while the innocent, sheltered within the water, remain oblivious to their fate. As time passes, memories of these innocents fade, yet reminders of their existence persist, urging for their release from this oppressive force.

🟩

He became a great body of water and cruel enough to turn human lives in the earliest.

Lives of breathing, emergence, feelings, protection, and warm.

In the middle of the rains, everyone looks at what they have earned and carefully carefully.

In the meantime, they are the innocent people who believe in the life of their master about their master.

They are hiding among the waters of the waters of the water and the increasing weight of the water.

There is plenty of information about the innocent innocent.

As the Maha Vanage is gradually, you can forget these dear pets.

Whenever you have all of their belongings, we also do not forget these innocent.

We ask you to be released as you can't take the least.

### Is the future Palestinian government possible?

*2024-06-03 21:21:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185247) · `ta`

The possibility of a future Palestinian government hinges on resolving longstanding conflicts, including border disputes, the status of Jerusalem, and the right of return for refugees. Recent international support, exemplified by European countries recognizing the Palestinian state, underscores the global desire for a peaceful resolution. However, challenges such as Israel's expansion beyond UN-defined borders, the presence of Jewish settlements, and the political implications of evacuating settlers complicate the path to a two-state solution.

🟩

The Hamas Movement on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the war on Israel's continuing war on Gaza has brought back the Palestinian issue in West Asia.. The world sees more countries to give a firm support for a future Palestinian state, with the destruction of a large part of the war Gaza and killed more than 36 thousand of its people.

Recently, three European countries, Spain, Norway and Ireland have recognized the Palestinian state. Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, say that if the Palestinian issue is not resolved, there will never be strict peace in the region. If the crisis is a solution with international recognition, it is a two -state solution.

The brief answer to this question is easy. The two state solution is to divide the land between the historical Balasatinam, the Jordan River to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the West of the Mediterranean.. But the long answer is complicated.

### Sri Lanka Government awaits Supreme Court ruling to cancel LG polls: State Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – The Sri Lankan government will not enact the necessary legislation to cancel already declared Local Government (LG) polls, a State Minister said, amid growing concerns over potential violations of election laws through various development projects and a poverty alleviation program.

The island’s Election Commission initially scheduled the LG polls for March 9, 2023, later postponing them to April 25, 2023. However, the elections were not held after President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s administration cited a lack of funds due to the country’s recovery from an unprecedented economic crisis.

Despite the postponement, the LG polls have not been officially canceled, meaning that standard election laws, including restrictions on political parties engaging in development projects or distributing funds, remain in effect.
