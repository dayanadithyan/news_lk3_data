Sri Lanka tax collections higher than revised 2023 target, deficit lower

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s tax collections in 2023 have totalled 2,750 billion rupees, up 55 from 2022 and higher than a revised out-turn presented at a November, official data show.

Sri Lanka originally targeted 3,130 billion rupees of tax collections in 2023 or 10.3-pct of gross domestic product despite an economic contraction but with an inflated economy at hikes in rates, while the International Monetary Fund projected only 3,005 billion rupees (10.1-pct of GDP).

In a budget for 2024 presented to parliament in November, the tax target was revised down to 2,596 billion rupees, or 9.2 percent of GDP.

But the actual collections have turned out to be 2,720 billion rupees for 2023, which is 8.9 percent of GDP.

### Sri Lanka changes fuel price formula ahead of polls; allow flexibility on profit margin

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has changed its fuel price formula used to determine the prices of fuel once a month with allowing flexibility in the profit margin, State Power and Energy Minister D V Chanaka said.

The move comes ahead of a presidential poll later this year in which President Ranil Wickremesinghe is expected to contest under an independent coalition.

Unprecedented fuel price hike in 2022 amid long queues due to shortage compelled nationalist Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna-led government to switch to fuel price formula which it cancelled in 2019 citing that government should have the control over fuel prices.

“We have changed the formula. Instead of 4% fixed profit margin, we have now allowed flexibility and fuel retailers can chose their profit margin from 0-4 percent,” Chanaka told reporters at a media briefing on Friday (26) in Colombo.

Ranil Wickremesinghe perceives himself as a unique selling proposition in the presidential election.

Ranil Wickremesinghe,  a 75-year-old  lawyer, has been immersed in politics for over 50 years. He has been an MP for almost 44 years. Ranil has served as  leader of the Opposition for about 18 years. He has been a deputy minister and Cabinet minister. Above all Wickremesinghe has been sworn in as Prime Minister six times. Impressive as it is, this record of service will not be Wickremesinghe’s lasting political legacy

The first advantage is that Wickremesinghe has a proven track record in this so far. He took over when the country was facing an unprecedented economic crisis. Shortages were rampant amid an acute lack of foreign exchange. There were queues everywhere but supplies were unavailable or inadequate. Power and fuel shortages had virtually paralysed the country

### Why is there so much braggadocio about drug pushers being arrested and drug caches being seized, but nothing concrete is done to stop the inflow of drugs?

Robert Frost once wrote, ‘Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.’ It’s a place like Hotel California in the popular Eagles song by that name — you can check out any time you like but you can never leave.

It’s all about family.  The prodigal son or daughter can return.  And when they do, other residents cannot pack their bags and leave, however distasteful the returnee has turned out to be or the returning is.

And even if they are far away, ‘family’ remains, in our thoughts and in our hearts, whether they are ‘prodigal’ or not. Indeed, while there are degrees of prodigality or extravagant behaviour that displease friends and relatives, few things can make people grieve as extreme addiction to narcotics and alcohol.

It is a ‘family matter’ unlike anything else. It is in fact a household matter wherever the addict may reside.

The cumulative factor of electing MPs on ethno-religious and caste preferences with ability to have personal issues addressed through them, have given the “vote” a completely contradictory reason for use, to what it is meant for. Within that distorted individualised purpose of using the vote left unquestioned, the likes of JVP/NPP now wants people to vote for candidates who would in their electorate “serve the people” and they pose as the most suitable candidates to “serve the people”. In plain language, Thevarapperumas do not “serve the people” as Nalinda Jayatissa says. They respond to individual requests

Two politicians, one a State Minister in present SLPP Government headed by President Wickremesinghe and the other a former State Minister under incumbent President Wickremesinghe’s previous “Yahapalana” rule, had tragic, unexpected deaths. One in a road accident and the other in an electrocution in his own land. The two had two different social responses over their deaths.

Climate change impacts all sectors, administrative levels, and segments of society. Research has firmly established the need to mobilise significant resources for addressing these impacts, as well as the current gaps and shortfalls in this endeavour. According to the first Global Stocktake, which was finalised at the 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement (COP28) in December 2023, the adaptation finance needs of developing countries “are estimated at USD 215–387 billion annually up until 2030,” and their needs to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) “at USD 5.8–5.9 trillion for the pre-2030 period.”

### For five long  years , Sri Lankan  governments have thumbed their noses at the Catholic church leading the call for accountability and justice for the Easter Sunday bombings.

*2024-04-26 23:07:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83942) · `en`

Election fever is hotting up in Sri Lanka, and this time around the most coveted by Opposition parties are those affected by the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings.

It’s been a long five years of waiting for the masterminds to be publicly named and brought to justice. Yet, incumbent governments choose to ignore the plight of the injured, and surving family members and their cries for accountability.

The governments of Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Ranil Wickremesinghe have studiously ignored the evidence placed before them. Instead, they’ve appointed those named and even fined by the courts for dereliction of duty to positions of command and power.

For five years the governments have thumbed their noses at the Catholic church leading the call for accountability and justice for the Easter Sunday bombings.

Colombo, April 26 (Daily Mirror) - The Association of Medical Specialists (AMS) have raised concerns regarding proposed changes to the entry criteria for fee-levying medical undergraduate programs at the state-owned medical school of Kothalawala Defense University.

Traditionally, admissions to medical faculties in Sri Lanka have been based primarily on the Advanced Level Examinations Z score, with the University Grants Commission (UGC) allowing a small allocation of additional marks for students excelling in extracurricular activities. This approach has been praised for providing equal opportunities regardless of economic or social background.

### Venice introduces entry fee for day-trippers to tackle mass tourism

After many years of preparation, Venice has finally debuted its controversial five-euro entry toll for tourists without a hotel reservation this Thursday (25).

This unprecedented measure – being the first city in the world to impose such a fee – has a clear objective: to confront mass tourism that has threatened the fragile balance of the city of canals for too many years, relentlessly driving out its residents.

The figures are quite graphic because, even though there are only about 50,000 residents living in the islands of Venice – not counting those living on the mainland – on days of high pressure, there can be up to 40,000 visitors in Venice at once.

Just last year, 20 million tourists came to walk through its alleyways. After having banned large cruise ships from the historic center in 2021, the City Council of La Serenissima has now decided to opt for an original measure after UNESCO threatened to include the municipality in the blacklist of endangered World Heritage Sites.
