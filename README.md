Local nationals in the south claim that if an immediate monitoring process is not enforced, tourists and locals are likely to clash as the tourists are attempting to hinder local businesses and hinder their livelihoods.

### Why the Sri Lankan economy is in crisis, while the cause is not addressed

*2024-02-28 03:31:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-the-Sri-Lankan-economy-is-in-crisis-while-the-cause-is-not-addressed/4-758939) · `en`

The idea in a Balance of Payments crisis, is to enhance exports to earn more foreign exchange, but the solutions put forward do not direct the economy in such a direction

Though it is now almost two years since the economic crisis blew over, Sri Lanka has not yet addressed the real cause of the crisis and is seeking solutions for the symptoms, while the cause lies elsewhere.

What is most frightening is that the solutions that are being acted on would cause greater damage to the economy to a point where it would totally be out of control, with no way out, even if we wanted to get back to a development path.

The past two years was valuable time that Sri Lanka had, to devise a way forward, which was lost in seeking solutions that were not related to the crisis. All the effort of the Government is to be able to go back to borrowing again and fall into a bigger mess.

Today, many thousands congregate to listen to another Tambuththegama product that eloquently addresses the masses, rooting his rural origin, on contemporary socio-economic-political problems, seeking the mandate to rule the country. He quotes the competition he faces from the elitists, depicting a ‘class struggle’. He is Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD), an educated, eloquent, robust political leader.

### Marx, Ants and Hyde Park Rally - EDITORIAL

Karl Marx was right, Socialism works, it is just that he had the wrong species– Edward Osborne Wilson

The argument put forwarded by Edward O. Wilson, the father was Socio-biology, was that altruism which is the very foundation of socialism, does not come naturally to human beings. Commenting on this subject in his book, “The Ants”, Wilson maintained that while altruism works for species like ants and bees, humans who are naturally selfish are unable to completely adjust to Socialism.

The above quote of Wilson was recited last Saturday to a packed audience at the Hyde Park in Colombo by Sugeeshwara Bandara who made his political debut that day.

Attributing the fall of the former USSR regime of Russia to the same theory, Bandara said forcing people to accept Socialist ways makes people frustrated and kills the spirit of innovation.

### ‘White Only’ Party and the Warped Mind of the Immigration Controller

The order by the Controller of Immigration and Emigration revealed the ‘FROG IN THE WELL’ mindset of the bureaucrats who rule the roost. This singular stupidity however has economic and potential geopolitical consequences that Sri Lanka cannot afford! The government should rescind the order and mitigate the negative publicity.

What would commonsensical authorities do when tourists are found to run businesses illegally?

Raid illegal ventures. Set up a mechanism to bring them into the tax net. Require them to comply with local regulations. Reform restrictive local laws, considering that businesses operate illegally in the first place due to a labyrinth of red tape that fosters graft and corruption.

No! The best that the warped minds of the Department of Immigration and Emigration could come up was to order the Russian and Ukrainian tourists who stay in the country on extended visas to leave within 14 days.

### Legality of no faith motion against speaker questionable: Minister

Colombo, Feb. 27 (Daily Mirror)- The legality of the no confidence motion which is being brought against Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene is questionable, Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today.

“The opposition claims that the Speaker got the Online Safety Bill enacted violating the constitution. It is not the Speaker who enacts a Bill. It is done by the MPs in Parliament. Speaker is not even allowed to participate in parliamentary debates. Also the Supreme Courts never force the legislature to amend any Bill. It only looks into whether a Bill violates any section of the constitution or not. How can one accuse the Speaker of violating the constitution in such a scenario? Therefore the legality of the no faith motion that is being brought against the Speaker is questionable,” the Minister said.

“Ruling party MPs will decide on their stance on the no faith motion on the basis of its legality,” he added.

Keeri Samba, cultivated for the first time in the Hambantota district’s Matigathwela area, has been very successful, said a senior official of the Agriculture and Plantation Industries Ministry.

The official said that growing Keeri Samba paddy for the first time on 100 acres at Agunakolapalassa in the Matigathwala area had given a boost to similar initiatives countrywide.

Keeri Samba cultivation was surveyed earlier this week by Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.

“At present, Samba and Nadu rice and paddy have exceeded the national requirement in our country, but there is a shortage of Keeri Samba rice. The reason is that farmers were not motivated to grow Keeri Samba rice in the 2022 season. Due to this, there was a huge shortage of Keeri Samba in the country, the minister said.

The minister added: “Because of this, the government took steps to import some other rice variety as an alternative to Keeri Samba.
