Thus, some of those who come forward to contest the election have to avoid those who come forward for their own reasons. Others come to the foreign ambassador services or the winning candidate from the winning candidate, in order to obtain the positions of the Head of State Department, to get the free media opportunity, or to appoint their representatives in the polls, to win the election for other reasons for other reasons.

The investigation revealed that Aabulkhan, along with his associates, was involved in confining trafficked victims on a boat before sending them to Mangaluru for further confinement. The case began in June 2021 when the Mangaluru Police rescued 13 Sri Lankan nationals from traffickers. The NIA took over the investigation and re-registered the case.

The probe uncovered that a Sri Lankan national named Eesan, believed to be the kingpin of the racket with links to the terror outfit LTTE, collaborated with Aabulkhan to illegally transport 38 Sri Lankan nationals to various parts of Tamil Nadu. The victims were falsely promised employment opportunities in Canada besides assurances to obtain legitimate documents for migration to the country.

As a country located 9- degree north of the equator, Sri Lanka is blessed with abundance of sun. Sun shines over Sri Lanka with vengeance to the point of feeling burning hot for most of the year. Yes, sun is everywhere. According to Asian Development Bank, a square meter of PV solar panel with 5.7 hours of sun can provide 4.6 KWh of power. That works out to be 807 watt-hours of solar power with a PV panel of 3 ft X 3 ft size every hour.

Another report by the ADB put the potential available capacity of solar power of SL at 16 GW or 16000 MW. This is huge and free power all year. Currently Sri Lanka houses about 750 MW of solar power or a pathetic 4.6% of available solar power.

Sri Lanka currently produces a total of about 5100 MW of power which 58% comes from renewable sources and the rest comes from fossil fuels. In other words, SL produce 2142 MW of power from crude and coal.
