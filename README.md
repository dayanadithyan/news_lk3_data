India’s Adani Group, which has committed SL’s single largest FDI in the power sector by committing to invest over a billion dollars in setting up ~500MW wind projects in Mannar and Pooneryn region, is facing resistance from a lobby group.

“Initially they said the project harms the environment. This when the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) was done by a renowned professor and the government promised to implement the suggestions made in it and by public to minimize environmental impact. Several other Renewable Energy Organizations, Climate Organizations, environment organisations like the National Environment Caucus, Youth for Renewable Energy Organization, Sri Lanka Blue Green Alliance too conducted their own studies and have decided to back the project.”

Efforts to stop a common candidate in the upcoming presidential election are underway, but Douglas Devananda, Secretary-General and Minister of the EPDP, believes these efforts will be futile for the Tamil people. He views this as an attempt to prolong the Tamil community's issues without addressing the root causes. Despite the lack of unity among them, he emphasizes the importance of relying on trusted leaders who have consistently communicated with the people.

🟩

Some people are talking about stopping the common candidate in the upcoming presidential election. It is also said that efforts are being made. I think it is not necessary to be a common candidate for me. Douglas Devananda, Secretary -General and Minister of the EPDP, said that the effort would not only be useless to the Tamil people.

He said this during a media briefing held at his party headquarters in Jaffna on Sunday (16).. In this regard, he said ..

In fact, I see this as an attempt to keep the problems of the Tamil people as long -standing problems.

Although they are all tied together in a potato bundle, they are scattered like a rolling in every direction, as Prabhakaran is not in the absence of today.

In this case, where is unity among them. What did you get for many years. Is it possible to control the destruction?Is there any improvement?In the absence of the election, they are talking about that again.

### Sri Lanka to end patrician tax free car permits under IMF deal?

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s car import relaxation will be linked to ending the practice of giving permits to special interest groups like civil servants, according to an International Monetary Fund program.

Sri Lanka has provided an initial plan to remove vehicle imports by May 21 and has pledged to give a detailed one by June 15.

“This finalized plan is tied to removing tax exemptions on imports of motor vehicles granted to specific groups including civil servants to curb any revenue leakages from the lifting of the restrictions,” the IMF program said.

“In order to support the recovery, we will relax restrictions on vehicles used for commercial purposes by June 2024.”

Sri Lanka gives tax slashed vehicles to state workers and completely tax-free vehicles to the elected ruling class.

### Why Sri Lanka needs new leadership

Wickremesinghe’s track record suggests a pattern of governance that prioritises personal and political survival over genuine public service

In the complex and turbulent political landscape of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe has emerged as a figure of significant controversy. Despite holding the office of Prime Minister six times and now serving as President, his tenure has been marked by a series of strategic manoeuvres that have often sidelined democratic principles and prioritised political expediency over national interest.

Wickremesinghe’s political career is a study in resilience and opportunism, akin to a chameleon that changes its colours to blend with its surroundings. The leader of the United National Party (UNP), the oldest political party in Sri Lanka, he has managed to stay relevant through numerous political storms. However, his methods and motivations raise serious concerns.

The IMF second review has not properly guided the Government to execute its first responsibility of ensuring macroeconomic stability and its continuing efficacy

The IMF issued a Press Release No. 24/214 on 12 June completing the second review under the Extended Fund Facility for Sri Lanka.

The economy is a system. The way we understand any system might be different. We understand the economy as a system having a cause-and-effect relationship. In such a system, as Buddhism preaches, nothing will happen without necessary conditions. When we look at the IMF second review, economic vulnerabilities just arise not knowing proper causes. Take the very first paragraph of IMF report. It says as follows:

Sri Lankans are finally ready to bid farewell to the three major parties. They are fed up with the old guard who have been cris crossing parties like leaches to remain in power, and eventually led our beloved homeland to financial ruin. It is widely believed and hoped that AKD will be elected to be our next President. I personally hope he will. Not so much know their agenda and policies but there is no other option.

But like thousands more, I am confused why Anura Kumara Dissanayake has not revealed his platform. Sri Lankans are screaming for a wholesale system change. They expect AKD and his team to deliver.

People are not expecting a change of face, but a change of the political structure that will create proper checks and balances, ensure independence of our criminal justice system, restore the rule of law and more.  With this in mind, here are my questions for AKD and his team

### Will  the current positions taken by Sajith Premadasa and Anura  Dissanayake Regarding the 13th Amendment  help bring about a positive change in the misconceptions among Sinhalese society about devolution of power?

*2024-06-16 21:09:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84206) · `en`

Although many amendments have been brought to the Sri Lankan Constitution during a period of more than four-and-a-half decades, which were detrimental to democratic governance, no major controversy has been raised against them.

However, the 13th Amendment (13A), which has a relatively democratic dimension, has been in the Constitution for more than three-and-a-half decades but has been controversial for a long time.

The 13A, introduced following the July 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord to introduce the system of Provincial Councils (PCs) has not been properly implemented by any government in office so far. Political controversies arise from time to time regarding that amendment. As the country looks ahead to the Presidential Election, there is another possibility of controversy raging regarding the 13A.

### The proposal by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to grant a six months extension to Sri Lanka’s Attorney General has put the hapless holder of that office in the centre of a vicious political whirlwind

*2024-06-16 21:00:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84201) · `en`

The proposal by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to grant a six months service extension to Sri Lanka’s Attorney General has put the hapless holder of that office in the centre of a vicious political whirlwind that further damages the already badly battered public reputation of the chief law officer of the land.

This must be said clearly and categorically. Absent that extension, the incumbent Attorney General will retire later this month. This controversial proposal has been placed with his customary aplomb by the President before the Constitutional Council (CC) sans any reflection on the grievous impact that this may have on constitutional propriety.

That proposal is now being tossed like a red hot coal by the CC from one week to the next. All this hot air comes in the backdrop of a looming national poll (presidential or parliamentary as the case may be) and in the wake of the President’s favourites in the United National Party (UNP) declaring that polls should be postponed.
