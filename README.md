### Vietnamese tycoon accused in multi-billion dollar bank fraud faces possible death sentence

*2024-04-11 13:48:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98573/vietnamese-tycoon-accused-in-multi-billion-dollar-bank-fraud-faces-possible-death-sentence) · `en`

(BBC) – It is the most spectacular trial ever held in Vietnam, befitting one of the greatest bank frauds the world has ever seen.

Behind the stately yellow portico of the colonial-era courthouse in Ho Chi Minh City, a 67-year-old property developer stands accused of looting one of Vietnam’s largest banks over a period of 11 years.

The numbers involved are dizzying. Truong My Lan is charged with taking out $44bn (£35bn) in loans from the Saigon Commercial Bank. Prosecutors say $27bn may never be recovered.

The habitually secretive communist authorities have been uncharacteristically forthright about this case, going into minute detail for the media. They say they have summoned 2,700 people to testify. There are 10 state prosecutors and around 200 lawyers involved.

The evidence is in 104 boxes weighing a total of six tonnes. Eighty-five defendants are on trial with Truong My Lan, who denies the charges. She and 13 others face a possible death sentence.

### Activist complains to Sri Lanka bribery commission on election deposit increase

ECONOMYNEXT — A civil society activist has lodged a complaint at the Committee to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption against a recent cabinet decision to increase the deposit placed by candidates contesting elections.

Jamuni Kamantha Thushara, Chairman of the Citizen’s Movement Against Fraud, Corruption, and Waste, who filed the complaint, told reporters on Wednesday April 11 that the deposit has been increased by 5,200 percent, which he claimed would give “corrupt” political parties who can afford such exorbitant rates the upper hand.

“With such a high amount, only corrupt political parties that engage in thievery can contest this election. An innocent person who can only manage to pay a small deposit can no longer contest,” said Thushara.

“Only thieving parties will be able to contest elections in the future,” he added.

Thushara also criticised the Commissioner of Elections for his support for the deposit increase citing rising election costs.

### War of words continues between Sri Lanka’s SJB, NPP on debate

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s main opposition the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the leftist NPP are on the warpath over a debate that each keeps challenging the other to but has yet to materialise.

SJB member Bandula Bandarigoda said he believes the NPP has been avoiding the matter because the party has no plan to develop the country.

“We invited the NPP first to a debate at the economic council level. Now they’re saying because it’s a presidential election, their leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake will come. Our leader gladly accepted, but this debate still hasn’t happened as they’re giving various reasons and wasting time. I think it’s because the NPP has no plan to take the country forward,” he said.

NPP member and All Ceylon Farmers Federation Convener Namal Karunaratne scoffed at the suggestion of a debate.

### Sri Lanka’s central bank buys $715mn from fx markets in March

*2024-04-11 06:45:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-central-bank-buys-715mn-from-fx-markets-in-march-158260/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has bought 715 million US dollars from forex markets in March 2024, up from a net 239.5 million US dollars in February, taking the total so far this year to 1,199 million dollars, official data show.

Gross official reserves went up by 431 million US dollars in March as debt was repaid from domestic savings.

A central bank is able to collect reserves when domestic credit is moderated by an appropriate interest rate (reducing domestic investments), and the rupees created by dollar purchases are mopped up by central bank securities sales to commercial banks.

The action constitutes a raising of ‘deposits’ by the central bank (a note-issue bank) from the domestic economy and lending it to the US or other reserve currency nations to finance their deficits.

The surveillance teams will specially check for vehicles that are transporting liquor in large quantities for resale purpose.

### With A View To A Kill (Master Spy-James Bond)!

“I know who did it” ~ Maithripala Sirisena on the Easter Bombing.

“We have met the enemy, and he is us”. Even as long ago as the Greek and Roman eras, playwrights have been engaging with the idea of tragicomedy, the dramatic coexistence of the two opposite elements in the human condition. “All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players” suggested the Bard; characters are inter-changeable, the dramatists introduced men as gods, slaves as masters, a trivializing portrait exemplifying the inherence of the two elements in the one moment, tragedy and comedy. The tragicomedy exaggerates and glorifies the trivial, the banal is presented as climacteric, a burlesque denying authenticity.

When an easy path is available and when the Indians and Sri Lankans both are linked to a common goal, why move on complicated routes?

The recent statements by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar (37 minutes long) on Kachchatheevu created a sensation in India and Sri Lanka, especially regarding what would be their short- and long-term repercussions. Quotes such as “every Indian” is angered as PM Modi said, and India needing to sit down and work out a solution, declared by Minister Dr. Subramaniam Jashankar, insinuated the heartburn and the potential for follow-up action in Indian power-houses.

Having watched recent TV performances by JVP leaders and NPP’s Dr. Harini Amarasuriya’s charming admission that though she reads Marx she is not a Marxist-Leninist nor is the leftist NPP, the SJB’s shadow finance minister Dr. Harsha de Silva experienced a “gotcha moment”. He exclaimed that this revealed a hugely problematic gap, and referring to the JVP’s admissions, challenged: “who can say they ‘love Marx’ and go to the IMF? No one does that! Tell me one country that does?” harsha de silva vcut (youtube.com)

The obvious answer is Ceylon/Sri Lanka and Dr. N.M. Perera, Minister of Finance, whose first visit to the IMF was in 1970. He was the Marxist leader of the country’s oldest and largest Marxist party. The IMF and World Bank engagement under his stewardship was critiqued by two widely-read books of the day, Cheryl Payer’s The Debt Trap and Teresa Hayter’s Aid as Imperialism.

### The Falcon and Falconer

No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable.

“The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones.”

It is showdown time. I borrowed the caption from the ‘The Second Coming’ by W.B. Yeats. Things fall apart and the centre cannot hold. Passionate intensity dictates debate.

The next election, Presidential or Parliamentary will be a ‘head-to-head’ encounter between the ‘dominant’ and the ‘dominated.’

Despite polls and engineered parades, the dismantling of the hegemony of the dominant class is not a certainty. Since hope is not optimism, I would say that it is a near certainty.

The Bastille will be breached. If not totally, substantially. 2024 is the year when people of Sri Lanka will prove Heraclitus right. “No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.”

Fitch Ratings said it has affirmed Sri Lanka-based Construction Guarantee Fund’s (CGF) National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating of ‘BB(lka)’. The Outlook is Stable.

Weak Operating Conditions: CGF’s performance exhibits a strong correlation with Government construction activity, as the company offers guarantees and related services to small- and medium-sized contractors involved in Government projects. The Government’s weak fiscal position has resulted in fewer new construction contracts, the suspension of existing projects and payment delays to contractors. This has affected CGF through a drop in premium income and a higher risk of claims by employers.
