“It was our responsibility to convince the majority of people to vote ‘yes’ and we clearly failed to do so,” Varadkar said.

### Nuwan Thushara takes hat-trick in third Bangladesh T20I

Nuwan Thushara became the fifth Sri Lankan to take a hat-trick in T20I cricket, as he made early breakthroughs to cripple Bangladesh's run chase in the third T20I in Sylhet.

Thushara, bowling his first over in the series, removed Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, Towhid Hridoy and Mahmadullah -- all deceived by his sling arm action -- to reduce the home team to 15 for 4, chasing a target of 175.

Thushara broke through Shanto's defence and castled the stumps with the second ball of the over, before uprooting the off stump to dismiss Hridoy on the next delivery.

He then completed the hat-trick of wickets when he trapped Mahmadullah leg before wicket, the decision being upheld despite the batsmen's review.

Thushara joins Thisara Perera, Lasith Malinga, Akila Dananjaya and Wanindu Hasaranga as the only Sri Lankans to take a hat-trick in the T20I format.

Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has been hit by a major coral bleaching event likely caused by heat stress built up over the summer at the biologically diverse site, a government agency has said.

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), which monitors the reef’s health, said on Friday that the damage was “widespread” in at least two-thirds of the areas surveyed at the UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The reef, a living organism, stretches some 2,300km (1,429 miles) off the northeastern coast of Australia and is considered one of the most species-rich habitats on earth. It is home to hundreds of coral, 1,500 fish species and 4,000 different molluscs.

Coral reefs are an important part of marine life as they house more than a quarter of all sea life on Earth, provide protection for coastal communities, and are natural carbon sinks. Climate change is the biggest threat to their survival because of their sensitivity to heat.
