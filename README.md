### Four arrested in Sampur for commemorating war dead

*2024-05-14 00:01:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Four-arrested-in-Sampur-for-commemorating-war-dead/56-761758) · `en`

Three females and a male were arrested by the Sampur Police on Sunday night for violating a court order by holding a commemoration event in remembrance of the Mullivaikkal war dead. According to sources, the arrested had allegedly distributed porridge to neighbours in memory of their relatives who were killed during the armed conflict.

The police, armed with a court order prohibiting such commemorative events, apprehended the four persons amidst a tense situation, as depicted in video footage showing the women being forcibly taken away.

The arrested were further remanded until 27 May after being presented to the Mutur Magistrates Court yesterday.

In 2016, the Human Rights Commission urged the Government to uphold the right to remember deceased relatives. However, activists view recent police arrests as a grave concern, considering this recommendation.

### Foreigner, Freeman forced out of Parliament 90 years ago First British passport holder elected to Parliament in 1924

*2024-05-14 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Foreigner-Freeman-forced-out-of-Parliament-90-years-ago-First-British-passport-holder-elected-to-Parliament-in-1924/172-282510) · `en`

Born in March 1864, Herbert Rayner Freeman was elected to the Legislative Council-(LG) under the Colebrook Constitution in 1924, representing the North-Central Province

Freeman was known to traverse miles along jungle trails, visiting the ill and those in need, always carrying his iconic umbrella. Remarkably, he even attended court sessions to advocate for individuals he believed had been unfairly accused in criminal cases

Abolish the National List; empower the electorate to choose their representatives. The current system is flawed, with party leaders and secretaries often lacking insight. They appoint individuals with dubious backgrounds, including terrorists and non-citizens, merely for financial gain. This practice undermines the credibility of our democratic principles and turns them into a farce. Let’s restore integrity to our electoral process by allowing people to have a direct say in who represents them.

### Untangling Sri Lanka’s messy government structure

This means that from 2010-2023, 111 gazettes have been published to  change either the duties and functions assigned to ministries, the  institutions that are assigned to those ministries or the laws that  these ministries are supposed to implement

It would be an absolute surprise for someone walking into a local ministry to find everything crystal clear. Rather it could be just the opposite with the operation all over the place. Sri Lanka’s system of government has a history of assigning unrelated subjects to a single ministry, thereby including multiple departments and institutions under one roof. The latest blueprint document for rational government by Verité Research reveals that the compositions of ministries had undergone changes 111 times between 2010 and 2023.

### The rise and fall  of South Asian leaders in Britain and Ireland

According to the website www.politico.com Rishi Sunak’s Conservative  party is “marching inexorably towards annihilation” in  the next  parliamentary elections expected to be held either at the end of this  year or January 2025. This is indicated in the results of the local  council elections held throughout the UK on May 2

The influence of South Asians at the highest political levels in the  British Isles appears to be on the wane. However, there is speculation  that Leo Varadkar might take up a top job in the European Union and  become the first person of part-Indian origin to do so

But Varadkar could not solve Ireland’s acute housing problem. Under both  terms as Taoiseach, he failed to hit targets for affordable housing. A  whole generation of young voters were unable to purchase homes

Leo Varadkar and Humza Yousaf have resigned and Rishi Sunak is shaky

Election fever is in the air. Yet elections have not been announced. It’s ‘Fun-O-Rama’ time for politicians who are having a ball. Past President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his time was a past master at splitting political parties that

This time around, the ex-president’s party-the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)- is one of the political outfits that is faced with several splits. The former chairman of the SLPP with 13 SLPP MPs defected and formed the ‘Freedom People’s Congress’. They now sit with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJP) in Opposition

SLPP strongman Basil Rajapaksa has demanded a General Election first. But added a rider as reported in the Daily Mirror on 8 May, that he would not leave room for a rift with the President. Former President Mahinda called for a rethink of the sale of state- owned enterprises, but in a very subdued tone.

The Leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya is at war with his Party chairman.

Transparency and widespread consultation is vital for an FTA Feasibility Study that reflects the interests of the country rather than vested interests of a few politicians and their business henchmen

It is mind boggling to perceive that in their haste to clinch as many FTAs as possible in obedience to the political masters in the fastest possible time with least dissent and negotiation, Sri Lanka is negotiating FTAs at the same level of its more developed partner countries opting for “substantial liberalisation” under GATT Article XXIV and Article V of the GATS in elimination of existing regulatory measures and prohibition of new regulations

### Government proposes law to co-opt and control non-governmental activity

While we challenge these individual attempts to dismantle our freedoms and rights, it is important to take a step back and see the monstrous governance apparatus that is growing

The proposed scheme appears to introduce legal legitimacy for the current oppressive treatment of non-governmental organisations. The scheme explicitly requires organisations to comply with governmental policy and agenda, rendering unlawful those who may criticise, challenge and question Government policy and agendas. It seeks to assert authority over all forms of non-governmental associations, groups and activities by introducing mandatory registration, whilst retaining powers to give directions to institutions that are specifically excluded from registration. The Government investment in the institutional mechanism and apparatus to oversee, supervise and direct non-governmental resources and activity is quite simply a taking control of the vast breadth of institutions and groups

### Electricity sector: What Rohan Samarajiva didn’t say

Samarajiva bemoans the fact that wind projects in Sri Lanka must pass an environmental impact  assessment whereas those in India need not. And that is somehow a good thing?

In his article, “Electricity sector: Without investment we will be in the dark again” (Daily FT, 7 April, 2024), Professor Rohan Samarajiva, evidently the latest apologist for India’s Adani Group, writes, “An eminent public intellectual, Rohan Pethiyagoda, bemoans the fact that a unit of electricity produced by the wind power facility proposed by Adani will cost more than wind-produced electricity in the US and in India.” He goes on, in the manner of a gifted prestidigitator, to cite a litany of excuses that argue for waiving the rules to help Adani cream of more than $ 700 million in excess profits from Sri Lankan electricity consumers. Much of what he writes consists purely of smoke and mirrors. But let’s cut to the bone.

(Reuters) - France won a record 15 billion euros ($16.17 billion) in foreign investment pledges on Monday, allowing President Emmanuel Macron to bask in the limelight with global CEOs and forget about strained public finances and weak polls for a while.

The bumper crop of pledges, in sectors ranging from artificial intelligence to pharmaceuticals and energy, stood Macron in good stead as he hosted business leaders for the annual “Choose France” summit at Versailles Palace.

This year’s figure is up from 13 billion euros announced in 2023.

The French presidency said the investments included 56 different business projects and could lead to the creation of 10,000 jobs.

Microsoft said it would invest 4 billion euros in France in its cloud and AI infrastructure, expanding its centres in Paris and Marseilles and adding a new data centre in the eastern city of Mulhouse.

Minister Jeevan Thondaman emphasized the need for plantation companies to comply with the government's gazette notification on salary increases for plantation workers, highlighting the companies' previous refusal to increase salaries despite the notification. He criticized the day-to-day wage system and urged for a switch to a more stable system. The minister also addressed the controversy surrounding the salary increase announcement by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, noting the companies' initial resistance to a salary increase and their subsequent willingness to increase the basic salary by 200 rupees. He questioned the companies' claims of financial constraints and called for an investigation into the lack of re-planting and maintenance of gardens, which have led to their transformation into forests. The minister also touched on the issue of clean drinking water in Jaffna, stating that the opening of the Salt Water Supply Center will increase the percentage of the population with access to clean water.

The Minister of Water Supply and Plantation Infrastructure Development Jeevan Thondaman said that the plantation companies need to function in accordance with the government's gazette notification issued by the government on the salary increase of plantation workers.

Minister Jeevan Thondaman further stated at a media briefing held at the Presidential Media Center on Monday (13).

“The day -to -day wage system is inappropriate. It is necessary to switch from that system. Four years will be required for that. For that, the plantation workers cannot be accepted to wait for a salary of 1000 rupees.

### What is greatly interesting about the Diana Gamage Saga  is the different approaches taken by the Supreme Court and a majority decision of the Court of Appeal with profound implications on the roll of the judicial dice in each instance.

Leaving apart the typically hysterical political brouhaha about the unseating of Diana Gamage, former (and largely unlamented) Member of Sri Lanka’s Parliament, what is greatly interesting about this otherwise distasteful saga is the different approaches taken by the Supreme Court and a majority decision of the Court of Appeal with profound implications on the roll of the judicial dice in each instance.

This concerned a parliamentarian whose seat was challenged by a social activist on the basis that she was the holder of a British passport thus ceasing to be a citizen of Sri Lanka and by virtue of Article 91 read with Article 89 of the Constitution, was disqualified from holding office as a Member of Parliament.

Significantly, the legal remedy sought was the rarely used Writ of Quo Warranto. This required Gamage to show ‘by what authority she claims to hold office and continue to function as a Member of Parliament.’
