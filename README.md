However, persons who sell illegal liquor continue to work in these areas without restrictions, ‚Äùhe said.

July 31, 2024. 122 billion government revenues were charged, and to reach the target more than Rs.. 110 billion is required.

In Sri Lanka's presidential election, Namal Rajapaksa faces unique challenges due to the presence of other candidates with similar names. This situation, reminiscent of past tactics by the Rajapaksas to confuse voters, has led to a confusing electoral landscape. Despite attempts to split votes among similarly named candidates, such strategies have historically failed to significantly impact the outcome.

üü©

The next -haired successor of the Rajapaksa lineage faces a different challenge in the upcoming presidential election.

Sri Lanka's voters face an unprecedented long -standing ballot as 36 candidates have been restricted until Tuesday evening.

Two nams in this ballot have turned the ballot into a confusion.

Stopping candidates of the same name is a tactic used by Rajapaksas in the past.

Rajapaksas stopped Sirisena to confuse Maithripala Sirisena's supporters who contested the presidential election in the 2015 presidential election as the general candidate of the opposition parties.. He was seen as a look like Maithripala Sirisena.

AR Sirisena, who stopped Rajapaksakkal, received 18174 votes, though many were not disappointed by this deception.

If his name is written in C.S.

However, the letter H in English is overwhelmed by a few people.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he will step down in September, ending a three-year term marred by political scandals and paving the way for a new premier to address the impact of rising prices.

‚ÄúI will continue to do everything I can as prime minister until then end of my term in September,‚Äù Kishida said in a televised press conference on Wednesday to announce his decision not seek re-election as Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader.

His decision to quit triggers a contest to replace him as party boss, and by extension as the leader of the world‚Äôs fourth-biggest economy.

Kishida‚Äôs public support eroded amid revelations about the party‚Äôs ties to the controversial Unification Church, and more recently, unrecorded political donations made at LDP fundraising parties.

### Double Trouble for Namal as Sri Lanka Nominations Set to Close

*2024-08-13 21:21:00* ¬∑ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/double-trouble-for-namal-as-sri-lanka-nominations-set-to-close-176685/) ¬∑ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì The heir apparent of the Rajapaksa dynasty will face an unusual challenge in the September 21 presidential election, with his loyalists confronted by another Namal Rajapaksha on the ballot paper.

With 36 candidates having paid their deposits to get on the ticket by Tuesday evening and one more day left to pay, the 2024 ballot paper is set to be the longest yet.

Adding two Namals with the same last name makes the voting slip potentially the most confusing‚Äîat least for Namal‚Äôs loyalists. Fielding candidates with names similar to main contenders has been a tried-and-tested tactic before, notably by the Rajapaksas themselves.

In 2015, the Rajapaksas not only fielded another ‚ÄúSirisena‚Äù in an attempt to confuse voters of Maithripala Sirisena‚Äîthe opposition‚Äôs common candidate‚Äîbut also gave him a makeover to resemble the man from Polonnaruwa.
