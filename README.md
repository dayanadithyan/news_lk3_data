“We asked the election commission to have the election in the shortest time possible,” he said.

Asked about the main opposition the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and leftist National People’s Power (NPP), he said: “The SJB and the NPP badly want to accept defeat, so it’ll be good to have an early election to give them what they want.”
