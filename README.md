The operation further dealt a critical blow to organized crime, successfully capturing 28 individuals included on the watchlist of the Police Narcotics Bureau and Special Bureau.

Authorities recovered a substantial amount of narcotics during the operation, with ice constituting the majority of the seizures.

Over 7 kilograms of the highly addictive drug were confiscated.

இலங்கையில் மாம்பழ அறுவடை இந்த ஆண்டு வரலாறு காணாத அளவில் அதிகரித்துள்ளதாக விவசாயத் திணைக்களம் தெரிவித்துள்ளது.

2023ல் நீடித்த வறண்ட வானிலையும், அதைத் தொடர்ந்து பெய்த மழையும் மாம்பழ அறுவடையை அதிகரிக்கச் செய்ததாக அவர்கள் தெரிவித்தனர்.

விவசாயம் மற்றும் பெருந்தோட்ட கைத்தொழில் அமைச்சர் தலைமையில் இடம்பெற்ற கலந்துரையாடலின் போது, ​​நாடளாவிய ரீதியில் ஆயிரக்கணக்கான ஏக்கர் மாம்பழங்கள் பயிரிடப்படுவதாகவும், குறிப்பாக ஏற்றுமதிக்காக பயிரிடப்படும் TEJC மாம்பழம், விலை குறைவினால் உற்பத்தி தடைப்படலாம் எனவும் அண்மையில் வலியுறுத்தப்பட்டது.

எனவே, மா பயிர்ச்செய்கையை மேலும் விரிவுபடுத்த வேண்டுமா என்பது குறித்த அறிவியல் அறிக்கையை தன்னிடம் வழங்குமாறு அமைச்சர் உத்தரவிட்டார்.

அறுவடைக்குப் பிந்தைய தொழில்நுட்பக்கழக தரவுகளின்படி, இந்நாட்டில் விளையும் அனைத்து வகையான மாம்பழங்களின் வருடாந்த அறுவடை சுமார் 250 மில்லியன் பழங்கள் ஆகும்.

எவ்வாறாயினும், 2023-24 மாம்பழ பருவம் அந்த அளவைத் தாண்டியுள்ளதாக தற்போதைய தரவு உறுதிப்படுத்தியுள்ளது என்று திணைக்களம் கூறுகிறது.

இதன் காரணமாக ரூ.800 முதல்1000 வரை விலை போன 1 கிலோகிராம் TEJC மாம்பழம் தற்போது ரூ. 400 முதல் 500 ரூபாய்  வரை குறைந்துள்ளதாக விவசாய திணைக்களம் தெரிவித்துள்ளது.

### Air quality declines in several areas across the island

*2024-01-16 11:19:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96439/air-quality-declines-in-several-areas-across-the-island)*

The air quality has declined in several areas of the island, the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) said.

The Media Spokesman ofre the CEA Ajith Weerasundara stated that accordingly a decline in the air quality index is observed in the Colombo, Jaffna, Mannar and Galle areas.

Weerasundara also took into note that as a result patients with respiratory issues and respiratory-related medical conditions should be more attentive regarding the matter.

Furthermore, he expressed that the major cause of this situation is the entry of various types of air pollutants by way of the air currents passing through the island, especially the wind currents from the outer regions of other countries, such as the Bay of Bengal.

The authority also emphasized that there is a minor possibility of this situation affecting the health of the people living in those areas.

“Especially people living in these areas who suffer some kinds of lung-related disorders like Asthma should be careful up to a level. As an example, if you wear facemasks, you can protect your health”, Weerasundara said.

“We believe that this situation will gradually subside and return back to normal in a few days. Here we especially request you to pay attention to the condition of the atmosphere”, he added.

Meanwhile, the air quality in New Delhi, India continues to linger between “very poor” and “severe”, whilst Delhi residents once again confronted dense fog and bone-chilling cold, causing widespread flight and rail operations disruptions, the foreign media reported on Tuesday (Jan. 16).

The air quality of India’s Delhi (272) ranked first as the poorest air quality in the world and India’s Kolkata (154) is third on the list, according to IQAir.

The AQI (Air Quality Index), used to communicate to the general public the daily air quality, is based on the measurement of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions. An AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality, as per international standards.

### Iowa caucus 2024: Trump dominates, DeSantis edges Haley for second

*2024-01-16 11:15:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96438/iowa-caucus-2024-trump-dominates-desantis-edges-haley-for-second)*

Donald Trump secured a resounding victory in the first 2024 Republican presidential contest in Iowa on Monday, asserting his command over the party despite facing scores of criminal charges as he seeks a rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, 45, finished well behind in second place, edging out former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, 51, as they battle to emerge as the chief alternative to Trump.

Trump, 77, won by an unprecedented margin for an Iowa Republican contest, strengthening his case that his nomination is a foregone conclusion given his massive lead in national polls.

“THANK YOU IOWA, I LOVE YOU ALL!!!” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.

With 95% of the expected vote tallied, Trump had 51%, while DeSantis was at 21% and Haley 19%, according to Edison Research. The largest margin of victory for an Iowa Republican caucus had been 12.8 percentage points for Bob Dole in 1988.

Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy ended his long-shot presidential bid after earning just under 8% of the vote on Monday and endorsed Trump in a speech to supporters.

If Trump finishes above 50%, winning more than all his rivals combined, it will further weaken his opponents’ argument that his march to the nomination can be derailed.

His performance reflected his popularity among Republican voters - even after two impeachments, his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of supporters and his 91 criminal charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election, retaining classified documents after leaving the White House and falsifying records connected to hush money payments to a porn star.

Nearly two-thirds of caucus-goers embraced his false claims about voter fraud, saying they did not think Biden legitimately won the presidency. More than 60% said Trump would still be fit to serve as president even if convicted of a crime.

Trump dominated across the board, according to an Edison entrance poll: he won a majority among men and among women; among those who consider themselves very conservative, somewhat conservative and independent; among those who graduated college and those who did not.

He captured a majority of Republicans who put immigration as their top concern - and a majority of those who said the economy was their main worry.

“The Iowa caucus results demonstrate the strength of Trump’s grip on the Republican Party,” said Jimmy Centers, an Iowa-based Republican strategist. “Absent a quick consolidation of the field, Trump appears to be on a fast track to the nomination.”

That consolidation appears unlikely, with both DeSantis and Haley vowing to press ahead following Monday’s results, ensuring Trump’s opposition will remain fractured as the campaign moves to other states.

DeSantis in particular had wagered his campaign on Iowa, barnstorming all of its 99 counties and pouring resources into the state.

“We’ve got our ticket punched out of Iowa!” DeSantis told supporters in West Des Moines on Monday.

Haley, who has enjoyed a steady rise in polls over the last few months, sought to position herself as the leading Trump challenger.

“At one point in this campaign there were 14 of us running. I was at 2% in the polls,” Haley told a crowd of supporters. “When you look at how we’re doing, in New Hampshire, in South Carolina and beyond, I can safely say tonight Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race.”

Republicans in more moderate New Hampshire will choose their nominee eight days from now. Polls show Trump with a smaller lead over Haley there, with DeSantis far behind.

Trump has aimed to create an air of inevitability around his campaign, skipping all five of the Republican debates thus far and largely eschewing the county-by-county politicking that most candidates do ahead of the Iowa vote.

Iowans braved life-threatening temperatures to gather at more than 1,600 schools, community centers and other sites for the state’s first-in-the-nation caucus, as the 2024 presidential campaign officially got under way after months of debates, rallies and advertisements.

“Trump is very narcissistic, he’s very cocky, but he’s going to get stuff done,” said Rita Stone, 53, a Trump backer, who attended a caucus at a West Des Moines high school. Like many other voters, Stone said her leading concern was the U.S. southern border with Mexico, praising Trump’s effort to build a wall when he was president.

Unlike a regular election, Iowa’s caucus requires voters to gather in person in small groups, where they cast secret ballots after speeches from campaign representatives.

Edison projected there would be approximately 120,000 votes counted, far short of the record 187,000 cast in the 2016 Republican caucus.

With the cold weather depressing turnout, Trump’s grip on his most loyal supporters may have given him an edge.

Iowa Democrats did not vote on Monday for their presidential nominees because the party has reshuffled its nominating calendar to put states with more diverse populations ahead of Iowa this year. They will cast their ballots by mail, with the results to be released in March.

Iowa has historically played an outsized role in presidential campaigns due to its early spot on the campaign calendar.

But the winner of Iowa’s Republican caucuses did not go on to secure the nomination in the last three competitive contests in 2008, 2012 and 2016.

A political battleground that backed Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, the state is now seen as reliably Republican in presidential elections as registered Republicans edge out Democrats.

### Concerns raised as prisons overcrowded by 232% - report

*2024-01-16 11:03:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96437/concerns-raised-as-prisons-overcrowded-by-232-report-)*

A recent government audit report on the management of overcrowding in prisons has revealed that the prisons capacity has exceeded by 232%.

The performance audit claimed that upon consideration of the data gathered for the last seven years, from 31 December 2015 to 31 December 2022, the number of inmates in the overall prison system in Sri Lanka has increased from 139% to 232% of capacity in Prisons.

This percentage increased from 149% to 213% from the beginning of 2016 to the end of 2019, and subsequently dropped to 139% by 31 December 2021.

“The reason for that was, the increase of prison capacity from 11,762 to 13,241(that is by 12.5%) by the end of 2020”, the report reads in this regard.

Despite the prison capacity having increased, however, the number of inmates too, have increased, thereby yet again giving rise to the issue of overcrowding, with the highest number of inmates exceeding the prison capacity being recorded in 2022.

“The average monthly number of detainees held in the 12 months of the year 2022 is 22,097 and it has grown by 15 per cent as compared to the average monthly number of 19,295 detainees in 2021”, the report read.

The overcrowding in prisons has also led to several other issues, including a lack of adequate space and sanitation facilities.

As per the performance audit, there was a shortage of 187 toilets in 27 prisons, and 287 of the existing toilets were in a condition of repair, while 14 prisons across the island have a shortage of 108,689 square feet of space. Meanwhile, the insufficient space for female inmates in cells and wards in the Negombo and Vavuniya prisons as at 01 July 2022 was 240 and 141 square feet respectively.

The report further identified two reasons behind the overcrowding of prisons; one being the influence of the economic, social, political and legal environment, in the context that difficulties faced during the economic crisis lead to higher rates of criminal activity which thereby lead to increased arrests, while the other reason was identified as the increase in imprisonments related to drug offences.

“A large number of Sri Lankan inmates have been involved in drug offenses. The number of prison inmates in Sri Lanka is 26,176, of which over 53 per cent, i.e. 13,794, are inmates related to drug offenses as at 31 December 2022”, the audit revealed.

The report further noted, however, that despite the rise in arrests and imprisonment is a direct result of increased criminal activity and subsequent overcrowding in prisons, the audit further highlighted that deficiencies in the administrative process related to law enforcement for criminals and imprisonment have also led to the creation of prison overcrowding.

### Indian air traffic disrupted on third day of dense fog

Dense fog swathed large parts of northern India on Tuesday for the third straight day of an intense cold wave, reducing visibility to disrupt more than 160 flights.

As many as 128 flights from the international airport in New Delhi, the capital, were delayed, with 33 cancelled, aviation site Flightradar24 showed, an effect that cascaded through flight schedules nationwide.

Visibility at the airport stood at 50 m (164 ft) at 8 a.m., weather officials said, predicting similar conditions until the end of the week.

New Delhi’s lowest temperature this winter was 3.3 degrees Celsius (37.4 degrees Farenheit) on Monday, when low visibility and dense fog caused the delay of as many as 500 flights and the cancellation of 87.

Angry passengers argued with airline staff in images on television and social media, with one video showing passengers eating dinner as they waited on the tarmac for a delayed flight.

On Monday, the aviation minister said authorities were hastening efforts to use an additional runway, equipped with the CAT III navigation system that enables aircraft to land despite low visibility.

Sri Lanka’s T20 captain Wanindu Hasaranga stresses that he is not prepared to respond to questions regarding any rumours circulating on social media.

“We still have a small number like 08 matches before the T20 World Cup”, he added.

Meanwhile, in response to a question raised by a journalist regarding whether he invited former captain Angelo Mathews to join the T20 squad, Hasaranga emphasized that Mathews is not a retired player and that therefore, there is no need to invite him to the team as he is already in it.

“Angelo Mathews is not a retired player. We could see the performance of a well-experienced player like Mathews…the way he batted until the end of a match so easily. He has not retired to be invited [into the team]”, he claimed.

### Donald Trump wins Iowa caucus, taking early lead to be Republican candidate for the presidency

*2024-01-16 10:34:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/16/donald-trump-wins-iowa-caucus-taking-early-lead-to-be-republican-candidate-for-the-presidency/)*

Colombo (News 1st) – Former President Donald Trump swept to victory in the Iowa Caucuses, the first step of the Republican Party's selection process of their candidate for the 2024 Presidential Election this November. Trump won 20 of the 40 delegates from the state.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis came in second with 8 delegates, while former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley was third with 7 delegates.

Entrepreneur Vivek Ramasamy, who had run a vibrant and entertaining anti-establishment campaign, announced that he was dropping out of the race, after winning just 2 delegates.

The Iowa Caucuses are the first step, with the Republican Party holding separate processes in each state to choose the candidate. All state delegates vote in the final Republican Party National Convention.

A similar process is run by the Democratic Party, which has not yet begun. Incumbent President Joe Biden, 81, is the frontrunner.

Trump, 77, is battling multiple legal challenges in many state and federal courts over his role in the failed 2021 January 6 insurrection, which may disqualify him from being a candidate.

### MIDDLE EAST CRISIS: Iran attacks site in Iraq it says is a Mossad office. Houthi missile hits US cargo ship

*2024-01-16 10:08:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/16/middle-east-crisis-iran-attacks-site-in-iraq-it-says-is-a-mossad-office-houthi-missile-hits-us-cargo-ship/)*

Colombo (News 1st) – UPDATE: Tensions rose further in the Middle East as Iran attacked what it called an Israeli Mossad centre in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil early Tuesday (16th), and a Houthi missile fired from Yemen hit a U.S.-owned cargo ship in the Red Sea, raising the possibility of more U.S. military strikes on Yemen in response, foreign media reported.

At least eight explosions were heard in Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, early on Tuesday.

A statement from Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said in a statement: “Ballistic missiles were used to destroy espionage centres and gatherings of anti-Iranian terrorist groups in the region late tonight”.

A later IRGC statement, shared by Iran’s IRNA news agency, claimed the group had targeted the headquarters of Israeli spy agency Mossad in Erbil.

Hours before, the merchant vessel Gibraltar Eagle, flying the flag of the Marshall Islands, was hit in the Red Sea by an anti-ship ballistic missile fired from Yemen by the Houthis, but has not suffered any significant damage and is continuing on its way, U.S. Central Command said.

A second missile that was fired had malfunctioned and crashed on land in Yemen.

The Houthi attacks came a few days after the U.S. and U.K. struck multiple targets across Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen with over 100 bombs and missiles. The Houthis have vowed revenge against the US, UK and any nation that helps the coalition.

The Houthis have been staging attacks against ships in the Red Sea for more than a month, claiming that they are only targeting ships bound to or from Israel or are connected to Israel in some way.

Most of the world's largest shipping firms have suspended sending vessels through the Red Sea and are now using the much longer route around Africa. This has driven shipping rates up and caused some disruption to global supply chains.

Members of 72 trade unions from the health sector have launched a 24-hour strike this morning (16 Jan.) over several demands.

Meanwhile, Health Minister Ramesh Pathirana has invited the trade unions for a discussion this evening, however, Convenor of the Union Ravi Kumudesh warned that the strike will continue in the event unnecessary measures are taken against the unions.

Speaking with regards to the strike on Monday (15 Jan.), President of the Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) Upul Rohana stressed that because Minsiter Pathirana is yet to provide any discussion regarding their demands,  around 100,000 health workers including all paramedical services, hospital secretaries, administrative officers as well as health administrative assistants, minor staff and 75 other trade unions of the health staff will join together with this island-wide strike.

“This action will completely disrupt the hospital service. The government should understand that it is not possible to maintain medical services only with the doctors”, Upul Rohana said.

The trade union action was launched in protest of the government’s decision to increase the  Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors by Rs. 35,000.

ඉතාලියේදී සැකකටයුතු හදිසියේ මියගිය තම ස්වාමියාගේ සිරුර මාස දහයකට ආසන්න කාලයක් එරටේ මල්ශාලාවක තැන්පත් කර තිබිමෙන් එම සිරුර භාරගෙන අවසන් කටයුතු කිරීමට,තම පුතුට සහ තමාට  ඉතාලියට යෑමට තානාධිපති කාර්යාලයෙන් මෙතෙක් තමන්ට වීසා නොදීමෙන් තමන් දැඩි අසීරුතාවයට පත්ව සිටින බව මහනුවර, මාවිල්මඩ පටුමග අංක 51/04 ලිපිනයේ පදිංචි එක්දරු මවක වන 48 වියති බී. නිරෝෂා ශාමලී මහත්මිය හැඬු කඳුළින් පැවසුවාය.

මෙලෙස සැකකටයුතු ලෙස ඉතාලියේදී මියගොස් ඇත්තේ, 51 වියති එක්දරු පියෙකු වන වීරක්කොඩි රාළලාගේ සම්පත් චන්දන වීරක්කොඩි යන යුද හමුදාවේ කපිතාන්වරයකු ලෙස සේවය කළ අයෙකි.

මියගිය තම ස්වාමියාගේ මළසිරුර එරටේ මල්ශාලාවක තැන්පත් කර තිබෙන අතර ඒ සඳහා තැන්පත් කුලි වශයෙන් මෙරටේ මුදලින් දිනකට රුපියල් 18,000 ක මුදලක් ගෙවීමට සිදුව ඇති බවත් ඒ අනුව මෙතෙක්

"ඉතාලියේදී මගේ මහත්තයා නැතිවෙලා දැන් මාස දහයටත් ලංවෙනවා මටයි පුතාටයි එයාගේ අවසන් කටයුතු කරන්න යන්න වීසා ලබා දෙන්නෙ නෑ, වීසා හදාගන්න ගියාම මම පුදුම පීඩනයකට ලක්වෙලා ඉන්නේ, මගේ පුතත් නිතර කම්පනයෙන් ඉන්නේ තාත්තා බලන්න යන්න ඕනේ කියලා. නමුත් අපි දෙන්නට තවමත් තානාධිපති  කාර්යාලයෙන් වීසා නොදීම නිසා මහත්තයාගේ අවසන් කටයුතු කරන්න යන්න බැරිවෙලා ඉන්නවා.

The Ministry of Defence says that tri-forces personnel have been mobilized to support hospital operations amid the island-wide strike launched by the health sector employees.

It said that tri-forces personnel were deployed to various government hospitals across the island following a request from the Ministry of Health.

Meanwhile the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) says troops have been deployed at various government hospitals across the country to ensure the uninterrupted delivery of essential health services today (16 Jan), under the guidance of the Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Vikum Liyanage.

The affected hospitals include prominent health institutions such as Colombo National Hospital, Kandy General Hospital, Kalubowila Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya Teaching Hospital, Matale District Hospital, Kurunegala Teaching Hospital and the Government Hospitals in Monarahala, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Hambanthota, Balangoda, Thissamahara, Debarawewa, Balangoda, Eheliyagoda, Diyathalawa, Matara, Avissawella and several others.

The deployment is aimed at maintaining the smooth operation of healthcare facilities during this critical time, the Sri Lanka Army said.

Under the supervision of the respective Security Forces Commanders, Army personnel are actively stationed at these hospitals to lend support and ensure that healthcare services continue without disruptions. Troops also remain on standby for additional troop deployment in case of emergencies, it said.

Around 72 trade unions in the healthcare service excluding doctors have launched a 24-hour token strike from 6.30 a.m. today (16) while the trade unions have decided to carry out only essential duties.

The trade unions are launching this action demanding that the allowance increase of Rs. 35,000 provided to the doctors be granted to them as well.

However, it is said that this morning, Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana has also invited the striking trade unions to a discussion on the matter.

Meanwhile Acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe says that he is to meet Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana later this evening to discuss the concerns of the health sector and find solutions.

### කන්දකාඩු: දිගින් දිගට ම රැඳවියන් පලා යන්නේ  පුනරුත්ථාපන ක්‍රමවේදය අසාර්ථක නිසා ද?

කන්දකාඩු: දිගින් දිගට ම රැඳවියන් පලා යන්නේ  පුනරුත්ථාපන ක්‍රමවේදය අසාර්ථක නිසා ද?

ශ්‍රී ලංකාව තුළ මත්ද්‍රව්‍යවලට ඇබ්බැහි වූ පුද්ගලයින් පුනරුත්ථාපන ක්‍රියාවලිය සාර්ථකව සිදුවනවා ද යන්න සම්බන්ධයෙන් මේ වන විට සමාජය තුළ දැඩි කතාබහක් මතුව තිබේ.

ඒ, එවැනි පිරිස් පුනරුත්ථාපනය සඳහා "වැඩි වශයෙන්" යොමු කෙරෙන පොලොන්නරුව, වැලිකන්ද, කන්දකාඩු ප්‍රතිකාර හා පුනරුත්ථාපන මධ්‍යස්ථානය තුළ ගෙවුණු වසර කිහිපයේදී වාර්තා වුණු සිදුවීම් හේතුවෙනි.

එහි ආසන්නතම සිදුවීම වාර්තා වූයේ, ඉකුත් ජනවාරි 12 වන දින ය. එදින ආහාර ගැටලුවක් මුල් කරගනිමින් ඇතිවූ ගැටුම්කාරී තත්ත්වයක් හමුවේ එම මධ්‍යස්ථානයේ රඳවා සිටි රැඳවියන් අතුරින් 20කට අධික සංඛ්‍යාවක් පලා ගොස් තිබිණි.

ඉකුත් වසරේ, එනම් 2023 වසරේ දෙසැම්බර් 12 වන දා ද එවැනි ම ආකාරයේ සිදුවීමක් වාර්තා වුණු අතර එහිදී මධ්‍යස්ථානයෙන් රැඳවියන් 100කට අධික ගණනක් පලා ගියහ.

2022 වසරේ ඇති වූ සිදුවීමකින් කන්දකාඩු කඳවුරේ රඳවා සිටි රැඳවියෙකු මියගොස් තිබුණු අතර ඒ සම්බන්ධයෙන් එහි සහය උපදේශකවරුන් ලෙස කටයුතු කළ ගුවන් හමුදා සැරයන්වරුන් දෙදෙනෙකු, යුද්ධ හමුදා මාණ්ඩලික සැරයන්වරයෙකු හා යුද්ධ හමුදා සැරයන්වරයෙකු රක්ෂිත බන්ධනාරගත කෙරිණි.

කන්දකාඩු රැඳවියාගේ මරණය සම්බන්ධයෙන් ආරක්ෂක අංශ සාමාජිකයින් 04 දෙනෙකු රක්ෂිත බන්ධනාගාරයට

අධිකරණ, බන්ධනාගාර කටයුතු හා ආණ්ඩුක්‍රම ව්‍යවස්ථා ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ අමාත්‍ය ජනාධිපති නීතිඥ විජයදාස රාජපක්ෂ බීබීසී සිංහල සමග අදහස් දක්වමින් සඳහන් කළේ, මෙවැනි ගැටලුකාරී තත්ත්ව වැඩි වශයෙන් වාර්තා වී ඇත්තේ, කන්දකාඩු ප්‍රතිකාර හා පුනරුත්ථාපන මධ්‍යස්ථානය ආශ්‍රිතව බව ය.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාව තුළ මත්ද්‍රව්‍යවලට ඇබ්බැහිවූවන් පුනරුත්ථාපනය කිරීම සඳහා අන්තරායකර ඖෂධ පාලක ජාතික මණ්ඩලය, පුනරුත්ථාපන කොමසාරිස් ජනරාල් කාර්යාංශය සහ බන්ධනාගාර දෙපාර්තමේන්තුව යටතේ ක්‍රියාත්මක මධ්‍යස්ථාන මෙන් ම, පෞද්ගලික අංශය මගින් පවත්වාගෙන යන පෞද්ගලික මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය ප්‍රතිකාර හා පුනරුත්ථාපන මධ්‍යස්ථාන ද පවතී.

කෙසේ වෙතත්, ඒ අතරින් කන්දකාඩු වැනි ඇතැම් මධ්‍යස්ථාන හමුදා පරිපාලනයක් යටතේ ක්‍රියාත්මක වීම පිළිබඳවත්, එය කොතෙක් දුරට සාර්ථක ද යන්න පිළිබඳවත්, කන්දකාඩු සිදුවීම් හා සැසඳීමේදී පුනරුත්ථාපන විෂය පිළිබඳ පුළුල් දැනුමක් ඇති පිරිස් සහ සමාජය ප්‍රශ්න කරති.

දිගින් දිගට ම රැඳවියන් පලා යන්නේ පවතින ක්‍රමයේ ඇති අසාර්ථකත්වය නිසා ද?

කන්දකාඩු ප්‍රතිකාර හා පුනරුත්ථාපන මධ්‍යස්ථානය ආරම්භයේ සිට ම ඒ තුළ හමුදාවේ මැදිහත්වීම ඉහළ ලෙස පැවති බව පේරාදෙණිය විශ්වවිද්‍යාලයේ වෘත්තීය උපදේශක සුචින්තන දසුන් පවසයි. නමුත්, එහි මත්ද්‍රව්‍යවලට ඇබ්බැහි වූවන් සඳහා ප්‍රමිතිගත ප්‍රතිකාරයක් නොලැබෙන්නේ යැයි ඔහු බීබීසී සිංහල හා පැවසීය.

සුචින්තන දසුන් මානසික සෞඛ්‍ය හා ඇබ්බැහිවීම් පිළිබඳ උපදේශකවරයෙකු මෙන් ම, එක්සත් ජාතීන්ගේ සංවිධානය සහ ලෝක සෞඛ්‍ය සංවිධානය වැනි ජාත්‍යන්තර ආයතන සමග කටයුතු කරන Colombo Plan Drug Advisory Programහි මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය ඉල්ලුම අවම කිරීම පිළිබඳ ජාත්‍යන්තර පුහුණුකරුවෙකු වන, මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය ප්‍රතිකාර හා පුනරුත්ථාපන ක්ෂේත්‍රය තුළ වසර 10ක පළපුරුද්දක් ඇති මනෝවිද්‍යාව පිළිබඳව උපාධිධාරියෙකි.

"මත්ද්‍රව්‍යවලට ඇබ්බැහි වුණු කෙනෙකුට අවශ්‍ය කරන, අපි පිළිගන්න ප්‍රමිතිගත ප්‍රතිකාරය එතනින් ඇත්තට ම සිද්ධ වෙන්නේ නැහැ. උදාහරණයක් විදිහට මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය ගැටලු කියලා උසාවිවලට ආවට පස්සේ, ඒ මිනිස්සුන්ව ඊළඟට පුනරුත්ථාපනයට දාන්න ඕනේ නේ. නිකම් සිරගත කළාට ඒ මනුස්සයාගේ ප්‍රශ්නයට පිළිතුරක් ලැබෙන්නේ නැහැනේ," ඔහු පැවසීය.

සුචින්තන පෙන්වා දුන්නේ, හොඳින් දත්ත විශ්ලේෂණය කර බලන්නේ නම්, මේ අවස්ථාව වන විට ද වැඩිවශයෙන් සිරගත වන්නේ, මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය වැරදි හා සම්බන්ධ පුද්ගලයින් බව ය.

එලෙස විශාල ගණනක් පුනරුත්ථාපනය කිරීම සඳහා පහසුකම් සැලසීමට කන්දකාඩු වැනි මධ්‍යස්ථාන ස්ථාපනය කර ඇතැයි ඔහු සඳහන් කළේ ය.

"එතන ඉන්න උපදේශකවරු පුහුණු වෙනවා. හැබැයි මේ මොහොතේ ඉල්ලුම වැඩියි. ප්‍රතිකාරයක් කියන එක එහෙම ගාල් කරලා කරන්න බැහැ. නමුත් ඒ වගේ පහසුකම් හැදෙන්නේ නැහැ, සල්ලි නැති නිසා හරි මොනවා හරි ප්‍රශ්නයක් නිසා. ගොඩක් වෙලාවට, ඒ අයට කරන්න පුළුවන් දෙයක් කරනවා. ඒ අය දවස ගාණේ වැඩසටහන් කරනවා. හැබැයි ප්‍රශ්නේ තියෙන්නේ, ඒකෙන් අපි කියන, ප්‍රතිකාරයට අවශ්‍ය කරන හොඳ වැඩසටහනක් ක්‍රියාත්මක කරන්න අපහසුයි ඒ වගේ තත්ත්වයක් යටතේ."

ඉකුත් වසරේ දෙසැම්බර් මස මෙන් ම, මෙම වසරේ පලා ගිය කන්දකාඩු රැඳවියන් යළි බලධාරීන් භාරයට ගත් අවස්ථාවේ දර්ශන විවිධ මාධ්‍ය ඔස්සේ විකාශය කෙරිණි.

එම දර්ශනවල ඇතැම් රැඳවියන් තමන් මධ්‍යස්ථානය තුළදී අත්විඳි කටුක අත්දැකීම් පිළිබඳව ප්‍රකාශ කරන අයුරු සටහන් වී තිබිණි.

"හෑන්ඩ්කෆ් දාලා තියෙනවා සතියක් විතර ගස්වලට දාලා, පොඩි පොඩි ප්‍රශ්නවලට," එක් රැඳවියෙක් පැවසීය. පලා ගිය රැඳවියන් නැවත භාරයට ගැනීමට පොලිස් නිලධාරීන්ට මෙන් ම යුද්ධ හමුදා නිලධාරීන්ට ද දැඩි පරිශ්‍රමයක් දැරීමට සිදුවිය.

කන්දකාඩු කඳවුර වැනි මධ්‍යස්ථාන වෙත පුහුණුව ලත් මිලිටරි නොවන උපදේශකවරු බඳවා ගත්ත ද පරිපාලනය සහ ආරක්ෂාව සැපයීම වැනි කාරණාවලදී හමුදා මැදිහත්වීමක් සිදුවීම හේතුවෙන් එහි කටයුතු හමුදාමය ස්වරූපයකින් බැහැරව සිදු නොවන්නේ යැයි පැවසිය නොහැකි බව සුචින්තන සඳහන් කළේ ය.

"මම දන්නවා උපදේශකවරු ඉන්නවා. මේ මෑතකත් බඳවා ගත්තා. මිලිටරි නොවන. හැබැයි පරිපාලනය සහ ආරක්ෂාව කියන කාරණාව ඇතුළේ, පරිපාලනය මෙතනින් වෙනවා කියන්නේ ම, අපි දන්නවා ස්වරූපයක් යෙදෙනවා කියන එක."

ඔහු පෙන්වා දුන්නේ, මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය සඳහා ඇබ්බැහි වූවන් සඳහා ප්‍රතිකාර කිරීමේදී එම ක්‍රියාවලිය සෞඛ්‍ය අමාත්‍යංශය යටතේ සිදු විය යුතු බව ය. එය ලොව පිළිගත් සම්මතය බව ඔහු පෙන්වා දුන්නේ ය.

"ඒක ආරක්ෂක අමාත්‍යංශය යටතට යන්න බැහැ. මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය සහ අපරාධ සම්බන්ධයෙන් පිහිටුවා ඇති එක්සත් ජාතීන්ගේ කාර්යාලයේ (UNODC) සම්මතයන් තමයි, ආරක්ෂක අමාත්‍යංශය යටතට ගන්න බැහැ. ආරක්ෂක අමාත්‍යංශය යටතේ තියෙනකොට වෙන්නේ වෙන වෙන දේවල්. අරමුණ සාක්ෂාත් වෙන්නේ නැහැ. මත්ද්‍රව්‍යවලට ඇබ්බැහිවීම කියන එක සෞඛ්‍ය සම්බන්ධ කාරණාවක්. ආරක්ෂක අමාත්‍යංශයට ඕක ගිය ගමන්, එයාලා දේවල් බලන විදිහ අපි දන්නවනේ වෙනස් කියලා. එතකොට මේක අපරාධයක්, දඬුවමක් ලැබෙන්න ඕනේ කියන තැනින් තමයි ගොඩක් වෙලාවට අල්ල ගන්නේ," සුචින්තන පැහැදිලි කළේ ය.

කෙසේ වෙතත්, එම අදහස පිළිබඳව අධිකරණ, බන්ධනාගාර කටයුතු හා ආණ්ඩුක්‍රම ව්‍යවස්ථා ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ අමාත්‍ය ජනාධිපති නීතිඥ විජයදාස රාජපක්ෂගෙන් බීබීසී සිංහල කළ විමසීමේදී ඔහු සඳහන් කළේ, හමුදා නිලධාරීන් යොදාගෙන පුනරුත්ථාපන ක්‍රියාවලිය සිදු නොවන බව ය.

"ආරක්ෂාවට තමයි වැඩි වශයෙන් හමුදාවේ අය ඉන්නේ. පුනරුත්ථාපානය කරන්නේ මානසික වෛද්‍යවරු, මනෝවිද්‍යාව පිළිබඳව ඉගෙන ගත්ත පුනරුත්ථාපනය සඳහා විශේෂ සුදුසුකම් තියෙන අය ලව්වා තමයි කරන්නේ ඒක. හමුදාව කරන්නේ ආරක්ෂාව සහ පරිපාලනය විතරයි."

කන්දකාඩු ප්‍රතිකාර හා පුනරුත්ථාපන මධ්‍යස්ථානය තුළ ක්‍රියාත්මක පුනරුත්ථාපන ක්‍රියාවලිය මෙන් සාර්ථක පුනරුත්ථාපන ක්‍රියාවලියක් ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ වෙනත් කිසිදු ස්ථානයක සිදු නොවන්නේ යැයි තමන් "වගකීමෙන්" ප්‍රකාශ කරන බව පුනරුත්ථාපන කොමසාරිස් ජනරාල් මේජර් ජෙනරාල් දර්ශන හෙට්ටිආරච්චි බීබීසී සිංහල සේවය සමග අදහස් දක්වමින් පැවසීය.

"මම ඉතාමත් වගකීමෙන් කියනවා මේ කරන ක්‍රියාවලිය ලංකාවේ කිසි ම තැනක මේ තරම් හොඳ, සාර්ථක පුනරුත්ථාපන ක්‍රියාවලියක් කෙරෙන්නේ නැහැ. මේකෙන් අපි ඉතාමත් විනයගරුක, යහපත් පුරවැසියෝ බිහි කරන්න, සමාජයට වැඩදායී පුරවැසියෝ කරන්න, රටේ ආර්ථිකයට දායකත්වයක් ලබා දෙන්න හොඳ පුරවැසියෝ කරන්න පුළුවන් වැඩපිළිවෙළක් මෙතන කරන්නේ."

ඔහු පෙන්වා දුන්නේ, පුනරුත්ථාපන කොමසාරිස් ජනරාල් කාර්යාංශය හරහා සිදුවන්නේ ජාතික අවශ්‍යතාවක් මෙන් ම සමාජ මෙහෙවරක් බව ය.

කන්දකාඩු ප්‍රතිකාර හා පුනරුත්ථාපන මධ්‍යස්ථානය තුළ ප්‍රතිකාර ලබන්නේ, මත්ද්‍රව්‍යවලට දීර්ඝ කාලීනව ඇබ්බැහිව සිට පොලිස් අත්අඩංගුවට පත් වී පසුව අධිකරණ නියෝගයක් මත පුනරුත්ථාපනය සඳහා යොමු වුණු පුද්ගලයින් මිස ස්වේච්ඡාවෙන් ඒ සඳහා යොමු වූ පුද්ගලයින් නොවන බව පුනරුත්ථාපන කොමසාරිස් ජනරාල්වරයා පෙන්වා දුන්නේ ය.

"ස්ත්‍රී දූෂණ, ළමා අපචාර, මංකොල්ලකෑම්, විවිධ සමාජ අපචාර ක්‍රියාවලින් 75%කට වඩා සම්බන්ධ වෙලා ඉන්නේ, මත්ද්‍රව්‍යවලට ඇබ්බැහි වුණු අය. ඒ කොටසක් තමයි මෙතනට ගෙනැල්ලා දාලා තියෙන්නේ. ඒ අය මෙතනට එන්නේ කැමැත්තෙන් නෙමෙයි. මේ අය ආපු දවසේ ඉඳලා මෙතනින් යන්න උත්සහ කරනවා.

මොක ද දීර්ඝ කාලීනව මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය ගත්ත කෙනෙකුට මෙතනට ආවම මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය නැති වුණා ම ඒ අය ලොකු පීඩනයක ඉන්නේ. ඒක පුද්ගලයාගේ වරදක් නෙමෙයි. පුද්ගලයාගේ ශරීරය අනුගත වෙලා තියෙන්නේ මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය එක්ක ජීවත් වෙන්න. මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය නැති වුණා ම ඒ අයට ඉන්න අමාරුයි. ඒක නිසා ඒ අය මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය හොයාගෙන එළියට පනින්න බලනවා."

ඔහු පෙන්වා දුන්නේ, වයස අවුරුදු 22ත් 36ත් අතර තරුණ පුද්ගලයින් මෙහි රඳවා සිටින බව ත් ඔවුන් පුනරුත්ථාපනය කිරීමේ ක්‍රියාවලිය "දැඩි සංයමයකින්" යුතුව සිදු කළ යුතු බව ත් ය. එමෙන් ම, එම ක්‍රියාවලිය හා සම්බන්ධ වී සිටින පිරිස් ඉතාමත් අභියෝගාත්මක, සංකීර්ණ සහ සංවේදී වැඩපිළිවෙළකට සම්බන්ධ වී සිටින බවත් ඔහු සඳහන් කළේ ය.

"විශේෂයෙන් ම මම කියන්න ඕනේ, යුද්ධ හමුදාව පරිපාලන කටයුතු කළාට, ආරක්ෂාව දුන්නට කිසි වෙලාවක ඒ අයට අඩත්තේට්ටම්, එක් එක් අවස්ථාවල සිද්ධ වෙලා තිබුණා අතීතයේ, දැන් ඒ වගේ කිසි දෙයක් වෙන්නේ නැහැ."

මේජර් ජෙනරාල් දර්ශන හෙට්ටිආරච්චි සඳහන් කළේ, මෙම මධ්‍යස්ථානය "හිරගෙදර වගේ කූඩුවල දාලා, මාංචු දාලා" දඬුවම් කරන ස්ථානයක් නොවන බව ය.

උදෑසන අවදි වූ අවස්ථාවේදී සිට දවස අවසානය දක්වා විවිධ ක්‍රියාකාරකම් සඳහා එහි සිටින රැඳවියන් සම්බන්ධ කරන බව ඔහු පැවසීය.

"මේ දරුවෝ අසනීප දරුවෝ. කාගේ හරි ස්වාමි පුරුෂයෙක්. කාගේ හරි අයියා කෙනෙක්, මල්ලි කෙනෙක්. රටේ අනාගතය භාර ගන්න ඉන්න තරුණ ජවය මේ වැරදි මාර්ගයට ගිහිල්ලා ඉන්නේ. මේ මිනිස්සුන්ට ගහලා, බැනලා පුනරුත්ථාපනයක් කරන්න බෑ නේ."

මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය යළි භාවිත කිරීමේ උවමනාවෙන් මධ්‍යස්ථානවලින් පැන යන රැඳවියන්ගේ ප්‍රකාශ පමණක් පදනම් කරගෙන "අසත්‍ය චෝදනා" කිරීමෙන් පුනරුත්ථාපන ක්‍රියාවලිය අඩපණ වන බව ඔහු අවධාරණය කළේ ය.

"පැනලා යන අයගෙන්, පැනලා යන්නේ මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය නැතිකමට ඉන්න බැරුව. ඒ මිනිස්සුන්ට කියන්න දාහක් දේවල් තියෙනවා. 500ක් ඉන්න තැනින් 200ක් පැනලා ගියාට 300ක් හැමවෙලේ ම ඇතුළේ ඉන්නවා. පොඩි කොටසක් තමයි එළියට පනින්නේ. ගොඩක් වෙලාවට මාධ්‍ය හරහා ප්‍රචාරය දෙන්නේ ඒ අය කියන දේවල්වලට."

කන්දකාඩු ප්‍රතිකාර හා පුනරුත්ථාපන මධ්‍යස්ථානයට අමතරව යුද්ධ හමුදා පරිපාලනය යටතේ ක්‍රියාත්මක තවත් පුනරුත්ථාපන මධ්‍යස්ථාන දෙකක් පවතින බව ඔහු වැඩිදුරටත් පැවසීය.

ඉන් එකක් පොලොන්නරු දිස්ත්‍රික්කයේ ම සේනපුර ප්‍රදේශයේ සහ වවුනියාව, පූන්ටෝට්ටම් ප්‍රදේශයේ පිහිටා තිබේ.

මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය හා අපරාධ පිළිබඳ එක්සත් ජාතීන්ගේ කාර්යාලය (UNODC) මොක ද කියන්නේ?

ලෝක සෞඛ්‍ය සංවිධානය සහ මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය හා අපරාධ පිළිබඳ එක්සත් ජාතීන්ගේ කාර්යාලය එක්ව සකසා, 2020 වසරේ මාර්තු 31 වන දා ප්‍රකාශයට පත් කරනු ලැබ ඇති 'International Standards for the Treatment of Drug Use Disordersහි' මෙසේ සඳහන් වෙයි.

"ඇතැම් රටවල මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය භාවිතයෙන් ඇතිවන ආබාධ තවමත් මූලික වශයෙන් මහජන ආරක්ෂාව සහ අපරාධ සම්බන්ධ ගැටලුවක් ලෙස සලකනු ලැබේ.

අභ්‍යන්තර කටයුතු, අධිකරණ හෝ ආරක්ෂක අමාත්‍යංශවල අදාළ ආයතන මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය භාවිතයෙන් ඇතිවන ආබාධ සඳහා සේවා සැපයීම හසුරුවන අතර, ඒවා බොහෝ විට සෞඛ්‍ය අමාත්‍යංශය හෝ වෙනත් මහජන සෞඛ්‍ය ආයතනවල අධීක්‍ෂණය හෝ මැදිහත්වීමකින් තොරව සිදු වේ.

නීතිය ක්‍රියාත්මක කිරීමේ උපාය මාර්ග සහ එවැනි ක්‍රම පමණක් භාවිත කිරීම මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය සහ අනෙකුත් ද්‍රව්‍ය භාවිතයෙන් ඇති වන ආබාධ සඳහා ඵලදායී පිළිතුරක් හෝ මහජන මුදල් වියදම් කිරීමේ ලාභදායී ක්‍රමයක් නොවේ.

මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය මත යැපීම බහුවිධ සෞඛ්‍ය ආබාධයක් ලෙස, වෛද්‍ය සහ මනෝ සමාජයීය ප්‍රවේශ භාවිතයෙන් ප්‍රතිකාර කළ හැකි බව පිළිගන්නා, ජෛව මනෝ සමාජයීය ප්‍රතිකාර ක්‍රමෝපායන් මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය ආශ්‍රිත හානි අඩු කිරීමට උපකාර වේ."

මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය ඉල්ලුම අවම කිරීම පිළිබඳ ජාත්‍යන්තර පුහුණුකරුවෙකු වන සුචින්තන දසුන් පෙන්වා දුන්නේ, ඇබ්බැහි වීමක් යනු, දිගු කලක් පවතින, නැවත නැවතත් ඇතිවන මොළය සම්බන්ධ රෝගී තත්ත්වයක් බව ය.

"ඇබ්බැහි වීමක ස්වභාවය, කෙනෙක් හොඳ ම ප්‍රතිකාර අරගෙන ගියත් යම් කිසි කාලයක් යනකොට ආයෙත් මතුවෙන එක. දියවැඩියාව වගේ ම, නිට්ටාවට සුව කරන්න බැහැ. හැබැයි කළමනාකරණය කරලා සාමාන්‍ය ජීවිතයක් ගත කරන්න පුළුවන්. ඒ වගේ ම තමයි ඇබ්බැහි වීමකුත්."

කෙසේ වෙතත්, ශ්‍රී ලංකාව තුළ ප්‍රතිමිතිගත ප්‍රතිකාරයක් නොලැබීම හේතුවෙන් ප්‍රතිකාර ලැබූ අයෙකු පවා නැවත පෙර පැවති තත්ත්වයට පත් විය හැකි බව ඔහු පැවසීය.

සුචින්තන සඳහන් කළේ, මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය ඇබ්බැහි වීමකින් මිදීමට මූලික අවස්ථාවේදී ඖෂධමය ප්‍රතිකාර අවශ්‍ය බව ය.

"හැබැයි එතනින් එහාට එළියට ගියාට පස්සේ ඒ කෙනාට මේකෙන් මිදෙන්න මනෝවිද්‍යාත්මක සහය අවශ්‍යයි. ඖෂධමය ප්‍රතිකාර අපිට මූලික අවස්ථාවේදී අවශ්‍ය වෙනවා. ඊට පස්සේ මනෝවිද්‍යාත්මක මැදිහත් වීම. ඒ කියන්නේ උපදේශනය, තෙරපි වගේ දේවල්."

ඉන් පසුව වැඩි වශයෙන් අවධානය යොමු කළ යුත්තේ, 'පවුල' නමැති සංරචකය කෙරෙහි බව ඔහු සඳහන් කළේ ය.

"මේකෙන් අපිට ගැලවෙන්න බැහැ පවුලේ සහයෝගය නැත්නම්. අම්මා තාත්තා හරි බිරිඳ විතරක් ම නෙමෙයි. එයා ආශ්‍රය කරන ඕනෙ ම කෙනෙක් වෙන්න පුළුවන්. එයා පවුල කියලා සලකන යාළුවෝ වෙන්න පුළුවන්. ඕනෙ ම කෙනෙක්.  සමීපතමයෙක් කියන්නේ. ඒ සහයෝගය නැත්නම් මේකෙන් ගැලවෙනවා කියන එක කොහොමත් ම අමාරුයි.

උදාහරණයක් විදිහට ලෝකේ තියෙන හොඳ ම ප්‍රතිකාරය අරගෙන ගිහින් ආපහු යන්නේ තමන්ගේ කල්ලියට නම්, එයාට ලොකු පීඩනයක් එනවා ආපහු මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය පාවිච්චි කරන්න. එතකොට එක නතර කර ගන්න එයාට අර කිව්ව පවුලේ සහයෝගය සෑහෙන්න ඕනේ," සුචින්තන අවධාරණය කළේ ය.

ඔහු තවදුරටත් පෙන්වා දුන්නේ, ශ්‍රී ලංකාව තුළ මත්ද්‍රව්‍යවලට ඇබ්බැහි වූ පිරිස් සඳහා පහසුකම් සැලසීමට තරම් ප්‍රමාණවත් පහසුකම් නොමැති බව ය.

දැනට ශ්‍රී ලංකාව තුළ ඇති පුනරුත්ථාපන ක්‍රියාවලිය "ආරක්ෂිතව" සිදුවන්නේ, අන්තරායකර ඖෂධ පාලක ජාතික මණ්ඩලය යටතේ ක්‍රියාත්මක මධ්‍යස්ථාන තුළ බව තම විශ්වාසය යැයි ඔහු සඳහන් කළේ ය.

එම මධ්‍යස්ථාන තුළ පුද්ගලයින්ට ආරක්ෂාව සැලසීම මෙන් ම, මානුෂීය ලෙස සලකන බව සුචින්තන පැවසීය.

එසේ වුව ද, ලබා දෙන ප්‍රතිකාරවල ප්‍රමිතිය සම්බන්ධයෙන් වැඩිදියුණු විය යුතු පැති ඇති බව ඔහු පෙන්වා දුන්නේ ය.

ඔහු සඳහන් කළේ, මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය නිවාරණය සහ ප්‍රතිකාරය සම්බන්ධයෙන් මෙරට ඇති කේන්ද්‍රස්ථානය එම ආයතනය බව ය.

පෞද්ගලික අංශය මගින් පවත්වාගෙන යන පෞද්ගලික මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය ප්‍රතිකාර හා පුනරුත්ථාපන මධ්‍යස්ථානවල ගුණාත්මකභාවය සහ ඒවා අධීක්ෂණය සම්බන්ධයෙන් ගැටලු පවතින බව සුචින්තන වැඩිදුරටත් පැවසීය.

අධිකරණ, බන්ධනාගාර කටයුතු හා ආණ්ඩුක්‍රම ව්‍යවස්ථා ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ අමාත්‍ය ජනාධිපති නීතිඥ විජයදාස රාජපක්ෂ බීබීසී සිංහල හා පැවසුවේ, නුදුරේදී ම මෙරට පුනරුත්ථාපන ක්‍රියාවලිය තුළ "විශාල" ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ කිහිපයක් සිදු කරන බව ය.

"ලොකු ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ ටිකක් හෙට අනිද්දා අපි කරනවා," යැයි ඔහු සඳහන් කළේ ය.

මේ දක්වා ගැටලුකාරී තත්ත්ව වාර්තා වේ ඇත්තේ, කන්දකාඩු ප්‍රතිකාර හා පුනරුත්ථාපන මධ්‍යස්ථානයෙන් පමණක් බව ඔහු පැවසීය.

"ඔතනත් ඉතින් අහඹුවක් මේ වෙලා තියෙන්නේ. මූලික වශයෙන්. අර යුක්තිය මෙහෙයුමෙන් ගෙනිහිල්ලා විශාල තොගයක් දාලා තියෙනවා. ඒ මිනිස්සු ටිකක් ප්‍රචණ්ඩකාරී අය. ඒගොල්ලෝ පුහුණු කරන්න වෙලාවක් වුණේ නැහැ. ආපු ගමන් ඒ මිනිස්සු. මේ කලබලේ ඇති කරලා තියෙන්නේ දෙගොල්ලො අතරේ රණ්ඩුවකින්."

කන්දකාඩු ප්‍රතිකාර හා පුනරුත්ථාපන මධ්‍යස්ථානයේ සිදුවීම සම්බන්ධයෙන් සොයා බැලීම සඳහා විශ්‍රාමලත් ශ්‍රේෂ්ඨාධිකරණ විනිසුරු හෙක්ටර් එස්. යාපාගේ සභාපතිත්වයෙන් යුක්ත ත්‍රිපුද්ගල කමිටුවක් පත් කළ බව ඔහු පැවසීය.

අධිකරණ අමාත්‍යංශයේ අතිරේක ලේකම් පියුමන්ති පීරිස් සහ ආරක්ෂක අමාත්‍යංශයේ අතිරේක ලේකම් සමන් දිසානායක යන නිලධාරීන් එම කමිටුවේ සෙසු සාමාජිකයින් ලෙස පත් කළ බව අමාත්‍යවරයා වැඩිදුරටත් සඳහන් කළේ ය.

කන්දකාඩු මධ්‍යස්ථානයේ කළමනාකාරීත්වය වෙනස් කිරීම සම්බන්ධයෙන් ද අවධානය යොමු වී ඇතැයි අමාත්‍යවරයා මීට පෙර සඳහන් කර තිබිණි.

ලීසිං: වාහනයේ ලීස් එක ගෙවාගන්න බැරි ද? ඔබ කළ යුත්තේ කුමක් ද?

ලොව පුරා පලස්තීන සරණාගතයින් කීදෙනෙකු වාසය කරනවා ද? පලස්තීන ඩයස්පෝරාව කොතරම් විශාල ද?

### No snow: Tourists cancel holidays as Indian ski resorts run dry

*2024-01-16 07:12:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96430/no-snow-tourists-cancel-holidays-as-indian-ski-resorts-run-dry)*

A lack of snowfall has led to empty ski resorts and holiday cancellations in the Indian Himalayas, with scientists linking the “unusual” winter to the El Nino weather phenomenon.

The dry spell in Kashmir has pushed skiers to skip the popular resort of Gulmarg, one of the highest in the world, and left hotels in the scenic region waiting for fresh falls to draw tourists to the panoramic views of snow-capped peaks.

Scientists said that this winter’s conditions in northern India have not been seen for about a decade, marked by the absence of snowfall in the mountains and biting cold made worse by thick fog in the plains.

“Fifty percent of the season is already gone,” said Farhat Naik, 35, a Gulmarg snowboard instructor, ruing at the sight of dry, barren land that would normally be covered in a knee-deep layer of snow.

“We are now hoping for snowfall in February first week,” he said, adding that all his European and American clients have cancelled their trips due to a lack of snow - a blow to the tourism and agriculture focused economy of the region.

Travel industry executives in the neighbouring states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand also complained of cancellations.

Bookings have dropped to 20% for Blue Poppy Resort in the ski resort of Auli, in Uttarakhand, its owner Kushaal Sangwan said. “Our cancellations have jumped and people cancel (just) days before the booking if there is no snow.”

Winter snow and rain in northern India, including the Himalayas, is brought by a weather pattern known as the western disturbances - frequent extra-tropical storms that originate in the Mediterranean Sea.

There are usually many such storms during winter but they have been largely absent this season, said R.K. Jenamani, a senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD). “When there’s no weather system, how can there be (snow),” he said.

The disappearance of western disturbances is linked to changing wind patterns and rising temperatures due to the active El Nino weather phenomenon and also climate change, said Gufran Beig, a former chief scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.

The current weather was very unusual for this time, Beig said. “It’s January and it is still very cold in Delhi ... there is excess moisture in the air but there’s also no snow ... It’s been one of the most polluted and prolonged stretches of winter.”

### Misty conditions to linger in many areas this morning

The Department of Meteorology says mainly fair weather is expected to prevail over the island today (Jan.16).

Misty conditions are likely in parts of the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Uva, North Western, Southern and North-central provinces in the morning.

Ground frost is possible at some places in Nuwara-Eliya District during the early hours of the morning.

Mainly fair weather will prevail in the sea areas around the island as well.

Winds will be north-easterly and wind speed will be 20-30 kmph.

Wind speed may increase up to 45 kmph at times in the sea areas off the coasts extending from Colombo to Mannar via Puttalam and from Pottuvil to Matara via Hambantota.

The sea areas off the coasts extending from Colombo to Mannar via Puttalam and from Pottuvil to Matara via Hambantota can be fairly rough at times.

### Health Sector Gripped by Strikes as 72 Professions Walk Out

*2024-01-16 06:23:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/16/health-sector-gripped-by-strikes-as-72-professions-walk-out/)*

Colombo (News 1st) – Sri Lanka's healthcare sector faces significant disruption today as members of 72 health unions representing a wide range of professionals, including laboratory technicians, radiology technicians, pharmacists, public health inspectors, midwives, drug compounders, and entomology officers, have decided to launch a strike.

The action, led by the Health Service Trade Union Alliance is set to continue until 8 am tomorrow.

The strike stems from a recent decision by the President, also serving as the Minister of Finance, to increase the duty interruption, attendance, and transport allowance (DAT) for doctors by 35,000 rupees.

Union Convenor Ravi Kumadesh has criticized the move as discriminatory and demanded similar financial incentives for other healthcare professionals.

Adding to the tension, government nurses are also poised to launch a 24-hour symbolic strike starting at 7 am tomorrow.

News First reached out to Health Minister Ramesh Pathirana for comment, and he noted that the matter is under discussion with acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe.

The widespread strikes raise concerns about potential disruptions in healthcare services across Sri Lanka.

Patients seeking non-emergency care may face delays or cancellations, while critical services could be stretched thin.

By March 2023, Hayleys Solar crossed its milestone of 125MW and has continued to add new rooftop solar capacity to its portfolio, in various locations across the country. Its 150MWp of solar capacity is enabling Hayleys Solar to save close to 151,835 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions released to the air every year.

Expressing his views, Hayleys Fentons Managing Director Hasith Prematillake stated: “This achievement is the largest to be installed across the island by any single entity and supports us to empower the community making solar solutions closer to all via accessibility and affordability. We are grateful for the trust and support our customers have placed in us.”

Hayleys Solar continues to establish solar experience centres island-wide, adding to its portfolio of experience centres in Matara and Jaffna with new launches in Nawala, Katunayake, Kurunegala and Kandy soon, This will make it easier for people from different communities to access and learn about solar solutions.

These centres offer a comprehensive range of applications, including rooftop PV systems, batteries, and inverters, alongside live demonstrations of solar-powered water pumps, lighting systems and solar powered hot water systems.

With high electricity tariffs, Hayleys Solar offers easy payment plans and loan facilities to support affordability for households and businesses to transition to solar.

Hayleys Solar Executive Director and CEO Roshane Perera said, “By far, Hayleys Solar has become a top of mind household name and plays a major role as a trendsetter in the solar energy sphere as the undisputed market leader. Throughout our remarkable journey, we have empowered a diversified clientele including world-renowned organisations and thousands of households. We are very grateful to our loyal clientele who has placed their trust with us”

“We are also in the process of installing the largest battery of 2MWh which will be commissioned by January 2024. I believe it is our responsibility as the market leader to focus on innovation and bring in the latest technologies to drive growth to expand market share in this sector.”

In 2022, amid challenges in power availability, Hayleys Solar enabled the facilitation of a massive project of installing solar at 830 telecommunication towers across Sri Lanka, which supported the community to stay connected.

With its ongoing commitment to adding rooftop solar capacity to empower the community with electricity and energy self-sufficiency, Hayleys Solar is dedicated to improve the livelihoods of many Sri Lankans for generations.

### SFG becomes first CORSIA-accredited validation and verification body in SL

*2024-01-16 01:19:06 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/business/SFG-becomes-first-CORSIA-accredited-validation-and-verification-body-in-SL/34-757405)*

The Sustainable Future Group (SFG), Sri Lanka’s premier Sustainability Validation and Verification Body which was South Asia’s first to be IAF-accredited to award ISO 14064-1 and 2 for organisational and project-level GHG reporting, ISO 14067 for product carbon foot printing, and ISO 14065 for environmental information, chalked up another “first” when it was accredited under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The accreditation was granted by the Sri Lanka Accreditation Board (SLAB) recently during the first day of the ‘Environment Matters in Aviation Workshop’ held at the Sri Lanka Civil Aviation Authority (SLCAA) auditorium in the presence of the Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Minister, South Asian Civil Aviation Authorities, South Asian Airplane Operators, and other high-level stakeholders in the Aviation industry. Representatives of the EU – South Asia Aviation Partnership Project II (EU-SAAPP II) who provided guidance, support and training for SFG against the CORSIA Scheme from 2019 up until the point of accreditation were also present at the occasion.

The CORSIA scheme provides specifications for airplane operators to calculate and report its CO2 emissions from its fleet, application of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs), and offsetting the amount of CO2 emissions which cannot be reduced through the use of technological improvements, operational improvements, and SAF usage with selected types of emissions units from the global carbon market. SFG is now accredited to verify whether airplane operators have correctly calculated its fleet emissions and have offset its residual emissions against the specifications provided in the CORSIA Scheme. Their first assessment was conducted on the ‘Airplane Operator Emissions Report’ of Maldivian Airlines (Island Aviation Services Ltd.) of the Maldives, which comprised of a desk and site review at the Maldivian Airlines office premises. Following the assessment, the results were then verified in accordance with the ISO/IEC 17029:2019 and ISO 14065:2020 standards by SFG.

CORSIA is the first global compliance market-based scheme for any sector implemented by The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), specialised agency of the United Nations (UN) that oversee and coordinate international air navigation principles and regulations.

The accreditation certificate was handed over to SFG by SLAB Chairman Dr. Sampath Wahala to Sustainability Assurance and Advisory Services Manager Sajeewa Ranasinghe.

### Cardinal slams President’s decision to involve SL in US led Red Sea Op

*2024-01-16 01:09:47 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/news/Cardinal-slams-President-s-decision-to-involve-SL-in-US-led-Red-Sea-Op/56-757395)*

Criticises Govt. for overlooking domestic concerns while involving itself in a Middle East conflict

Says SL has leaders who are indifferent to starving countrymen but are gearing up to join war

Stresses Catholic Church is not agitating for disorder or anarchy but it has a right to demand that justice is done

Emphasises it is now time for active protest rather than remaining silent as 2024 is an election year

In yet another scathing attack against the Government, the Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith on Sunday slammed the decision made by the current Government led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to send in two Sri Lanka Navy vessels to join the Red Sea operation launched by the US and its allies to safeguard merchant vessels from attacks by Houthi rebels

Ranjith criticised the Government for overlooking domestic concerns while involving itself in a Middle East conflict. “We have leaders who seem indifferent to the hunger of our people, yet they are gearing up for a conflict in the Middle East,” he said.

The Archbishop made these comments during a sermon at All Saints Church in Borella, commemorating the second anniversary of the discovery of a grenade on the church premises that sparked a major controversy at the time.

“It is boastful to announce that we will join an international armada with two small ships while the people here are starving. People are going through serious difficulties, these leaders are hardly concerned, and they only want to enjoy themselves at the cost of the taxpayer” he said.

The Archbishop said the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka is not agitating for disorder or anarchy in the country but it has a right to demand that justice is done. “But where is justice when they manipulate incidents like the grenade incident?” he asked.

Ranjith emphasised that the time has come for active protest rather than remaining silent. “In this election year, we have an opportunity to decide whether these corrupt politicians will persist in governing our country or if a new group will be entrusted with steering our nation towards the future,” he added.

He also accused the authorities of failing to find the real perpetrators who placed a grenade inside the church, who planned the Easter Sunday attacks and those who have harassed the media in the past.

Commenting on the grenade incident, Ranjith said the grenade had been set up to explode on the day. He said the police arrested four innocents including the sacristan of the Church who had picked the grenade up. “These four had no idea what a grenade was. This is why the sacristan picked it up innocently. He did not understand it was a grenade” he said.

The Archbishop remarked that the Minister in Charge of the Police and the Secretary of Defence hastily pointed fingers at the four individuals without conducting a thorough investigation or reviewing the CCTV footage at that time. “This is how justice works in this country. Big shots can remain free even after committing a murder. There is no rule of law. There is only the law of the powerful,” he alleged.

He urged the Government to launch a comprehensive investigation into the incident but expressed scepticism about its execution. Ranjith stated, “We are yet to witness justice being served for those responsible for the Easter Sunday attacks. The perpetrators behind the disappearance of Prageeth Ekneligoda and the killing of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramatunga remain unknown. It appears that these critical issues have been overlooked, with authorities seemingly prioritising international concerns over resolving domestic challenges in the country.”

### CID arrests self-proclaimed ‘Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara’

*2024-01-16 01:08:53 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/news/CID-arrests-self-proclaimed-Bodhisattva-Avalokiteshvara/56-757394)*

Investigators of the Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Mahinda Kodituwakku, a man professing to be the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara yesterday in Pannipitiya.

Kodituwakku who suddenly shot to fame recently through viral videos of him preaching flanked by groups of followers is being accused of distorting Buddhist teachings and engaging in irreligious activities.

According to Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa, the suspect has been apprehended on four charges, including violations under the Computer Crimes Act. Additionally, Thalduwa said he faces allegations of insulting the Buddhist doctrine by delivering various sermons, thereby offending religious sentiment.

The Police Spokesperson said the suspect is also facing charges under Sections 291 (a) and 291 (b) of the Penal Code for allegedly uttering words with the explicit intent of causing religious offence and insulting the religion or beliefs of a specific class. Charges under the Money Laundering Act have also been brought against Kodituwakku.

On 12 January the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court also imposed an overseas travel ban on him after the police received many complaints, particularly from Buddhist clergy against his activities.

The Magistrate issued the order following Senior Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dileepa Peiris requesting a travel ban as it was required for an investigation led by the CID’s Computer Crimes Division.

Peiris revealed that the suspect, who recently arrived from Egypt, organised extravagant ceremonies to welcome himself at the Bandaranaike International Airport and the Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya. He said ongoing investigations aim to ascertain whether the suspect misrepresented himself as a Bodhisattva to serve the objectives of a religious fundamentalist organisation or if he acted under the influence of a fundamentalist group. Concurrently, the suspect is under investigation for potential violations of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

DSG Peiris accused the suspect of exploiting religion for personal financial gain. He highlighted that the suspect’s sermons, disseminated through his YouTube channel, distort Buddhism and pose significant dangers. Furthermore, he noted that the suspect has publicly admitted to sexually abusing his daughter, potentially making him liable to charges of sexual abuse of a minor. The case against Kodituwakku will be taken up again on 17 January.

Meanwhile, the Mahanayaka Theras also sent a letter to President Ranil Wickramasinghe over the weekend urging him to institute the requisite legal measures to enforce the law against persons involved in distorting Buddha Dharma.

In Buddhism, Avalokiteshvara is a tenth-level bodhisattva associated with great compassion.

### Economy 2024: More challenging than the two previous years

*2024-01-16 00:22:42 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Economy-2024-More-challenging-than-the-two-previous-years/4-757391)*

Unless correct policies are adopted from now onward, becoming a rich country by 2048 will simply be a wish only

It seems that IMF is working with numbers which are pleasing to their ears ignoring the wider external debt problem which the country is faced with. Once Sri Lanka begins to repay the whole debt, it will not be able to maintain the current low-level equilibrium that involves relative stability in the exchange rate, on one side, and the balance in the current account of the balance of payments, on the other

Sri Lanka has entered 2024 having passed 2022, the year of the severest economic crisis, and 2023, the year of the beginning of economic recovery. Having followed an economic recovery package as agreed with IMF for an extended fund facility or EFF, Sri Lanka should now consolidate its position to retain the hard-earned macroeconomic stability and push the economy to a high growth path needed for delivering permanent prosperity to its people. However, the present stability experienced by Sri Lanka is at a low-level equilibrium as observed by the Presidential economic advisor, Dr. Sharmini Cooray in the 2023 Central Bank Anniversary Oration (available at: https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/about/speech_20231102_CBSL_73_anniversary_oration_e.pdf).

What she meant by a low-level equilibrium was that though high inflation has been brought down to an affordable rate of about 5% and the exchange rate from close to Rs. 400 to about Rs. 320 a dollar, that has been attained at a low level of GDP, that is, $ 77 billion in 2022 compared with $ 85 in 2021. The average income of a Sri Lankan, if distributed equally among them and known as per capita income, has also fallen from $ 3,997 in 2021 to $ 3,474 in 2022. Hence, on average, all Sri Lankans have become poorer.

At this level of per capita income, Sri Lanka is categorised by the World Bank as a lower middle-income country because it is a way above the threshold of $ 1,135 attributable to a low income or a poor country. However, the Sri Lanka Government requested the World Bank in late 2022 to treat it as a poor country for the disbursement of concessional funds from the World Bank group. This request has, as a special case, now been granted by the Bank. Hence, Sri Lanka today is like a person who has on paper academic qualifications equivalent to a university degree, but his knowledge is so poor that he is assigned the work that can be handled by a person with only GCE (Advanced level) qualification.

It is just an instance of voluntarily becoming poorer in front of the rest of the world because it helps the country to get low-cost foreign aid. Thus, the GDP numbers released by the authorities do not reflect the true position of Sri Lankans. This is a stigma. Accordingly, the biggest challenge which Sri Lanka faces in 2024 or in later years is to have it removed and show the world that it is not a poor country anymore. But like the proverbial ‘beggar’s wound’, the incentives are to continue to enjoy this stigma.

Sri Lanka enters the new year with a friendly but significantly serious warning by IMF. According to IMF’s Communications Director Julie Kozack, though the progress of the current EFF program is satisfactory, the country should complete the negotiations with the external commercial creditors and implement the agreements with official creditors for the restructuring of the selected items of the central government external debt (available at: https://www.ft.lk/front-page/IMF-urges-swift-action-on-debt-restructuring/44-757364). For external debt restructuring purposes, only the commercial borrowings and those borrowed from bilateral sources were included.

The total public sector borrowings as at the end of 2021 amounted to $ 69 billion, made up of $ 45 billion by the central government and $ 24 billion by other public sector entities (see for details: https://www.ft.lk/columns/Child-s-guide-to-debt-restructuring-Not-a-cakewalk-but-a-task-entailing-hard-work/4-736706). Of this, only $ 33 billion or nearly a half was to be restructured. Even if this is successfully restructured, the problem of country’s foreign indebtedness remains unresolved.

2024 will be an election year, and it is unlikely that the energy and the talent pool of the Government could be diverted to this type of long-term planning. But with every passing moment, the country will lose valuable time which cannot be regained. But there is no choice in my view. The Central Bank with the support from IMF has stabilised the economy at a low-level equilibrium. If no proper policies are adopted to upgrade the real economic activities that will deliver richness and prosperity to people, it will be difficult for the country to maintain even this low-level equilibrium. This is a formidable challenge, and the Government should not take this challenge lightly

It seems that IMF is working with numbers which are pleasing to their ears ignoring the wider external debt problem which the country is faced with. Once Sri Lanka begins to repay the whole debt, it will not be able to maintain the current low-level equilibrium that involves relative stability in the exchange rate, on one side, and the balance in the current account of the balance of payments, on the other.

She has expressed the IMF’s satisfaction about the restructuring of the domestic debt, tagged as domestic debt optimisation by the Sri Lanka Government, in 2023. The reference here is the decision of the Government to pass the entire burden of the domestic debt relief on to the superannuation and pension funds. Among them, the chief burden-bearers are the largest private sector superannuation fund, Employees’ Provident Fund or EPF managed by the Central Bank, and the Employees’ Trust Fund or ETF, managed by a separate board of trustees.

These two funds as well as other provident and pension funds were told by the Government that if they would not agree to the proposed optimisation, they would be subject to an income tax of 30% instead of the 14% they were paying at that time. The tax of 30% was justified because that was the tax paid by other financial institutions and, therefore, it was an equalisation of the tax rates. I discussed in a previous article how this tax comparison would fall on EPF unfairly because EPF and other funds paid taxes on the gross income while financial institutions paid it on the net income (available at: https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-misunderstood-taxation-of-EPF-and-other-superannuation-funds/4-750423).

Accordingly, the amounts of taxes paid by EPF on its gross income would be 70% in 2020, 88% in 2021, and 490% in 2022 when recalculated on the tax base of net income applicable to financial institutions. The other bond holders were freed from this burden and equity in distributing burden required the Government to treat all of them equally.

I therefore pointed out in the article under reference as follows: “If the pain is passed on to all the bondholders equally, it would have been a fair and equitable treatment. Though there is a fear that it would lead to instability of the financial system, that could be avoided it the pain is transferred to all equally. Then the people would have felt that they have been treated fairly. Such a trust is a must when a country goes through a painful adjustment to come out of a serious economic crisis”. But the plan of passing the burden on the superannuation fund holders was carried out as planned. However, it involved the reduction of the earnings of EPF members by a significant margin by Rs. 274 billion over the period 2024 to 2038 (available at: https://www.ft.lk/columns/Apologetic-custodian-of-EPF-also-a-victim/4-753076).

It is about this treatment of the domestic debt that IMF’s communications head has expressed her satisfaction. Since EPF earnings are likely to be lower than 9% after paying a tax of 14%, it will be a challenge for the Government to ensure a minimum rate of return of 9% to EPF members as promised in the debt optimisation plan. It is in fact an unnecessary waste of the taxpayers’ money if the Treasury meets this shortfall.

Sri Lanka’s avowed goal is to deliver richness to its people by 2048 when the country celebrates the centenary of independence from Britain. This is a challenging task since the country is now going through a low-growth scenario till at least 2027. In 2022, it was a negative growth of 7.8% and in 2023, it is projected to have a negative growth of about 4%. From 2024 to 2026, the growth will be at an annual average rate of about 2% according to the forecasts made by both IMF and the World Bank. According to these forecasts, the country will return to the size of its economy which it had in 2021. That amounts to a GDP of $ 85 billion. It is from this level that the country will have to move up to become a rich country by 2048.

I have discussed the main challenges involved in a previous article in this series (available at: https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-Magic-2048-What-is-to-be-done-to-make-Ranilnomics-a-reality/4-747608). In this article, the main challenge has been identified as follows: “In terms of the World Bank classifications, a country will become a rich country if its gross national income or GNI per head reaches the threshold of $ 12,000 and remain at that level or above thereafter. Over the next 25 years, Sri Lanka’s population also will increase requiring the country to produce more to reach this level. The population of the country has been rising at about 1% per annum in the past. But the future population projections are made based on demographic changes. Accordingly, for Sri Lanka, two population projections were made, one at an average growth of half a percent per annum and the other at an average growth of a little over a fifth of a percent. In the first one, the population will rise to 25.4 million by 2048. In the second one, Sri Lanka’s population will peak in 2035 and begin to fall thereafter.

Since EPF earnings are likely to be lower than 9% after paying a tax of 14%, it will be a challenge for the Government to ensure a minimum rate of return of 9% to EPF members as promised in the debt optimisation plan. It is in fact an unnecessary waste of the taxpayers’ money if the Treasury meets this shortfall

“By 2048, its population will be 21.9 million, a little more than its population in 2021.

In terms of the first projection, to generate a GNI per capita of $ 12,000, the total GNI should rise to $ 305 billion or an increase of 243% over the period. The average growth per annum should be about 12%. In terms of the second projection, the GNI should be $ 263 billion marking an increase of 196% over this period. It marks an annual increase, on average, of 10%. Therefore, the annual economic growth to be maintained from 2028 to 2048 will be between 10 and 12% if Sri Lanka is to become a rich country by that last year of the period. This is again a formidable challenge for future governments”.

This is a formidable challenge. Unless correct policies are adopted from now onward, becoming a rich country by 2048 will simply be a wish only as it had happened on many occasions in the past. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the nation in June 2023, announced that he would be following the Growth Lab approach developed by the Center for International Development or CID of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government (available at: https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/special-statement-delivered-by-president-ranil-wickremesinghe-full-text/). Wickremesinghe has a particular love for CID because he himself had been an alumnus of this prestigious institution.

He explained the Growth Lab approach as follows: “Under the Lab approach, we will bring together Government Ministers, government officials, subject matter experts, and key representatives from the private sector to collaboratively engage in detailed discussions over a period of six weeks. The aim is to collaboratively resolve any roadblocks hindering the roll-out of investments and projects by listening carefully to the private sector. During these discussions, comprehensive implementation plans will be developed, and the necessary facilities to support the implementation of these projects will be organised. Government stakeholders involved in the Labs will dedicate their full-time efforts to ensure the successful execution of these projects. As President, I, along with the Cabinet Ministers, will actively participate in this event to demonstrate the government’s commitment to ensuring success of the Lab process”.

The timeline announced was that the lab will be convened in the third quarter of 2023, its report ready by September 2023, and it will be presented to people for their review, suggestions, and approval before the end of 2023. That will be unveiled for implementation as a ‘national transformation plan’. This plan will be based on four important pillars: reforming both the fiscal and financial sectors, driving investments for accelerated economic growth, introducing social protection to the vulnerable and the implementing a strong good governance program, and transforming the state-owned enterprises or SOEs to function as profit centres.

While these are important goals, they do not cover all the required strategies that should be adopted. For instance, they do not include a human resource development plan to upgrade the country’s human capital to a creative capital stock, encouraging the professionals who are leaving the country to contribute to the country’s development through a system of reverse migration, and introducing high technology to the country’s production structure to help it to compete successfully in the global markets.

Sri Lanka’s avowed goal is to deliver richness to its people by 2048 when the country celebrates the centenary of independence from Britain. This is a challenging task since the country is now going through a low-growth scenario till at least 2027. In 2022, it was a negative growth of 7.8% and in 2023, it is projected to have a negative growth of about 4%. From 2024 to 2026, the growth will be at an annual average rate of about 2% according to the forecasts made by both IMF and the World Bank. According to these forecasts, the country will return to the size of its economy which it had in 2021. That amounts to a GDP of $ 85 billion. It is from this level that the country will have to move up to become a rich country by 2048

Even with the limited scope announced, the Government has missed all these milestones in the timeline. Hence, they will have to be redated for 2024. But 2024 will be an election year, and it is unlikely that the energy and the talent pool of the Government could be diverted to this type of long-term planning. But with every passing moment, the country will lose valuable time which cannot be regained. But there is no choice in my view. The Central Bank with the support from IMF has stabilised the economy at a low-level equilibrium. If no proper policies are adopted to upgrade the real economic activities that will deliver richness and prosperity to people, it will be difficult for the country to maintain even this low-level equilibrium.

This is a formidable challenge, and the Government should not take this challenge lightly.

### Now, to those taxes

*2024-01-15 23:46:44 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Now-to-those-taxes/4-757374)*

While a State needs tax revenue to meets its expenses, it is widely acknowledged that high taxes act as a disincentive to investment, and consequently, development. In Sri Lanka, it is money taken from a relatively efficient sector to an inefficient State, mainly to pay its debts and to keep afloat many white elephants in an overall unproductive sector. The most objectionable are the indirect taxes like the ‘VAT’ that leave a deep dent in the average purse, already reeling from the effects of a drastically devalued currency

“Alongside  decayed roués with dubious means of subsistence and of dubious origin, alongside ruined and adventurous offshoots of the bourgeoisie, were vagabonds , discharged soldiers, discharged jailbirds, escaped galley slaves, rogues, mountebanks, lazzaroni, pickpockets, tricksters, gamblers, maquereaus, brothel keepers, porters, literati, organ-grinders, rag-pickers, knife-grinders, tinkers, beggars, in short, the whole indefinite, disintegrated mass, thrown hither and thither, which the French term, la boheme” -The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte-Karl Marx

No, in the above quote Marx was not describing the Sri Lankan Parliament!

In this instance, Marx’s searing analysis, couched in his accustomed vivacity, was directed at a French social class of early 19th century he describes as the ‘lumpen- proletariat’, which by and large had supported Louis Bonaparte in his quest for the Presidency of France in 1848.Three years later, in 1851, Bonaparte staged a coup d’etat, soaring above the class struggle, that was thought to be imminent. His ascendency despaired outstanding thinkers of the era like Victor Hugo and Karl Marx, who saw Louis Bonaparte as an imposter, a grotesque mediocrity playing the role of a hero.

It was inevitable that Bonaparte would invite comparisons to his epoch making uncle, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Marx mocks the nephew’s (Louis Bonaparte) coup, comparing it with Napoleon Bonaparte’s coup of 1799 on Eighteenth Brumaire. Adopting German philosopher Hegel’s idea that world spirit causes the re-enactment of events, Marx opened his thesis with the celebrated line that history repeats, first as a tragedy (Emperor Napoleon) and then as a farce (nephew Louis Bonaparte). It is uncertain whether Marx accepted the Hegel aphorism as a historical truism, but in the case of Napoleon and his far less illustrious nephew, a telling line indeed.

For France, the 18th and 19th centuries were tumultuous; the land of revolutions, class wars, communes and Napoleon. Marx anticipated a triumphant revolution, but it did not evolve that way. Today France is a highly productive and prosperous country, boasting a vibrant cultural life. Like most western countries, high standards of living across the board have made class definitions and antagonisms meaningless. Uncommonly perceptive Marx may have been, but theoretical postulates must bow to obvious realities. As historian Fukuyama suggests, “history” as an unbroken chain of class struggles may not be tenable in context. That is not to say that human societies will remain static. In time, there is bound to be turmoil and even cataclysmic upheaval, but perhaps not quite on the lines as suggested by Karl Marx.

While the enormous validity of Marx is undeniable, it is also an important factor that his focus was primarily on Europe, then a melting pot of social, economic, national as well as religious ideas. These were years of incredible ferment; everything old was challenged, examined and reformed, if not discarded. Asia was a distant continent, backward and primitive, evoking only an occasional comment from Marx, often derisive. Weak societies, stuck in a mind-set of a bygone era; awash with dark superstitions, in the choking grasp of incompetent despots; they were in no position to resist the European colonisation

Almost every institution we now behold in this country, whether it be the parliament or the judiciary, medical profession or the constabulary, the game of cricket or political parties, owe their introduction to that colonial intrusion.

‘History’ may have ended, ‘races’ have not. In the modern world, certain “peoples” have proved themselves capable of running complex systems, building huge economies, expanding intellectual horizons, providing a high standard of living for its citizens, while at the same time, ensuring a sturdy democratic structure. The endless lines of hopefuls waiting at their door for a better life, is evidence enough of their success, and, a damning testimony to the failure of the feeder countries.

There are other races that have achieved some benchmarks, but not all; successfully building large economies and improving the life of their citizens, relative to the condition they were in before.

There is a third group, repeatedly going from tragedy to comedy, in an endless cycle; limited, inept and fundamentally corrupt. In these countries, in times when the State predominates, their systems are distinguished by corruption, incompetence and stagnation (SriLanka 1970-77). When their private sector comes to the fore, it is cronyism, exploitation and plunder, the free market interpreted by coarse temperaments, through their avaricious eyes

Whether it is State run or private sector heavy, the glaring truth is that Sri Lanka has one of the weakest industrial bases in Asia. Typically, we have clung on to garments, an industry with very little specialisation or innovation and one that keeps migrating to poorer economies (with poor wages) in order to be viable. If not for the plantations established more than two centuries ago, and our blue collar workers in the Middle East, the show would have ended much earlier.

Sri Lanka being a tiny economy, it is inevitable that most businesses are either suppliers or work contractors for the Government. Neither party needs tuition on what makes the system work!

The so called old elite, a comprador class created by the needs of the colonial era, has now given way to a new elite, a parvenu class. If the former were a tragedy, now we have the farce! They are unmistakable; in appearance undistinguished, the expensive designer brands and the contrived casualness sitting awkwardly on the essentially provincial character; ingratiating, self-promoting, slithery; our new rich have all the vices of the old, but none of their virtues! If the former attracted mockery, the latter invites

We do not have an Asian Marx to vivisect the sorry mimic we have made of the adopted system. If there were to be, what he beholds would provide him endless scope for contempt. A lamentable scene, where every aspect of the adopted system is understood only partially, interpreted perversely and works in contradiction of its very purpose.

Our Constitution is a good case in point. Once elected, Sri Lankan politicians become omniscient, the little matter of constitutional tinkering taken in their stride. With cavalier disregard for the consequences (Constitutions are generally rigid, resistant to change) they play at law making. Before the introduction of the 1978 Constitution its spiritual author JR Jayewardene advanced the case for a presidential system, arguing that Sri Lanka needed such a system to embark on our rapid development and that a President carrying a personal mandate from the people need not be deterred in that endeavour by the pressures and restrains that a parliamentary system would necessarily impose. Whatever the legal technicalities may be, the very constitution has now allowed an unelected person to be appointed by Parliament to that

While a State needs tax revenue to meets its expenses, it is widely acknowledged that high taxes act as a disincentive to investment, and consequently, development. In Sri Lanka, it is money taken from a relatively efficient sector to an inefficient State, mainly to pay its debts and to keep afloat many white elephants in an overall unproductive   sector. The most objectionable are the indirect taxes like the ‘VAT’ that leave a deep dent in the average purse, already reeling from the effects of a drastically devalued

And, this is a country where politicians are collecting millions in the guise of election funds, without receipts and without tax!

It is basic to the spirit of democracy that for a Government to impose taxes on the people, must first have a mandate to govern from the people. There cannot be taxation without representation. Leave aside the President, it is extremely doubtful whether the parliamentary majority today   enjoys the trust and confidence of the people any longer. Democracy is not only the holding of periodic elections. For it to have any meaning, the true spirit of democracy must be alive in the hearts and minds of its putative practitioners. If we use the experiences of the past 70 years as a gauge, for these hearts and minds, democracy is just another business, a sure way of hogging the public stage.

When we began our new journey in 1948, there were high expectations. For 70 years we journeyed gaudily and noisily; 70 long years of bombast, phrase-mongering and grandstanding. Now that all this hoopla has ended in a messy train wreck, we see all our post 1948 leaders in true light; second rate men: empty characters with monstrous egos; men of small deeds and big talk.

Not the wreckers of the country, not the beneficiaries from the sleaze, not those who enjoyed all the pageantry and the privileges of the State; the burden has fallen squarely on the millions of our impoverished citizens. Their unelected President demands it. Their elected representatives in Parliament have voted for it.

### IMF team overseeing Sri Lanka’s bailout programme visits Jaffna

*2024-01-15 23:22:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96428/imf-team-overseeing-sri-lankas-bailout-programme-visits-jaffna)*

A team of senior IMF officials overseeing Sri Lanka’s bailout programme has toured the Tamil-dominated Northern district of Jaffna for the first time under the current USD 2.9 billion agreement, officials said on Monday.

Led by Peter Brueur, the International Monetary Fund senior mission chief for Sri Lanka, the team last week met with the Governor of the Northern province, PMS Charles, and other senior officials and discussed issues related to economic growth in the province, demining programmes, resettlement of conflict-displaced individuals and compensation for conflict victims.

They also discussed the educational matters related to Jaffna University, post-COVID operations, and the adverse effects of climate change on the northern region, the officials said.

The team, which returned to Colombo on Monday, is scheduled to engage with the finance ministry. Talks are expected with Shehan Semasinghe, the state minister of finance, who leads the local IMF engagement under President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The discussions in Colombo are anticipated to focus on the targets outlined in the current IMF programme, which advocates large scale economic reforms in the island nation.

In a meeting with President Wickremesinghe on Thursday last, Brueur had expressed satisfaction with Sri Lanka’s progress in implementing reforms aimed at revitalising the economy.

The global lender had commended Sri Lanka for its advancements in policy-oriented variables and fiscal consolidation.

Sri Lanka, which declared its first-ever debt default in April 2022, had secured an IMF bailout agreement of USD 2.9 billion over four years by the last quarter of 2022.

The first tranche of USD 1.5 billion was released in March 2023, with the second installment of USD 337 million arriving in December 2023 following the first review.

### Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Platforms may invest in Sri Lanka Telecom - report

*2024-01-15 23:12:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96427/mukesh-ambanis-jio-platforms-may-invest-in-sri-lanka-telecom-report)*

Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani has plans to expand his horizons in the telecommunications business through his firm Jio Platforms, expressing interest in buying stake in Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, the state-owned telecom company, Indian media reported.

The Sri Lankan government has been struggling with the cash-strapped Telecom PLC, as current authorities continue to push for privatisation of many sectors to revive the economy amid the recent financial crisis.

Sri Lankan government had invited applications from potential bidders for Sri Lanka Telecom PLC by November 10, and Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Platforms was one of three companies that expressed interest in buying the stake of the firm, reported Moneycontrol.

The Sri Lankan government on January 12 issued a press release where it named Jio Platforms as one of the potential bidders for their government telecom company. Apart from Jio, the other two companies in the running are Gortune International Investment Holding Ltd and Pettigo Comercio International LDA.

The press release further said that the proposals by the company will be “evaluated as per the Special Guidelines on Divestiture of State-Owned Enterprises approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.”

Sri Lanka has been mandated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to push for the privatisation of all the non-core sectors in the country, in order to pull the Sri Lanka out of the deep cash shortage that triggered the anti-government protests in 2022.

With the Sri Lankan investment, Reliance’s Jio Platform is hoping to enter and dominate the global telecom market. Currently, Jio is market leader among all Indian telecom service providers.

Latest figures released by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) showed that Jio added 31.59 lakh mobile users in October 2023, significantly more that top competitor Bharti Airtel.

Recently, Reliance and Jio shares rallied on the stock market after Mukesh Ambani’s investment announcements at Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2024 in Gandhinagar last week. The jump in shares led to Mukesh Ambani reclaiming the spot of the richest person in Asia.

Colombo (News 1st) – Tensions rose further in the Middle East as a Houthi missile fired from Yemen hit a U.S.-owned cargo ship in the Red Sea late Monday (15th), raising the possibility of more U.S. military strikes on Yemen in response, foreign media reported.

The merchant vessel Gibraltar Eagle, flying the flag of the Marshall Islands, was hit in the Red Sea by an anti-ship ballistic missile fired from Yemen by the Houthis, but has not suffered any significant damage and is continuing on its way, U.S. Central Command said.

A second missile that was fired had malfunctioned and crashed on land in Yemen.

The Houthi attacks came a few days after the U.S. and U.K. struck multiple targets across Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen with over 100 bombs and missiles. The Houthis have vowed revenge against the US, UK and any nation that helps the coalition.

The Houthis have been staging attacks against ships in the Red Sea for more than a month, claiming that they are only targeting ships bound to or from Israel or are connected to Israel in some way.

Most of the world's largest shipping firms have suspended sending vessels through the Red Sea and are now using the much longer route around Africa. This has driven shipping rates up and caused some disruption to global supply chains.

The Welisara Magistrate’s Court has ordered a suspect who was arrested over attacking a teenage boy with a sword and was in hiding for 11 days, to be remanded in custody until January 19.

On January 04, the suspect had attacked a 14-year-old child with a sword over a dispute that had occurred between the two groups of people, the police said.

It is reported that a finger of the child’s left hand had been severed due to the sword attack.

However, the suspect, Dilruk Prashantha Silva, a father-of-three, had surrendered to police after evading arrest for 11 days, following the discharge of the victim from the hospital, the police said.

Nevertheless, on Sunday (15) Welisara Magistrate Thusitha Dhammika Uduwawidana ordered the suspect to be remanded in custody, after considering a request made by Ragama Police stating that the investigations are still underway in search of the sword used in the attack.

Attorney-at-Law Shamindra Soysa, who appeared on behalf of the victimized child before the courts, had previously filed a motion alleging that the police, who had arrested the suspect previously, had released the suspect due to the pressure exerted on the investigating officers by a senior police officer.

The magistrate, who took all facts presented into consideration, ordered the case to be recalled on January 19, 2024 and also ordered the police to report the progress of the investigations related to the case to the courts on the aforementioned date.

### Beyond Plantations: Kahawatte’s holistic approach to sustainable prosperity

*2024-01-15 19:43:00 - [islandlk](http://island.lk/beyond-plantations-kahawattes-holistic-approach-to-sustainable-prosperity/)*

Our latest Regional Plantation Company (RPC) Innovation Update highlights one of Sri Lanka’s trailblazers in sustainable, ethical and community-centric plantation management – Kahawatte Plantations PLC (KWPL) under the MJF Group.

KWPL was established in alignment with the MJF Group’s vision that ‘Business is a Matter of Human Service’, As such their pioneering initiatives not only boost agricultural excellence but also significantly uplift the living standards of their plantation communities and beyond.

KWPL has been at the forefront of a broader movement aimed at fostering innovation and standardizing plantation practices to harmonize economic goals with profound social responsibility. The company has been an advocate for a progressive model that integrates comprehensive welfare programs, environmental stewardship, and community empowerment into its corporate ethos, thus supporting the progressive evolution of Sri Lanka’s plantation industry.

With a history steeped in the rich tradition of Ceylon tea, rubber, cinnamon and an array of diverse crops, KWPL’s journey is marked by its pursuit of excellence in every leaf and life it touches.

The company’s strategic approach goes beyond cultivating crops; it cultivates a sustainable future for all its stakeholders. KWPL’s people-centric strategy is a proactive step towards the diverse ways in which an industry leader can contribute to both the sector and the personnel at its frontlines.

KWPL’s estates span12,400 hectares across the Nawalapitiya and Sabaragamuwa plantation districts. Within each, KWPL is engaged in cultivating tea, cinnamon, rubber, and timber. In the last three years, the company has further expanded its portfolio by venturing into coffee, coconut, and pepper cultivation as part of a strategic diversification that will further strengthen the company’s resilience to increasingly volatile global market conditions, and enhance its value addition potential.

From its inception, Kahawatte has been driven by the philosophy of its parent body, propelling it to take the lead in various community welfare programs across the sixteen estates under its care. What distinguishes these initiatives is their profound impact, as the benefits transcend the plantation population, positively influencing neighbouring communities.

Moreover, the company is committed to a significant investment of Rs. 120 million in the fiscal year 2023/2024 towards development initiatives. This substantial investment will encompass the enhancement of 20 Childhood Development Centres (CDCs), restroom facilities, re-roofing projects, and healthcare centres. The primary objective is to ensure the provision of quality care not only for the employees but also for individuals in the surrounding communities.

### New Year, New VAT: Can Sri Lanka’s poor cope with the increase?

*2024-01-15 19:39:00 - [islandlk](http://island.lk/new-year-new-vat-can-sri-lankas-poor-cope-with-the-increase/)*

Lakshila Wanigasinghe is a Research Officer at the IPS with research interests in poverty, social welfare, development, education, and health. She holds an MSc in Economics with a concentration in Development Economics and a BA in Economics with concentrations in International, Financial and Law and Economics from Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC), US. (lakshila@ips.lk)

Ringing in the new year for Sri Lankans was an increase in the value-added tax (VAT) rate to 18% and a withdrawal of tax exemptions on several goods and services. The last day of 2023 witnessed long queues as people rushed to stock up on essentials such as fuel and gas. Although queues are a familiar sight following the onset of the economic crisis, this time around, it was to avoid being hit with the VAT hike.

In light of these developments, this blog aims to shed light on VAT, offering a brief overview and delving into the potential implications of the increase, particularly on the poor and vulnerable.

There are both pros and cons to VAT. While VAT offers a means for governments to generate revenue without overcharging the wealthy, its downside lies in imposing a substantial economic burden on lower-income groups, as consumers ultimately bear the tax burden.

In an attempt to raise government revenue, the VAT rate on applicable goods and services increased from 15% to 18% starting 01st January 2024. This amendment brought 97 previously VAT-exempt goods and services including, fuel, gas, telecommunication services, as well as several food products manufactured using locally cultivated grains, locally manufactured coconut milk, and certain dairy products (locally produced), under the tax umbrella. Items that continue to be VAT-exempt include medicines, educational services, public passenger transport services, and food products such as infant milk powder, locally manufactured rice, bread, etc.

Along with the change in tax rates, the VAT threshold for businesses was also reduced to an annual turnover of LKR 60 million (from LKR 80 million) and LKR 15 million per taxable period (from LKR 20 million). These changes to VAT are expected to generate revenues of around LKR 1,400 billion in 2024.

The tax rate increase and the threshold reduction for businesses liable for VAT signals that more items are applicable for VAT at a higher percentage than before. Although this affects all households, it adds an excessive burden on the already struggling poor and vulnerable groups grappling with the concurrent crises from COVID-19 in 2020 to the ongoing economic crisis.

The fuel price hikes, a direct consequence of the new VAT rates, are expected to trigger a domino effect on the prices of various consumer goods and services, potentially leading to inflation. Although inflation has been low since mid-2023 compared to the beginning of the year, the latter part of 2023 (October to December) witnessed a relative increase in inflation. As per the Colombo Consumer Price Index, inflation between September to December 2023 was recorded as 1.3%, 1.5%, 3.4% and 4.0% respectively. The VAT reforms are likely to add to inflationary pressures in 2024. This, in turn, will further reduce the purchasing power of already constrained households.

A survey conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) in 2023 on the impacts of the economic crisis revealed that over 60% of households in the country experienced a decrease in income since March 2022. The survey also finds that over 90% of households experienced an increase in their monthly household expenditure due to the economic crisis. The findings further reveal that 99% of households that experienced a rise in expenditure witnessed an increase in food expenditure. The combination of reduced income and rising expenses is poised to constrain consumer spending, particularly affecting goods and services subject to VAT. For example, the survey results reveal that 83% of households whose expenditure increased due to the economic crisis experienced a rise in transport costs. Following the imposition of VAT on petrol and diesel (previously VAT exempt), the price hike in these commodities will further escalate household expenditure on transport. This will compel some households to self-impose restrictions on the use of certain modes of transport or find alternate solutions due to unaffordability concerns.

Purchasing power constraints force households to adopt various coping strategies to minimise the impacts of these adverse shocks. Around 74% of households that experienced a decline in income did not employ any coping strategies to mitigate the impact while around 7% resorted to a secondary job or additional source of income. Conversely, to cope with the impact of rising expenditure, households employed multiple mechanisms such as limiting/controlling expenses (75%), dietary changes (75%) and reducing/withdrawing savings (46.4%), etc. It is interesting to note that most households chose to adopt coping mechanisms only with respect to mitigating the impact on expenditure although a majority experienced income loss as well.

In the absence of savings – particularly among the poor and vulnerable due to the consecutive adverse shocks –households are likely to borrow to cover their essential expenses. As per survey findings, 55% of households in the country are currently indebted with 22% of such households in debt to meet daily food requirements. Interestingly, 22% of households have accumulated outstanding debt due to the economic crisis while the majority (78%) have not. However, it is concerning that over half of Sri Lankan households are presently indebted, and a considerable share face financial constraints to satisfy essential needs. The VAT reforms are likely to impact these households further through amplified indebtedness due to increased borrowings from both official and unofficial channels. This limits the possibility of timely recovery from shocks as concerns such as repayment challenges will arise in the future. Hence, in addition to struggling at present, the poor and vulnerable are also at risk of facing more prolonged periods of struggle even as the country’s economic crisis subsides.

It is important to support the poor to cope with the VAT hike at least through targeted initiatives that cater to the most vulnerable groups. Using existing social protection programmes to identify the most vulnerable households and providing them with some form of concessions such as reduced prices on certain VAT-liable goods and services that are frequently used by these groups is one such option.

Targeted transfers are another option. While cash transfers are already provided to eligible poor and vulnerable groups in the country it is important to assess if the amounts received by these groups are sufficient to cope with the ongoing crisis and the burden of indirect taxes. Another option worth considering is to provide needy households with dry rations/nutritious food commodities since low-income households spend a large portion of their total expenditure on food and this share may increase further due to the VAT reforms. Further, although it was mentioned that essential items such as fruits and vegetables will not be taxed, these items too are likely to go up in prices due to the indirect nature of the tax.

Although it is too early to assess the true impacts of the VAT amendments on the poor and vulnerable’s ability to survive, they are certainly at elevated risk of facing unaffordability which in turn triggers countless other obstacles. While the degree of the abovementioned risks can vary by household, they can only be measured upon the availability of sufficient consumption data over the upcoming months. Proactive measures, such as timely support in the form of targeted initiatives and concessions, can not only alleviate the immediate challenges but also contribute to the resilience and recovery of the most vulnerable segments of the population.

### Sri Lanka rupee not a one-way bet, hedging instruments, deepening needed: CB Governor

*2024-01-15 19:14:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-rupee-not-a-one-way-bet-hedging-instruments-deepening-needed-cb-governor-147314/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rupee is no longer a one-way bet, and the Central Bank would like to see a deeper market with more hedging instruments in the future Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

“We all know in the past the exchange rate has been a one-way bet, and there has been a lot of speculation,” Governor Weerasinghe said delivering an annual policy speech on January 10.

“Now we have been able to address that part. It is no longer a one way bet. It responds to demand and supply conditions and we will intervene to smoothen out any excess volatility.”

Governor Weerasinghe also dismantled most of the trading controls imposed during the period of inflationary domestic operations, which triggered forex shortages, allowing forex markets to work.

“And also in this kind of environment we would take steps to foster a deeper and more liquid domestic foreign exchange market, that is basically run by you,” he told bankers in the audience.

The central wanted a deeper and more liquid FX market also hedging instruments to hedge exposure for businesses, he said.

“This would be further supported by implementing the FX Global Code in the domestic foreign exchange market, providing a common set of guidance to promote a robust, fair, liquid, open, and appropriately transparent market in which market participants could confidently and effectively transact at competitive prices that reflect available market information.”

The central bank has launched the first phase of an  International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) in 2023 to collect data on cross-border transactions and foreign currency transactions daily from the banking system.

“The Central Bank plans to report monthly data pertaining to the external current account, particularly on trade in services, based on ITRS data from 2024 onwards,” Governor Weerasinghe said.

“Going forward, all banks are urged to continue to support the development of the ITRS system and to ensure the coverage, accuracy and timeliness of data.”

Under Governor Weerasinghe’s watch the rupee has appreciated from 360 to around 330 to the US dollar on complementary monetary policy.

Sri Lanka rupee came under pressure from large liquidity injections made to suppress rates before and after intervening in forex markets to maintain the exchange rate, driving unsustainable credit over 2021 and 2022, (inflationary monetary policy) triggering reserve losses.

In 2022 March, an attempt was made to float the currency without hiking rates sufficiently and with a surrender rule (buying dollars while the rupee was falling), leading to steep collapse of the rupee to 360 to the US dollar from around 200.

Since the setting up of the central bank in 1950 the rupee has been busted from 4.70 to the US dollar, in a worse fall than Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, all of which started at the same rate as currencies derived from the Indian rupee, which was originally silver based.

Governor Weerasinghe in April 2022 hiked rates, possibly ending hyperinflation and market dollarization, and established a guidance peg at which dollars were bought from banks.

In March the surrender rule was lifted and under his watch the rupee appreciated to around 330 to the US dollar.

Since then, the rupee has fluctuated between 320 to 330 to the US dollar under muted private credit conditions and largely deflationary policy (central bank selling down its Treasuries stock and withdrawing liquidity from dollar purchases).

Analysts have however warned that when private credit picks up, the central bank in the past has resumed inflationary policy to suppress rates, losing its ability to collect reserves, triggering depreciation, and social unrest through rising energy and food prices and long run higher nominal rates.

Sri Lanka’s rupee, and currencies of most other countries that became unstable, started to fall steeply after the International Monetary Fund’s Second Amendment to its articles in 1978, which left countries without a credible anchor (or peg) for money allowing bureaucrats to choose bad ones and depreciate at will.

### Myanmar rebel group claims control of town bordering India, Bangladesh

*2024-01-15 18:47:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96423/myanmar-rebel-group-claims-control-of-town-bordering-india-bangladesh)*

An ethnic armed group in the western Myanmar state of Rakhine said it has taken control of a town bordering India and Bangladesh, marking the latest loss for the military government as it battles rebellion in several parts of the country.

Myanmar is in the throes of an insurgency on multiple fronts, where allied anti-junta groups backed by a pro-democracy parallel government have seized control of several military posts and towns. It is the biggest challenge the junta has faced since it mounted a coup against an elected government in 2021.

A spokesperson for the Arakan Army (AA) said late on Sunday it had conquered Paletwa, a port town on the Kaladan river that is key to trade with neighbouring countries.

“Regarding border stability issues, we will cooperate at our best with neighbouring countries,” said AA spokesperson Khine Thu Kha in a statement, adding the group will take over administration and law enforcement in the area.

A spokesperson for the junta did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not independently verify the AA’s claim.

The fall of Paletwa in the west comes after another rebel group in the Three Brotherhood Alliance took Laukkai town on the in northern Shan State on the border with China.

Last week, the junta agreed a ceasefire with that group, the TNLA, for the region bordering China. The talks were held in the Chinese city of Kunming and facilitated by Chinese officials.

But on Sunday, the rebel alliance said junta forces are breaching the ceasefire agreement, launching attacks in several townships in Shan State.

### Shritharan  Backed by Yoheswaran  Asks Sumanthiran not to Contest the ITAK President Election.

*2024-01-15 18:18:00 - [dbsjeyarajcom](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83440)*

“Suma, Shri And Yohes In Triangular Contest For ITAK/FP Leadership” was the heading of my article published in the “Daily Mirror”of 16 December 2024. Ihe article  was about the forthcoming  election for the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK) President post. The ITAK known as the Federal Party (FP) in English is the premier political Party of  the  Northern and Eastern  Tamils of  Sri Lanka.   Currently the ITAK/FP has six MPs in Parliament representing  the two Northern and three Eastern electoral districts.

As stated earlier the ITAK’s long delayed party convention is scheduled for  January 27 and 28 this year in Trincomalee. A crucial change of leadership is on the cards as the current ITAK President Somasuntharam Senathirajah known as “Maavai” is on the verge of “compulsory  retirement”. “Maavai” has been ITAK President since 2014.

Hence, a new President will be elected one week before   the convention  at a combined meeting of the ITAK “Podhu Sabhai”(General Council) and “Mathiya Seyal Kuzhu” (Central working Committee) to be held on 21 January in Trincomalee. Around 325  persons from the General council and 50 from the Central Working Committee will elect the new president.Voting is by secret ballot. Voting by proxy is not allowed.

Three contenders are in the fray for the ITAK Presidency. The three aspirants to the ITAK leadership  mantle are Mathiaparanan Abraham Sumanthiran, Sivagnanam Shritharan and SeenithambyYoheswaran. As is well known, Sumanthiran and Shritharan are both Jaffna district MP’s while Yogeswaran is a former Batticaloa district Parliamentarian.

The eldest of the competing trio, M A Sumanthiran  was  born in 1964 and is a lawyer by profession. He was first appointed as a national list MP in 2010. Subsequently he was elected to Parliament from the Jaffna district in the 2015 and 2020 elections.

S. Shritharan was  born in 1968. He is a former teacher and school principal. Shritharan was elected successively to Parliament from the Jaffna district in the 2010, 2015 and 2020 elections.

The youngest of the trio is S.Yoheswaran born in 1970. Yoheswaran’s vocation/profession  is social service.  Yoheswaran was elected from the Batticaloa district to Parliament in 2010 and 2015. He contested the 2020 polls but was not elected.

The nomination procedure requires a  minimum of six members of the Central Working Committee  to propose a name with the prospective candidate’s consent. In this instance Sumanthiran’s name was proposed by twelve persons while Shritharan and Yoheswaran were nominated by six persons each. They were from Kilinochchi and Batticaloa district respectively. Sumanthiran was nominated by four persons from Jaffna district and one each from the Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaitheevu,Vavuniya,Trincomalee,Batticaloa, Amparai and Colombo districts respectively.

The election to the party president post is  a “first” for the ITAK. Though the party constitution states an election must be held if there are two or more candidates, there has never been a presidential election in the ITAK’s 74 year old history. The Party’s co-founder and respected leader Samuel James Veluppillai Chelvanayagam venerated by his followers as “Thanthai Chelva” adopted the practice of   selecting a leader through a consensus among  senior leaders and obtaining approval from the rank and file at the party convention.

An election of a president for the first time therefore is a refreshing  feature as it strengthens inner -party democracy. However there were many within and without the ITAK who feared that a competitive election could result in  the party breaking up. These  worries were compounded  by the veiled threats issued on behalf of a potential candidate by his supporters that their man would form a new party or join another party if he was not elected president. There was concern that the party would be divided.

This writer too  had some concerns about an election. I felt that under prevailing circumstances , the holding of a presidential election could encourage fissiparous tendencies within the party and ultimately lead to fragmentation. The party could suffer a serious split. Besides an election could  create an opening for extraneous intervention by the global Tamil Diaspora, Elements in India and the Sri Lankan “deep state”

As such  I urged well-intentioned ITAK stalwarts and well-wishers to intervene and bring about a compromise among the candidates thereby avoiding an election.

I  called upon  ITAK leaders like Sampanthan, Maavai Senathirajah, CVK Sivagnanam, Kurukularajah to work positively and constructively in this regard. The ”Daily Mirror”article was translated into Tamil and published in Tamil newspapers. The feedback I received indicated that my viewpoint had struck a responsive chord in some   ITAK members, supporters and well-wishers.

Initially  there were reports of the ITAK’s “emeritus leader”  Rajavarothayam Sampanthan writing a letter to current ITAK  president “Maavai”Senathirajah about the ITAK Presidential election. The Nonagenarian  Trincomalee MP does not hold any post in the ITAK now, but is respectfully referred to as “Perunthalaiver” (Great leader) by  the Tamil media. The Octogenarian  ”Maavai” Senathirajah who was Jaffna district MP for almost two decades, lost in 2020 and is no more an MP.

“Maavai”  SEnathirajah has clung on to the ITAK presidency for nine years despite calls by many to relinquish his post and enable  new leaders  to take over. When Sampanthan became ITAK president in 2010, he served for two , two -year terms and let Senathirajah who was then  the general secretary become president in 2014.  Senathirajah who should have stepped down gracefully in 2018 did not do so. Instead he has hung on to the presidency by “hook or by crook”.  The ITAK Party convention was not held for several years so as to avert  the advent of a new president.

Finally overwhelming pressure from the party rank and file compelled Senathirajah to comply with the demand for a party convention. When it became clear that there was going to be an election,  some had genuine  concerns about a party split as a result, “Maavai”  then suggested  that he should continue further as president instead of having an election. This was rejected by the party. Moreover the rival  candidates themselves   “united” on this issue and reiterated the call for an election.

Under these circumstances, Sampanthan’s letter provided Maavai with another opportunity to remain in office as ITAK president. Sampanthan piqued with some ITAK partymen in Trincomalee alleged that elections for  branch leadership posts  in the district had not been done properly. (Sampanthan’s troubles with the ITAK in Trinco may be discussed in detail in a future article) As such he wanted the present branches to be dissolved and urged that the party convention should not be held until then.

“Maavai” utilsed Sampanthan’s demand to his advantage. He suggested that the ITAK Convention be postponed indefinitely until Sampanthan’s grievances were redressed. Until then he Senathirajah would continue to be  the ITAK’s pro tem president. An ITAK Politbureau meeting was convened at Sampanthan’s Colombo residence on 10 January to discuss the issue.

Meanwhile  Ex-MP Yoheswaran openly aligned with Shritharan and extended support to him in the  ITAK presidential hustings. This made the election a duel between Sumanthiran and Shrithaean.

When the  ITAK politbureau met on  Jan 10th, Senathirajah was in for a surprise. Although the Politbureau meeting had been convened to discuss  matters like Sampanthan’s letter of complaint against the ITAK Trinco branches, postponng the Convention and endorsing  “Maavai” as pro tem ITAK president, those did not happen.

Sampanthan pointedly refrained from discussing  the Trincomalee branch issue. Therefore the matters of postponing the convention and appointing  a pro tem president were not taken up for discussion. What  Maavai did not know was that three  concerned individuals all of them lawyers had visited Sampanthan at different times prior to the Politbureau meeting and discussed Sampanthan’s grievances. The “Perunthalaiver”was satisfied and a  compromise arrived at.. As a result  Sampanthan did not follow up his letter of complaint.

The Politbureau therefore confirmed that the convention would take place. The President election would also be held. Nevertheless, some felt that an election should be averted and the party tradition of electing a president through a consensus should be  continued. Sampanthan too expressed the same sentiments. It appeared that most members of the Politbureau wanted the  candidates to arrive at an understanding and do away with an election. This placed the two main contenders in a delicate position. What was to be done?

Sumanthiran then   stated that he was prepared to discuss the matter  the next day and possibly reach an understanding ,if  Shritharan and Yoheswaran were willing.  Both Shri and Yohes agreed. Sumanthiran then  suggested that all three of them meet the following day and  arrive at a compromise if possible. Thre was agreement and it was decided that Sumanthiran would  meet with Shritharan at the latter’s  residence in Madiwela. Yoheswaran was also staying there.

The meeting took place on January 11th morning at Madiwela.  Sumanthiran began the talks by saying “let us discuss this matter in deference to the wishes of the Politbureau and reach a settlement”.Shritharan cut to the chase immediately by asking Sumanthiran to withdraw  and let him (Shri)become president. He would quit in two years and let Sumanthiran be president.

Taken aback by this blunt “request” Sumanthiran asked Shritharan  why he was making this demand. Shritharan replied in Tamil “You once said that you will work with me as Party leader”. Sumanthiran then refreshed Shritharan’s memory by referring to the context in which he reportedly said this.

“You had announced that you (Shritharan)were ready to take up the  leadership of the ITAK. The media asked me what my response was to your statement. I replied that I would be prepared to work under you if the party elected you as president. Subsequently you apologized to Senathirajah for making such a statement and declared that you wont be interested in a leadership position for five years” Sumanthiran reminded Shritharan

Sumanthiran pointed out that Shritharan had not been elected president and therefore  the question of working under him did not arise. At this point Shritharan asked Sumanthiran why he wanted to be the ITAK president. “Why cant you let me be President this time and take over after me?” asked Shri.He also reiterated that the ITAK presidency could be shared by both on a rotational basis of two years each.

Sumanthiran responded by saying that he was not interested in being president on a rotational basis. He said that the Tamil people were facing a huge crisis at present.  It was the ITAK that could provide positive leadership at this juncture. The party needed both change and continuity.

The President’s counsel pointed out that he could provide both  change and continuity as he had been involved in every major  political initiative undertaken by the ITAK concerning the Tamil national question. He had participated in negotiations and discussions nationally and internationally. He  was in contact with many international leaders and officials. He had also handled legal matters in a number of issues affecting Tamils. Besides he  had good relations with a number of  political leaders from different parties said Sumanthiran

Speaking further Sumanthiran said that on the strength of his background and experience ,he was  confident of leading the ITAK  successfully   in the near future. He said  that with the support of the party, he hoped to accomplish several things for the benefit of the Tamil people during his tenure.  Sumanthiran also said that he had publicly announced that he would retire from Politics when he reached 65 years and that he would be 60 next February. Therefore he was not going to be President for a long time.

The  third candidate Yoheswaran was a silent listener to the conversation. At this juncture Yoheswaran got up and prepared to leave. Shritharan then  said let the election take place and ended the discussion. Sumanthiran left. The discussion did not take more than 20 minutes. Consequently both Sumanthiran and shritharan spoke to Tamil media outlets and said that the party would elect the new president.

The stage therefore is set for  the ITAK presidential election on 21 January. One of the three candidates Yoheswaran has thrown in his lot with  another candidate  Shritharan. The election will therefore be a duel between Sumanthiran and Shritharan. The  fate of the ITAK presidential election will greatly determine the future course of Tamil  Nationalist politics in Sri Lanka.

### Sri Lanka revises import duties for 1,222 items under Singapore FTA

*2024-01-15 16:34:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-revises-import-duties-for-1222-items-under-singapore-fta-147311/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has published import duties of up to 20 percent applied to 1,222 items under a free trade agreement with Singapore.

Sri Lanka usually has a negative list for imports in trade deals.

In addition, so-called para tariffs, such as the Sri Lanka’s Airport Levy as well as an import CESS is also charged from some goods.

Excessively high import duties on some items, imposed to give artificially high profits to politically connected producers while harming consuemrs, have led to undervaluation and corruption, critics say.

Over 30 international human rights organisations including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists have expressed their deep concern regarding the “drastic intensification” of anti-drug operations in Sri Lanka leading to significant human rights violations.

Issuing a joint statement, the 33 international organizations demand the Sri Lankan government to stop the ‘abusive anti-drug operation’ and release the arbitrarily detained individuals.

Furthermore, the statement highlights that this operation is unfolding in a context of already severe repression against persons who use or are suspected of using drugs, and who suffer discrimination and stigma within the Sri Lankan criminal justice system and society.

“Alongside the Sri Lankan police, members of the armed forces have been supporting this operation, during which several human rights violations have been reported. These violations include alleged arbitrary arrests, primarily against individuals from marginalised socio-economic communities; searches conducted without warrants or reasonable suspicion; and degrading treatment including strip searches in public as well as cavity searches. The searches and arrests have been televised, in violation not only of the right to privacy (and of basic human dignity) but also of a person’s right to be presumed innocent”, the joint statement added.

The global organizations, which also point out that according to lawyers, persons are being arrested even when no drugs are found in their possession, simply for having been arrested for drug offences or having been sent to compulsory rehabilitation in the past, mention that the arrests of main livelihood earners and mothers have adversely impacted the ability of families to meet their basic needs during a time of economic crisis in Sri Lanka, and the wellbeing of children.

“Persons are being arrested primarily under Section 54A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, an offence which is non-bailable. As a result, those arrested are bound to spend time (sometimes months) in pretrial detention, thereby exacerbating already poor conditions of imprisonment in an overburdened prison system.”

Furthermore, the statement has drawn attention to the fact that the level of overcrowding of the prison system is at nearly 200% - with punitive drug policies playing a significant role: as of 2022, 63% of convicted persons were sentenced for drug-related offences, as per the statistics issued by the Department of Prisons.

The aforesaid organizations have also expressed in this joint statement that the total number of arrests pursuant to operation Yukthiya has exceeded 29,000 as of 9 January 2024, while nearly 1,500 people are in administrative detention in police custody for further investigation and at least 1,600 more persons have been sent for compulsory drug rehabilitation, “in violation of several fundamental rights; including the right to the highest attainable standard of health, which includes the right to consent to and withdraw from medical treatment”.

“‘Drug treatment’ in these centres is abstinence-based, essential harm reduction services are not available, and persons undergo severe withdrawal symptoms without any medical assistance while in detention.”

“The use of violence to discipline and punish has been reported in at least two compulsory drug rehabilitation centres which are within the purview of the Bureau of the Commissioner General for Rehabilitation and are operated by the military, which is in itself a violation of international standards”, it added.

“The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in its statement at the conclusion of its visit to Sri Lanka 2017expressed concern regarding the involvement of military personnel in drug treatment and rehabilitation, the fact that strenuous physical exercise was the core component of compulsory drug treatment, and at the lack of trained professionals to monitor the health of people in detention. Furthermore, the statement highlighted the irregularities in the judicial process by which persons were sent to drug rehabilitation centres without a medical assessment”, the statement mentioned.

In addition, the organizations say that since the 2016 UN General Assembly Special Session on drugs, there is international consensus on pursuing a holistic and health and human rights-based approach to drugs, which encompasses supply and demand reduction as well as harm reduction.

“The 2019 Ministerial Declaration on drugs – the current global drug policy document - as well as multiple resolutions of the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, and the UN Human Rights Council reiterate and recommend a similar approach”, it added.

Further, the joint statement clarified: “a punitive and militarised approach to drug control contravenes recognised international human rights standards and guidelines, is ineffective to protect individual and public health, and ultimately fails to make communities safer”.

Thereby, the 33 global organizations call upon the Government of Sri Lanka to immediately cease operation “Yukthiya” and release persons who have been arrested without evidence or reasonable suspicion. The government should ensure that those arrested who do not have access to legal representation are provided legal aid, they stressed.

Through the statement, it is also demanded to immediately release persons arrested or sent to compulsory drug rehabilitation for using drugs/having a drug dependence, cease involving the armed forces in drug control and treatment activities as consistent with human rights law, repeal laws that allow compulsory drug rehabilitation, close compulsory treatment centres and release persons presently held at the centres within the purview of the Bureau of Commissioner General for Rehabilitation.

Additionally, they have called the government to ensure that any law enforcement operation to address the supply side is conducted respecting due process standards and constitutionally protected fundamental rights.
