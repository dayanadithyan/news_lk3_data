### Uncertainty, stability and the Executive Presidency

The total change of a system of government which has stood for 46 years is a very serious matter and anyone proposing to change it should present a convincing argument and show us how the new system will work. We need to remember that going back to the old system may no longer work, as the world and our country has changed around us, and we sit next to a giant economically powerful neighbour. A change of the Executive Presidency also means that the provincial councils will need to change

It is said that the beauty of cricket is in its uncertainty. This could be the reason why we are so preoccupied with politics; we love its uncertainty. We should be thankful, for if it were certain, we would no longer be living in a democracy. While uncertainty in the outcome of an election is democracy, the breakdown of the system of government could become anarchy.

### Sri LankaтАЩs NPP plans to raise tax-free threshold to Rs 200K monthly income

ECONOMYNEXT тАФ The leftist National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) has proposed that Sri LankaтАЩs income tax-free threshold be increased to 2.4 million rupees a year from the current 1.2 million and to тАЬequitablyтАЭ amend tax rates and tax brackets.

The NPPтАЩs election manifesto released on Monday August 26 has also proposed that the tax base be widened according to taxation fundamentals.

Increasing the tax-free threshold to include people who earn up to 200,000 rupees a month will likely exclude many people from the tax base, however.

NPP leader and presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake first proposed this increase in January 2023. He also said at the time that an NPP government would cap progressive taxation at a maximum of 24 percent.

Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana said on August 18 2024 that Sri LankaтАЩs planned relief to personal income tax payers could cost 0.08 percent of gross domestic product in lost revenues and would be compensated by additional tax measures.

### What the majority want from a new government

Now that the presidential election is round the corner and would be followed by a general election, the majority of law-abiding, patriotic, selfless and non-partisan people would want many changes in the system to bring this country back to where it was in the early nineteen fifties.

The first thing many are clamoring for is to abolish the executive presidency. This office has been a bane rather than a boon to this country and its people. It has only helped to enrich some who achieved this position. As we can remember, there were many previous occupants of this office who promised abolish it if they were elected, but reneged on their promise.

The powers attached to the executive presidency have been misused even by those with a good educational background and we have seen how the prerogative of the presidential pardon had been utilized to pardon murderers, drug dealers, child rapists, etc.

The arrears came due to various facilities given to state agencies to clear goods at in past year, he told reporters in Colombo.

Out of 38 parties that from whom uncollected taxes were due, 37 were state agencies.

The state agencies were given various accommodations to release goods and the money was now owned to various ministries.

Even for the state agencies to pay the taxes, the Treasury will probably have to make an allocation to the relevant ministry to pay the customs charge and the likelihood of the Treasury getting any net revenue was low, Muthukuke said.  (Colombo/Aug26/2024)

Australian employees can now ignore work emails and calls thanks to a new тАЬright to disconnectтАЭ law designed to curb those and other intrusions into personal lives.

The new rule, which came into force on Monday, means employees, in most cases, cannot be punished for refusing to read or respond to contacts from their employers outside work hours.

Supporters say the law gives workers the confidence to stand up against the steady invasion of their personal lives by work emails, texts and calls, a trend that has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic scrambled the division between home and work.

тАЬBefore we had digital technology there was no encroachment, people would go home at the end of a shift and there would be no contact until they returned the following day,тАЭ said John Hopkins, an associate professor at Swinburne University of Technology.

Gunmen fatally shot 23 passengers after identifying them and taking them from buses, vehicles and trucks in one of the deadliest attacks in restive southwestern Pakistan, police and officials said Monday.

The killings occurred overnight in Musakhail, a district in Baluchistan province, senior police official Ayub Achakzai said. The attackers burned at least 10 vehicles before fleeing the scene.

President Asif Ali Zardari and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi in separate statements called the attack тАЬbarbaricтАЭ and vowed that those who were behind it would not escape justice.

The attack came hours after the outlawed Baluch Liberation Army separatist group warned people to stay away from the highways, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility.
