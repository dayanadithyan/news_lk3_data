### IMF urges Asian Central Banks to not follow Fed too closely

*2024-04-19 13:38:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/IMF-urges-Asian-Central-Banks-to-not-follow-Fed-too-closely/108-280993) ¬∑ `en`

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged Asian Central Banks to not follow the Fed too closely.

IMF Director of the Asia and Pacific Department Krishna Srinivasan this week recommended Asian Central Banks to focus on domestic inflation and avoid making their positive decisions overly dependent on anticipated moves by the Federal Reserve.

‚Äú If central banks follow the Fed too closely, they could undermine price stability in their own countries,‚Äù Srinivasan said, addressing a press briefing on Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and Pacific.

IMF staff analysis shows that U.S. interest rates have a strong and immediate impact on Asian financial conditions and exchange rates. The Fund noted that expectations about Fed easing have fluctuated in recent months, driven by factors that are unrelated to Asian price stability needs.

Sri Lanka has a deeply flawed non-floating ad hoc soft-peg arrangement found in all defaulting IMF advised countries, with inconsistent policies where external and domestic anchors conflict, critics have pointed out.

In May 2023, after the central bank collected 666 million dollars amid panic sales by market participants when inconsistent peg was allowed to appreciate to 295 to the US dollar from 321 in April, the rupee came under pressure in the following two months.

As the inconsistencies of the deadly flexible exchange rate clash, the rupee is quoted wide, spot trading disappears, moral suasion comes in and the spot next and one week market becomes active.

(CNN) - Polls opened Friday for the first and largest phase of India‚Äôs marathon general election, kicking off a vote in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to win a rare third consecutive term.

About 969 million people are eligible to vote in the biggest election in human history, with polling taking place in seven phases over the next six weeks in the world‚Äôs most populous country.

The nationwide vote is considered among the most consequential in decades as Modi‚Äôs powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) aims for an outright majority and a mandate to widen its development and Hindu-nationalist policies established during its 10-year rule.

Those policies have transformed India economically and culturally, and BJP rule has been defined by a pull away from India‚Äôs secular foundation, toward Hindu majoritarianism.

Under Modi‚Äôs leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world‚Äôs fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power.

Colombo, April 19 (Daily Mirror) - A request by some MPs across the political divide for concessionary vehicle permits is likely to be shot down by the party leaders given the dire economic situation of the country, Daily Mirror learns.

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne brought to the notice of the Business Committee last week that a letter is being signed by the MPs for such a request.

He said such a request would tarnish the honorary services of the MPs and therefore such facility should not be granted to them in adherence to due protocols as in the case of other public servants and judicial officers.

However, SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella said at the same meeting that such a request should not be entertained at all due to what they called bankruptcy of the country.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs leading pneumatic tyre manufacturer CEAT-Kelani has introduced three new variants of high-performance radial tyres into the market, widening choice for a significant segment of vehicle owners.

Joining CEAT‚Äôs ‚ÄòOrion Brawo‚Äô range, the new radials are in the sizes 155/65 R14, 165/70 R14 and 165 R13, with the first two sizes designated for popular models of compact and small cars, and the third for mid-sized vans, the company said.

The CEAT Orion Brawo 155/65 R14 and 165/70 R14 tyres both feature a tread pattern of a centre rib with three circumferential grooves and a high land area, which translate to improved tread life and higher resistance to impacts, cuts and other damage.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs premier mobile phone company, Dialog Axiata, will issue 952 million shares by way of a share swap to Bharti Airtel to acquire the latter organization. The deal was finalized yesterday, CSE market analysts said.

Dialog is the largest telecom service provider in Sri Lanka with more than 17 million subscribers as of 2021, representing around 51 percent of the market. Airtel Lanka has about 5 million subscribers. The 952 million Dialog shares amount to 10.4 percent of the total shares issued by the company.

The All Share Price Index went down by 33.1 points, while the S and P SL20 declined by 8.81 points. Turnover stood at Rs 2.22 billion with 3 crossings.

He noted that this has caused a delay in the disbursement of the second tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and in reaching an agreement with international sovereign bondholders.
