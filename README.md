*2024-04-21 12:05:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181564) · `ta`

The Breathless Sunday Attack impacted many, including a mother who lost her five-year-old daughter and lost her job due to hearing loss. The attack affected people of various nationalities and economic statuses, including children of Helch Powlsen, a Denmark millionaire. The Tamils of Sri Lanka, often overlooked, face ongoing struggles, including social discrimination, economic crises, and political recognition issues. Despite not being directly attacked, their communities have been severely impacted, leading to financial strain and displacement. Individual stories highlight the psychological and economic toll, such as Vadani, widowed with three children, and John, whose wife is psychologically affected by the loss of their daughter, leading to unemployment and financial strain.

Singing Easter Sunday Attax: Still Avating Justice

The survival Sunday attack has taken the lives of many people from many nationalities and many economic status.

Many boys who went to Christian Goddesses, including the children (tourists) of Helch Powlsen, the most famous Denmark millionaire and chief executive officer of Bestseller, were killed.

Many articles have been written on the victims and the survivors and the media has focused on the media, but the Tamils of Sri Lanka have been seen as a forgotten society.

It is not a new issue to be forgotten and excluded by the community for these people living in the mountainous areas of Sri Lanka.

Although they have been brought from India by British rulers to work in the hill country, their lives and current conditions have not yet improved.

The struggle and lack of equality that began as part of slavery in the colonial period continues to date.

### Colonial Legacies: Cultural Imperialism & The Fracturing Of Ethnic Identities

Cultural imperialism evolved from the concept of using cultural domination as a means of political and economic control. The idea behind cultural imperialism is that a powerful group, often a colonial power or dominant nation, imposes its cultural values, beliefs, and practices on a less powerful group or nation. This imposition is not just about spreading culture but is often a deliberate strategy to exert influence, control resources, and maintain dominance. It was a tool used to weaken the cultural identity and unity of colonized peoples. By imposing the culture, language, and values of the colonizers, the colonized were often made to feel inferior or backward, which reinforced the power dynamics of colonial rule.

### Is Religion The Opium Of The Masses?

*2024-04-21 08:45:42* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/is-religion-the-opium-of-the-masses/) · `en`

“Myself when young did eagerly frequent, Doctor and Saint and heard great Argument, About it and about, but evermore, Came out by the same Door as in I went”

Perhaps there is no phrase of Karl Marx that is better known or more frequently quoted than his quip about religion being the opium of the masses. So let me quote the passage in full.

“Religious distress is an expression of real distress and a protest against this distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, the spirit of a spiritless condition. It is the opium of the masses. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the condition for their real happiness. The demand to give up this illusion is the demand for men to give up a condition which needs illusions”. Marx, Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right.

ECONOMYNEXT – Vietnam can grow 6.0 percent in 2024, with ‘policy support’ but there is a debate whether it should be done through fiscal (widening deficits/worsening debt or state spending) or monetary means, a top International Monetary Fund official said.

The IMF projects 6.0 percent growth for Vietnam in 2024 “as it rebounds from a challenging 2023,” Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department told reporters during the Spring Meetings in Washington.

“Now, in the case of Vietnam, I would say that there’s an issue about policy mix, whether you could get more support from the fiscal and rely less on monetary,” Srinivasan said.

“So there is an issue of policy mix which we’re talking, which we’ve been engaging the authorities with.

“I would say that policy support should be more favorable and that should, and along with external demand, help raise growth to 6 percent.”

Sri Lanka’s leading pneumatic tyre manufacturer CEAT-Kelani has introduced three new variants of high-performance radial tyres into the market, widening choice for a significant segment of vehicle owners, the company announced.

Joining CEAT’s ‘Orion Brawo’ range, the new radials are in the sizes 155/65 R14, 165/70 R14 and 165 R13, with the first two sizes designated for popular models of compact and small cars, and the third for mid-sized vans, the company said.

“These tyres both feature a tread pattern of a centre rib with three circumferential grooves and a high land area, which translate to improved tread life and higher resistance to impacts, cuts and other damage,” a news release said.

The 155/65 R14 is designed for Suzuki Wagon R, Daihatsu Mira ES, Daihatsu Hijet, Nissan Dayz and Honda N-WGN, while the 165/70 R14 fits Toyota Vitz, Toyota Aqua, Renault Kwid and Toyota Passo, seen in large numbers on Sri Lankan roads.
