### Health workers to resort to another strike

*2024-01-31 18:10:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Health-workers-to-resort-to-another-strike/108-276055) · `en`

Colombo, Jan 31 (Daily Mirror) - In a decisive move set to reverberate across the nation's healthcare landscape, at least 72 trade unions within the health sector have announced plans for an island-wide strike commencing at 6:30 a.m. tomorrow (01).

The primary demand fueling this action is the long-standing dispute over the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance.

Despite assurances from the highest levels of government, including promises of dialogue upon the President's return from official overseas duties, healthcare workers remain disillusioned by the lack of substantive engagement.

The trade unions assert that no formal discussions have materialized since the President's return, exacerbating the brewing discontent among healthcare professionals.

However, the All Ceylon Nurses' Union, a prominent voice in the healthcare arena, has opted not to takepart in the scheduled strike.

### Online bill sends negative signal on Sri Lanka reforms and recovery: US envoy

ECONOMYNEXT – A law to control Sri Lanka’s online discourse labelled the Online Safety Bill will send a negative signal on the island’s reforms and recovery, the US ambassador to Colombo, Julie Chung has said.

The controversial bill on which many provisions were struck down by the Supreme Court as violating the constitution was passed amid strong protests by opposition legislators.

Civil society organizations have said it has a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech, and global tech companies also raised serious concerns.

“When major global tech companies characterize the bill as “unworkable” and stifling innovation and democracy, instead of actually addressing online crimes, frankly this sends a negative signal in Sri Lanka’s path towards reform and recovery,” Chung told members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka according to the text of her speech.

ECONOMYNEXT – Profits of Sri Lanka insurers will be hit by a directive to remit 100 percent of premiums for strike, riot, civil commotion and terrorism cover to state-run National Insurance Trust Fund from an earlier 12 percent, Fitch Ratings said.

The segment has generally been highly profitable in recent years due to relatively low claim incidence, though there were significant claims in May 2022 as a result of anti-government protests, Fitch said.

“However, the effect on non-life insurers’ profitability and risk-based capital adequacy ratios could be reduced if they are able to raise premium pricing,” the rating agency said.

“The impact will also depend on the level of commissions motor insurers receive from NITF for providing SRCCT cover.”
