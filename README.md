Colombo, March 16 (Daily Mirror) - A recent survey conducted by the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) has unearthed concerning trends regarding democratic governance in Sri Lanka.

The survey, titled ‚ÄòSurvey on Democracy and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka,‚Äô involved 1,350 participants across 25 districts in January, shedding light on shifting attitudes toward authoritarianism and declining trust in democratic institutions.

According to the findings, approximately 1 in 10 Sri Lankans expressed a preference for authoritarian rule, marking a significant increase since 2018.

Despite the majority favoring democratic governance, the survey highlighted a worrying sentiment that "In certain situations, a dictatorial government can be preferable to a democratic one."

The CPA, a prominent policy think-tank based in Colombo, emphasized that the spike in support for authoritarianism coincided with the political upheaval during the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government in 2018.

March 16, (ESPNcricinfo) -¬†Bangladesh have dropped Litton Das for the third ODI against Sri Lanka. He has been released from the squad on advice from the team management to play in the ongoing Dhaka Premier League.

Bangladesh have replaced him with wicketkeeper-batter Jaker Ali who scored an impressive 68 in the first T20I against Sri Lanka. He has 84 List A appearances and has racked up 1918 runs at an average of 34.87.

It is the first time that Litton has lost his place since 2021 when he was dropped for a T20I series against Pakistan.

From the start of the 2023 ODI World Cup, Litton has scored just 313 runs in 14 ODIs at an average of 24.07. He has crossed the 50-run mark just twice in that time.

"We are living in a country with poor management. The current government cannot manage even the price of an egg in the local market.
