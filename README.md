The increase in the use of plastic and polythene and the destruction of high -level trees is currently increased by temperature. Therefore, all people should plant homemade trees and keep the environment cool.

In the last two weeks, we have lost four to five patients who have been admitted to our patient hostels due to heat stroke.

People who are older do not know how to thirst for water. So to provide water foods continuously. Doing so can reduce the body's heat and prevent heat stroke.

Following is the full text of a statement issued by Immigration and Emigration Department Controller General I.S.H.J. Ilukpitiya yesterday on the GovernmentтАЩs decision to work with VFS Global for processing of visa applications for visitors to Sri Lanka

The Department of Immigration and Emigration commenced in 2012 the online Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) Programme. To grant approval to enter to Sri Lanka for the foreigners who visit Sri Lanka and under this program, only text data was obtained from foreigners. Subsequently, there was a strong requirement to introduce a new methodology due to the fact that this program was not updated timely to meet the technical requirements of the Department. This requirement was further intensified with the introduction of a new visa methodology.

From the fact the Sri Lankan developers of wind farms source many of the needed inputs from India, it should be

evident that the eco system of supportive manufacturers is well established there and not here

The 13-hour power cuts two years ago should have educated us on the importance of reliable power supply. But we forget after two weeks, it is said.

What is being done to ensure that will not happen again, including lessening dependence on imported fossil fuel, may not be perfect. But it is important to call out egregiously misguided criticisms. If such attacks succeed as they did 20 years ago, we will continue to suffer the consequences of a bad legal framework, resulting workarounds, and underinvestment in generation, transmission, and distribution. The blocking of new baseload plants from the 1990s served no oneтАЩs interests, other than perhaps of the so-called diesel mafia. We all paid for that. We continue to pay.

Politics and economics are concepts that are fundamentally intertwined. Yet the unprecedented economic crisis of 2022 highlighted the complex challenges of aligning short-term political goals with long-term economic strategies.

While the sharp appreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee in recent months has been roundly welcomed by most sectors of society as a positive signal, this optimism overlooks the nuanced factors influencing our currencyтАЩs strength and the medium-long-term challenges that could arise from volatile fluctuations in the price of the rupee.

### Concerns emerge on unauthorised players entering local lubricant sector

While Sri LankaтАЩs petroleum industry awaits the establishment of a new regulator, concerns are being raised about the potential for unauthorised players to enter the market, particularly in the lubricant sector.

The previous regulatory body, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), ceased its activities in market monitoring, consumer and trade education, import inspection and action against unauthorised operators and product adulterators.

As per the Energy Ministry directive, the lubricant licence fees that were previously paid to the PUCSL are now to be paid directly to the ministry.

An entity expressing concerns in this regard is Chevron Lubricants Lanka PLC.

тАЬWith this development, there is a risk that the vacuum could result in a proliferation of unauthorised players and product adulterators, which would be detrimental to the licensed players, consumers and government, in terms of loss of revenue,тАЭ said its MD/CEO Bertram Paul in the companyтАЩs annual report.

The visit of JapanтАЩs foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa to Sri Lanka is an indication that the relationship between the two countries is on the mend. The manner in which Japan was ousted from the special status it had once held by the previous government headed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa would have caused much heartburn. Japan was, for several decades, Sri LankaтАЩs biggest economic benefactor providing both outright grants and subsidized loans for a range of infrastructure and economic development projects. The cancellation of the light rail transit project, which Japan had offered on very concessional terms, was an example of both political churlishness and economic foolhardiness for which Sri Lankans have had to pay a very heavy price.

The law would mandate government civil rights offices to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance AllianceтАЩs (IHRAтАЩs) definition of anti-Semitism.

*2024-05-07 00:00:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Collective-resolve-of-regional-and-international-actors-a-glimmer-of-hope-for-Afghans-Air-Chief-Marshal-Bulathsinghala/172-282040) ┬╖ `en`

Afghanistan has been in deep political divisions, structural governance┬а challenges, and economic insecurity to impede durable peace and┬а development progress for years. The interruption of the fragile peace┬а talks with the Taliban and the withdrawal of the NATO troops have┬а created more uncertainty for Afghanistan. The power shift made on 15th┬а August 2021 has complicated the matter further to a very higher┬а proportion

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) is a┬а political UN mission established to assist the people of Afghanistan in┬а laying the foundations for sustainable peace and development. United┬а Nations Security Council Resolution 1401 established UNAMA on March 28,┬а 2002. Its original mandate was to support the Bonn Agreement of December┬а 2001

### Press freedom, a boon for economic recovery

*2024-05-07 00:00:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Press-freedom-a-boon-for-economic-recovery/172-282041) ┬╖ `en`

Sri Lanka ranked 150 out of 180 countries in the 2024 Edition of the Press Freedom Index, published annually by Reporters Without Borders (Reporters Sans Frontiers - RSF) is a remarkable drop of 15 positions from 135 to 150 when compared to 2023.

However, Sri Lanka has been ranked higher than India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. India is ranked 159th, Pakistan 152nd and Bangladesh 165th. Norway is ranked in the top position and Eritrea┬а in the last position. The RSFтАЩs ranking is based on five indicators such as political context, legal framework, economic context, socio-cultural context and safety of journalists.

Sri Lankan authorities might still argue that media freedom in the country is above what prevails in the neighbouring countries and also they might find gaps in the index citing the fact that one of the criteria for Sri LankaтАЩs ranking in the index is the unresolved issues that have occurred during the separatist war which ended 15 years ago.
