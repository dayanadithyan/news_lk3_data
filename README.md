### Preparing For Free & Fair Elections

*2024-05-14 01:30:48* ¬∑ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/preparing-for-free-fair-elections/) ¬∑ `en`

Elections provide a unique situation where people become equal regardless of their class or ethnic and religious identity. This offers space to rival politicians to address their unmet needs. The government has commenced several development initiatives that will take resources to the community level in a targeted manner. These initiatives would be beneficial to the government in mustering support for it at the grassroots level. Those who wield governmental power have the ability to make tangible offerings to the people to secure their vote in a time of elections. The intervention of the Election Commission and civil society organisations in disapproving some of these governmental actions and ensuring free and fair elections needs to be seen in this light.

Freeman was known to traverse miles along jungle trails, visiting the ill and those in need, always carrying his iconic umbrella. Remarkably, he even attended court sessions to advocate for individuals he believed had been unfairly accused in criminal cases

Abolish the National List; empower the electorate to choose their representatives. The current system is flawed, with party leaders and secretaries often lacking insight. They appoint individuals with dubious backgrounds, including terrorists and non-citizens, merely for financial gain. This practice undermines the credibility of our democratic principles and turns them into a farce.

This means that from 2010-2023, 111 gazettes have been published to¬† change either the duties and functions assigned to ministries, the¬† institutions that are assigned to those ministries or the laws that¬† these ministries are supposed to implement

It would be an absolute surprise for someone walking into a local ministry to find everything crystal clear. Rather it could be just the opposite with the operation all over the place. Sri Lanka‚Äôs system of government has a history of assigning unrelated subjects to a single ministry, thereby including multiple departments and institutions under one roof. The latest blueprint document for rational government by Verit√© Research reveals that the compositions of ministries had undergone changes 111 times between 2010 and 2023.

The influence of South Asians at the highest political levels in the¬† British Isles appears to be on the wane. However, there is speculation¬† that Leo Varadkar might take up a top job in the European Union and¬† become the first person of part-Indian origin to do so

But Varadkar could not solve Ireland‚Äôs acute housing problem. Under both¬† terms as Taoiseach, he failed to hit targets for affordable housing. A¬† whole generation of young voters were unable to purchase homes

This time around, the ex-president‚Äôs party-the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)- is one of the political outfits that is faced with several splits. The former chairman of the SLPP with 13 SLPP MPs defected and formed the ‚ÄòFreedom People‚Äôs Congress‚Äô. They now sit with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJP) in Opposition

SLPP strongman Basil Rajapaksa has demanded a General Election first. But added a rider as reported in the Daily Mirror on 8 May, that he would not leave room for a rift with the President. Former President Mahinda called for a rethink of the sale of state- owned enterprises, but in a very subdued tone.

The Leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya is at war with his Party chairman.

Versatile musician Hiruni Virginia Fernando is due to leave for London, today, to team up with her husband.

She also played bass for C&C with Chandani Hettiarachchi and was seen in action, as a pianist, at the Galadari Hotel, in Colombo.

Hiruni says she will be busy with her music, in London, as well, but in a different format.

Her teaching skills will surface, once again, as she will be conducting leisure playing and exam-based online and physical classes, connected with the piano and guitar (bass, electric and classical guitar).

According to Hiruni, she will be operating from East Croydon, in London.

Having been raised and schooled in Kandy, I have watched the festivities of the Esala Perahera at least 10 times, as a child, and drawn it at least five times during my school years. August was the best month for schools in Kandy Lake Round. We used to get a long school vacation as schools closed to house the forces providing security to the Esala Perahera. Ice cream carts, cotton candy vendors, popcorn, isso-wadai, balloon animals, sadda-nalaa  [whistles for the lack of an English equivalent], glowsticks; August was carnivalesque for my childhood self. Growing up, I saw it more as a circus. Why do crowds raise their arms with ‚Äúsaadu saadu‚Äù? Why are elephants in this procession? Why do new mothers take their children under the belly of elephants for good luck? Do elephants have healing powers? Are they divine? Why are they chained then? Are they beastly?

While we challenge these individual attempts to dismantle our freedoms and rights, it is important to take a step back and see the monstrous governance apparatus that is growing

The proposed scheme appears to introduce legal legitimacy for the current oppressive treatment of non-governmental organisations. The scheme explicitly requires organisations to comply with governmental policy and agenda, rendering unlawful those who may criticise, challenge and question Government policy and agendas. It seeks to assert authority over all forms of non-governmental associations, groups and activities by introducing mandatory registration, whilst retaining powers to give directions to institutions that are specifically excluded from registration. The Government investment in the institutional mechanism and apparatus to oversee, supervise and direct non-governmental resources and activity is quite simply a taking control of the vast breadth of institutions and groups

He criticized the day-to-day wage system and urged for a switch to a more stable system. The minister also addressed the controversy surrounding the salary increase announcement by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, noting the companies' initial resistance to a salary increase and their subsequent willingness to increase the basic salary by 200 rupees. He questioned the companies' claims of financial constraints and called for an investigation into the lack of re-planting and maintenance of gardens, which have led to their transformation into forests.

Significantly, the legal remedy sought was the rarely used Writ of Quo Warranto. This required Gamage to show ‚Äòby what authority she claims to hold office and continue to function as a Member of Parliament.‚Äô
