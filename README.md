Numerous CCTV footages depicted the disturbing nature of the crime, suggesting the level of confidence and brazenness among the perpetrators. There is even speculation that one such video was being watched in real-time by the mastermind behind the attack, which, if true, should create fear even among those who are provided security nowadays.

The Tamil National Alliance's decline marks a significant failure in Tamil nationalism. Tensions arise from leadership disputes between Sumanthiran and Sridharan over control of the alliance's wealth. Despite its dissolution, there's a pressing need to appoint a parliamentary leader.

The decay of the Tamil National Alliance is one of the biggest failures of Tamil national politics that all parties in the future will be realized.
