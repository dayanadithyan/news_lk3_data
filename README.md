By 2026, the T20 World Cup will involve 12 teams, including qualifiers from Africa, Europe, the U.S., Asia, and East Asia Pacific. The ICC also granted co-status to the U.S. Cricket Company and Cricket Chile.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has confirmed that the 2024 T20 World Cup will be reviewed in the United States and the West Indies.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has appointed a team of three directors - Roger Dus, Losan Naidu and Imran Khawaja, to supervise and submit the report.

Criticism has been raised over the amount of money spent during competitions in the United States and the shortcomings in the Caribbean Islands.

In this case, it was decided to appoint the committee during the ICC annual conference held in Colombo from July 19 to 22.

During the meeting, the ICC also approved the increase in the number of teams that participate in the Women's T20 World Cup in 2030.

Eight teams participated in the 2009 R20 World Cup competition, and the number rose to 10 in 2016.

### Thousands of migrant kids reach Canary Islands alone; officials seek SpainтАЩs help

The children sometimes wonтАЩt stop crying. Health workers dealing with migrants arriving on SpainтАЩs Canary Islands try to understand if the tears are from illness, injury or, as is often the case, from pure shock.

One young Senegalese boy who disembarked recently kept fainting every few minutes, troubling doctors who couldnтАЩt determine the cause. Other migrants finally explained: the boy had witnessed both parents die during the arduous boat voyage from West Africa. Their bodies were thrown overboard into the Atlantic Ocean.

тАЬThereтАЩs no medicine for that,тАЭ said Inmaculada Mora Peces, a 54-year-old emergency doctor who treats migrants arriving on the island of El Hierro.

Mora Peces is among a growing number of people sounding the alarm as the archipelago struggles to deal with thousands of teenagers and children traveling alone to the European Union territory from Senegal, Mali, and other African nations, fleeing poverty, conflict and instability.

Sri Lanka imports 4.5 million tons of plastic annually, recycling only 50,000 tonnes. The Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, chaired by Ajith Mannapperuma, focuses on plastic waste management. It's noted that while 1,200 metric tons of plastic are recycled monthly, 900 tons are improperly disposed of. The main obstacle to increasing recycling is the lack of interest in collecting plastic bottles. Proposals for improving plastic recycling, including deposit schemes for PET bottles, were insufficiently advertised. The committee recommends legalizing these proposals and extending the submission deadline to August 27th. The Ministry of Environment will investigate international recycling practices for PET bottles.

This is the most focused on plastic and that about 1,200 metric tons of mine per month is recycling to the environment, and the remaining 900 tons are buried in the open environment.He said he was sabotized in the soil.

It was also revealed that the main reason for the largest reason for not adding plastic bottles is not interested in collecting them.

When President Gotabaya resigned, large segments of the aragalaya crowds simply melted away. The UNPтАЩs own activists in the aragalaya, the foreign funded NGOs, the Tamil and Muslim groups, the Christian and Catholic groups all left the Galle Face protest site.

The Elections Commission plans to request the Urumaya and Jayakamoosree organizations in Sri Lanka to exclude politicians from their upcoming public meetings, ahead of the impending election announcements. Despite lacking authority to enforce this, the commission aims to communicate its stance through a letter to the President's Secretary, highlighting the need for transparency and neutrality in public gatherings.

The Elections Commission will appeal to the Urumaya and Jayakamoosree Sri Lanka without politicians.

The Elections Commission will appeal to stop the involvement of politicians in events such as the Urumaya, as the announcement of the elections will be released soon.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is expected to contest the presidential election, has used public meetings such as the Urumaya, and accuses the public of the public.

Elections Commission Chairman RMAL Ratnayake says that they have no authority to impose restrictions on politicians participating in such events so far as the Election Commission has not yet announced the presidential election.

However, the Elections Commission has decided to send a letter to the President's Secretary Samanratnayake to hold public meetings such as the Urumaya.

"We will ask for these public meetings without the participation of politicians," he said.
