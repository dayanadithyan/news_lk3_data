The US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung meeting the officials of the Election Commission

What a big fuss would have been made by the embassies of Western countries had the Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Qi Zhenhong met with the members of the Election Commission (EC), as American Ambassador Julie Chung and several other Western diplomats had done recently?

Also, can we at least imagine a meeting between the Sri Lankan or Indian Ambassador to the United States and the election officials of the US, including those of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), to discuss the forthcoming US Presidential election? Answers to these questions would explain the world order that had been imposed by the West on others.

### The right to strike and motivated strikes

*2024-06-08 00:00:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-right-to-strike-and-motivated-strikes/172-284353) ¬∑ `en`

For over the past 35 days, the non-academic staff of government universities in the country has been on strike. There is no doubt that the working class of this country is burdened with low salaries. In some instances, workers‚Äô wages were reduced during the economic melt-down.

On June 6 the Locomotive Operating Engineers‚Äô Union of Sri Lanka Railways suddenly decided to go on strike. The trade union action according to the Union is being carried out over delays in second-class promotions of locomotive drivers and several other issues.

With the present cost of living far beyond the reach of a majority of workers, something needs to be done to correct the situation. Yet the country too is going through unprecedentedly bad economic times.

While most of the demands of the strikers are understandable, what the public find¬† difficult to agree with is the manner in which these strikes are called. Trade union action most always, inconveniences the public.

People‚Äôs aspiration and hope for a change was short lived and short changed, widening the mistrust between policy makers and electorate further

One fact remains as an acceptable analogy; which is, those who cannot cope with change will never be able to initiate change in any circumstances. This applies to all stakeholders including those who caused and contributed to the current crisis. Fair share of responsibilities fall on to the electorate who got carried away with populism engineered by few; with an ultimate aim of state and regulatory capture for their advantage leaving the country into a dire state grappling with debt. Therefore, capacity and capability to initiate that essential change is absent in the DNA of politicians who deceived their constituents

Sri Lankan Buddhists are spoiled for choice these days. Depending on where your faith lies and what tugs at your heart, it seems you can choose the flavour of Theravada Buddhism that suits you best: from the traditional temple Buddhism of the great sects of Kandy to the radical orthopraxy of ascetic Buddhism in remote forest monasteries, and from the devotional Buddhism of Mahamevna to the contrarian, eclectic mix of teachings at Umandawa, the variety can be dazzling‚Äîso much so that one could be excused for thinking that this lack of homogeneity is a sign of decay.

### How Argentina‚Äôs once great economy was destroyed? Lessons for Sri Lanka

Argentina‚Äôs exemplary economic success took a wrong turn from 1946 when Juan Peron became president and he implemented economic policies to make Argentina self-sufficient

As Argentina was the fifth largest economy in the world in the early 1900s, Sri Lanka was one of the best economies in Asia and was referred to as the Switzerland of Asia. Sri Lanka‚Äôs downfall too was due to looking into import substitution starting in the mid 1950s. Sri Lanka went into a disastrous overdrive towards import substitution and self-sufficiency starting in 1970 which led to goods shortages and high prices and an economic crisis. Sri Lanka opened its economy in 1977. But the Sri Lankan economy has not remained fully open since then and many of the tough reforms were not done when Sri Lanka opened its economy leading to many lost economic opportunities for the country

The President said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre deliberating whether the TRC should wield judicial authority or if a separate court should be empowered based on TRC recommendations.

"Review: 'Weapon' features Sathyaraj, Vasanth Ravi, and others in a sci-fi tale where a serum turns a man into a superhuman. Despite engaging modern tech elements like AI, the plot lacks depth on its purpose and side effects. Sathyaraj shines as the superhuman, but the film misses opportunities for humor and clarity. Tanya Hope and Rajiv Menon deliver strong performances amidst a storyline that could benefit from more focus on social development and less on indiscriminate violence."

Fans expecting a run-fest were left disappointed when Sri Lanka were bowled out for 77 -- their lowest ever score -- against South Africa, while India bowled out Ireland for 96 in Wednesday‚Äôs one-sided contest.
