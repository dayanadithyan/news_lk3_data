### Abolishing the Executive Presidency; Prudent Proposal  - But DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT FIRST

*2024-02-19 04:30:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Abolishing-the-Executive-Presidency-Prudent-Proposal-But-DISSOLVE-PARLIAMENT-FIRST/172-277270) · `en`

### Language: A Catalyst to foster National Unity - EDITORIAL

*2024-02-19 04:29:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Language-A-Catalyst-to-foster-National-Unity-EDITORIAL/172-277269) · `en`

Sri Lanka is described as a multilingual country but this definition could perhaps be deceptive when reflecting on the past and present. One may be quick to point fingers at various state policies that were implemented which made one language superior to the rest. However, language is an integral part of communication and is a key marker of identity. Sri Lanka witnessed a time when minority groups faced linguistic discrimination which in fact was a political recipe for disaster. As the world prepares to celebrate International Mother Language Day on February 21, it would be timely to reflect on the ‘mistakes’ that dragged Sri Lanka towards ethnic separatism.

The war in Ukraine and the sudden escalation of global commodity prices made it very difficult to import essential goods such as fuel. Having exhausted its foreign reserves without prioritising the imports of essential goods, the government defaulted on its external debt two months later.

The consequences of the seventy -five -year -old party until now have been based on compliance and now the consequences of the democratic system are visible.

Moreover, it is a shame that there are many shortcomings in the party with a variety of renowned lawyers since Rani Attorney SJV Selvanayagam.

Therefore, in the near future, if the TNA is establishing itself in the politics of the party, it is necessary to self -examine and prompt a reform to ensure internal democracy.

These two tasks are incomplete, and the responsibility of providing elegant representation to a race that the party is fighting for liberation.

### SL must forge new trade and investment partnerships with complementary economies

Partnering with these emergent markets could open doors for Sri Lankan business, while strengthening the country’s network within the Indo-Pacific region

With 56 member states, including some of the world’s fastest growing and most dynamic economies, the global Commonwealth network provides Sri Lanka with a pathway to closer and deeper partnership with nations around the world. What’s more, a combination of cultural, legal, and economic factors means that it is 21% cheaper for Commonwealth countries to trade with one another, an effect known as the ‘Commonwealth Advantage’

Now more than ever before, it is vital that Sri Lanka engages closely with a wide range of trade and investment partners. A strong recovery from the difficulties of the past few years will only be possible with the cooperation and capital of international partners, who recognise the extensive opportunities that Sri Lanka offers. Crucially, these partners must be varied and reliable.

The threat of debt distress or default is exacerbated by the climate crisis and presents a serious challenge for climate-vulnerable developing countries around the globe

Rising debt levels and fiscal constraints are a key challenge for developing countries across the globe. The threat of debt distress or debt default is further exacerbated by the climate crisis, which causes additional risks and requires significant investment to fulfil national obligations and build long-term resilience.

For climate-vulnerable developing countries facing serious debt-related challenges—including Sri Lanka—it is therefore crucial to understand the climate-debt nexus and identify ways to reconcile the need for green economic growth, debt sustainability, and climate action.

The heroines or heroes in these novels are defeatists. Readers finish the books with anger and resentment in their heads. Hulugalle’s creative work is different from this popular genre. True, there is love blossoming in the heart of an inexperienced young girl. But this girl differs from her counterparts in other novels and does not take the defeat as the inevitable fate. Instead, she makes an unusual sacrifice for those whom she loves and reaches her final goal of seeking academic excellence outside the country and away from those who had been known to her. In this sense, she is a heroine conquering the world which is hostile to her through understanding and persevering till she reaches her goal

### "Arunachalam" is the first Tamil leader to fail in compliance politics

*2024-02-18 19:39:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/176696) · `ta`

After the 1931 election, two people were elected from the Tamil and Muslim side when the cabinet was formed. Berry Sundaram, the Minister of Labor and Makan Makar Transport Minister. But when the Cabinet was formed in 1936, it was a separate cabinet council. Fifty -fifty demands of GG Ponnambalam. In fact, even if the executive committee selects its chairman, he can only hold the post of Minister if the President accepts it. In this, the patriotism was the silence of the patriot.

The politics of the Jaffna youth Congress, which was moving this way, moved parallel to the politics of the Jaffna Congress until 1934.. The Jaffna Youth Congress boycotted the 1931 cosmic elections. The reason is that Donamur Yapu did not give Sri Lanka a complete independence. Due to this boycott, the election has not been held in all four constituencies of Jaffna. Many Sinhalese political leaders have retreated but later retreated. The Jaffna Youth Congress was left alone in this regard.

Our defeat was always implicit in the victory of others; our wealth has always generated our poverty by nourishing the wealth of others – the empires and their native overseers. In colonial and anti-colonial alchemy, gold changes into scrap metal and food into poison. ~ Edward Galeano[1]

The opening of Edward Galeano’s book looks at the historical origins of Latin America’s underdevelopment, the central theme being the genocide of the native population by the Spanish and Portuguese ‘civilising’ colonial project in the Americas. This involved hunger, overwork, communicable diseases, and massive damage to the cultures, flora and fauna of the continent. Echoes of this are found in the thirty year civil war in Sri Lanka and in the Palestinian struggle for self-determination.
