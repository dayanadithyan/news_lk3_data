Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has reinstated the membership of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, enabling her to lead the party-dominated Podujana Eksath Peramuna (People’s Alliance), the Daily Mirror learns.

SLFP leader former President Maithripala Sirisena has already informed Ms. Kumaratunga about the membership reinstatement. The party has now decided to revive the People’s Alliance under its chair symbol. The alliance was originally formed ahead of the general election in 1994 as a move to defeat the 17-year rule of the United National Party (UNP). The People’s Alliance remained in power until 2001 when it was defeated by the UNP again.

In 2004, the SLFP took the lead in forming the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA).

Since then, the People’s Alliance remained idle in politics. In what appeared to be a new political development ahead of the presidential elections, it will be revived with Ms. Kumaratunga as the leader.

### The Ups & Downs Of Jaffna

*2024-02-03 07:17:37* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-ups-downs-of-jaffna/) · `en`

Jaffna offers little hope of recovery. People talk much of an intellectual revival but I see few signs of it. Indeed, there is no sign of English revival. Without it, there can be no intellectual revival. I see greater hope in the visibly evident emerging service industries doing more for us than the university where there is a great problem in the use of English. The much touted Engineering Faculty is running aground with few Ph.D holders teaching. The signs are that the Dean too will flee as his term ends. His efforts at recruitment are opposed by his staff threatening to strike should he bring in people of good quality.

### Lawyers group criticises Tiran Alles for personalising anti-drug initiative

The Lawyers Collective, a recently formed civil society group in a letter to Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, yesterday expressed grave concerns in the manner the Public Security Minister is exercising his powers in relation to the ‘Yukthiya’ Anti-Drug Campaign.

The organisation said the campaign must conform to the Rule of Law and cannot be a passionate, personal, initiative that the Minister seeks to implement outside the law.

“The manner in which you are conducting this campaign and making public statements on the media indicates that you will consider any laws that you think restrict your authority as obstacles that you have every right to disregard and that all who comment or criticise the manner in which the campaign is conducted are drug dealers and drug addicts,” it noted.

The organisation said the Minister has repeatedly referred to lawyers in this manner, despite a statement from the Bar Association of Sri Lanka objecting to this attack on the legal profession.

### 76 years on is Sri Lanka independent or in-dependence? What are we celebrating?

Sri Lanka has not had the benefit of a local Mahatma Gandhi, neither then, nor even today. So the country has to have a different model to India. The ideal model would be a collective leadership with a high level multiparty governing council for a period of time at least to chart a common economic program that sets some key parameters and strategies to set the country on a long term economic and social revival

There was no fight for . . . freedom which involved a fight for principles, policies, and programmes … No. It just came overnight. We just woke up one day and we were told, “You are a dominion now.” - S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, Ceylon Prime Minister

It sings of a stauncher freedom and untrammelled liberty, which we earnestly desire but often find to be out of reach year after year, generation after generation – Pic by Ruwan Walpola

As Sri Lanka parades past its 76th milepost on a journey of independence from colonial dominion today, there are a few factors to my mind that may help discern how the wind in that flag flies in the face of our march past.

It sings of a stauncher freedom and untrammelled liberty, which we earnestly desire but often find to be out of reach year after year, generation after generation.

The way we spend our days, of course, is the way we live our lives. This is as true of nations as it is of individuals.

There is therefore some merit in examining the way we dealt in the year past with diurnal events as individuals, as it may indicate the turn that our destiny as a nation is taking.

### SJB Protest Turns Out A Damp Squib

Electioneering is in the air. The usual rounds of protests are commencing. The NPP/JVP combine commenced their programme to ‘educate’ the electorate of issues at hand some time ago. On Tuesday, the main opposition party (SJB) held what it expected to be a massive demonstration against the ‘Online Safety Bill’ (OSB), the imposition of taxes, various price hikes and a skyrocketing cost of living.

The party expected to bring into Colombo 50,000 protestors. Unfortunately that expectation fell short by around 48,000. While many applaud the SJB sentiment of drawing attention to the dangers posed by the imposition of the OSB and the unbearable cost of living, everyone was aghast at the SJB’s claim of having led the ‘Aragalaya’ and the toppling of ex-President Gotabaya Rakapakasa.

Feb 2 (Daily Mirror) -  Fraud and corruption activities persisted at the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation of Sri Lanka (SPC) during the tenure of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, claims the Government Medical Officers' Forum (GMOF).

They further claim that these issues are ongoing, even following the appointment of a new Minister to the Health Ministry.

According to GMOF president Dr. Rukshan Bellana, tenders initiated during the former chairmanship of Sarath Liyanage at the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) were cancelled. However, he alleges that the same tenders are being reintroduced under the new SPC chairmanship, with the values inflated to ten times their previous amounts.

"Despite the new Minister being aware of these revised tender procedures, he maintains a silent approach. Consequently, the GMOF is compelled to take decisive action to draw attention to this situation and address the matter with the Minister," the GMOF president said.

It reminds us of the saying “Pride costs us more than hunger, thirst and cold” by Thomas Jefferson, when we see how rulers of an economically bankrupt nation are preparing themselves to celebrate their independence from the British colonialism. Even though it is true that the independence which is a process contributed by lots of men and women in the country should be celebrated and appreciated annually, the value of its financial cost is questionable at this crucial juncture where citizens are unprecedentedly taxed, inhumanely ignoring the capability of fulfilling even their basic needs. On the other hand, independence remains important and celebrate-worthy, given the fact that independence is gained from what or whom, especially how big the threat is. It is in that sense that we are able to figure out that the independence to be gained is more important and valuable than the one that our forefathers fought for.

### Two UK teens get life sentence for ‘sadistic’ killing of trans girl

*2024-02-02 22:17:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96960/two-uk-teens-get-life-sentence-for-sadistic-killing-of-trans-girl) · `en`

Two British teenagers were ordered to be detained for life on Friday for the “sadistic” knife murder of a 16-year-old transgender girl that shocked the country.

Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both 16, killed Brianna Ghey in Warrington, northwest England, in February last year, in what the judge called a planned “frenzied and ferocious” assault.

Ghey was stabbed 28 times in the head, neck, back and chest after believing she was going to meet a friend. Her body was discovered by dog walkers in a park.

“You both took part in a brutal and planned murder which was sadistic in nature,” judge Amanda Yip told the pair as she handed down the sentence at Manchester Crown Court.

Yip said that Jenkinson’s “primary motivation” had been a desire to kill, but the pair had also been motivated in part by Ghey’s transgender identity.

The judge ruled that Jenkinson must serve a minimum of 22 years before being considered for release, while Ratcliffe must serve at least 20 years.
