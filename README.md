இதன்படி ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலில் பொதுஜன பெரமுனவின் ராஜபக்ச முகாமின் ஆதரவு தேவையா அல்லது தனது சொந்த அணியினரின் ஆதரவு தேவையா என்பதை ஜனாதிபதியே தெரிவு செய்ய வேண்டும் என்றும் அக்குழுவினர் தெரிவித்ததுள்ளனர்.

### RW’s “judicial cannibalism” stirs up a storm

*2024-06-23 10:34:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/rws-judicial-cannibalism-stirs-up-a-storm/) · `en`

The topics of the judiciary and its independence were a recurring theme during last week’s parliamentary sittings. Both government and opposition MPs took turns discussing various aspects of the judiciary, with some using their parliamentary privileges to criticize judges and the courts.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe led the baton charge on Tuesday morning, explaining his stance on the recent Supreme Court determination on the constitutionality of the Gender Equality Bill. Using the words “judicial cannibalism”, he found fault with the court for holding that the Bill violated the powers of Parliament under Article 4 of the Constitution and called for the appointment of a parliamentary select committee to study and make recommendations on this matter. But he did say he was not proposing summoning judges before the select committee.

“All theory is grey… But forever green is the tree of life. “Goethe (Faust)

For three months in late 1990’s, American author and political activist Barbara Ehrenreich lived the life of a low-wage worker. She wanted to discover, first hand, how President Bill Clinton’s welfare reforms were impacting on the lives of the working poor. Her experiences gave birth to her most celebrated book, Nickle and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America. In it, she focuses on the phenomenon of employed-homeless, workers who often do more than one job but are still unable to afford a roof over their heads. The conjunction of low wages and high rents create poverty traps from which few workers escape, Ehrenreich notes.

### Free-Markets Pre-Date Capitalism

*2024-06-22 19:22:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/free-markets-pre-date-capitalism/) · `en`

Gobeli Teppe is the best known of half a dozen sites which have captured the attention of archeologists. Located in south-east Anatolia (Turkey) in the upper-reaches of the river Euphretes in the northern portion of the Fertile Crescent, it is an ancient market town with archeologically interesting temples which date back to the neolothic (new stone age) period, 9500-8000 BC. The birth of agriculture is credited to women who stayed at home and planted (gatherers) as men (hunters) pushed-off, chewed on meat, munched bones and came home from time to time to empty their overful containers# before they burst, and to procreate. The point of all this for this essay is that ancient market towns predate modes of production (slavery, feudalism, capitalism). Free markets are not a creation, nor a prelude, to capitalism as bogus liberal democrats, the IMF or an assortment of crooks would have us believe. Markets have been an ancient setting of human dealings for over ten-thousand years.

Adjudicated rapist and convicted felon Donald Trump’s pathological yearning for absolute fealty was on display at Tuesday’s Republican primary election in Virginia’s Fifth District, a deep-red Republican seat.

Popular incumbent, ultra-conservative Representative Bob Good, head of the Freedom Caucus, which includes indomitable Trump warriors like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan, was seeking a third Congressional term. In a primary where a Republican victory was a foregone conclusion in the general election, Good faced a challenge for this safe Republican seat from Republican State Senator, John J. McGuire III, also a Republican hard-liner, endorsed by Donald Trump.

### Reflecting on Poson

*2024-06-22 18:57:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/reflecting-on-poson/) · `en`

Unlike Vesak, Poson is specific to Sri Lanka and India. It celebrates the coming of Buddhism to the island through an embassy of five monks, one samanera, and one layman, led by Mahinda Thera, the son of Asoka from his second wife, Vedisa-Devi. The Dipavamsa and the  Mahavamsa are the main literary sources from this country that we have for the details of this embassy. All other accounts are variations on them.

According to these chronicles, Tissa, the second son of Mutasiva, was out on a hunt with 40,000 of his courtiers during a water festival, when he caught sight of an elk-stag (or a deer) which he proceeded to give chase to. He then pursued it to the top of Missaka Mountain, or Mihintale as it is known today, where he encountered Mahinda Thera, who preached the Dhamma to him after testing his intelligence.

### Unbundling The CEB II: Ranil & The Politics Of Reforming SOEs

*2024-06-22 18:34:59* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/unbundling-the-ceb-ii-ranil-the-politics-of-reforming-soes/) · `en`

It is an old truism in policy analysis that there is nothing purely ‘technical’ in policy decisions. Every policy decision has a political aspect to it. Technical analysis is necessary and useful to identify and evaluate feasible options, including the costs and benefits of each option. In the end, what is selected or rejected is a political matter based on political preferences. There is nothing wrong with that. What gets to be objectionable is when decisions are made to reach outcomes to benefit some or disbenefit someone else based on inappropriate considerations.

### Free Markets Predate Capitalism

*2024-06-22 18:33:26* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/free-markets-predate-capitalism/) · `en`

Göbekli Tepe is the best known of half a dozen sites which have captured the attention of archeologists. Located in south-east Anatolia (Turkey) in the upper-reaches of the river Euphretes in the northern portion of the Fertile Crescent, it is an ancient market town with archeologically interesting temples which date back to the neolithic (new stone age) period, 9500-8000 BC. The birth of agriculture is credited to women who stayed at home and planted (gatherers) as men (hunters) buggered-off, chewed on meat, munched bones and came home from time to time to empty their overfull containers before they burst, and to procreate. The point of all this for this essay is that ancient market towns predate modes of production (slavery, feudalism, capitalism). Free markets are not a creation, nor a prelude, to capitalism as bogus liberal democrats, the IMF or an assortment of crooks would have us believe. Markets have been an ancient setting of human dealings for over ten-thousand years.

### Scholars and Gentlemen

*2024-06-22 17:38:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/scholars-and-gentlemen/) · `en`

There are now a large number of scholarships for education abroad, including many given by foreign governments and institutions. Fifty years ago (this article was written in 1976) there were only two scholarships (before that, only one) awarded on the results of the Intermediate examination held in Colombo by the London University. If I remember correctly they were worth Stg. 400 per annum for three years.

Young people of those days were just as keen as their successors of today to travel and to study abroad. But, with some exceptions, they came back to pursue their careers at home. Rich parents sent the more promising among their progeny to Oxford and Cambridge, to medical schools in the United Kingdom, and to the Inns of Court in London so that they could become barristers who had the right to practise in Ceylon.
