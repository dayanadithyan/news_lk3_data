In a five-minute speech at the White House, Jobs said that the verdict of the judges 6-3 is affecting the rule of the law.

Joe Bidan said that it was the responsibility of the American people to decide whether Trump is worthy of re -entrusing the regime in the upcoming election.

### Sri Lanka reports US$706mn current account surplus amid financial outflows

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka has recorded a 706 million US dollar current account surplus in the first quarter of 2024 as the financial account recorded a deficit amid private and official debt repayments and reserve collections, data show.

Sri Lanka has recorded current account surpluses, since the last quarter of 2022 when monetary stability is reached.

The current account is a mirror image of the financial and capital accounts, subject to errors and omissions.

The way external accounting is calculated, only the balance of payments surplus and deficit (as defined) can be accurately measured.

Whether there is a balance of payments deficit or surplus depends on the note-issue activities of the central bank.

When money is printed through reverse repo or standing facilities, regardless of a budget deficit or surplus, there are foreign exchange shortages, making it difficult to make foreign payments, especially in the capital account, leading to a run down of reserve and eventual default.

### Imputed rental income tax: Gateway to corruption on a massive scale

This flawed system provides the assessor a great deal of authority and gives them the opportunity to pocket a buck for themselves

By 1 April 2025 the Government proposes to implement a wealth tax by way of an ‚Äúimputed rental income‚Äù on property as a precursor to a land tax. In simple terms the meaning of ‚Äúimputed rental income‚Äù is the estimated rental income of a property if it were rented. The mere assumption of a rental income is very much subjective and cannot in any effect be a guide to govern taxes.

In reality, imputed rent is exactly what the Local Councils are already obtaining from property owners by way of Municipality Rates. Hence the new ‚Äúimputed rental income‚Äù is just a facade to re-tax the citizen who is already taxed twice over on the same income, first by the Municipality on the imputed rent and secondly by the Inland Revenue based on actual income of the same property.

In the late 1970s, during the rising tide of neoliberal globalisation, many countries in the Global South opened up their economies to foreign capital in order to build a so-called export-oriented economy. The ethos that drove such reforms can be divided into two camps:

In China, pragmatism prevailed, with Chairman Deng Xiaoping stating, ‚ÄúTo cross the river, feel for the stones.‚Äù

In Sri Lanka, there was an ideological faith in markets and foreign capital, with then President J.R. Jayewardene stating, ‚ÄúLet the robber barons come.‚Äù

Today, one of these countries has defaulted on its external debt and is undergoing its 17th IMF program. The other is the world‚Äôs factory, contributing to over 35% of global manufacturing value-added and expected to lead the next business cycle. No prizes for guessing which is which.
