Do these migratory birds pick which project to hit or not hit, in this case they only hit the Adani wind project, is it?

The economic benefits of the Mannar project are substantial. It is expected to create 1,000 plus jobs, boosting the local economy. As are many infrastructural and developing projects of this nature developers are committed to working with local communities, addressing their concerns, and minimising disruption to their lives. Can Sri Lanka afford to lose this investment?

Due to its wealth of natural and cultural resources, Sri Lanka has great potential for scaling up ethical, sustainable, and eco-friendly fashion – Pic credit: SLYCAN Trust

Sri Lanka has a vibrant fashion and textile industry that has long been an important source of employment, export earnings, and economic growth. In addition to producing for global brands, it is also a significant part of the country’s cultural heritage with traditional practices such as handloom, batik, dumbara, beeralu, or jewellery-making. Furthermore, due to its wealth of natural and cultural resources, Sri Lanka has great potential for scaling up ethical, sustainable, and eco-friendly fashion—for example, through the use of natural dyes and fabrics or by repurposing factory waste and cutoffs.

It is the citizenry at the middle and lower end of the income scale who would be asked to bear the cost of this exercise rather dis-proportionately

“Don’t buy things you can’t afford with money you don’t have to impress people you don’t like”. This quote from Dave Ramsay which applies to individuals and families may as well apply to governments also. Why did Sri Lanka borrow so much, was there proper accounting of how it was spent, how many of the projects funded by borrowed money actually met the real needs of the country, and who really benefited, are all questions that still remain unanswered.

Joe Biden took to the stage at his Thursday night news conference with everything on the line – his presidency, his re-election hopes, his political life.

If those were the stakes, he barely acknowledged them at the hour-long session to mark the end of a Nato summit, having earlier introduced Ukraine’s President Zelensky as “President Putin” at a separate event.

The news conference was his first unscripted appearance after a disastrous debate with his rival Donald Trump, leading to calls from several Democratic politicians and donors for him to drop out of the race for president.

Mr Biden, 81, has faced continuous questions over his age and ability to serve another term, which intensified after the debate.

But at the highly anticipated news conference, he dismissed the concerns about his campaign that were posed again and again by a room full of reporters, and promised that he was fighting not for his legacy, but to finish the job he started when he took office in 2021.
