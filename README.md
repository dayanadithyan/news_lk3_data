If the employers cannot maintain and improve the gardens, we will take steps to provide the government back and provide them with proper maintenance of the gardens.. Minister of Labor Manusha Nanayakkara said that we will change the way the plantation workers exploit the labor of the plantation workers.

My mind is filled with so many experiences and emotions... I feel a boundless flow of energy within myself. The 2024 Lok Sabha elections are the first in the Amrit Kaal. I began my campaign a few months ago from Meerut, the land of the First War of Independence of 1857. Since then, I have traversed across the length and breadth of our great nation. The final rally of these elections took me to Hoshiarpur in Punjab, the land of the great Gurus and a land associated with Sant Ravidas Ji. After that, I came to Kanniyakumari, at the feet of Maa Bharti.

### Nortje takes 4-7 as South Africa beat Sri Lanka in T20 World Cup

*2024-06-03 23:47:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Nortje-takes-4-7-as-South-Africa-beat-Sri-Lanka-in-T20-World-Cup/108-284036) · `en`

(New York) - South Africa's Anrich Nortje took a remarkable four wickets for just seven runs as the Proteas dismissed Sri Lanka for a record low 77 on their way to a six-wicket win in the teams' T20 World Cup opener in New York on Monday.

Sri Lanka's total was their lowest in all T20 cricket, with fast bowler Nortje's figures the best by a South African at a T20 World Cup, surpassing his own 4-10 against Bangladesh in Sydney two years ago.

Kagiso Rabada (2-21) and left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who took two wickets in two balls on his way to 2-22, also damaged Sri Lanka's cause.

Opener Kusal Mendis (19) and veteran all-rounder Angelo Mathews (16) were the only Sri Lanka batsmen to pass 15 after their captain, Wanindu Hasaranga, seemingly misread conditions by opting to bat first after winning the toss in what was the first match at a Long Island ground built specially for this tournament.

*2024-06-03 23:35:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185248) · `ta`

South Africa secured a 6-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the opening match of the 9th T20 World Cup, with Nokia taking 4 key wickets. Sri Lanka's 77 runs were their lowest in an international T20, largely due to South Africa's accurate bowling. The match highlighted challenges faced by both teams on Nasav's artificial pitch, showcasing a battle between bowling strength and batting prowess.

🟩

South Africa won by 6 wickets for 77 runs in the opening match of the 9th T20 World Cup chapter's T team held at the New York Nasav Stadium today.

The accurate bowling with Nokia's 4 wickets has made South Africa's victory easier.

Sri Lanka's 77 runs in this match are the lowest total number of Sri Lanka in an international T20 cricket match.

The players of the two teams faced the difficulty in the international cricket match, which was the first time Nasav, who played on the artificial pitch.

The match is expected to be a match between Sri Lanka's bowling and South Africa's batting.

But it was a match between the two teams and the bowlers and the batsmen.

Sri Lanka decided to bat first and lost all wickets in 19.1 overs and scored only 77 runs.

The Sri Lankan team, who was unable to face the South African bowlers properly, scored only double -digit numbers and both of them lost the match in the middle of the row.

### Hot Chocolate …heating up the scene

*2024-06-03 23:29:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/hot-chocolate-heating-up-the-scene/) · `en`

Whenever I think of Hot Chocolate, I’m reminded of the British soul band Hot Chocolate who had several hits, including ‘Everyone’s a Winner,’ ‘You Sexy Thing’ and ‘It Started With a Kiss.’

Well, guess what! We, too, have in our midst Hot Chocolate…yes, of course, the drink, and a music group, as well.

In fact, Hot Chocolate has been around, in our scene, for over five years.

They describe themselves as a driving force in Sri Lanka’s music scene…with a string of hit songs and electrifying live performances, that has captivated audiences with a unique blend of multiple genres of music.

The name Hot Chocolate, they say, originated from their lead vocalist, Tehan Perera’s unyielding love for the warm, comforting beverage.

Their journey began in 2016, when they started jamming together, crafting original songs that captured the Sri Lankan spirit.

### Stakeholders urge SLPA to ensure minimum safety standards at Colombo Port

*2024-06-03 22:44:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/stakeholders-urge-slpa-to-ensure-minimum-safety-standards-at-colombo-port/) · `en`

Pointing at safety standards recommended by Singapore’s Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB), Sri Lanka’s shipping industry stakeholders urge the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) to ensure minimum safety standards at the Port of Colombo, in order to avoid future catastrophe similar to X-Press Pearl (XP).

The TSIB, which is the air, marine and rail accidents and incidents investigation authority in Singapore, has made several safety recommendations to the SLPA in its final report ‘FIRE ONBOARD X-PRESS PEARL AT COLOMBO ANCHORAGE’, released late last year.

X-Press Pearl, which was carrying several containers of epoxy resin plastics, caused an overwhelming economic, social and environmental impact to Sri Lanka in 2021, as the ship caught on fire and subsequent sinking. The report highlighted the rather limited support of Sri Lankan authorities in diffusing the situation, partially due to the limited firefighting capabilities of the SLPA.

A powerful entity transforms into a vast, harsh body of water, capable of devastating human lives. Despite its cruelty, it embodies the essence of life: breath, birth, emotions, protection, and warmth. Amidst the rain, individuals reflect on their achievements while the innocent, sheltered within the water, remain oblivious to their fate. As time passes, memories of these innocents fade, yet reminders of their existence persist, urging for their release from this oppressive force.

He became a great body of water and cruel enough to turn human lives in the earliest.

Lives of breathing, emergence, feelings, protection, and warm.

In the middle of the rains, everyone looks at what they have earned and carefully carefully.

In the meantime, they are the innocent people who believe in the life of their master about their master.

They are hiding among the waters of the waters of the water and the increasing weight of the water.

There is plenty of information about the innocent innocent.

As the Maha Vanage is gradually, you can forget these dear pets.

Whenever you have all of their belongings, we also do not forget these innocent.

We ask you to be released as you can't take the least.

### Is the future Palestinian government possible?

*2024-06-03 21:21:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185247) · `ta`

The possibility of a future Palestinian government hinges on resolving longstanding conflicts, including border disputes, the status of Jerusalem, and the right of return for refugees. Recent international support, exemplified by European countries recognizing the Palestinian state, underscores the global desire for a peaceful resolution. However, challenges such as Israel's expansion beyond UN-defined borders, the presence of Jewish settlements, and the political implications of evacuating settlers complicate the path to a two-state solution.

🟩

The Hamas Movement on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the war on Israel's continuing war on Gaza has brought back the Palestinian issue in West Asia.. The world sees more countries to give a firm support for a future Palestinian state, with the destruction of a large part of the war Gaza and killed more than 36 thousand of its people.

Recently, three European countries, Spain, Norway and Ireland have recognized the Palestinian state. Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, say that if the Palestinian issue is not resolved, there will never be strict peace in the region. If the crisis is a solution with international recognition, it is a two -state solution.

The brief answer to this question is easy. The two state solution is to divide the land between the historical Balasatinam, the Jordan River to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the West of the Mediterranean.. But the long answer is complicated.

The Central Bank should be urged to unwind its large Treasury bill holdings, depreciate the currency aggressively, and cut the statutory reserve ratio to encourage risk-taking by banks

Many of us were puzzled by the recent monetary policy announcement where the monetary board chose not to lower interest rates, despite inflation being below 5%. When a journalist questioned the Governor about this, asking if they expected inflation to exceed 5% in the latter half of the year, it was like asking if the emperor had any clothes on. The governor’s response was unclear, referencing a dynamic model before deferring to Dr. S. Jegajeevan, head of the Economic Research Department. Dr. Jegajeevan clarified that they do not foresee inflation approaching 5% later this year.

As long as a two-thirds majority in Parliament passes a constitutional amendment or a new constitution and a majority of the People approves the same, are there no limitations to what can be done?

United National Party Secretary Range Bandara’s statement at a media briefing at UNP Headquarters that the terms of the current President and current Parliament should be extended by two years ‘to save the Nation’ has drawn the ire of the people at large, with even the UNP’s ally (for the moment?), the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna distancing itself from the proposal. The essence of the people’s response is that the present Parliament has lost its legitimacy, and President Wickremesinghe has been elected not by the People directly but by that very Parliament for the remainder of the term of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was forced to resign.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will plant 10 lakhs of saplings to substitute for falling trees, state minister for provincial councils and local government Janaka Wakkumbura said.

“On June 5 [world environment day], we plan to implement a program to plant 10 lakhs of plants around the country,” Wakkumbura told reporters on Monday.

This announcement follows State Minister of Defense, Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon’s announcement the same day that 300 trees in Colombo are considered high risk. “Now Environment Day is coming up, and anyone can go plant a tree by the road. We have to take a decision about this. Trees should be suitable for the area. Some trees have roots that spread and damage roads, buildings. When the roots can’t go deep, they tend to topple over.”
