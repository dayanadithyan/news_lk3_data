### Sri Lanka central bank buys US$121mn in July, taking total to US$1.87

*2024-08-19 07:57:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-buys-us121mn-in-july-taking-total-to-us1-87-177150/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has bought 121 million US dollars from banks in July 2024, taking net purchases to 1.87 million US dollars in 2024.

The central bank had to sell dollars on a net basis in June after an ealier spike in unsterilized excess liquidity and credit.

In order to collect reserves permanently the liquidity created from dollar purchases has to be mopped up.

Mopping up prevents domestic investments of the same amount, allowing the central bank to invest the funds abroad as reserves.

Sri Lanka gets about 2.0 billion dollars of current receipts every month, of which about 1.5 billion US dollars are used in imports now. Some money is also used for outward travel and paying bonds.

The central bank can collect reserves from whatever that is saved by recipients of US dollars and is not re-lent to the domestic economy to invest as credit.

In June the central bank had to sell 52 million US dollars on a net basis, amid a spike in credit and exchange rate volatility.

Recently while opening the de-salination plant in eastern Vadamaradchy, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he would commission river for Jaffna project, which Tamils are not going to take seriously. However it is worth examining feasibilty of it. Already there is one river in Jaffna peninsula, Valuki Aru, originating in Alavedy and confluencing at Araly, which in most of the time of the year runs dry. Hence this would be the second.

One of the problem faced by people of Jaffna is the lack of potable and arable water supply. Ground water is the main source for agriculture in Jaffna through lift irrigation from wells, initially manually and now mechanised using pumps. While it is the preferred method for cash crops, rice cultivation is rain fed, where 90% of rain fall is in October to December. Due to excessive use of ground water, wells in some parts have turned brackish.

“…who’s the fairest of them all?” Grimm Brothers (Snow White)

The most iconic moment at Nelson Mandela’s star studded memorial service was a handshake.

As US President Barack Obama ran up to the podium under a light drizzle, a CNN reporter was droning about the extra security arrangements. Suddenly, the excited voice of Christiane Amanpour cut in, shouting, “Castro, he’s shaking hands with Raul Castro.” Mr Obama had paused to shake the hand of the Cuban leader and to share a few words with him.

That simple sign of civility had its decriers, especially on the right wing of the Republican Party. Mr. Obama was accused of being a traitor, of pandering to the enemy, of endangering democracy and American security.

Mingling with one’s opponents on nomination day has become a Sri Lankan norm. 2024 was no exception. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sirithunga Jayasuriya, ideological antipodes of long standing, chatted together amiably.
