Maduro said he signed a resolution presented by regulator Conatel which “has decided to take social network X, formerly known as Twitter, out of circulation for 10 days” and accused Musk of inciting hate, civil war, and death.

The IMF may have their own agendas. But they are in the country because our politicians and officials failed to manage the economy leading it to bankruptcy. Some degree of economic and financial discipline is evident today, thanks to the presence of the IMF. Any proposed renegotiations should be on the basis of even greater discipline, and sustainable discipline, and not pandering to populism.

### Adapting concepts of Islamic Finance to an effective debt restructuring mechanism

Islamic Finance (IF) is based on the Shariah principles which are interpreted via Quran and Sunnah. It is operated currently globally not only in Muslim countries, in other Western and Eastern countries which are based on conventional banking principles. Hence, it is imperative to analyse how the IF can be adopted as a global financial system in order to address most of the current economic hazards in the world.

In Islam, it highly considers that the resources are needed to fulfil the material requirements of both individual and society. The high concern and knowledge on these ethical principles are directed to the personal and societal justice and tranquillity which is the way to the fair financial system. Especially, in the event of handling the distressed customers in the financial institutions, the principles of IF can be successfully adapted.
