When 39 candidates file nominations, only 4 candidates are encouraged.

Can this be done?Meanwhile, it has been announced that a voter can spend 20 rupees in the local government election. But the presidential election has announced that a candidate can spend 109 rupees. That is, 18,500 lakhs of rupees.

### Divisions and polarisation in our society

*2024-08-21 23:12:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/divisions-and-polarisation-in-our-society/) · `en`

Humans are not united as a species. Divisions based on geography, ethnicity, coloir, religion, opinions and other attributes present everywhere dominate the social and political dynamics of the world.

Nobody knows why this happens: a naïve explanation is that birds of the same feather flock together. A person feels more comfortable when he or she associates with people who look similar and think alike. Intolerances of differences leads to social segregation.

Human communities also polarise. Polarisation is the widening separation of a society into two physically unseparated opposing camps based on some identity or belief. The colour, the language spoken and the religion, the political ideology are examples of the former and latter.

Polarisation differs from division. Unlike in division, the polarised parties oppose or confront each other. However, division can be triggered to ensue polarization.

### Anura, Ranil, Sajith: Classism versus elitism

The much anticipated Presidential election next month has created seismic activity in and out of the political arena. While the candidates are focused on winning, those in the periphery, the cohorts and the plutocrats are in a dilemma. The biggest joke is that for most of the sitting Members of Parliament and other politicians it does not matter whether Ranil wins or Sajith wins. Among their selfish and opportunistic agendas, the formidable challenge is to make sure that Anura does not come to power.

Under the NPP government after 21 September 2024, law and order will undoubtedly be relevant and applicable to all, from the president of Sri Lanka to the ordinary people or grassroots. In other words, if the law is violated, due punishment by the law will be ruled. The above will be a massive change in the right direction so people can sense and feel it is becoming part and parcel of life

The country’s people are currently grappling with severe economic problems or challenges, including the escalating cost of living and the repercussions of IMF programs aimed at economic recovery. However, the NPP is committed to addressing these issues, offering hope and optimism for a better future. Indeed, the escalating cost of living is the foremost burning issue for all low- and middle-income households. Given the above, the country witnessed an array of strikes by trade unions, and the Government addressed and resolved the workers’ concerns using tear gas and water cannons

### Election outcomes, best teams: Strategic advantages of political alliances

There were three surprises in Sri Lankan politics in the last week.

The unprecedentedly massive turnout for Sajith Premadasa in Kurunegala, August 16th which was evidence of a quantum leap after his formation of a broad Alliance on August 8th.

The entry into the Alliance campaigning for a Sajith presidency, of Champika Ranawaka, foremost ideologue and figure of the BJP-type Right, together with his compact but proficient group of followers (Karunatne Paranavithana being especially noteworthy).

The rock-star emergence of Namal Rajapaksa, starting outside the Election Commission on August 15th. The SLPP-SLFP ‘barons’ who defected en masse to Ranil, re-formed the UPFA, and entering through a virtual doorway paraded as on a catwalk at a ‘Sri Lanka Can’ signing on August 16th, should be afraid, very afraid. The renegades have no one who generates that type of enthusiasm among their voters. Namal’s vote fractures Ranil’s SLPP-SLFP political prop.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is in the process of finalizing 10 mining companies which have been looking to invest in the island nation’s mining for a long time amid change in the mining regulation, State Investment Minister Dilum Amunugama said.

The Cabinet in August 2023 approved several proposals by President Ranil Wickremesinghe aimed at promoting foreign and local investment in the country’s mineral industry to boost revenues in a sector which has been long dragged by corruption.

The cabinet proposal has changed the earlier mandatory requirement of value addition from the first day of the business.

Instead, the government considers separation of minerals from the deposits as the initial value addition and the licensee could export the minerals either for 24 months or a maximum 30 percent of the grids. The licensee then could put up a value addition plant.
