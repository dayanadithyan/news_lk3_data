Eksath Lanka Podujana Peramuna Presidential candidate Janaka Ratnayake has urged Sri Lankans to make a rational decision at the polls on 21 September, asking them to vote with their minds rather than their hearts. In his address to the nation, Ratnayake emphasised his vision of rebuilding the country, rescuing it from its current economic challenges, and securing a better future for the children of Sri Lanka.

He recalled his time as the Chairperson of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), where he consistently advocated for the underprivileged. He alleged that his removal from this position was orchestrated by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Presidential candidate Namal Rajapaksa, and National People’s Power (NPP) Presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake working together.

However, despite these accusations all NPP MPs led by Dissanayake voted against the motion to remove him when it was brought to Parliament on 24 May 2023.

Airport expansion will soon begin with the appointment of the new contractor

The spirit of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, that is, reconciliation, fairness, and generosity, was eloquently emphasised by J.R. Jayewardene at the momentous occasion of the Peace Conference in 1951, inspired by the great teachings of Lord Buddha, “Hatred ceases not by hatred, but by love…!”

His words were, “We extend to Japan a hand of friendship, and trust that with the closing of this chapter in the history of man the last page of which we write today and with the beginning of the new one, the first page together to enjoy the full dignity of human life in peace and prosperity.”

In its announcement, Fitch Ratings said: “The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch’s belief in CKH’s ability to retain its market share despite increasing competition from imported tyres. It also indicates our expectation CKH will maintain adequate credit metrics and liquidity, even during periods of intensive investment.”

### Finance Ministry on Sri Lanka’s external debt service payments

The objective of the debt standstill was to create some space for Sri Lanka to commence negotiations for restructuring debt in a manner that would enable debt service to resume in the future

The Finance Ministry in a statement said it has observed that there is a perception in society that the prevailing economic stabilisation in Sri Lanka is entirely due to external debt not being serviced, and that once debt service resumes, economic instability will return. It is also unfortunate to note that this same narrative is being used to trivialise and undermine the necessity for the critical macroeconomic reforms that are in fact the actual drivers of economic stabilisation. In this context the Finance Ministry via this statement addresses some of these misperceptions and explains the correct position in this regard to the public.

Is it correct that Sri Lanka does not service any of its foreign debt following the announcement of the debt standstill in April 2022?

Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) has been with the Parliament for about 47 years. Without support from the voters, he became President in 2022 because of his luck. He wants to stay in power, but his leadership is questioned by many, given his performance, particularly over the last two years. Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) has been in the Parliament for about 20 years and was a minister and the Chief Opposition Whip from 2015 to 2018. Both RW and AKD are Presidential candidates. This article is a committed inquiry into the leadership qualities of RW and AKD so that voters can decide who to support to be the next president of Sri Lanka.

### Lasting legacy of a unique politician – M. D. Banda

*2024-09-16 23:01:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/lasting-legacy-of-a-unique-politician-m-d-banda/) · `en`

Fifty years is a long time, enough for most things to fade into obscurity. So, it is truly remarkable that the legacy of the late Mr. M.D. Banda continues to endure, even five decades after his passing on September 18, 1974. In a country where memories are often short-lived, the fact that M.D. Banda’s name is still spoken with respect and admiration is indeed a testament to the profound impact he made on Sri Lanka.

What makes this all the more intriguing is that M.D. Banda was a rare politician, one who actively avoided the limelight and personal glorification. He never put his name on plaques or buildings, nor sought to be immortalized in monuments, despite spearheading countless development projects for the people. His greatness lies not in self-promotion, but in his remarkable deeds.

### Mega scene with Gypsies …Down Under

*2024-09-16 23:00:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/mega-scene-with-gypsies-down-under/) · `en`

The Gypsies is one band that has the ability, and the talent, to cater to the musical tastes of a wide and varied audience and they proved it in a mega way during their recent tour of Australia, taking in Perth, Sydney and Adelaide.

Surprisingly, Melbourne wasn’t included, and that’s a happening place where Sri Lankans are concerned, but leader Piyal Perera has a valid explanation.

“We didn’t take in Melbourne because we were there in February, this year, and we generally like to keep a gap of about one year before we return.”

The concerts in Perth, Sydney and Adelaide were well patronised – in fact, it was ‘sold out’ at all three venues.

On social media, this came up regarding the band’s concert in Perth:

“Sold Out! The Gypsies are ready to bring the house down in Perth on 31st August at the Indian Community Hall! Get ready for an unforgettable night of music and dance. Thank you to all our fans for your incredible support!”

### Doing it in Germany

*2024-09-16 22:54:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/doing-it-in-germany/) · `en`

Kevin Elias has been a musician for many years now, but, I guess, not many music lovers in the scene here would remember Kevin as he left for Switzerland in 1988.

He is now based in Germany and is quite active in the scene there … as a solo artiste, also as a duo and trio, depending on the occasion.

Right now he is doing the duo scene with former Moonstones’ guitarist Anura Herat.

In the past, he had a four-piece band, but the pandemic changed everything.

Hotels and entertainment venues made drastic cuts, where payments to musicians were concerned, with most venues opting for duos, said Kevin, adding that quite a few nightspots, in Germany, have also put up shutters.

“I’m lucky I have work at hotels, and I also perform on a cruise ship, singing German, Spanish, Italian and English songs. I do a show – let’s say a very entertaining performance!”

In Sri Lanka, Kevin performed with several bands, including Super Pink & Purple and Climax, and had his own band, as well – Zodiac.

### How will 1.65 million Muslims vote on Saturday?

90% of the Muslim voters do not want to live under fears of racial riots

Statistically Muslims constitute only 9.3% of the national population. They are a close second to the Sri Lankan Tamil strength of 11.1% according to the 2012 Census. The statistical difference is only 1.8% unlike the figures before the July 1983 racial riots. The anti-Tamil pogrom led to Tamils emigrating from the island in noticeably large numbers. It must be added that Tamil migration increased the statistical percentages of both Sinhala and Muslim population in the country but not their real numbers.

In terms of the real number who are likely to go to polls placed at 75%, the number of votes cast by the Muslims would be around 1.2 million and Tamil votes around 1.4 million. The difference in the number of voters would be only around point 2 million or 200,000! The Upcountry Tamils, the third largest minority, who vote invariably independent of the Sri Lankan Tamils constitute 4.1% of the national population.

### ‘Not all foreign debt repayments halted’: Finance Ministry issues clarification on Sri Lanka’s external debt servicing

Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies has issued a clarification on the country’s external debt service payments in the recent past.

Issuing a statement, the Finance Ministry said it is observed that there is a perception in society that the prevailing economic stabilization in Sri Lanka is entirely due to external debt not being serviced, and that once debt service resumes, economic instability will return.

Furthermore, the ministry mentioned that it is also unfortunate to note that this same narrative is being used to trivialize and undermine the necessity for the critical macroeconomic reforms that are in fact the actual drivers of economic stabilization.

Accordingly, the Finance Ministry clarified that it is incorrect to say that all foreign debt is not being repaid and that the temporary moratorium on selected external debt service that was announced in April 2022 applied to external commercial debt and official bilateral debt.
