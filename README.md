### Sri Lanka keeps policy rates unchanged, CB wants market interest to fall

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka central bank kept its policy rate unchanged at 10 percent in the first monetary policy meeting in 2024 saying market rates should fall further.

The central bank has operated largely deflationary policy (selling down its Treasury bills portfolio against dollar inflows), preventing pressure on the currency and building reserves (running balance of payments surplus).

Over the past month, the exchange rate has appreciated, which may also help offset a 3 percent hike in value added tax in traded commodities, analysts say.

“The Board took note of the effects of the recent developments in taxation and supply-side factors that are likely to pose upside pressures on inflation in the near term,” a statement said.

“However, the Board viewed that the impact of these developments would not materially change the medium-term inflation outlook.”
