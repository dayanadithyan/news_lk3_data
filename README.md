### Sri Lanka Yukthiya operations leading addicts to seek Ayurveda high

ECONOMYNEXT – A shortage of drugs due to the Yukthiya crackdown has led some addicts to look for alternative medicines, State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody said.

“The shortage of pharmaceuticals has led some individuals addicted to drugs to turn to certain alternative medicines within the indigenous medical system, Jayakody said at a press briefing last week.

Sri Lanka allows cannabis to be used in the manufacture of ayurvedic medicine. Raw materials in Ayurvedic medicine include several parts of the cannabis plant, as well as abin (Papaver somniferum Linn), in herbal remedies.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that over-the-counter products available at shops that sell ayurveda products (sinhala beheth) provide varying degrees of relaxation or stimulation.

Jayakody said a written notification has been sent to Public Security Minister Tiran Alles and the Inspector General of Police regarding the challenges faced by the indigenous medical sector due to operation ‘Yukthiya’.

### Taylor Swift’s music back on TikTok after dispute

*2024-04-12 08:40:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Taylor-Swifts-music-back-on-TikTok-after-dispute/108-280638) · `en`

April 12 (BBC) - Taylor Swift's songs are back on TikTok following a dispute that led her label to stop licensing its content to the app.

Her music's return on Thursday comes ahead of the release of her new album, The Tortured Poets Department.

Universal Music pulled songs by its artists in January, including Rihanna and Ariana Grande, citing a licensing dispute.

While many of her songs - including You Belong With Me and Cruel Summer - are again available for users to add to their videos, music belonging to Universal's other artists has still not been relisted.

That may be because unlike other artists, Swift owns the copyright to her music under the terms of a 2018 deal with Universal. Some reports speculated Swift reached a separate deal with TikTok.

"Swifties" - Taylor Swift fans - took to the platform to share their delight at her music returning.

"OMG this made my whole year," wrote verified user Jessica Golich, adding that users would "have the whole new album to play with".

### Vietnamese billionaire sentenced to death for $44bn fraud

*2024-04-12 08:40:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Vietnamese-billionaire-sentenced-to-death-for-44bn-fraud/108-280639) · `en`

Vietnam, April 12 (BBC) - Behind the stately yellow portico of the colonial-era courthouse in Ho Chi Minh City, a 67-year-old Vietnamese property developer was sentenced to death on Thursday for looting one of the country's largest banks over a period of 11 years.

It's a rare verdict - she is one of very few women in Vietnam to be sentenced to death for a white collar crime.

The decision is a reflection of the dizzying scale of the fraud. Truong My Lan was convicted of taking out $44bn (£35bn) in loans from the Saigon Commercial Bank. The verdict requires her to return $27bn, a sum prosecutors said may never be recovered. Some believe the death penalty is the court's way of trying to encourage her to return some of the missing billions.

The habitually secretive communist authorities were uncharacteristically forthright about this case, going into minute detail for the media. They said 2,700 people were summoned to testify, while 10 state prosecutors and around 200 lawyers were involved.

During previous years the NTC had discussions with private bus associations to arrange buses without inconveniencing commuters, he said.

"Earlier, we were advised to assign short-distance buses to long-distance services to meet the demand. But this time no such decision has been taken. Therefore, people have to wait many hours at the bus stand to get their transport facilities", Priyanjith said.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) said that sufficient buses were assigned for people to get to their villages.

### Appropriate moment: Sajith, Tamil party should speak with Anura- Dayan Jayatilaka

*2024-04-12 06:38:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181012) · `ta`

Diplomat Dayan Jayatilaka advises Tamil parties to engage with main rivals, Sajith and Anura, amidst Sinhalese and Buddhist communalism. He suggests against stopping a Tamil general candidate, noting the lack of public support for such a move. Despite the historical tributes by Tamil parties in presidential elections, the current attempt to unite behind a common candidate faces challenges due to differing political tendencies and the absence of unanimity. Jayatilaka emphasizes the importance of addressing long-term issues with Sajith and Anura, drawing parallels with Catalonia and Kurdishland, and advocates for strategic decision-making to leverage the current political climate.

🟩

Diplomatic Dayan Jayatilaka has said that the Tamil parties, Sajith, should carry out talks with the main rivals, as the time when the Sinhalese and Buddhist communalism, which have long been politicized at home, have been appropriate.

He also pointed out that while the political tendency of the Tamils is going on, the attempt to stop a Tamil general candidate will not be appropriate.

He said this while commenting on the Tamil political parties, which are based on the North and East, have taken a public candidate in the upcoming presidential election.

The Tamil people have carried out various tributes in the past in the presidential election. However, the tricks have not received enough reactors to the Tamil people.

Against this backdrop, Tamil political parties are trying to stop a common candidate on their next presidential election.

It is a possible strategy if all parties come forward to work together on this issue.

Real estate tycoon Truong My Lan was sentenced Thursday to death by a court in Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam in the country’s largest financial fraud case ever, state media Vietnam Net said.

The 67-year-old chair of the real estate company Van Thinh Phat was formally charged with fraud amounting to $12.5 billion — nearly 3% of the country’s 2022 GDP.

Lan illegally controlled Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank between 2012 and 2022 and allowed 2,500 loans that resulted in losses of $27 billion to the bank, reported state media VnExpress. The court asked her to compensate the bank $26.9 million.

### Vietnamese tycoon accused in multi-billion dollar bank fraud faces possible death sentence

(BBC) – It is the most spectacular trial ever held in Vietnam, befitting one of the greatest bank frauds the world has ever seen.

Behind the stately yellow portico of the colonial-era courthouse in Ho Chi Minh City, a 67-year-old property developer stands accused of looting one of Vietnam’s largest banks over a period of 11 years.

The numbers involved are dizzying. Truong My Lan is charged with taking out $44bn (£35bn) in loans from the Saigon Commercial Bank. Prosecutors say $27bn may never be recovered.

The habitually secretive communist authorities have been uncharacteristically forthright about this case, going into minute detail for the media. They say they have summoned 2,700 people to testify. There are 10 state prosecutors and around 200 lawyers involved.

The evidence is in 104 boxes weighing a total of six tonnes. Eighty-five defendants are on trial with Truong My Lan, who denies the charges. She and 13 others face a possible death sentence.

ECONOMYNEXT — A civil society activist has lodged a complaint at the Committee to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption against a recent cabinet decision to increase the deposit placed by candidates contesting elections.

Jamuni Kamantha Thushara, Chairman of the Citizen’s Movement Against Fraud, Corruption, and Waste, who filed the complaint, told reporters on Wednesday April 11 that the deposit has been increased by 5,200 percent, which he claimed would give “corrupt” political parties who can afford such exorbitant rates the upper hand.

“With such a high amount, only corrupt political parties that engage in thievery can contest this election. An innocent person who can only manage to pay a small deposit can no longer contest,” said Thushara.

“Only thieving parties will be able to contest elections in the future,” he added.

Thushara also criticised the Commissioner of Elections for his support for the deposit increase citing rising election costs.

### War of words continues between Sri Lanka’s SJB, NPP on debate

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s main opposition the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the leftist NPP are on the warpath over a debate that each keeps challenging the other to but has yet to materialise.

SJB member Bandula Bandarigoda said he believes the NPP has been avoiding the matter because the party has no plan to develop the country.

“We invited the NPP first to a debate at the economic council level. Now they’re saying because it’s a presidential election, their leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake will come. Our leader gladly accepted, but this debate still hasn’t happened as they’re giving various reasons and wasting time. I think it’s because the NPP has no plan to take the country forward,” he said.

NPP member and All Ceylon Farmers Federation Convener Namal Karunaratne scoffed at the suggestion of a debate.
