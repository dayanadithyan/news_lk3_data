Colombo, Feb 26 (Daily Mirror) -  In light of the gravity and complexity of the sequence of events surrounding the recent deaths at the dialysis unit of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital, the Health Ministry is considering expanding the composition of the five-member committee tasked with investigating into the matter, the Daily Mirror learns.

According to a top source, the initial investigations conducted at hospital level have failed to determine the actual cause of deaths prompting the hospital management to request the Health Ministry to conduct a through investigation.

Hence, the Health Ministry appointed a five-member committee headed by Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Samitha Ginige.

However, the source revealed that the composition of the committee may be expanded given the complexity of the scenario.

Furthermore, sources are of the opinion that the incident may have occurred due to the entry of certain unidentified pathogens into the dialysis unit.

### Bangladesh court halts wild elephant adoption

*2024-02-26 10:35:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Bangladesh-court-halts-wild-elephant-adoption/108-277727) · `en`

Dhaka, Feb 26 (AFP) - A Bangladeshi court on Sunday barred the adoption of elephants from the wild, a move hailed by animal rights activists as a "landmark" order to help stop cruelty.

Rights groups said the high court order suspending licences will stop the torture of captive Asian elephants in the name of training.

"The high court today suspended all licences for the captive rearing of elephants," said Amit Das Gupta, deputy attorney general of the country.

Bangladesh was once one of the major homes for Asian elephants.

But poaching and habitat loss saw their number dwindle so much that they are now declared critically endangered in the South Asian country.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says there are nearly 100 captive Asian elephants in Bangladesh, nearly half the amount of elephants left in the wild in the country.

As logging and farming encroach on elephant territory, young animals are captured in the country's northern and southeastern hills.

### Bangladesh court halts wild elephant adoption

*2024-02-26 10:14:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97535/bangladesh-court-halts-wild-elephant-adoption) · `en`

A Bangladeshi court on Sunday barred the adoption of elephants from the wild, a move hailed by animal rights activists as a “landmark” order to help stop cruelty.

Rights groups said the high court order suspending licences will stop the torture of captive Asian elephants in the name of training.

“The high court today suspended all licenses for the captive rearing of elephants,” Amit Das Gupta, deputy attorney general of the country, told AFP.

Bangladesh was once one of the major homes for Asian elephants.

But poaching and habitat loss saw their number dwindle so much that they are now declared critically endangered in the South Asian country.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says there are nearly 100 captive Asian elephants in Bangladesh, nearly half the amount of elephants left in the wild in the country.

As logging and farming encroach on elephant territory, young animals are captured in the country’s northern and southeastern hills.

### Sri Lanka central bank salary hikes show lack of accountability for its actions

*2024-02-26 08:17:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-salary-hikes-show-lack-of-accountability-for-its-actions-152064/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – The steep salary hikes of Sri Lanka’s central bank after the inflation the agency itself created, has drawn public and legislators’ ire, but the deeper problem is that it is yet another sign of the lack of accountability in the new monetary law.

Some legislators are upset that the Parliament’s control of public finances has been usurped by the ‘independent’ central bank.

But Sri Lanka’s central bank has a history of topping up pensions also to cover for inflation  – whether low or high  – while giving low interest loans for staff.

This is questionable because unlike other SOEs, the central bank itself is responsible for cutting rates and driving up inflation and interest rates to stabilize the currency after blowing a hole in the balance of payments.

The practice of transferring billions to defined-benefit pension staff funds when inflation and interest rates are down, can perhaps be excused as a reward for not triggering monetary instability.

As a result, children's education has been hampered and unable to find the necessary costs for food, the fishermen said to the BBC Sinhala service.

Sri Lanka is presently caught up in the middle of a heatwave. The Department of Meteorology had forecast the present spell of dry weather some months earlier. As is usual in our country, other than a few media outlets making passing mention of the forecast, neither the government nor the private sector has made plans to mitigate or counter the effects of the present spell of dry weather.

Even worse, the Meteorology Department authorities too are sending out mixed signals regarding the effects of the ‘heatwave’. On one hand, it warns the public to take protective measures by limiting exposure to the sun, recommends greater intake of liquids (water), etc, while at the same time claiming present conditions are merely statistics on a Heat Index.

### Navalny Died Trying to Politicise the Russians

The sudden, mysterious death of Aleksei Navalny, the charismatic Russian Opposition Leader imprisoned on trumped up charges, came as a shock to many. It’s not totally surprising, however, given the long list of Russians killed by gunmen or by poisoning over the past decade. They all have one thing in common, running afoul of the Kremlin (which is Vladimir Putin) for one reason or another.

The shadowy Yevgeny Prigozhin, Head of the Wagner Mercenary Group (with close ties to Putin) who led an armed rebellion against Putin from Ukraine in June 2023, died in a plane crash with top associates in August 2023.

Little noticed was the murder of Maksim Kuzminov, a Russian helicopter pilot who defected from the fighting in Ukraine. He was shot dead in February this year near Alicante in Spain. Spanish intelligence services accused the Kremlin of orchestrating the killing.

The reason for such mockery aimed at the recent taxes, is the sheer disregard by the government of the two main principles of taxation, namely the fairness (ability to pay) and consistency.

This perception of ‘legalized robbery’ is gaining momentum among the general public especially in the backdrop of the unparalleled financial crisis and sky-rocketing cost of living, while the income of the public has been drastically slashed.

Sri Lanka cannot promote its export sector while having an unproductive tariff structure and restrictions on imports

No country can get out of poverty, or indebtedness without having sustained economic expansion. It is the economic surplus that is produced that will be used to reduce poverty through new investments and repay the creditors without being indebted further. However, growth is necessary but not sufficient to sustain the expansion of an economy. Growth will produce a higher volume of goods and services for consumption by people. But unless the people within the country have purchasing power to buy the same, producers will find that they are saddled with unsold stocks
