“No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” ~ Elanor Roosevelt

In January 2019, former Minister of Sports Harin Fernando appointed Major General Daya Ratnayake as the Chairman of the National Sports Council (NSC), along with 14 executive members, with the goal of uplifting sports in Sri Lanka. At the time, Harin Fernando stated, “As the Minister of Sports, my main focus is to ensure that sports are played clean in the country. Win or lose, playing clean should be the main focus. I want to put a stop to talented youngsters from rural areas being unable to compete and perform due to a lack of basic facilities like a pair of spikes.”

However, in November 2019, Harin Fernando resigned from his ministerial post following the defeat of the UNP candidate in the Presidential election. During the tenure of Harin Fernando and Daya Ratnayake, there was hardly any noteworthy progress in the development of sports generally.

### On the move again… Engleberg-Vienna-London-Mount Lavinia

*2024-07-14 03:43:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/on-the-move-again-engleberg-vienna-london-mount-lavinia/) · `en`

As the Acting Director of the School of Hotel Management at Schiller International University (SIU), my work primarily centred on the London campus. When I received an opportunity to visit the SIU campus in Switzerland, I eagerly accepted. Visiting the quaint Swiss town of Engelberg, with its population of fewer than 3,000, was a delight. Engelberg, located 25 km south of Lake Lucerne in a wide mountain valley at an altitude of around 1,000 meters, is one of Switzerland’s top 10 ski regions. The town’s rustic charm was complemented by its famous Benedictine monastery, founded in 1120 and still active today.

A highlight of my brief visit to Engelberg was meeting Mr. Jorge Müller, a lecturer at SIU. Mr. Müller had been an ILO Expert Maître d’hôtel at the Ceylon Hotel School in 1971 when I was a student. Over three years, he taught me food and beverage service and was always a supportive and kind mentor. Now, in 1990, he was happy to see us as colleagues at SIU.

### Weere, the Blind Scholar, at Peradeniya

*2024-07-14 03:30:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/weere-the-blind-scholar-at-peradeniya/) · `en`

I met Weere (Weerakkody) at Peradeniya University in 1972, when we were final-year students – he was in Western Classics, and I was in Sociology. We were at Arunachalam Hall as resident students. Weere was blind. He knew how many steps he had to walk from his room to the dining room, hall telephone, toilet, and office. Carefully counting his steps, he strolled towards his destination with his white cane. Any interruption to his calculation of steps would make him mad. He then demanded someone to take him back to his room, where he could restart his walk and count the steps. When he went to his classes, church, or Arts Theatre, he depended on a small circle of friends for assistance, and I was one of them.

### Is Biden dishonest about his health problems?

*2024-07-14 03:15:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/is-biden-dishonest-about-his-health-problems/) · `en`

It certainly would be exceptional, if anyone who is lucky enough to live past seven decades, has no medical problems at all. It may happen with holy men practising meditation in the Himalayas or those living in isolated communities shielded from the stresses of the modern world but among only around two percent who survive to be 80, the vast majority would have physical or mental disabilities or both.

Compromised memory was once considered to be an invariable effect of ageing, due to brain cells lost over time being not replaced. But fortunately for us, the old fogeys, scientists have had a rethink. The relatively new concept of neuroplasticity gives us hope and human brain seems to be smarter than scientists thought. It compensates for loss of cells by making new connections. However, minor degrees of cognitive impairment are bound to occur with age, even if there are no physical problems but these could be compensated with minor adjustments and live a normal life.

It has been reported that the Government proposes to introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution for the purpose of bringing Article 83 into conformity with the amendments made by the 19th Amendment to Articles 30(2) and 62(2). Since this proposal is wholly unnecessary, and makes no sense whatsoever in constitutional terms, it may be necessary to look beyond the obvious for some less discernible, perhaps more sinister or Machiavellian objective.

### The beginnings of East West – the Nahil Wijesuriya empire

*2024-07-14 02:31:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-beginnings-of-east-west-the-nahil-wijesuriya-empire/) · `en`

(Excerpted from Simply Nahil: The maverick with the Midas touch)

Regarding his business empire East West, Nahil Wijesuriya explained how he decided on the name of the company. While he was working for P&O Lines based in London, he had been discussing with a friend how difficult it was to send goods from the West to the East.

Then in an eureka moment it dawned on him that the name ‘East West’ would be ideal for an import/export business. This was a time there were restrictions on importing certain items to Sri Lanka with some folks even going to the extent of sending things like Wilkinson blades in aerogrammes to the island.

Meanwhile, Vajira Wijewardena of Anglo Asian, fame was manufacturing blades at his Anglo Asian factory under the brand name ‘Sharp’ and helping fill the dearth in the market. Nahil says of these blades “When you shave one side of your face you need a second blade to shave the other side!”

### Nihal Fernando’s Odyssey in and with Sri Lanka: An Appreciation

*2024-07-14 01:24:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/nihal-fernandos-odyssey-in-and-with-sri-lanka-an-appreciation/) · `en`

There is, on the title page of Nihal Fernando’s ‘Sri Lanka — A Personal Odyssey’ a photograph of a shadow of a man holding what must be a camera. It falls on a wide beach with a set of footprints leading to where the subject, Nihal Fernando himself stands. Beyond them and in the distance is a glimpse of the sea. This is an image that gently nudges me into recognizing Nihal himself, one of the finest men of our time, a great artist, a selfless devotee, his skills indisputable. I do not know who took the picture but it is surely an inspired gesture and helps to illustrate a confession Nihal made on another occasion, in the Prologue to his ‘The Wild, the Free, the Beautiful’: “I do not choose my subjects, they chose me …”

### Capitalizing The Global Commons For Environmental Renewal

The Identification and Mobilization of the Standing Stock in the Global Commons for Planetary Environmental Renewal

The hypothesis that ‘what is unowned is un-marketed, what is un-marketed is under- priced, what is underpriced is mismanaged, overused and wasted’, has provided the underpinning of the market economy. However, a partial recognition of reality has enabled a flawed operation of this dictum causing the environment to become increasingly hostile to living things. A case in point is the ownership of forest lands. Where ownership was exercised, forests were owned by the communities who lived in and around them, unless there was a centralized command system such as organized kingdoms in which case forests were owned by the king. Today the right of such communities has been assumed by governments. Given the present Geopolitik, it is highly unlikely that any nation will surrender a perceived opportunity to exercise ‘ownership’ – Especially if it was a resource.
