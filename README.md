### President hints at vehicle import resumption; importers warn of possible cost increase

*2024-03-15 07:08:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/President-hints-at-vehicle-import-resumption-importers-warn-of-possible-cost-increase/108-278885) ┬╖ `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday hinted at a possible gradual resumption of private vehicle imports starting next year. However, local vehicle importers have warned that this development may not necessarily translate into positive news for buyers.

While the relaxation could breathe new life into the stagnant motor sector, importers have expressed concerns that duty structures for imported vehicles may see a significant increase.

In January, the government revised the duty structure, resulting in a significant rise in vehicle import costs. Despite the potential allowance for vehicle imports, importers caution that substantial restrictions may remain, implying it is too early to celebrate the statement made by the President.

The Vehicle Importers Association of Sri LankaтАЩs survey indicates that local market prices are poised to climb alongside the resumption of imports.

### New expedition to Titanic wreckage could get go-ahead after Titan tragedy

A planned expedition to the resting place of the Titanic could get the go-ahead after plans were scaled back in the aftermath of the fatal Titan implosion last year.

The US government is seeking more information on the revised plans for the expedition, which is scheduled to go ahead in May, Kent Porter, an assistant US attorney, told a federal judge in Virginia on Wednesday

Mr Porter did add that the US has yet not determined whether the new plans would break the law.

RMS Titanic Inc., the Georgia-based company that owns salvage rights to the shipwreck, initially wanted to try and recover freestanding objects inside the vessel, take images inside the shipтАЩs hull and retrieve artefacts from the debris field.

However, the US Government pushed back against the plan by filing a legal challenge in August last year.

### Questions to those questioning Sri LankaтАЩs IMF program

*2024-03-15 06:10:12* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Questions-to-those-questioning-Sri-Lanka-s-IMF-program/4-759512) ┬╖ `en`

There has been a lot of criticism about Sri LankaтАЩs 17th IMF program from people of various backgrounds. They have made all kinds of accusations against the IMF program and criticised it. I agree that the IMF program is not the perfect solution. But the question is, what is the alternative? I am yet to see anyone who has offered a sensible alternative to the IMF.

Sri LankaтАЩs debt is a staggering 128% of GDP and half of it is external debt which is in foreign currency. Sri Lanka could not have repaid its debt if it had not defaulted. The debt has to be restructured. The bilateral creditors and the international sovereign bondholders may not have agreed to restructure Sri LankaтАЩs debt without the IMF. People may point out that Argentina restructured parts of its external debt in 2005 and 2010 without an IMF program. But these are exceptions and nearly a decade later in 2018, Argentina was back again on an IMF program.

### Appointment of a tax ombudsman: The time is apt

Due to the current economic environment, it is understood that tax revenue collection should be enhanced to increase the Tax to GDP ratio. However, the Government should take precaution to ensure this endeavour to enhance tax revenue does not lead to harassment or unfairness to the taxpayer.

There are many knowledgeable tax officers who understand both sides of the fence and act professionally by respecting the Rule of Law and the Taxpayer Rights. However, due to heightened pressure from the Ministry of Finance and Parliamentary Committees one could lose track of respecting the rights of the other party. What is the recourse available to a taxpayer if tax officers transgress the Rule of Law to exercise their power without respecting the legal rights of the taxpayer?

тАЬThe Chamber is concerned about the potential impact on the overall financial market as a result of the cancellation of the parate execution law,тАЭ it said in a statement to the media.

We cannot generate a more critical concept of planning until we take seriously the conflict of interests and ideologies that will inevitably shape any possible recovery for Sri Lanka today

Despite claims of a тАШfree marketтАЩ, the leverage that these actors have over much of the global supply chain means that large swathes of the market are in fact held under a kind of private dictatorship.

### Revitalising Sri Lanka through Social Solidarity Economy

By embracing the principles of the SSE, the nation can chart a course towards a more just, inclusive, and sustainable future

As Sri Lanka grapples with a severe economic crisis, the need for a transformative economic model has never been more apparent. Decades of neoliberal policies since 1977 have left the nation facing rising inequality and vulnerability to global economic shifts. Previous experiments with socialist policies encountered challenges, stifling innovation and individual entrepreneurship. ItтАЩs time for a paradigm shift, and the Social Solidarity Economy (SSE) emerges as a beacon of hope for a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable future.

### Wages of sin latest addition to never ending fiascos at CBSL

It is difficult to find another instance in the history of central banking where the head of that bank with conscienceless audacity abused the constitutional independence of that institution to raise unilaterally the wages of his staff to such a height, between 36 and 79%, and made them an un-imitable elite of officers to be envied by the rest of the community of public servants. This is one of many and multiplying horror stories one hears almost daily from paradise Sri Lanka.

At a time when millions of hard-working heads of ordinary families and parents are found skipping meals or eating smaller portions to feed their children, when 30% of five-year-old children are found malnourished, and when the danger of starvation is knocking at the doors of the poorest, the unconscionable act of munificence by the big chief Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe (NW) fits into the proverbial robbery of Peter to pay Paul. The Central BankтАЩs notoriety continues unabated.

It was reported that the Commissioner General Sepalika Chandrasekara has said that about 1,000 companies have been issued notice by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) to pay up their tax arrears amounting to more than Rs. 160 billion in six months or face seizure of bank accounts and property.

I would like to know from the Commissioner how feasible it is to execute the above decision, if the company resorts to or is faced with any one or more of the following situations:

1. If the bank balance of the company is very low/nil and not substantial enough to recover the tax arrears, or if the money is totally withdrawn before the account is blocked.

2. If the company has taken a huge overdraft and thereby already indebted to the bank

3. If the property has been already mortgaged requiring parate execution

4. If the company deliberately goes into bankruptcy and declares so before seizure by IRD

Ground-breaking initiative uses local newspaper cuttings documenting instances of abuse and harassment against women to mark International WomenтАЩs Day

In a poignant tribute, Ogilvy Sri Lanka, in partnership with Women in Need (WIN), revealed тАШMasterpiece of AbuseтАЩ, an art installation, designed to raise awareness and support for survivors of abuse on International WomenтАЩs Day.

Crafted from local newspaper cuttings documenting instances of abuse and harassment against women, this forsaken art serves as a powerful symbol of the harsh realities faced by women. It stands in stark contrast to the celebratory and empowering messages that often dominate media platforms exclusively on WomenтАЩs Day.

The installation captures the essence of the pervasive issue of abuse experienced by women across the island. By depicting the harsh realities of survivors, it seeks to illuminate the often-overlooked struggles that persist, urging society to confront this pressing issue head-on.

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) in a statement yesterday expressed its deep concern over the increasing number of vacancies in the Superior Courts, which has now reached a critical point that significantly hampers the functionality and the integrity of the justice system.

The statement issued by BASL President Kaushalya Nawaratne PC and Secretary Isuru Balapatabendi also said the following.

The recent retirement of a judge of the Supreme Court has further exacerbated the situation by creating an additional vacancy in the Supreme Court. This comes at a time when there is already an ongoing impasse between the Constitutional Council and the Executive over the appointment to fill an existing vacancy within the same court. The delay in resolving these appointments is not only undermining the efficiency of our appellate courts but also eroding public confidence in the legal systemтА║s ability to deliver timely justice.

Displaced Palestinians gather to collect food donated by a charity before an iftar meal, the breaking of the fast, on the first day of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan in Rafah. AFP

Just as the people sentenced to death are fed their best meal before they are executed, the Gaza StripтАЩs people, in the midst of a deadly famine, are being fed meals sent by the United States before they are slaughtered by Israel. Whatever is sent is not the best. But taste is not an option when survival is at stake.

The United States is completing a pier in the seas off the Gaza coast to send much-denied food aid. Its genocide-committing ally, Israel, also says it is trying to тАЬfloodтАЭ Gaza with aid, unable to withstand mounting international pressure, including some harsh criticism from its hardcore allies. Among them is the European Union, which stands by Israel and stomachs its war crimes with a high tolerance bar that is not seen in its human rights witch hunt against countries like Sri Lanka.

### Sri Lanka look to bounce back in second ODI

Mar. 14 - Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will clash in the second One Day International (ODI) at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattogram, tomorrow.

The visitors would aim to square the series 1-1 after losing the opener by six wickets on Wednesday at the same venue.

Bangladesh chased down their target of 256 runs successfully in the first ODI with Skipper Najmul Shanto and Mushfiqur Rahim getting them home.

It remains to be seen if the series goes into the decider as Sri Lanka will be determined to bounce back.

Defending a subpar target of 256, Sri Lanka did well to reduce Bangladesh to 23 for three but then a pair of partnerships - first between Shanto and Mahmudullah and then Shanto and Mushfiqur - took the game away from the visitors.

They were assisted by the fact that their bowlers had earlier done extremely well to reel the Lankans in after a fast start and eventually bowl them out inside 49 overs.
