Blinken’s visit comes as U.S. President  faces mounting election-year pressure over his stance on the conflict, with his Democratic party starting its national convention on Monday amid pro-Palestinian protests and worries about Muslim and Arab American votes in swing states.

### Why does women not present the presidential election in Sri Lanka with more women's population?

*2024-08-20 06:40:46* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c703r7e38n6o) · `si`

In Sri Lanka, despite having a higher percentage of women in the population, few women participate in presidential elections. This is attributed to historical patterns where only four women have contested, with none winning since 1988. Cultural and societal norms often associate politics with men, discouraging women from entering the field. Additionally, political parties have historically lacked female representation, and when proposed, ideas to include women were met with resistance. Economic challenges and lack of political awareness among women further contribute to the underrepresentation of women in Sri Lanka's presidential elections.

The Elections Commission has decided to reject the gas cylinder objections to Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is contesting as an independent candidate for the presidential election.

Election Commissioner Saman Sridha Ratnayake has responded to allegations made by a political party that the gas cylinder symbol was given to his team in the last local government election.

During the local elections, many demanded the Cass cylinder symbol. The reserved symbols are only for political parties. Others can use anyone.

Therefore, not to give a chance to false things. In response to this, it is false and they are doing so for advertising in the media.
