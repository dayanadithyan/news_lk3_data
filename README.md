Parliament, June 6 (Daily Mirror)- The time allocated for the Parliamentary debate on the Electricity Amendment Bill is to be extended following the requests by Opposition MPs.

The final decision on the extension will be made at the party leaders' meeting to be held at 1pm today.

An uproar was seen earlier in Parliament today when the Opposition wanted more time for¬† the debate on the Electricity Amendment Bill in order to study the amendments and the Supreme Court determination.

The uproar began when MP Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda said the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Power and Energy had given the green light for the legislation subject to amendments.

MP Charitha Herath who responded said a decent space of time should be given to MPs to study the legislation as per Standing Orders 50(2). He said this situation should be taken into consideration.

### Stoinis shines as Australia cruise past Oman in T20 opener

*2024-06-06 10:47:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Stoinis-shines-as-Australia-cruise-past-Oman-in-T20-opener/108-284237) ¬∑ `en`

(Bridgetown) - Marcus Stoinis shone with bat and ball as Australia launched their bid for a grand slam of major cricket titles with a 39-run victory over Oman at the T20 World Cup in Barbados on Wednesday.

Stoinis smashed a game-changing 67 not out off just 36 balls to power Australia to 164-5 and then took three wickets for 19 runs as Oman were restricted to 125-9 in reply at Kensington Oval.

"It was a nice start," player of the match Stoinis said afterwards. "Maybe a few cobwebs for us but we're better for it, and nice that we got the win.

"And nice that I got to spend some time in the middle and have a bit of a bowl."

Stoinis hammered six sixes and two fours during a swashbuckling batting performance that led Australia's recovery after they had slumped to 50-3 earlier in the innings.

### Lack of modern equipment prevented accurate forecast of inclement weather

Lack of proper equipment prevented accurate forecast of the recent inclement weather conditions, geologist Professor Athula Senaratne said yesterday.

‚ÄúIt would have been possible to issue prior warning of 400mm rains which some parts of the nation experienced during the past few days if the necessary equipment was available,‚Äù Professor Senaratne told journalists in Kandy.

He also said Sri Lanka does not have proper equipment to measure rainfall.

Colombo, June 6 (Daily Mirror) - In another landmark judgment pertaining to the scope of the pardon granted by the executive President, the Supreme Court today ruled that former President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to grant a Presidential pardon to to Royal Park murder convict Don Shamantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha is arbitrary and not valid in law.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justices S. Thurairaja, Yasantha Kodagoda and Janak de Silva ordered to set aside two Presidential pardons granted to Shamantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha for not following the Constitutional provisions.

The Supreme Court declared that former President Maithripala Sirisena violated the Fundamental Rights of the petitioner and public trust doctrine while granting presidential pardon to the above mentioned respondent.

"We have submitted our proposal to the government, outlining how this issue should be resolved. We have received minimal agreement for our demands so far. If we receive approval for our demands through the Finance Ministry or the Cabinet, we may call off the ongoing strike," Priyantha said.

Against the backdrop of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing on May 30, significant meetings took place between Chinese President and a number of top¬†Arab leaders

China‚Äôs real aim was to further strengthen its economic ties with the Arab world, which are already strong

Another advantage that the Chinese have in the Arab world is that they do not point to human rights violations in the Arab countries; and the Arab countries in turn remain silent about the persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang

China‚Äôs strengths in the Arab world are its economic heft, willingness to take up expensive infrastructure projects, non-interference in internal affairs, and the declining political credibility of the US in the Middle East. But the impediments in China‚Äôs way are the West‚Äôs technological superiority, the unassailable position of the dollar, and transparency characteristic of Western systems.

Sri Lankans are easily attracted to the lifestyle of successful individuals, but rarely do they wish to put in long hours to emulate those feats. Here some fishermen are seen engaging in the perplexing task of checking their nets; an activity which is a must to ensure a large catch at sea

Few common factors are found when analysing careers of politicians and artistes; the present generation engaged in these two professions are all out to earn maximum money during their careers

There are so many performing artistes who took to politics; some of them were in parliament till very recently, but most of them failed to make any impact in the field of politics

A politician‚Äôs ‚Äòlife‚Äô is often hectic. It has to be; because he has to serve the people who elected him to office. But we also see the ‚Äòlifestyles‚Äô they live and often envy them. Talk about our lawmakers having hectic lives, there are some who are the opposite, are lazy and not worth the salaries they earn.

### Should The Economic Transformation Bill Proceed?

*2024-06-05 22:56:24* ¬∑ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/should-the-economic-transformation-bill-proceed/) ¬∑ `en`

Given the pivotal role of debt restructuring in the Economic Transformation Bill (ETB), the debt-to-GDP ratio may not remain below 95% by 2032 and reach an optimal level of 60% by 2048. This uncertainty also extends to the gross financing needs, which may not stay below 13%. While a 5% increase by 2027 seems feasible regarding GDP growth, it is uncertain if it will continue to exceed 5% after 2027. The ETB does not clearly outline the necessary economic growth to achieve Advanced Economic Status by 2048. This is a crucial factor in determining investment and welfare and, ultimately, improving the well-being of the people. A clear and comprehensive economic policy framework is necessary, rather than relying on arbitrary targets or a legal framework.¬† Based on the current US$ 4000 per capita income in Sri Lanka, achieving Advanced Economic Status by 2048 without such a framework seems highly improbable.

### Historic Crimes Of The Chauvinistic Left: Struggle For Far Sighted Marxist Position

I was one of the boys in the car that made its way to the Palali airport in the middle of the night. The other is my brother. It‚Äôs unimaginable now what must have been going through my aunt‚Äôs mind as she sat in the car with us, making our way to Palali airport in the dead of night. My brother and I, just fourteen at the time, couldn‚Äôt comprehend the gravity of the situation. We never had the chance to discuss it further with her, as our time together was cut short. Soon after we left the country, despite her illness, Akila threw herself fully into the local administrative work under the control of the LTTE. At times, she worked with Thamilselvan, the leader of LTTE‚Äôs political wing, who was killed by the Sri Lankan army in 2007 in a targeted airstrike. Akila also succumbed to her illness, which deteriorated mainly due to the demands of her work, requiring extensive travel across the North.

*2024-06-05 21:56:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185406) ¬∑ `ta`

Imtiaz Pakir Makar urges immediate action to address the longstanding teacher shortages in the Beruwala Education constituency, highlighting critical vacancies in mathematics, science, and English teaching positions that have persisted for over a decade. The situation impacts student exam readiness and reflects broader issues within the Kalutara Education Zone, affecting both the quality of education and teacher morale.

üü©

The long -standing teacher vacancies for high -quality classes in the Kalutara Educational Zone are still not filled. Opposition member Imtiaz Pakir Makar said that the teacher should take immediate steps to fill the vacancies in this regard.

He said this while addressing the debate on the issue of the country's educational activities in Parliament on Wednesday (5).

When the Minister has repeatedly responded to the lack of a massive Asian Zone from the Kalutara Education Zone, there is no response to the function.. There is a shortage of teachers in the Beruwalai constituency in the Kalutara Education Zone alone. That is, there are no 36 people where there should be a hundred.

Mathematics and Science Graduate Teacher Vacancies are found in the Beruwalai constituency. This teacher has been in shortage for 10, 12 years. If so, how can these students face exams?I urge the Minister to search for this.
