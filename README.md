Colombo, March 10 (Daily Mirror) - Deputy Director of the National Hospital, Colombo and Government Medical Officers' Forum (GMOF) president, Dr. Rukshan Bellana, claimed that in recent weeks, the police have been arresting fresh medical graduates who were practicing under the supervision of registered doctors while failing to apprehend quack doctors who claimed to be unlicensed practitioners.

He told the Daily Mirror that quack doctors are unqualified, unregistered medical practitioners practicing Allopathic medicine and Ayurvedic, Homoeopathy and indigenous medicines.

"Most of the fresh medical graduates usually practice under a licenced doctor until they get their government appointments. It is not illegal to serve like that because the fresh medical graduates can earn some money and experience before getting their licences. The medical graduates do not working as independent doctors, but under a registered doctor who is the responsible person," he said.

Opponents argued that the wording of the changes was poorly thought out ‚Äî an argument that appeared to have gained traction in the final days of the campaign. Voters said they were confused by the questions and others said they feared changes would lead to unintended consequences.

A sensational hat-trick by pace bowler Nuwan Thushara rattled Bangladesh top order as the hosts were handed a defeat of 28 runs by Sri Lanka in the third and decisive match of the three-match T20 series in Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Saturday.

Chasing a target of 175, Bangladesh found themselves reeling at 24 for 5 inside fourth over, courtesy of a fiery hat-trick by pacer Nuwan Thushara who was only playing his eight T20 match. If not for a spectacular rearguard charge by Rishad Hossain and Taskin Ahmed, Bangladesh‚Äôs defeat was bound to be a massive one.

Thushara sent shockwaves through the Bangladeshi camp as he rattled the stumps of both Najmul Hossain Shanto and Tawhid Hridoy in fourth over and his first. He then dismissed the seasoned Mahmudullah plumb in front of the wicket, leaving Bangladesh in complete disarray, and picking up his hat-trick as the fifth Sri Lankan bowler in the T20 format.

Shortly after the announcement of the new chairmen for the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA), there was a surge of criticism on social media regarding the appointment of Kalutara District SLPP MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena as the head of COPE.

Both chairmen were elected to their positions, and the SLPP, with its majority representation in the committees reflecting that of the parliament, was able to secure the election of their candidates. The election of COPA chairman MP Lasantha Alagiyawanna didn‚Äôt spark as much controversy, as he had previously held the position. However, Abeygunawardena‚Äôs appointment drew significant backlash, with many questioning his qualifications to lead a parliamentary watchdog committee.

### Nuwan Thushara takes hat-trick in third Bangladesh T20I

Nuwan Thushara became the fifth Sri Lankan to take a hat-trick in T20I cricket, as he made early breakthroughs to cripple Bangladesh's run chase in the third T20I in Sylhet.

Thushara, bowling his first over in the series, removed Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, Towhid Hridoy and Mahmadullah -- all deceived by his sling arm action -- to reduce the home team to 15 for 4, chasing a target of 175.

Thushara broke through Shanto's defence and castled the stumps with the second ball of the over, before uprooting the off stump to dismiss Hridoy on the next delivery.

He then completed the hat-trick of wickets when he trapped Mahmadullah leg before wicket, the decision being upheld despite the batsmen's review.

Thushara joins Thisara Perera, Lasith Malinga, Akila Dananjaya and Wanindu Hasaranga as the only Sri Lankans to take a hat-trick in the T20I format.
