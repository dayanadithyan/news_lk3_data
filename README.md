### A System Change

*2024-06-19 10:28:47* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/a-system-change/) · `en`

It was the principle slogan of the Aragalaya that there was a need for a System Change. The dominant theme and cry was for “Political Change” from the prevailing one, which after 75 years of operation, has failed. What then is the kind of change that was wanted? There may be many examples of changes that may occur to any who ponder this issue. The strident cry was “Chase out all 225.” Nothing could be clearer than that. The political establishment reacted with brutality. First, from “Temple Trees” and then from the newly installed Presidency, barely hours after Mr Wickremasinghe took over.

Several institutions, conventions and practices demand critical review. Mere cosmetic changes will no longer suffice, and radical changes are emphatically needed. We describe ourselves as a “Democratic, Socialist Republic.” Are we so?

Abraham Lincoln’s definition of Democracy as the “Rule of the people, by the people for the people,” I regarded as the bedrock of democracy.
