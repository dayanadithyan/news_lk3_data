### Oil falls as US recession fears offset Mideast tensions

Oil prices fell on Monday as fears of a recession in the United States, the world‚Äôs top oil consumer, offset concerns that escalating tensions in the Middle East may affect supplies from the largest producing region.

Brent crude futures inched down 4 cents, or 0.1%, to $76.77 a barrel by 0035 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $73.39 a barrel, down 13 cents, or 0.2%.

Prices were supported by persistent fighting in Gaza with an Israeli airstrike hitting two schools and killing at least 30 people on Sunday, Palestinian officials said, the day after a round of talks in Cairo ended without result.

Israel and the United States are bracing for a serious escalation in the region after Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah pledged to retaliate against Israel for the killings of Hamas‚Äô leader Ismail Haniyeh and Fuad Shukr, a top military commander from Lebanese armed group Hezbollah last week.

The US presidential election, the campaign for which has been going on forever, is scheduled for November 5, the canonical Tuesday after the first Monday of November. To continue where I left last week, Kamala Harris is till riding high, and Donald Trump is finally being exposed for his crass limitations. But with 94 days to go there is plenty of time left for twists and turns, and ups and downs.

### Monster assembled from human flaws? Frankenstein would make a Trump

*2024-08-05 10:57:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/monster-assembled-from-human-flaws-frankenstein-would-make-a-trump/) ¬∑ `en`

Someone asked ‚ÄúWhy do some British people not like Donald Trump?‚Äù Nate White, an articulate and witty writer from England wrote the following response:A few things spring to mind. Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace ‚Äì all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.

So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump‚Äôs limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.

Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing ‚Äì not once, ever.

I don‚Äôt say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility ‚Äì for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.
