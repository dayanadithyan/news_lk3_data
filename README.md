Funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the project was suspended in 2022 until Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring was finalized.

The construction of the second terminal of the airport started in 2020 at a cost of Rs. 145 billion under the ‘JICA’ soft loan scheme.

After Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy due to the economic crisis, the concessional loan programme given by ‘JICA’ for the second terminal project had also been halted.

### Eliminating political corruption: Key to our recovery

Sri Lanka is grappling with a severe cost-of-living crisis rooted in pervasive political corruption. Political intermediaries profit at every stage, shifting the burden onto consumers. The economy has plummeted due to corrupt leaders using the Government to further personal agendas and misusing public funds on unproductive projects while simultaneously selling national assets and depleting public reserves. Under such deceptive governance, our future hard work and increased taxes will be in vain, offering no relief to ordinary citizens as corrupt politicians continue to siphon off surplus funds.

To put things in perspective. Figures from widely reported independent sources indicate, as of today, the number of Palestinians – Muslims, Christians and others – killed total to 37,000. Of this, the number of children killed are 13,800. The total number injured is 75,000 and the attacks are continuing.

More than at any time in the past those in whose hands lies the power to choose their leaders will also decide their own futures and that of their children – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

There has never been as important a period in the history of Sri Lanka as will be the next few months. The country is still reeling under the financial and economic battering of two years ago. As per the latest statistics the country’s debt burden has ticked over the $ 100 billion mark – including the backlog of interest. Meanwhile, a deceptive sense of calm and even spots of prosperity – for some – seem to prevail on the surface disguising strong undercurrents of turmoil.

This turmoil is more than just a single facet. One could debate which of them is worse but the combination is a deadly cocktail which unless mitigated has the potential to cripple the country and the lives of its citizens for decades to come. Yet, the solution to this complex situation lies – literally – in the hands of the stakeholders.
