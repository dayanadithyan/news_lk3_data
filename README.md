May 21 (AFP) - Mitchell Starc struck three early blows to help Kolkata Knight Riders storm into the IPL final with a eight-wicket thrashing of Sunrisers Hyderabad in Ahmedabad's searing heat on Tuesday.

Two-time champions Kolkata bowled out Hyderabad for 159 as Starc returned figures of 3-34 in the first play-off - qualifier 1 - at the world's biggest cricket stadium.

Starc, a left-arm quick, once again justified his price tag from the December auction after he became the most expensive buy in IPL history when Kolkata got him for $2.98 million.

The figure quickly broke a record after Hyderabad brought Pat Cummins for $2.5 million in the same auction and later made him captain.

Venkatesh Iyer, on 51, and skipper Shreyas Iyer, on 58, remained unbeaten in Ahmedabad as Kolkata achieved their target with 38 balls to spare.

Hyderabad will have another shot at making the final when they clash with the winner of the eliminator in the second qualifier on Friday in Chennai.

### Asian Series Rout Championship: 4 x 400m for men. Gold to Sri Lanka in the series

*2024-05-21 20:10:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184173) · `ta`

In the inaugural Asian Series Championship, Sri Lanka clinched the gold in the men's 4x400m event, clocking 3:04.48. The team consisted of Aruna Darshana, Hunger Lakshan Kodikara, Dinukka Deshan, and Kalinga Kumarake. Despite missing out on direct Olympic qualification, a win in future series could secure them a spot based on rankings. India took silver (3:05.76), and Vietnam bronze (3:07.37).

🟩

Sri Lankan team won the gold medal in the men's 4 x 400m series in the inaugural Asian series championship, which ended on Tuesday (21) in Bangladesh, Thailand.

Sri Lanka won the gold medal in India, Vietnam, Qatar, the Philippines, Thailand and Chinese Breasty.

The Sri Lankan team won the gold medal in the men's 4 x 400m race in 3 minutes and 04.48 seconds.

Aruna Darshana, Hunger Lakshan Kodikara, Dinukka Deshan and Kalinga Kumarake were featured in the Sri Lankan series.

However, it is disappointing that the Sri Lankan team missed the directory level for the direct Olympic qualification.

However, if the Sri Lankan team wins the next series of matches, it is believed that the Sri Lankan series will be able to participate in the Olympics based on international rankings.

India (3: 05.76) won the silver medal and Vietnam (3: 07.37) won the bronze medal.

### Matheesha Pathirana becomes most expensive player in LPL history

Young Sri Lankan fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana became the most expensive player ever in a Lanka Premier League (LPL) auction Tuesday when he was grabbed by Colombo Strikers for a record $120,000.

The 21-year-old – who has an unorthodox slinging delivery style – broke the $92,000 mark set by Dilshan Madushanka in last year’s edition of the T20 tournament.

Colombo Strikers bought Pathirana after matching Galle Marvels’ bid with their Right To Match option.

In an interesting turn of events, the Dambulla franchise began the bidding at USD 70,000 after Matheesha Pahitrana entered the bidding at his base price of USD 50,000.

However, Galle Marvels raised the stakes and took it to USD 100,000 straightaway. To avoid retention from Colombo Srikers, Galle even increased their own bid to USD 120,000 but their effort went in vain.

The State Minister also said that the government has decided to incorporate a Skills or Professional stream into the G.C.E (Ordinary Level) Examination syllabus to promote social empowerment.

He made these remarks during a media briefing under the theme “Collective Path to a Stable Country” held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today.

ECONOMYNEXT – A new report from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recommended targeted sanctions on officials responsible for disappearances in Sri Lanka since 1970 and has called for justice outside the country for the families of victims.

Released last week, just before the 15th anniversary of the war’s end and four months ahead of the next UN human rights session where Sri Lanka is likely to face a new resolution, the report has sparked significant attention from rights groups.

The report, titled “Accountability for Enforced Disappearances in Sri Lanka,” urged justice for all Sri Lankan ethnic groups, including Sinhalese and Muslims, during the war and other insurrections, rather than focusing solely on ethnic minority Tamils as in the past.

### Reflections On Solar Consciousness & Unity: A Message For Vesak Day 2024

*2024-05-21 18:30:25* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/reflections-on-solar-consciousness-unity-a-message-for-vesak-day-2024/) · `en`

As we celebrate Vesak Day on May 23, 2024, reflecting on the recent past, notably April 14, offers us a profound connection to our cultural and spiritual heritage. This day, commemorated by Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka and by many others across India and other countries, marks the Solar New Year, when the Sun transitions from Pisces to Aries. This celestial shift is deeply rooted in the concept of solar consciousness, a vital element in the ancient traditions of Sri Lanka.

The significance of Rāvanā in the context of solar consciousness cannot be overstated. Seen as the last of the ancient solar beings, Rāvanā’s name itself, deriving from ‘Rā,’ connects him to the Sun, symbolizing his divine origin and his influence on the region’s mythological history. The celebration of the Solar New Year on April 14 ties back to these narratives, emphasizing rebirth and renewal, themes that are equally relevant as we observe Vesak.
