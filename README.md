### Sri Lanka private credit, excess liquidity up in May , state credit down

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s private credit expanded 60.7 billion rupees in May 2024, reversing a contraction in April, while credit to state enterprises were flat, official data showed.

Sri Lanka’s private credit has expanded only 71 billion rupees over the first five months of May 2024, amid low inflation and easing import prices, as well as stable exchange rate, which may lead to importers using supplier’s credit.

Domestic demand is just starting to pick up amid low or falling inflation, with some private sector salaries increased – which is seen in PAYE tax receipts – which will eventually lead to a recovery in consumption and later to investments in capacity expansion.

Though the central bank has not cut rates with inflationary operations up to May, excess liquidity built up to around 200 billion rupees by the end of the month from dollar purchases.
