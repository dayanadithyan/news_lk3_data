ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Fitch Ratings said it was confirming an A-(lka) rating on Sri Lanka‚Äôs National Development Bank Plc with a Stable outlook, amid an improvement in operating environment, indicated by headline macroeconomic indicators.

Fitch said it expects Sri Lanka‚Äôs stabilising macroeconomic environment to support NDB‚Äôs ability to generate and defend business volumes, but its business profile remains constrained by risks in the domestic operating environment which are still elevated.

‚ÄúWe expect NDB to benefit from the resumption in lending, albeit modest, thereby leading to an uptick in the share of net loans in total assets (end-1Q24: 57.5%), similar to peers.‚Äù

NDB‚Äôs risk profil remains tied to the credit and market risk of the sovereign, through its substantial exposure via the defaulted foreign-currency-denominated sovereign bonds (end-2023: 6.5% of assets) and a further 25.6% of assets in rupee-denominated treasury securities, the rating agency said.

The opposition to privatisation in Sri Lanka stems from a mixture of ideology and vested interests.

The continuing lack of a political leadership in the Sinhala South that accepts the Tamil and Muslim people as equals and as citizens with equal rights and dignity, is what denies a decent political solution to the TNQ

The Sinhala South and its leaders cannot for a moment leave all responsibility with Tamil leaders for all these sectarian and extremist developments that make solutions more and more difficult. Political leaders in Sinhala South even now avoid discussing political answers to post-war issues in North-East and for their long-standing issue of sharing political power. Everything belted out on Southern Sinhala political platforms are issues for Sinhala-Buddhist consumption, no different to Sinhala-Buddhist politics of Black July, 41 years ago. No political leader in the South can be heard here in the South saying his or her political party would negotiate power sharing for Sri Lanka with Tamil and Muslim political parties

A reconciled society respects and champions the rights of all citizens. Identifying issues that need to be addressed when working towards reconciliation becomes crucial. Achieving a just, equitable society requires equal life opportunities for all, regardless of anyone‚Äôs background.Effective reconciliation demands enlightened leaders addressing past crimes and rights violations. It transcends political classes, requiring genuine commitment

In Sri Lanka, fear is pervasive. Suppression of media and fundamental rights of people and repression of human rights defenders foster a climate of fear, silencing victims, and inhibiting reconciliation. Political and criminal interests threaten the justice system, putting lives at risk for exposing the truth.

### How is the black money of the sudden bear?

*2024-07-25 01:53:46* ¬∑ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/cldy1p1egx1o) ¬∑ `si`

Black money, earned from illicit activities like drugs, terrorism, and gambling, poses significant challenges to economies worldwide due to its impact on financial systems and economic stability. Money laundering, a method to legitimize these funds, distorts economic indicators, undermines tax revenues, and creates unfair competition in markets. Countries like Sri Lanka combat this through legislation, including the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (No. 5 of 2006) and the Terrorism (Prevention, Prohibition, Suppression and Control) Act (No. 25 of 2005), imposing hefty fines and long prison sentences for offenders. Despite efforts, the issue remains critical, affecting societal trust and economic growth.
