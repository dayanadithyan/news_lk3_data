### Religious freedom of minorities in Sri Lanka - US Commission on international religious freedom

*2024-05-23 01:00:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184268) ¬∑ `ta`

The US Commission on International Religious Freedom reports that religious freedom in Sri Lanka remains compromised, with ongoing violence against religious minorities like Tamil Catholics, Hindus, and Muslims. Despite constitutional guarantees, state actions favoring Buddhism over other religions have led to tensions and unrest. Recent efforts to seize religious sites, especially in the Northern and Eastern provinces, have exacerbated concerns. The commission's findings suggest that Sri Lanka's treatment of religious minorities warrants further scrutiny and potential inclusion on a watchlist for religious freedom violations.

Sri Lanka did witness the grooming of two individuals in politics: Executive President J.R. Jayewardene groomed Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake, but destiny didn‚Äôt support either of them; they were both assassinated

Even in the present political set-up, we see offspring of old politicians already in the system and nurturing political ambitions, where one senior stalwart in politics is often heard saying: ‚ÄúMy son will have to wait. He has some time to get there‚Äù

Sri Lanka is a country which believed in electing to Parliament individuals with unproven track records and later repented their actions. This is because this nation doesn‚Äôt have a system in present day politics where the senior lawmakers hand over the baton to the next generation of budding lawmakers.
