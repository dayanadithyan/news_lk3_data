The public had a negative opinion of all leading Presidential candidates, but A.K. Dissanayake had the least negative rating.

In IHP SLOTS polling for August 2024, the net favourability rating of SJB leader Sajith Premadasa improved to -32 (+10 points compared to July). Meanwhile, NPP/JVP leader A.K. Dissanayake and President Ranil Wickremesinghe saw their favourability ratings drop to -21 (-16 points) and -33 (-4 points) respectively. The favourability rating of Namal Rajapaksa, the SLPP Presidential Election candidate, was -89 in August.

Favourability estimates for each month are based on 100–500 interviews conducted during that month and a few weeks before and after, ensuring a minimum set of responses for key party leaders. The August 2024 estimates are based on 517 interviews for Sajith Premadasa, 491 for A.K. Dissanayake, 530 for Ranil Wickremesinghe, 639 for Namal Rajapaksa, and 384 for Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

### Second preference vote is second round in Presidential election

*2024-09-14 00:45:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Second-preference-vote-is-second-round-in-Presidential-election/4-766737) · `en`

It may be important to pay attention to the second and third preferences in the current Presidential election, which seems to be a three-way battle

Presidential elections of most major democracies are held using two-round systems. It is a more democratic variant of the one-round first-past-the-post systems. Even in a two-round system, if a candidate gets more than 50% of the votes in the first round, there is no need for a second round. If no one gets more than 50%, only the first and second candidates will qualify for the second round.

Sri Lanka’s presidential election system is a unique one. It seems to be a composite of three systems that are currently used internationally to make the first-past-the-post systems more democratic. The three methods are – Supplementary Vote, Ranked Choice and Two-Round methods. For now, I think it’s more practical for us to think of our system as a variant of a two-round system.

### Yes, future of SL and its people was in our hands to shape for as long as 75 years

We have a challenging journey ahead, let us be alert, positive, proactive, and constructive, for this, is our only home

Following is a reproduction of a post on LinkedIn by the author about 18 months ago on the occasion of Sri Lanka’s 75th independence on 4 February 2023

Yes *“We did not focus on sustainable social responsiveness and thus there is dissent. We were not sincere and purposeful regarding interreligious, inter-communal, interracial harmony, resulting in intellectual capital flight – brain drain. There are many grievances among those who remained onshore. Reparations, Compensation, genuine initiatives towards National Harmony, are now a National Imperative.”*

It is unwise, insensitive and indeed incomplete to say, as some say rather dismissively, that we have not created, neither built, nor established anything since we gained independence.

### Far horizons

*2024-09-14 00:41:15* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Far-horizons/4-766734) · `en`

In the Presidential election to be held in a few days, this country faces its first test of public opinion since the Aragalaya

“There was one daily newspaper in the Ivory Coast, at least, only one came my way. It was called Fraternite’ Matin. Every day on its front page, in the top left-hand corner, it carried a ‘thought’ of the President’s. The thoughts were mainly about development and the economy; and so were big front-page stories”

Of all the extra-parliamentary convulsions that have happened all too regularly in this country since independence, the mass protest movement which occurred two years ago, commonly referred to as the ‘Aragalaya’ (struggle), is certainly unique.

### Pelwatte and Sevenagala sugar distilleries – economic disaster

Pelwatte and Sevenagala sugar factories are supposed to carry a stock of 1.3 million litres unable to sell

A friend had sent me an extract of a statement made by State Minister for Investment Promotion Dilum Amunugama titled ‘Sri Lanka state sugar firms drowned in unsold ethanol’.

The two sugar firms referred to are Pelwatte and Sevenagala sugar factories. They are supposed to carry a stock of 1.3 million litres unable to sell.

He attributes this problem to the economic crisis and tax hikes.

In 1968 I took over as Distillery Manager at the then Government-owned distillery at the Kantale Sugar Factory. That is the reason for my friend to refer this to me to comment.

### The race is not to the swift, nor neo-racism to the slick

We can only trust and hope that an electorate that has repeatedly suffered from the fallout of racial politicking that burned towns and cremated the dead against their religious convictions has learned the lessons of history and won’t provoke the fates by any attempt to repeat the same – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The Sihala Urumaya (SU) was formed in April 2000 on the basis that while Tamils and Muslims demonstrably had political parties to safeguard their interests, the majority community suffered from a lacuna in this regard. But the SU may have conveniently – or cynically – overlooked how the United National Party (UNP) as well as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) openly catered primarily to the wellbeing of the island’s Sinhalese Buddhists, and arguably shared the dubious honour of pioneering ‘political Buddhism’

Are 17.1 million voters ready to entrust the destinies of this nation to a convict who has violated the fundamental rights of the people of this country, for the next five years? – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The simple question that comes to the mind of any fair minded reader is that did all these help and assistance by the Indian government, the IMF, the WHO, the World Bank and various other friendly countries like China and Japan come only because of RW? What a joke. What an insult to these countries and global organisations. They were offered for the people of Sri Lanka, not to the President. Besides all the loans obtained by Sri Lanka have to be repaid by the people of this country with interest after all. Even if Battaramulle Seelarathana Thera was the president at this difficult time, those creditors and international establishments would have given this assistance to Sri Lanka

“We will make sure there is justice and fairness,” Premadasa said in an interview in his Colombo office. “The burden should be shared by the super rich, not the working class poor.”
