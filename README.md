### Elon Musk’s Neuralink implants brain chip in first human

*2024-01-30 11:06:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Elon-Musks-Neuralink-implants-brain-chip-in-first-human/108-275964) · `en`

Jan 30 (Reuters) - The first human patient has received an implant from brain-chip startup Neuralink on Sunday and is recovering well, the company's billionaire founder Elon Musk said.

"Initial results show promising neuron spike detection," Musk said in a post on the social media platform X on Monday.

Spikes are activity by neurons, which the National Institute of Health describes as cells that use electrical and chemical signals to send information around the brain and to the body.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had given the company clearance last year to conduct its first trial to test its implant on humans, a critical milestone in the startup's ambitions to help patients overcome paralysis and a host of neurological conditions.

In September, Neuralink said it received approval for recruitment for the human trial.

Consequently, the Sri Lanka Navy informed the joint maritime force, consisting of 40 countries located in Bahrain, to investigate the missing vessel. The Seychelles Coast Guard initiated a special operation to locate the "Lorenzo Putha 4," successfully finding the vessel in the possession of Somali pirates.

### Is a “production economy” the solution?

*2024-01-30 00:07:59* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Is-a-production-economy-the-solution/4-757912) · `en`

Is the Government capable of identifying what we should produce for export? Isn’t it better to leave that to the entrepreneurs? What can the Government do? Remove whatever barriers enterprises face. If information gaps exist, help bridge them. But in many cases the most helpful thing Government can do is to improve infrastructure services

Every few years, Sri Lanka’s weakness in manufacturing comes up as the cause of our economic malaise. Economic growth through services is not real, they argue. In the most recent iteration, the slogan is that of a production economy, code for manufacturing.

### Politics without substance or substance without politics? People have a choice

It will be interesting to make an assessment of what Sri Lankan leaders have been demonstrating vis a vis the ideals and objectives of the World Economic Forum

Sri Lankans need to be told the truth by all political parties. Their credibility will hinge on this. Solutions to address this truth might be different, but they need to be based on the true situation the country is in. What is the true situation? It is that the country is in debt to the hilt, its current GDP growth would not allow it to repay the debts, and if they are not honoured, the country will not be able to borrow any more even for development work, let alone for consumption

The Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum for the year 2024 is held from 15-19 January in Davos, Switzerland, under the theme ‘Rebuilding Trust’. It aims to restore collective agency, and reinforce the fundamental principles of transparency, consistency, and accountability among leaders.

No law abiding person who wants a country free of crimes and the drug menace would belittle or discourage a campaign launched by the authorities to accomplish that purpose. In the same breath, on the very ground of being a law-abiding person, he/she would not like to see the campaign tarnished by possible or apparent personal agendas of anyone or any group and the highhanded activities of the personnel on the ground.

### The Contribution of Siam and Burma to Buddhism in Sri Lanka

*2024-01-30 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-Contribution-of-Siam-and-Burma-to-Buddhism-in-Sri-Lanka/172-275930) · `en`

It is well known that monks from Siam and Burma (as Thailand and Myanmar were called earlier) helped stem a decline in the practice of Buddhism, and contributed to its democratization in Sri Lanka during certain periods in the island’s history.

The circumstances which necessitated help from Siam and Burma, the process of securing such help, the role of the Dutch in it, and the  results of foreign involvement are vividly described by Auckland University sociologist Kitsiri Malalgoda in his book Buddhism in Sinhalese Society 1750-1900 (Tambapanni Academic Publishers, Colombo, 2023).

### A crisis of confidence

*2024-01-29 22:46:22* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-crisis-of-confidence/4-757888) · `en`

The hills are alive in Davos, with the sounds of failure. Conversations used to be about taking advantage of the global playing field that US presidents and their allies were seeking to build after World War II and after the end of the Cold War. Companies now, and countries themselves, are seeking to understand how to ameliorate the risks of a new, emerging, seemingly chaotic world order.

Yes, it was recently that time of year, as corporate chieftains, policy makers, NGO “warriors”, so-called journalists and self-styled intellectuals went invading the Swiss Alps for the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. Their anthem was “rebuilding trust.” After devastating trust on so many fronts this was a bold aspiration.

Stock market trading lacked lustre yesterday as the market witnessed huge selling pressure. Apparently, the absence of a proper process for 2024 with regard to the external debt restructuring exercise, particularly for sovereign bond holders, caused a dip in the market, analysts said.

Both indices moved downwards. The All- Share Price Index went down by 38.4 points, while the S and P SL20 declined by 17.17 points. Turnover amounted to Rs 590 million without any crossings.
