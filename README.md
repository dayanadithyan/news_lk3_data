### “It was neither protest nor rally”: Sarath Fonseka

Colombo, Feb. 01 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that the SJB protest did not turn out to be successful, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said if he was to organise it, he would have done it more skillfully.

The MP said some 8,000 people participated in the protest but ultimately it was neither a protest nor a rally.

"People had to leave soaked after being attacked with tear-gas and water cannons," he said responding to a question during a media conference.

"There was good participation for the protest though some people who usually attend our rallies did not turn up this time. People have so many issues and we had to face difficulty in bringing them. However, there were around 7,000 to 8,000 people. Ultimately,it was neither a protest nor a rally and ended up with people having to leave getting tear-gassed and soaked due to water cannon attacks. If I had organised it, I would have done it somewhat skillfully," he said.

Sources said that the number of private credits is very large.

A team of private lenders has told DailyMirr that if Sri Lanka does not negotiate with them, we will engage in all activities to stop the second -volume of the IMF.

They said this is the only way to negotiate with the Sri Lankan government.

The year 2024 is expected to be one of prosperity for Asia with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expecting the region to maintain its momentum in delivering two-thirds to global growth.

Providing a snapshot of the regional economic outlook, Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department noted that the region's prospects for a soft landing have improved.

”The good news is that we have revised growth upward for both 2023 and 2024,” he said addressing a press conference this week.

For 2023, the IMF estimates growth at 4.7 percent, compared to the 4.6 percent projection in October. China and India account for most of the upward revision. In China, growth was supported by higher spending on disaster reconstruction and resilience projects. In India, strong domestic demand underpinned another increase in our growth estimate.

The Fund has also upgraded the regional growth forecast for 2024 to 4.5 percent, from 4.2 percent in October.

Colombo (News 1st) – The Myanmar government has begun a crackdown on Chinese warlord families running scam centres in the Laukkaing province of Myanmar, foreign media reported. This is a different province to the one in which 56 Sri Lankans are known to be enslaved in online scam centres in Myanmar close to the Thai border.

The Myanmar military junta on Tuesday flew the leaders of three Chinese mafia families to Beijing on a special chartered flight. The three – Bai Suocheng, Wei Chaoren and Liu Zhengxiang – had been running a ‘scam city’ in the province of Laukkaing with the backing of the Myanmar junta since 2009.

But increasing pressure from the Chinese government, together with the weakening of the junta in losses to Myanmar rebel armies in far-flung regions of Myanmar, resulted in the junta turning over the warlords.
