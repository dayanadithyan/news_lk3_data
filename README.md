### AKD slams speaker for stuffing his staff with relatives

*2024-03-25 13:13:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/akd-slams-speaker-for-stuffing-his-staff-with-relatives/) · `en`

The three-day debate on the No-confidence Motion against Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena offers an insight into the prevailing ‘dump the lot’ public opinion on the incumbent legislature. Listening to what some MPs said (sometimes yelled) during the debate helps understand the present mood in the country that the incumbent legislature has long lost its mandate which must be urgently restored through a general election.

Only a few members presented coherent arguments during the debate. The government relied on its roster of provocative speakers who bellowed the usual rhetoric. Those who spoke sensibly rightly predicted that the government’s numerical advantage would secure the motion’s defeat. However, they cautioned that any victory would be fleeting as they believed the government’s downfall was inevitable.
