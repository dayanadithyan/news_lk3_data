Two individuals have been apprehended by the Special Investigation Unit of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) in connection with a foreign employment scam.

The arrests were made following a raid on an institution located in Borella, prompted by a complaint alleging that the company had defrauded Rs. 1 million from individuals promising employment opportunities in the financial sector in Canada.

Investigations have revealed that the institution was operating as an unlicensed foreign employment agency, without the necessary authorization from the SLBFE.

The Special Investigation Unit of the SLBFE has arrested the owner of the company along with another suspect. After being produced before the court, the suspects have been released on two surety bails of Rs. 1 million each.

The High Court directed the Tamil Nadu government to respond to a petition investigating events surrounding Jayalalithaa's hospitalization due to ill health. The court's intervention was sought due to numerous discrepancies in the events that occurred during her stay at Apollo Hospital in Chennai. A request was made for a CBI investigation under the direct supervision of the High Court, following a petition filed by a member and lawyer of the AIADMK party. Despite recommendations from the Arumugasamy committee to investigate suspicions about Jayalalithaa's death, no action was taken based on the report. Additionally, there were allegations that incorrect information was disseminated regarding Jayalalithaa's body before her death announcement and that the hospital administration was criticized for this.

Thailand has announced visa-free entry for citizens of 93 countries, including Sri Lanka, but implementation awaits official Sri Lankan government approval. This marks the first time Sri Lankans can visit Thailand without a visa, allowing stays of 30 to 60 days for tourists and short-term business travelers, provided they show proof of funds, accommodation, and return flights. Additionally, Thailand introduced the Digital Nomad Visa (DNV), valid for up to 180 days and valid for five years, aimed at digital nomads, freelancers, and those interested in culinary and martial arts. This initiative aims to boost tourism, which saw a 35% increase in arrivals, earning $24 billion in 2023, with projections indicating significant growth from Chinese, Malaysian, and Indian tourists by 2024.

üü©

It has been announced that people from 93 countries, including Sri Lanka, can go to Thailand without a visa today.

But the Thai Embassy said the project would be implemented only after the official announcement of the Sri Lankan authorities.

In this case, Sri Lankans received no confirmation from Bangkok yesterday regarding the visa free of Thailand. Therefore, the Sri Lankan Immigration and Air Transport Officers will be informed once the official announcement is received. At the time, the project will come into effect. ‚Äù

Meanwhile, no announcement has been made on the new project on the Internet of the Thailand Embassy in Sri Lanka.

Meanwhile, this is the first time that Sri Lankans are allowed to travel to Thailand without a visa.

Sri Lanka has already granted permission to come to Sri Lanka without a visa.

Sri Lankans who go without a visa can stay in Thailand for 30 to 60 days. However, the Sri Lankans traveling there must have evidence of money, shelter and flight tickets.

It has been reported that the Government proposes to introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution for the purpose of bringing Article 83 into conformity with the amendments made by the 19th Amendment to Articles 30(2) and 62(2). Since this proposal is wholly unnecessary, and makes no sense whatsoever in constitutional terms, it may be necessary to look beyond the obvious for some less discernible, perhaps more sinister or Machiavellian objective.

### Sir Ponnambalan Ramanathan¬† (1851- 1930): The First Member for Ceylon

*2024-07-15 11:08:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sir-ponnambalan-ramanathan-1851-1930-the-first-member-for-ceylon/) ¬∑ `en`

In 1911 Sir Ponnambalan Ramanathan was elected to the educated Ceylonese seat in the Legislative Council at the age of sixty. The seat was so named because, even as late as 1910, the Governor did not think that Ceylonese in general were fit to exercise the vote. Ramanathan was elected to the seat largely by the votes of the Sinhalese. Admittedly, he was a brilliant speaker and had held the high office of Solicitor-General. He defeated Sir Marcus Fernando, a distinguished physician and a man of rare ability in many fields.

The 125th Anniversary of the birth of Ramanathan will fall on Friday April 16, 1976. As a young man he was a hard-working lawyer who was nominated a member of the Legislative Council at the age of 28 to succeed his uncle Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy as the ‚ÄòTamil member‚Äô. He had to give up his seat when he was appointed Solicitor-General.

In Sri Lanka, there have been over 220 murders in the past two years, with 22 occurring in just one year. A former Deputy Inspector General of Police highlighted the issue, stating that preventing such crimes requires a dedicated minister overseeing crime investigations.

There was a build-up of excess liquidity up to 200 billion rupees after dollar purchases in April and May.

Sri Lanka operates a so-called flexible exchange rate, which analysts says is not backed by consistent policy.

When there is higher import demand, usually due a pick up in private or state enterprise credit or both, the flexible exchange rate slides triggering a confidence shock in both importers and exporters.
