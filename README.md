Foreign nationals who overstay their visas and do various odd jobs to earn money continue unabated with the authorities concerned hamstrung with the lack of resources to curb them, an official said.

In one instance, another group of 15 foreigners overstaying their visas in Sri Lanka and doing online jobs for a living were arrested by an investigation team of the Department of Immigration and Emigration during raids in Colombo and Dehiwala yesterday.

Eleven of them were Indians from Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Uttharakhand, Gujarat and Maharashtra states and others Napalese aged between 20 and 30.

Initial investigations revealed that some of them had arrived on resident visas and others on tourist visas

### Political coalitions purely in pursuit of power will aggravate political immorality and unethical behavior

It appears that there is unanimity in the public perception of an overwhelming number of Sri Lankans that Sri Lanka has gone beyond the point of resurrection when it comes to immorality, unethical behaviour, corruption, lack of law and order and poor governance

‚ÄúPolitical ethics requires leaders to meet higher standards than would be necessary for private life. They may have less of a right to privacy than ordinary citizens do, or no right to use their office for personal profit. Personal or private morality and political morality are often viewed as a conflict of interest‚Äù ‚Äì Andrew Stark, Conflict of Interest in American Public Life. (Harvard University Press, 2003)

### Can the IMF program be renegotiated by a future government?

President Ranil Wickremesinghe chairs a meeting with the IMF in Colombo ‚Äì File photo

In my opinion, the IMF program Sri Lanka has got now is lenient when you compare it with many other countries. The 17th IMF program may not be enough even if implemented fully. Therefore, there is very little space to make changes in the broader program targets.

1.Achieve a primary budget surplus of 2.3% by 2025 and beyond

2.Bring annual foreign currency debt service from 9.4% of GDP in 2022 to 4.5% of GDP during 2027-2032. Reduce the government‚Äôs gross financial needs which was at 35% of GDP in 2022 down to below 13% from 2027-2032.

3.Public debt, which was 128% to GDP, should be reduced to 95% by 2032.

If there were to be any renegotiations of the IMF deal by a future government, it will have to change one or all of the above. Let me go through them one by one.

Target 1 - Primary budget surplus of 2.3% by 2025 and beyond

The Presidential Media Division and the Daily News released press releases and media news items titled ‚ÄúCountry set for rapid transformation into an export economy‚Äù quoting remarks made by you at the inauguration ceremony of a historic temple in Kegalle.

As a caring citizen I said, ‚Äúthree cheers‚Äù, happily thinking that at last, the country was on the correct governance path focusing on the creation of new strategic leadership options and policy changes to encourage present and new investors to produce tradable goods and engage in external services. I was delighted that the statement began with a reference that Sri Lanka can no longer continue to rely on borrowings (presumably external?) to address the imbalance between imports and exports, which if pursued will inevitably lead to another economic crisis within a decade.

Wage disparities between men and women remain significant in Sri Lanka and have not significantly closed in the last decade. Renewed policy efforts can close this persistent yet remediable gender gap to promote a more inclusive economic recovery

In most countries around the world, women earn substantially less than men. At the global level, the gender pay gap is estimated at 20%. This issue concerns countries across all geographical regions, regardless of their stage of economic development.

Develop an engine which can generate more revenue at decreasing marginal cost with the right DNA

Growth is the fundamental focal point behind any business decision. However, whether businesses achieve meaningful growth is the big question today. For the growth to be meaningful it has to come at a decreasing marginal cost. Meaningful growth happens only where businesses build with scalable DNA. This thinking has to be calculated into the business at the startup conceiving stage itself.

### Sustainability in business ‚Äì or corporate greenwash

‚ÄòSustain‚Äô is derived from Latin and it means hold up or support. Its etymology suggests endurance without yielding; continuity without downfall. Sustainability, by extension, may well be the capability of sustaining, but in common speech and in commercial jargon it has become a vague and abused term, laying claim to a plethora of definitions. What then does sustainability mean, and what should it mean in business? What ought we sustain, and does sustenance suffice?

The need to address sustainability in business arose because irresponsibility in commerce and industry have led inter alia to scarcity of clean water, drain of natural resources, ill health of communities, strained employees and landfills of unsold produce ‚Äì not only when mistakes have occurred, but even when operating as designed and being economically profitable.

Says statement and lack of accountability raises concerns about security lapses that led to these attacks

Stresses it is deeply concerned by nonchalance surrounding investigation into Easter Sunday attacks

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed concern regarding the recent statement by former President Maithripala Sirisena concerning his knowledge of the mastermind behind the terror attacks on Easter Sunday in 2019.

This statement, coupled with the ongoing lack of accountability for these heinous acts, raises serious questions about potential security lapses that led to the death of innocent civilians.

The BASL reiterated its commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice for the victims.

‚ÄúIn this spirit, the BASL filed a Fundamental Rights application, against the former President, other members of the leadership, and senior officials for their failure to discharge their fundamental duties towards the people of our country,‚Äù the organisation said.

### A face-off that promises a surprise ending - EDITORIAL

*2024-04-05 02:41:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/A-face-off-that-promises-a-surprise-ending-EDITORIAL/172-280214) ¬∑ `en`

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and his camp received a positive response from the National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) for a debate on the country‚Äôs economy. It‚Äôs a bit strange for the NPP to have agreed to a face-off with Premadasa because the JVP-led alliance prefers staging debates in an environment where experts speak on topics where analysis, statistics, reasoning and logic shape the direction of the ‚Äòconversation‚Äô.

We all know that ‚Äòconversation‚Äô might not be the most appropriate word to use in the context of a debate. Debates where Sri Lankan lawmakers feature in are hostile and very seldom do parties at loggerheads accept shortcomings and agree on a compromise. But this time around things might be different, according to reports reaching us from reliable sources.

### Attack on Iran: Amid lies and deception, Gaza war may escalate into a regional conflict

The April 1 attack by Israel on the Iranian consular office in the Syrian capital of Damascus, killing several people including a senior Revolutionary Guard general and diplomats, is a potential trigger for a regional war. Let the entire world suffer and let millions of people die in such a war, which will have a devastating effect on developing countries. Israel will not stop until it conquers the world.

This is not a dark prophecy. Israel is well on the path to achieving its ambitions. With the West, the Arab world, and one-time Non-Aligned Movement stars paying obeisance to Israel, the Zionist state believes it is special and above the law. It believes international human rights laws, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and myriad United Nations mechanisms for a rules-based world order are only for nations other than Israel.

I hold Narendra Modi in high regard due to his remarkable leadership skills and rapid political growth. He has not continued the Ayodhya temple issue, prevented its ramifications from significantly affecting India‚Äôs political landscape. Moreover, his diplomatic efforts to elevate India‚Äôs global standing are commendable.

I have closely observed Modi‚Äôs evolving ideologies, particularly in his approach towards fostering strong business growth in India. While acknowledging India‚Äôs shift towards an open and liberal economy under Modi‚Äôs leadership, it‚Äôs notable that he seldom acknowledges the pivotal role played by Manmohan Singh, a Congress member, in spearheading this transformation.
