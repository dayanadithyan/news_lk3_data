*2024-03-11 14:50:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178428) ¬∑ `ta`

In Gaza, Palestinians face starvation, with children's deaths reported. Israelis protest against humanitarian aid, blocking trucks on the Gerome Salom route. They argue against aid to Hamas, citing the killing of their people. Women are abused, and the situation escalates, with protests turning violent.

üü©

While the Palestinians are hunger in Gaza, some Israelis are involved in the attempt to prevent humanitarian assistance from Gaza.

They are sitting in the middle of the street and engaging in picket protests in Gerome Salom, a traffic route between Israel and Gaza.

This is the case after Israel launched an attack against Hamas.

Israelis who are protesting have been caught by Hamas hostages, saying that humanitarian aid should not go into Kazawa.

The Israeli are protesting that the food should not be provided to those who killed our people.

Women are abused and they are not provided with food, we are feeding Hamas, they say.

The ABC said that 40 people engaged in prayers had stopped several trucks going into Gaza.

They refer to those who are hostage to Hamas as brothers and say they should not forget them.

They say that we should strangle Gaza's neck and breathe until they give our brothers back.

Why do I care about them and they are one of our enemies who killed our brothers.

In 2018, ‚ÄúEUROPOL‚Äù headquartered in Hague, Netherlands, a key organization established to prevent and combat serious internationally organized crimes, cybercrime and terrorism, had clearly defined the difference between cyber-dependent crimes and cyber-enabled crimes . As defined by them, any crime that can only be committed using computers, computer networks or other forms of information communication technology was named as cyber-dependent crimes and traditional crimes facilitated by the Internet and digital technology were categorized as cyber-enabled crimes. So, there are two categories of cybercrimes and these definitions are internally accepted.

Illicit intrusion and hacking into computer networks, disruption of computer functionality with the spread of viruses or other malware and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks which can paralyze service delivery by computers are some examples for cyber-dependent crimes.

*2024-03-11 13:16:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lanka-whither-goes-thou/) ¬∑ `en`

I plagiarized the title of this article from a Latin quote ‚ÄúQuo Vadis‚Äù. It was an immensely popular movie in the 50s starring Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr. According to the film, Quo vadis (Whither Goes Thou) were the words exchanged between God and St Peter. The first apostle was fleeing from Rome along the Appian Way to Brindisi to take a boat and escape to Palestine. Peter went back to Rome where he was crucified. Today there is a small chapel on that road where Peter turned back. It is called the Church of Domine Quo vadis.

Now you know I admitted I plagiarized. Don‚Äôt throw stones at my aeroplane. I have already said my mea culpa.Times have become difficult and often impossible to cope with. Whatever winds blow across our paradise isle, they are all filled with maelstroms that have so many manifestations. I do not think I am wrong if I say that even the winds are deceitful. We have been in turbulence for more years than we can recall.

### The Election-Economy Nexus and the Politics of JVP Apology

*2024-03-11 13:15:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-election-economy-nexus-and-the-politics-of-jvp-apology/) ¬∑ `en`

The economy is the base; everything else is superstructure. That is the old Marxian concept, simply put. The base ultimately determines what goes on in the superstructure, which includes among other things the state and its institutions, as well as their processes and functions. Included are the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, and their elections and appointments. Over time, there have been modifications to the old concept.

Borrowing from Freud‚Äôs psychoanalysis, Louis Althusser, the French Marxist, used the concept of over-determination to suggest that there are multiple causes producing an effect, i.e., political outcomes are ‚Äòover determined‚Äô by many causes besides the economy, although the economy could be singularly significant. Neo-Marxists have provided another angle in that just as the base could determine the goings on in the superstructure, what goes on in the superstructure also have implications for the base.

A political leader is a public servant dedicated to enhancing society, elected through votes from the community. More than just a politician, a political leader embodies ‚Äústatesmanship.‚Äù This implies having integrity and the determination to champion what is just, even if it means stepping down from a governmental role or facing electoral defeat. Regrettably, in contemporary times, some politicians declare intentions that differ from their actual actions. They may state one course of action while secretly planning another, ultimately failing to follow through on either of their promised commitments or their true intentions. This misalignment between words and deeds can erode public trust in the political process.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that the Rajapaksa would want to hold the general election while the Presidential Elections were to be held first.

The president wants the first presidential election to be held more than the general election as he does not have strong support at the grassroots level.

Sri Lanka PA knows that Rajapakse cannot be re -president. Basil recently came to the country. But, he has no chance to contest the presidential election. So they think the general election is favorable.

However, Dissanayake also said that the Elections Commission would have the authority to hold the presidential election on July 22, 2024, as the clash between the two factions continues on which elections to be held first.
