ThaksinтАЩs release, after almost two decades of antipathy between his populist political machine and ThailandтАЩs conservative royalist ruling class, raised speculation that Yingluck also might be returning soon.

### Can workers get the salary of the lease agreement?

*2024-03-04 14:37:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177873) ┬╖ `ta`

Workers' salaries in lease agreements are a complex issue. The Ceylon Workers Congress and unions argue for higher wages, but companies warn of stopping welfare services if basic salaries increase. The 1995 lease agreement between the government and plantation companies led to a joint contract for workers' welfare, but it's unclear if this affects the lease agreement's terms. The 2003 Labor Welfare Joint Agreement, made every three years, includes provisions for fair additional allowances and specific conditions for workers. Despite these agreements, plantation workers' welfare has declined over the years, leading to calls for negotiations and reforms. The government has decided to extend the lease agreement, but unions argue that companies have not complied with agreed salaries.

ЁЯЯй

Talks about the agony of plantation workers may have begun a goal. When the General Secretary and Minister of the Ceylon Workers Congress, Jeevan Thondaman, during a media briefing held last week, responded to this, the companies say that if the basic salary was paid Rs 1,700, other welfare services would be stopped.. If that happens, he said he would have to lease with companies in this regard.

The unions must understand that the workers' pain and the leasing agreement with the government with the government. At the same time, the unions have forgotten that there is a joint venture on the welfare of the workers.

The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Myanmar Janaka Priyantha Bandara says that unverified reports have been received claiming that a group of eight Sri Lankans who were held hostage at a Cyber Slave Camp in Myanmar have been rescued.

In December, reports were rife about a group of Sri Lankans who were lured with tourist visas behind the false front of lucrative job offers in the IT sector and were trafficked to Myanmar through its border with Thailand. These workers had reportedly travelled to Myanmar without registering with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE).

The Sri Lankans forcibly detained at the terrorist camp in Myawaddy тАУ an area infested with cybercrimes under the grip of an armed group тАУ were reported to be working as cyber slaves forced to commit internet scams.

### Globally, a rightward political shift is visible

*2024-03-04 13:24:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/globally-a-rightward-political-shift-is-visible/) ┬╖ `en`

The global political scene was very left-inclined from about the mid-1960s to say 10 or 15 years ago. The sweeping trend to social democracy in post-war Europe, a surge to the left throughout Asia (Chinese Revolution, defeat of US Imperialism in Vietnam, post-war USSR, our own JVP) and a little later in Africa (Patrice Lumumba, revolution in Mozambique, Nelson Mandela etc), signposted what may be loosely called a period of global shift to the left. That ended about 10 years ago. The last spurt was perhaps ObamaтАЩs re-election. The reverse trend became prominent in the US with Trump and internationally a dynamic that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.

It has been reported that at a meeting of the Constitutional Council held a few days ago, the nomination made by President Wickremesinghe of Deshabandu Tennekoon for appointment to the office of Inspector-General of Police was approved, and Tennekoon was accordingly appointed. However, it has also been reported that the Leader of the Opposition, Sajith Premadasa, has claimed that the appointment was made in violation of the Constitution and without the necessary approval of the Constitutional Council. The Speaker, on the other hand, has asserted that, at the meeting which he chaired, the number of votes required for approval of the nomination, namely five, was obtained.

### Instant ceasefire in Gaza - Australian Malaysian leaders jointly request

*2024-03-04 13:22:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177865) ┬╖ `ta`

Australian and Malaysian leaders jointly request an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, aiming to resolve Israel-Hamas conflicts. They also call for the release of all hostages. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim emphasizes the need for a ceasefire, not addressing the controversial Israel-Palestine issues. The leaders express concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza, especially since October 7th, without condemning the attack on Israel. Efforts are underway to publish a report on Gaza, despite differing positions from Malaysia and Hamas.

ЁЯЯй

The Australian Malaysian leaders have called for an immediate ceasefire, making efforts to overcome the regional tensions that has created due to Israel Hamas conflicts.

They have also requested that all the hostages in Gaza be released.

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has said that I am not talking about the controversial issues between Israel and Palestine, but I want to talk about the immediate ceasefire.

The comment was made when the two met during the Special ASEAN Summit in Melbourne.

At the end of the conference, efforts are being made to publish a report on Gaza, although Malaysia and Hamas have emphasized a fierce position.

Meanwhile, Australian Malaysian leaders have expressed concern over the worst humanitarian situation in Gaza after the seventh of October.

They did not condemn the attack on Israel and called for an immediate ceasefire.

ЁЯЯй

Most of the coconut milk is made of coconut milk, and the rise in the price of coconuts will have a severe impact on the future of the food pack and curry, the food sector unions said.

Rukshan Harshana, president of the All Ceylon Resources Owners Association, told the media yesterday that the usual price of coconuts from 60 to 80 has doubled.A coconut is currently sold for Rs.120 to 150.

He said that snacks and restaurant owners are in great difficulty without being able to prepare rice and curry packets under the increased coconut prices and are in the uncertainty to sell food packages at higher prices.

Coconuts have an unexpected rise in rice, including rice, chicken, eggs and gas.

Harshana has warned that the price of coconut oil will rise in the coming days due to the sudden increase in coconuts.
