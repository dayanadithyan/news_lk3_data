Colombo, March 28 (Daily Mirror)- The special commodity levy on rice was reduced not to allow import of rice but to clear a stock of rice currently stuck with the Customs, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said today.

He told reporters that a stock of Keeri Samba rice was imported in January to control the escalating prices and shortage in the market and that a part of that imported stock of rice was stuck with the Customs due to a delay in receiving the stock.

He said the special commodity levy on rice was reduced from Rs. 65 to Rs. 1 for a period of one week to facilitate the importers to get that rice stock cleared from the Customs.

"This move will not lead to import of new rice stocks as the reduction will be effective only for a week. The importers must clear the rice stock stuck with the Customs within a week," he said.

The Department of Excise denies rumors of liquor price reductions for New Year. No directive from the finance ministry to lower excise tax on liquor has been received, so prices will remain unchanged.

🟩

The Department of Excise today said that there is no truth in the rumors that the prices of liquor will be reduced ahead of the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year.

The media spokesman Sanna Weerakkody said that there are reports in the media that the maximum liquor prices imposed on liquor will be reduced to reduce the prices of liquor.

The Excise Department has not received any directive or instruction from its qualified finance ministry to revise the excise tax on liquor, so the price of liquor will not be reduced.

Therefore, news about the reduction in the price of liquor is false and baseless, he said.

MJ Gunasiri, the chief of the Department of Excise last week, commented to the Daily Mirror, "The use of liquor in the country has been reduced significantly.. He said the department has been given a new annual target of Rs 232 billion by the end of this year.

Earlier, Basil Rajapaksa of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), requested the President in his one on one meeting that the parliamentary election should precede the presidential election. In his calculation, a parliamentary election at this juncture is more advantageous to his party than a presidential election which is slated to be conducted before October 17.

However, as reported by the Daily Mirror, the President affirmed to the Cabinet of Ministers that he would not call for any snap general election ahead of the presidential election which is on schedule in terms of the Constitution.

### Sri Lanka must explore options to reduce prices of local graphite: Industry

### The digital road to heaven

Developing digital public infrastructure – a critical measure to accelerate economic growth

Infrastructure development is a fundamental for economic growth. Any country seeking to improve its people’s lives must invest in infrastructure to ensure free and speedy movement of goods and services. Trade and commerce and therefore economic growth depend on such developments.

So historically the road to economic heaven has been literally that – building of roads, and other infrastructure for free and easy movement of goods. And this kind of development took years. Sometimes decades before its fruits could be tasted by the common man.

It’s the same in 2024. Except the new road that promises a speedy compressed gateway to economic heaven is also digital. And digital infrastructure building is fast becoming a way of catapulting and accelerating economic development.

‘Why Bharat Matters’, matters. The new book by one of the world’s most outstanding and admired foreign ministers, India’s Dr. S. Jaishankar, makes clear the centrality of Ramayana mythology within ‘Bharat’ as BJP’s India and BJP worldview. Cosmology dominates ideology.

In an ambitious exegetical enterprise, Dr. Jaishankar strives to confer the (non-secular) Ramayana a methodological and intellectual status as a strategic text that is implicitly above Kautilya’s (secular) Arthashasthra, a Realist classic. A tough sell, that.
