North Korea has released a new song praising leader Kim Jong Un for being a ‚Äúfriendly father‚Äù and a ‚Äúgreat leader‚Äù, in a move that appears to be part of a propaganda drive to enhance his standing in the reclusive state.

The music video for the song was aired on the state-controlled Korean Central Television on Wednesday.

It features North Koreans of different backgrounds ranging from children to troops and medical staff exuberantly belting out lines such as: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs sing, Kim Jong Un the great leader‚Äù and ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs brag about Kim Jong Un, a friendly father‚Äù.

A live performance of the song accompanied by an orchestra and watched by Kim was also broadcast on state television as part of a ceremony to mark the completion of building 10,000 new homes.

The Kim family dynasty that has ruled North Korea since its founding after World War Two have sought to strengthen their grip on power by building cults of personality around them.

Their study, published this week in the scientific journal Mitochondrion, has revealed that the Vedda have a greater genetic similarity with these five tribes than with either Sri Lanka‚Äôs Sinhalese or Tamil populations with whom they have shared the island for centuries.

### China writes off interest-free loans given to Zimbabwe

China has written off an unspecified amount of Zimbabwe‚Äôs interest-free loans and pledged to help the Southern African country find a way out of its debt crisis, even as activists warned of a permanent debt trap.

As of September 2023, Zimbabwe‚Äôs publicly guaranteed debt stood at $17.7 billion, of which $12.7 billion was external and $5 billion domestic.

Most of the foreign debt was purchased from China, as the country is ineligible for loans from multilateral creditors such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after defaulting on repayments since the turn of the millennium.

It was a dream come true moment for Nalini on polling day as she would have never expected cameras following her from the refugee camp to the polling booth at MM Middle School, near the airport, where she cast her vote.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have words to express my feelings. Voting for the first time, I feel I have come out of my past now,‚Äù said Nalini.

The journey from being a refugee in a land where she was born to becoming first member of her community to get voting rights took two years of legal battle as her application for an Indian passport was rejected by a regional passport office in 2021. In September 2022, Nalini had established before the Madras High Court that she was an Indian citizen.

In April 2022 our country was declared bankrupt. We were unable to import basic needs such as food, fuel, cooking gas, medicines and other necessities. A sudden ban on the import of petroleum-based fertiliser nearly killed some of our main export crops such as tea, rubber and coconut. Soon shop shelves ran empty. Long queues formed around fuel depots. Amid the turmoil, the executive president fled the country.

A situation of anarchy was eased with the election of President Wickremesinghe to the presidency by Parliament. Wickremesinghe was able to steady the ship and prevent the country from sliding into anarchy.

Today, for the first time in three years gross official reserves crossed the US$4 billion mark at end of December 2023.

This most encouraging change has much more far-reaching implications, in that the basic resources available are natural renewable resources such as sunshine, wind, water on one hand and no one can claim ownership of these resources and the technologies of converting these to electricity are now economically feasible at much smaller scale. Of particular interest are the solar energy technologies, which has now made it possible for electricity consumers to become ‚ÄúProsumers‚Äù.

Five years is upon us this Easter and the nation sadly is none the wiser.

Meanwhile the suffering of those who were maimed and injured in varying degrees, has continued unabated.

A book by the former President also alludes to disagreements and disillusionment amongst senior military officials in other matters, begging the question if this disillusionment is a manufactured version to create space between these officials and their one time colleague and Boss.

The President at the time of the Easter Tragedy has awoken from a presumably manufactured slumber and has claimed to have knowledge of the Mastermind/s behind this attack which is beyond sinister. His shameful attempt to make light of this very tragic tragedy is not only shameful but reaches to new depths of depravity.

As April showed this year, Easter ‚Äì together with Eid and Aluth Avurudu ‚Äì can be entertained in ecumenical hearts,

without breaching the undivided peace that prevailed in the hearts of most people of an island race keen to live in harmony

Sri Lanka is no stranger to hostiles with big black backpacks brimming with explosives, literally and metaphorically.

A protracted conflict between insular tribes, stoked by ethno-nationalism and egged on by war profiteers, taught us to expect sudden or strategic violence in public places and contested spaces.

The tsunami of 2004 took a sleeping island by surprise in their homes. But being used to ‚Äònature red in tooth and claw‚Äô, the wound was more readily assimilated than death blows delivered by neighbours in 1983.

That, and humanity‚Äôs inhumanity to humankind, combined to make the Easter Sunday bombings of April 2019 arguably the single explosive event with the farthest-reaching ramifications of our times.

One of the most enchanting books I have read in recent times has to be ‚ÄúA Moveable Feast‚Äù by the celebrated American writer Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961). The book eludes easy categorisation, although it could be broadly considered a memoire of a period of his early life, when he lived in Paris (from 1921 to 1926). Hemingway had kept notes of his Paris days, getting down to writing A Movable Feast only in the last years of his life, in 1957 to be exact.
