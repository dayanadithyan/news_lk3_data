Colombo, Feb 29 (Daily Mirror) - The time has come to decide whether we should remain in an assembly where its head repeatedly violates the Constitution, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said today.

Premadasa came up with this remark during a meeting held at the Saranakara Maha Vidyalaya, Bingiriya today.

"Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena is openly violating the Constitution. He violated the Constitution by casting his vote to approve the appointment of a new IGP. He had written to the President stating that he decided to cast his vote at the Constitutional Council on the assumption that the two civil members who abstained were  against the appointment of Deshabandu Tennekoon as the new IGP. The Speaker seems to have pushed the Constitution aside and is doing things his own way. Therefore, the time has come for us to decide whether we should remain in Parliament or not," he said.
