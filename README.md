### Best business practices from an Islamic standpoint

Many of the teachings embodied in both the Qur’an and Hadiths are actually followed by  multinationals in spirit - Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a very efficient leader. He had excellent XQ (Execution Quotient) i.e. ability to get things done. The secret of his efficiency was his sense of urgency. Once a task was decided he would formulate a plan with relevant parties and execute it as fast as possible. This was evident in his many actions from winning over tribal chiefs to the many campaigns he led to ensure Islam triumphed and a commonwealth based on the brotherhood of man finally emerged. That he was supremely successful in this nobody will deny. We know in our personal life that anything we decide to do later, rarely gets done. One delay leads to another, which is why procrastination is regarded almost as a sin in Islam

They bring with them the efficiencies of the private sector in construction and operations, enhancing the speed of development and the quality of infrastructure. One of the key benefits is the ability of PPPs to generate additional resources outside government budgets.
