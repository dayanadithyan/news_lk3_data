President Ranil Wickremesinghe presented his latest policy statement while opening the new Parliament session on February 7. Contrary to his previous policy statements and special statements on the economy it did not contain so many plans that his government is going to implement, yet it has much food for thought.

Wickremesinghe at the outset painted a rosy picture on the situation. He said that the inflation, which stood at a daunting 50.6 per cent last year, has dramatically decreased to a mere 6.4 per cent, today. Food inflation, previously at an alarming 54.4 per cent, has seen a remarkable decline to just 3.3 per cent. The exchange rate has shown positive movement, with a dollar worth Rs. 362 in the past and now valued at Rs. 314. The current situation is vastly improved, with foreign exchange reserves standing at $ 4.4 billion by the end of

### Putting Fetters on Live-In Relationships

*2024-02-13 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Putting-Fetters-on-Live-In-Relationships/172-276862) · `en`

It is feared that an Indian State’s restrictive law on live-in relationships may be replicated by other conservative State governments in India

Earlier this month, the Legislative Assembly of Uttarakhand, a North Indian State at the foot of the Himalayas, passed a Uniform Civil Code (UCC). While most of the provisions were progressive, there were some which put fetters on “live-in” relationships, to the extent of criminalizing them. These provisions have come in for much criticism on the grounds that they invade privacy and individual liberty guaranteed by the Indian constitution.

The law defines living-in as a “relationship between a man and a woman who cohabit in a shared household through a relationship in the nature of marriage.”

If you vote for corrupt reasons, you will elect corrupt leaders and you will be their eternal slaves – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

We must be confident that the President we choose can be trusted with extraordinary powers in situations where the safety, or the liberty, of our country is truly in grave danger. We must also be confident that in giving such powers, which must be limited in scope and time, we do not leave room for an opportunistic leader to violate human rights and not abide by the constitution under the pretext of saving the country from imminent, inescapable, and mortal danger. Who among the candidates can we trust with extraordinary powers?

President Ranil Wickremesinghe said the finalisation of debt restructuring could be completed by the first half of the year, which is going beyond the earlier anticipation for it to be completed within the first quarter

President Wickremesinghe said in Parliament last week that “Sri Lanka expects to implement a debt restructuring framework within the first six months of 2024, expressing confidence that the nation was recovering from its worst financial crisis in decades.” The Sri Lankan economy is clearly showing signs of recovery from the severe economic crisis, with improvements in our foreign exchange positions and current account deficits. But a significant challenge remains in managing the country’s large sovereign debt and inequities of the partial coverage of the domestic debt optimisation program. Therefore we need to show some tangible progress in the debt rescheduling.

Growth of new generation of leaders from Generation X, Millennials, and Generation Z

Much credit should be expressed to the youth that realised the suppression of the masses and spearheaded the Aragalaya movement and made a pivotal moment for transformational changes. Although the movement may not have rightfully idealised the necessary structural changes, it did spark the crucial awareness needed for initiating reforms away from the status quo. Unfortunately, this unique opportunity was selfishly squandered by the established political class that exploited a loophole left behind by their predecessors to seize power from under the table

At a recent public seminar on the Online Safety Act (OSA), a policy perspective under the title ‘OSA: Why The Rush?’ was presented by the academics and students of the Bandaranaike Academy for Leadership and Public Policy (BALPP) in tandem with cyber-security experts.

BALPP students following a post-graduate course in cyber-security observed that the OSA is ostensibly to protect women and children from the following:

(Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund is now “very confident” the global economy will see a soft landing, its managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on Monday, adding that interest rates would start coming down around mid year.

“We are very confident that the world economy is now poised for this soft landing we have been dreaming for,” after some of the sharpest interest rate hikes in decades, Georgieva said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.

On the prospect of interest rates being cut in leading economies like the United States, she added: “I expect to see by mid year interest rates going in the direction inflation has been going on for the last year.”

She cautioned to expect the unexpected in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and said a prolonged war between Israel and Hamas would impact global economies.

“I fear most a longevity of the conflict because (if) it goes on and on the risk of spillovers go up,” the IMF chief said.

### AKD in New Delhi: Some thoughts about the ‘Indian policy’ of a progressive government

Senior Lecturer, Department of Legal Studies, Open University of Sri Lanka

The recent visit of a delegation from the National People’s Power (NPP), led by Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, to India has sparked an intriguing discussion within our political circles. While some parties have seized upon this opportunity to mock the JVP, recalling their anti-Indian stance in the 1980s, others have raised concerns about the potential dangers of yielding to Indian regional hegemony. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that the invitation extended by the Indian government to an NPP delegation for discussions signifies a significant turning point. The NPP, with only three members in Parliament, was until very recently perceived as a marginal political party.

### Dudley Senanayake (1911-1973): The gentle knight of Ceylon politics

“He was a verray parfit gentil knight”, in the words of the fourteenth century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer. Dudley Senananyake was a Minister at the age of 36 and four times Prime Minister. He won the respect and affection of millions, many of whom had never seen him, or know him only from his picture in a public print or a displayed poster.

Although he was a wise statesman and an experienced politician, there is something else which comes uppermost to the minds of those who pause to recall his public career of 38 years. I was working in my small garden after I had heard the news of his death. An elderly woman was plucking some jasmine flowers from a creeper in the fence. She too had heard the news and turning to me, said: “Such is our existence on this earth. Even the Lord Buddha had to die.”

Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s recent visit to India, on an invitation extended by the Indian government, underlies a tectonic shift in Sri Lankan politics, a sign of things to come. It hints at what may happen at upcoming elections. More than anything, it shows that India is taking the JVP-NPP seriously. We should be, too.

The responses to the visit by other parties have, so far, been lukewarm. The UNP’s Vajira Abeywardena, for instance, welcomed the move, and stated that his party hoped the JVP-NPP would contribute towards national policies which would “revive the nation”, adding that he looked forward to seeing the party work with the UNP, just as it had worked before with Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe ceremonially commenced the fifth session of Parliament on Wednesday with a speech (once called the Throne Speech), calling on opposition parties to join his endeavor to rebuild the nation. It was his third policy speech in the legislature, the first and second being delivered on August 3, 2022, and February 8, 2023, commencing the third and fourth sessions of the ninth Parliament.

He directed that all ceremonial and events traditionally associated with the opening of Parliament be dispensed presumably for reasons of economy. So there was neither a military parade or 21-gun salute; only the reciting of Jayamangala Gatha by a bevy of pink-clad girls from Devi Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo.

The president called on the SJB and JVP to adapt and change for the sake of the nation’s welfare and the prosperity of the country’s youth and to share his vision to ‘unite in the pursuit of our nation-building dream.’

It is no longer a secret that a progressive section of the Buddhist clergy (Sangha) and Tamil parties (for example the Global Tamil Forum) have met in Europe and North America and worked out a “Road Map” to put an end to repetitive riots and pogroms that have despoiled this country since Independence. Leaders SWRD, JR, Ranil, Premadasa and Mahinda, all of them, have racist blood on their hands. DS took away the citizenship of Upcountry Tamils but I don’t think he instigated race riots.
