“The second review will commence from March 7 and we are very confident that it will be a smoother review than the first review,” Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe said during a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre on Wednesday.

### Unhealthy Competition in Tourism Must Be Stopped - EDITORIAL

There was a recent report in the Daily Mirror stating the inconveniences caused to locals due to businesses conducted by Israeli, Russian and Ukrainian nationals in the southern part of Sri Lanka. This report demands deep pondering investigation.

As much as such businesses are eating into the earning opportunities of locals, we also must think that there are hidden opportunities for business here when some people think that all is lost in this sun-kissed paradise island. These foreign nationals are operating bars, restaurants, giving surfing lessons, buying or leasing lands and renting out tuk-tuks; the latter to cut down on travel expenses. Wow! The message that foreign nationals are giving to all of Sri Lanka is that ‘if you cannot do business here in this country we’ll show you how’.

### Palestinian question: The context highlights the illegality of Israel

Displaced Palestinian children gather for food in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. AFP

The October 7, 2023, attacks the Palestinian resistance group Hama launched on Israel did not happen in a vacuum. In October last year, weeks after the Hamas attack, the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, told the UN Security Council that “it is important to recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum.”

Intellectuals avoid jumping to conclusions. They investigate all sides of an issue, including its history, context, and surrounding narratives, to form an opinion grounded in justice. The Secretary-General was not taking sides in the Israel-Palestinian question. His speech conformed to what was expected of an intellectual and a UN official committed to standing up for justice.

### Retelling the story of China and why it’s important

*2024-03-01 00:10:20* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Retelling-the-story-of-China-and-why-it-s-important/4-759015) · `en`

China appears to continue doing what it does best – move forward. And this perspective, whether for China, or any other country of the Global South, remains vital

A debt trap. A dispute at sea. A trade threat. An anomaly. A friend of Russia. The many names China has been called in recent years doesn’t require much reiteration, because they are already so engrained in our minds; either by label-repetition, international media-unison and perhaps also because of China’s Achilles’ heels – limitations with the English language and Western expression.

Meeting with Chinese counterparts over the last month, I only had one question. Why don’t they fight the provocation much harder? And moreover fight it in public spaces rather than behind closed diplomatic doors where the risk for facts to be eluded and stereotypes resorted to being much higher. A case in point is perhaps the blatant press leaks to a closed door diplomatic meeting at the G20; a clear unapologetic breach of pacta sunt servanda.

### Economic stability in Sri Lanka: Myth or reality?

While inflation may have decreased in real terms, stagnant wages and rising taxes have eroded the purchasing power of citizens, exacerbating poverty and inequality

The economic landscape of Sri Lanka has been a subject of fervent debate in recent times, with conflicting narratives surrounding the notion of stability. On the surface, there are indicators suggesting positive growth and progress, yet beneath the veneer lies a stark reality of pervasive instability, particularly for a significant portion of the population.

If the people do not change themselves, there is never going to be any form of change whatsoever

The above verse from the Holy Quran is a reminder to the entire mankind contextually adapted for the current political climate. Broadly, the condition of any people revolves around two major generic areas. The good and bad. It is only when bad has taken root, there will be a need for mankind to change towards goodness. And, until and unless man himself has decided to change the badness in him, nothing is going to change.

### Go to court if the Speaker's decision is error - Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa

*2024-02-29 23:54:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177633) · `ta`

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakse said that the Speaker's decision to head the Constituent Assembly on the appointment of the new Inspector General of Police could go to court.

He was speaking to the media at a function held on Thursday (29) in the Pannipitiya area of Maharagama.

Many people are criticizing the Speaker's decision during the appointment of the new Inspector General of Police. But the main reason for this problem is that even though the constitutional amendment has taken steps to appoint 10 members to the Constituent Assembly, the representative of the small parties will not be named.

Due to this problem, the Speaker is facing practical problems. So if you think that there is any legal problem in the Speaker's decision, the best place for the constitution is the best place for legal issues in the Constitution.

(Reuters) - Gaza health authorities said more than 100 Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces as they waited for an aid delivery on Thursday, but Israel challenged the death toll and said many of the victims were run over by aid trucks.

At least 104 people were killed and more than 280 wounded in the incident near Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said, and the death toll in nearly five months of war passed 30,000.

Medical teams said they were unable to cope with the volume and severity of the injuries, with dozens of wounded taken to the al-Shifa hospital, which is only partially operational after Israeli raids on the facility.

The incident caused the largest loss of civilian lives in weeks. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said it was an “ugly massacre conducted by the Israeli occupation army on people who waited for aid trucks at the Nabulsi roundabout”.

### Sri Lanka’s RAMIS online tax collection system “not operatable”: IT Minister

*2024-02-29 20:51:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-ramis-online-tax-collection-system-not-operatable-it-minister-152567/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s online tax collection system RAMIS is “not operatable”, and the Ministry of Information Technology is ready to do for an independent audit to find the shortcomings, State IT Minister Kanaka Herath said.

The Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) was introduced to the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) when the island nation signed for its 16th International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme in 2016.

However, trade unions at the IRD protested the move, claiming that the system was malfunctioning despite billions being spent for it amid allegations that the new system was reducing the direct contacts between taxpayers and the IRD to reduce corruption.

The RAMIS had to be stopped after taxpayers faced massive penalties because of blunders made by heads of the IT division, computer operators and system errors at the IRD, government officials have said.

### Women who postpone fertility

*2024-02-29 20:43:27* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/கருத்தரிப்பதை-தள்ளிப்போடும்-பெண்கள்/175-334014) · `ta`

The total fertility rate refers to the number of average children who give birth in her lifetime.

In South Korea, fertility rate decline and population decline has become the main issue. South Korea is the only country in the countries of the Economic Cooperation and Development System, the only country that is less than 1 percent of fertility rate.

Total fertility rate refers to the number of average children who give birth to a woman in her lifetime. The average number of children in the South Korean woman's life was 0.78 by 2022. Korean statistical data suggest that it declined to 0.72 by 2023.

The government spends several crores of rupees to change this trend that led to the decline of population. However, women are postponing fertilization because they are worried about their career improvement, income and the costs of raising children, or without having to have children. Due to this, the total fertility rate continues to decline.
