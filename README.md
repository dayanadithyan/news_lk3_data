### Weather, economy and fate of cricket team

It’s growing hotter by the day. Last Saturday the temperature in Colombo rose to around 89 degrees Fahrenheit.

Forecasters have predicted that there will be no let-up in the spell of hot weather. Rather they are warning that temperatures will rise further by April when the sun will be directly over Lanka.

Doctors also warn the public to avoid strenuous labour, to wear white clothing that absorbs solar energy and drink more water. A difficulty here is that our reservoirs are running low on water supplies. The Department of Irrigation is requesting the public to reduce the consumption of water!

The irony of it all is that the Department of Meteorology warned us of the impending dry spell around mid-last year. In this column we have constantly drawn attention to the need to dredge our ancient tanks and the need for clearing waterways which feed the tanks, thereby enhancing the collection of greater quantities of water.

People’s sovereignty has been stolen, taken away, and virtually installed in the hands of individual parties

Chapter I of the Constitution specifies, the people, the state and sovereignty. It has several clauses and sub-clauses on how the three pillars: Executive, Legislator and Judiciary should function harmoniously and in compliance thus adhering to people’s sovereignty. However, the mandate given to both Executive and Legislator has been grossly violated undermining people’s power delegated to elected

The recent two events, the online bill and the appointing of IGP, are good examples that led to controversies. The online bill was passed despite Supreme Court rulings and appointing the IGP by manipulation of vote counts of the Constitutional Council (CC) by the Speaker who is the chairman of CC, eligible for casting vote only in the event of equal “Yes” against “No”.

Russia launched one of its biggest missile and drone barrages on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure overnight into Friday since the start of its full-scale invasion more than two years ago.

Ukrainian officials said at least 10 of the country’s regions were struck in an attack targeting power supplies in multiple towns and cities, including Kharkiv in the east, Odesa on the coast and Kryvyi Rih in the center.

The attacks have left well over 1 million households without electricity Friday morning, according to reports from multiple regional authorities. Only Kyiv and the northwest of the country were spared.

Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had “launched a massive strike” on Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex” in response to recent strikes on Russia’s territory. Ukraine’s military – as well as pro-Ukrainian groups of Russian fighters – have this month targeted Russia’s border regions of Belgorod and Kursk, forcing schools to close and residents to evacuate.

Last Saturday, it was thrilling – 15 years later – to do as my son Amrit and I in 2009, building on the success of the unique facility with the renewed Dilmah Conservation ‘Elephant Knowledge Walk’.
