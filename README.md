In the past, the governments used to allocate funds to MPs in the opposition to carry out development projects of their choice in their constituencies. However, such allocations have not taken place for the past five years, Instead, financial allocations for the same purpose were channeled through the district coordinating committees during the period.

The current government has implemented the project and some SJB MPs have secured allocations according to a renewed criterion introduced by the government led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to make sure that money is not used for charity work but employment generation activities.

The Government is maintaining a deafening silence on the investigations over a number of emblematic cases.

Current President then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had in 2015 assured justice over the murders, including that of former Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge and rugger player Wasim Thajudeen.

However, President Wickremesinghe and his administration have not provided any assurances to the families of the victims since taking office after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced out of office.

Dr. Kasippillai Manoharan, whose 20-year-old son, Ragihar, was among the five youths killed in Trincomalee in 2006, told Daily Mirror he has not heard anything from the Government over the investigations.

Known as the ‚ÄòTrinco Five‚Äô case, five Tamil students were killed on January 2, 2006, allegedly by the security forces at point-blank range.

Dr. Manoharan said that Amnesty International had been pursuing his son‚Äôs case and now another foreign individual was assisting to ensure justice.

### The Iran-Israel conflict leaves Lanka at crossroads - EDITORIAL

Israel‚Äôs misguided (as the US President chooses to call it) attack on the Iranian Consulate in Syria, the retaliatory strikes by Iran on Israel and counter-strikes by Israel on Iran have set West Asia (referred to as the Middle East by the US and the West) in flames. By these actions, the taboo against direct attacks on each other has now disappeared.

If there is another round-a conflict over Iran‚Äôs nuclear advances or another strike by Israel on Iranian military officers- both sides will feel free to launch direct attacks on the other.

Relations reached a point of no return on April 1, 2024 when an Israeli air strike destroyed the Iranian Consulate annex building in Syria killing 16 people, including a senior Quds Force Commander.

At one point, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin even referred to Iran as one¬† of Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúbest friends.‚Äù However, sentiments shifted rapidly, and¬† Rabin later characterized Ayatollah Khomeini‚Äôs regime as ‚Äúdark‚Äù and¬† ‚Äúmurderous.‚Äù

Global oil and gold prices surged, while stock markets plummeted, in the wake of reports that Israel had launched missiles at several sites in Iran.

Iran and Israel were once close allies during the reign of the Shah, as they shared common geopolitical interests and concerns regarding Arab nationalism. However, with the establishment of the Islamic Republic following the 1979 Islamic Revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini‚Äôs rise to power,Khomeini severed diplomatic ties with Israel and adopted a firm anti-Zionist stance.

After the stabilization of the country's financial situation, people's lives have returned to normal. The prices of essential commodities have been reduced.

The government's decisions to address the economic crisis have been successful. Our success has emerged in New Year's celebrations.

United People's Liberation Front called for the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna to come up with a public debate on the country's economic situation. But the debate is still in a state of disrepair.

The United Nations on Sunday urged Sri Lanka to bridge its ‚Äúaccountability deficit‚Äù and ensure justice as the country commemorated the 279 victims of its worst-ever attack against civilians five years ago.

The UN‚Äôs top envoy to the country, Marc-Andre Franche, told a remembrance service in Colombo that there should be a ‚Äúthorough and transparent investigation‚Äù to uncover those behind the Easter carnage in 2019.

Islamist bombers hit three churches and three hotels in the island‚Äôs deadliest suicide attack aimed at civilians, but grieving families say they are still waiting for justice.

Among the dead were 45 foreigners, including tourists visiting the island a decade after the end of a brutal ethnic conflict that had claimed more than 100,000 lives since 1972.

‚ÄúSri Lanka suffers from a continuing accountability deficit, be it for alleged war crimes, more recent human rights violations, corruption or abuse of power, which must be addressed if the country is to move forward,‚Äù Franche said.

The United Nations on Sunday urged Sri Lanka to bridge its ‚Äúaccountability deficit‚Äù and ensure justice as the country commemorated the 279 victims of its worst-ever attack against civilians five years ago.

The UN‚Äôs top envoy to the country, Marc-Andre Franche, told a remembrance service in Colombo that there should be a ‚Äúthorough and transparent investigation‚Äù to uncover those behind the Easter carnage in 2019.

Islamist bombers hit three churches and three hotels in the island‚Äôs deadliest suicide attack aimed at civilians, but grieving families say they are still waiting for justice.

Among the dead were 45 foreigners, including tourists visiting the island a decade after the end of a brutal ethnic conflict that had claimed more than 100,000 lives since 1972.

‚ÄúSri Lanka suffers from a continuing accountability deficit, be it for alleged war crimes, more recent human rights violations, corruption or abuse of power, which must be addressed if the country is to move forward,‚Äù Franche said.
