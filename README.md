### Sri Lanka approves lifting some limits on rupee conversion for outward remittances

Sri Lanka has approved gradually lifting some limits on converting rupees to foreign exchange for outward remittances and the new directions will be presented to parliament for approval, cabinet spokesperson Bandula Gunawardane said on Tuesday.

The island nation’s central bank had suspended permission to remit funds for overseas investments by Sri Lankan residents from mid-2020 except under certain conditions.

“Sri Lanka’s reserves have gradually improved and limits will be increased under the guidance of the central bank,” Gunawardane told reporters during the weekly cabinet briefing.

The country of 22 million people is slowly recovering from its worst financial crisis in decades, which sent the economy into freefall with soaring inflation, currency depreciation and low foreign reserves.

Sri Lanka’s official reserves stood at $4.4 billion at the end of 2023, an increase of 22% according to the central bank. About $1.5 billion of the reserves is a Chinese yuan-denominated swap.

### Election ’24: Judicial Evolution, Power Devolution, and a New Tamil Leader

*2024-02-06 11:59:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/election-24-judicial-evolution-power-devolution-and-a-new-tamil-leader/) · `en`

Sunday this week marks Sri Lanka’s 76th independence anniversary. By President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s reckoning another twenty four years will have to go by before Sri Lanka’s economy could fully recovery from the man made crisis it contracted two years ago. And what is immediately ahead is a “grueling recovery path.” That is the grim warning of Dushni Weerakoon, the respected Economist.

Another Economist from abroad, Prof. Mick Moore, who coined the phrase “man-made crisis” to describe Gota’s debacle, has now advised that it is time for Sri Lanka to have an “authentic finance minister” after more than 30 years. Like the UB Wanninayake’s, NM Perera’s and Ronnie de Mel’s of old. Not the tandem Executive President / Finance Minister model of today.
