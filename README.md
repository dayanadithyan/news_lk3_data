வரி செலுத்துவோர் அடையாள இலக்கம் (TIN) பெற்றவர்கள் வரி செலுத்துமாறு உள்நாட்டு இறைவரித் திணைக்களத்திடம் இருந்து கடிதங்கள் அல்லது குறுஞ்செய்திகள் அனுப்பப்பட்டுள்ளன.

எனினும், அவர்களின் மாதாந்த வருமானம் ஒரு இலட்சத்தினை தாண்டாது இருப்பின் வரி செலுத்த தேவையில்லை என்று நிதி இராஜாங்க அமைச்சர் கலாநிதி ரஞ்சித் சியம்பலாபிட்டிய தெரிவித்தார்.

இது தொடர்பில் அருகில் உள்ள உள்நாட்டு இறைவரி திணைக்கள பிராந்திய அலுவலகத்திற்கு அறிவிக்க முடியும் எனவும் அமைச்சர் கூறியுள்ளார்.

இதுவரை 23 இலட்சம் பேர் TIN நம்பர் பெற்றுள்ளதுடன்,  ஜூன் மாதத்தில் மட்டும் 13 இலட்சம் பேர் பெற்றுள்ளனர்.

இந்த நிலையில், ஜூலை மாத இறுதிக்குள் டின் எண்கள் வழங்கப்பட்டவர்களின் எண்ணிக்கையை 73 இலட்சமாக உயர்த்தலாம் என அமைச்சர் நம்பிக்கை வெளியிட்டார்.

Keir Starmer will be Britain’s next prime minister with his centre left Labour Party expected to win a huge majority in a parliamentary election, ending 14 years of often tumultuous Conservative government by trouncing Rishi Sunak’s party.

With many results still to be announced from Thursday’s vote, centre-left Labour has already won more than 326 of the 650 seats in parliament, with an exit poll suggesting it would capture about 410.

On a humiliating night for Sunak, the Conservatives have so far only won 70 and were predicted to suffer the worst performance in the party’s long history with voters punishing them for a cost of living crisis, failing public services, and a series of scandals.

“Tonight, people here and around the country have spoken and they’re ready for change, to end the politics of performance, a return to politics as public service,” Starmer said after winning his seat in London.

“The change begins right here ... You have voted. It is now time for us to deliver.”

### Why parate is so hot these days

The Parate is not that draconian as most of the people see it. Firstly it applies only for loans of which the capital is Rs. 5 million or above. In practice, no bank will exercise the Parate Right until a borrower fails to repay 7/8 instalments or more. The bank as much as possible negotiates with the borrower and carefully listens to the reasons of the borrower’s failure. Banks will in the first instance endeavour to understand whether the default is due to the own negligence of the borrower or due to something beyond his control. Even in the case of own negligence the bank will warn the borrower and try to correct him, leaving aside the Parate. When the default is beyond the control of the borrower, banks give them sound concessions based on case by case

Once the parate is abolished as proposed, the borrowers who are repaying satisfactorily will also, without thinking twice, refrain from repaying their loans

The Joint Working Framework negotiated with the AHG provides a fair balance of risk sharing and sufficiently addresses the concerns of Sri Lanka and the requirements of bondholders. The MLB structure, following the adjustments made through the evolution of the proposed instrument, enables the appropriate sharing of upside between creditors and the debtor, whilst also ensuring that in this process, the debt sustainability of the debtor sovereign is not compromised. These terms require formal confirmation by the Secretariat of the Official Creditor Committee and the IMF staff in order to confirm conformity with comparability of treatment requirements and compliance with Sri Lanka’s IMF program debt sustainability targets

The negotiated Joint Working Framework enables a fair sharing of upside or downside between creditors and Sri Lanka in case of an economic over-performance or under-performance by Sri Lanka

### On a merry-go-round with “debt sustainability”

SL people have been left totally out of the whole process of “debt restructuring” and in the dark on “conditions and measures” the Wickremesinghe Government has agreed to

One major reason there is no transparency in any of the transactions President Wickremesinghe entered into with the IMF and in debt restructuring, is untold geo-political tie-ups. I doubt the President would ever be transparent and accountable to the people with numerous geo-political obligations that would have to remain out of public eye. But people have a right to know the conditions they are tied to in “deferring bi-lateral loan instalment payments”

Sri Lanka signing agreements with bi-lateral lenders Japan, China and India to restructure external debts has received calculated praise from SJB leadership and from the IMF with expectations. Japan congratulated Sri Lanka for effectively “managing debt obligations”.

### Imputed Rental Income Tax: A poisoned chalice?

While the IMF staff report offered a foundational framework for the proposed IRIT, recent pronouncements from the Government hint at potential divergences from the outlined plan

While the IMF recommends a wider tax net with progressive rates, the current Income Tax system, with its narrow base and high rates, suggests that policymakers might prioritise other approaches. Additionally, the IMF criticises the “Net Annual Value” concept for its reliance on exemptions (such as exempting the primary residence) and the use of assessed values. This raises the question: “Is there a contradiction between the vision of the IMF with regard to the Tax Base pertaining to IRIT and the intention of the Government”?

As per the recently published IMF Staff Level Report, it is expected that the Imputed Rental Income Tax (IRIT) would be implemented before the beginning of the tax year, April 2025.
