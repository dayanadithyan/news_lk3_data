### Sri Lanka to shut oil refinery for ‘turnaround’ maintenance

*2024-03-02 06:22:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-shut-oil-refinery-for-turnaround-maintenance-152743/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation said its refinery will be shut for 45 days for scheduled ‘turnaround’ maintenance, which is required every three years.

“This is a mandatory requirement, in compliance with international norms, that qualifies the refinery for safe and reliable operation for a further 03 years,” CPC said in a statement.

“Once the refinery is brought back on stream after the Turnaround, it will be subjected to upgrades designed to increase its contribution to Sri Lanka’s changing product requirements.”

CPC will maintain a buffer stock of double the demand of refined products during the shut down period.

Sri Lanka’s 50,000 barrels per day refinery produces a relatively large share of furnace oil and is more geared to refining light crudes. (Colombo/Mar02/2024)

### Elon Musk sues ChatGPT-maker OpenAI over Microsoft links

*2024-03-02 03:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/elon-musk-sues-chatgpt-maker-openai-over-microsoft-links/) · `en`

Elon Musk is suing OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, arguing it has breached the principles he agreed to when he helped found it in 2015.

The lawsuit – which has also been filed against OpenAI boss Sam Altman – says the firm has departed from its original non-profit, open source mission.

It says instead of trying to “benefit humanity” – as it was set up to do – it is focusing on “maximising profits” for major investor Microsoft.

The firm was created with the intention of building what’s known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) – AI that can perform any task a human being is capable of.

It was also set up as a not-for-profit company, meaning it would not aim to make money.

The lawsuit, which has been filed in San Francisco, states it was under these conditions, that Mr Musk agreed to found OpenAI, along with Mr Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman. He left three years later.

Earnings from merchandise exports record marginal decline of 0.8% YoY

Sri Lanka’s merchandise trade deficit in January widened to US $ 514 million, from US $ 445 million in the corresponding month of the previous year, due to a higher increase in imports.

The deficit has expanded even when compared with December 2023, where US $ 487 million was recorded.

The provisional data released by the Central Bank this week showed that the earnings from merchandise exports recorded a marginal decline of 0.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) to US $ 971 million in January 2024, compared to US $ 978 million in January 2023.

A decline in earnings was observed in industrial exports and mineral exports, while agricultural exports increased in January 2024.

“The decline in industrial goods exports in January 2024 compared to January 2023 was mainly contributed by garments, resulting from lower exports of garments to most major markets,” the Central Bank said.

Ronnie sat for the Ceylon Civil Service (CCS) exam and joined the CCS in 1948. He served in different capacities at the Puttalam, Vavuniya and Matara Kachcheris

The new Devinuwara MP with his leftist ideology and classical oratory was an instant hit. His parliamentary speeches were very popular

### Water for Peace and Harmony

Most of us take water for granted. However, clean drinking water is essential for human life, and in these days of high temperature reaching 94°F, many people experience dehydration, and we need to drink about six litres of water a day.

Next month, the United Nations marks World Water Day, and the theme is ‘water for peace’. In a statement, the UN says, water can create peace or spark conflict. When water is scarce or polluted, or when people have unequal or no access, tensions can rise among communities and countries. More than 3 billion people worldwide depend on water that crosses national borders. Yet, only 24 countries have cooperation agreements for all their shared water.

As impacts of climate change increase and populations grow, there is an urgent need, within and among countries, to unite around protecting and conserving our most precious resource.

### Minister Douglas Devananda notes

*2024-03-02 00:04:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177717) · `ta`

Minister Douglas Devananda pointed out that the activities of the private transport servants that are inconvenienced by the people are unpleasant and that he has never wanted the political positions of selfish politics with the struggles.

The Minister stressed the meeting on Thursday (29) at the Governor's Office to resolve the struggle carried out by the private transport service in the Northern Province.

There will be no mistakes in democratically carrying out the struggles that the private transport service will express their demands. That's their basic rights even. But the actions of the people can not be accepted for their actions that disrupt the public transport service and cause people to disrupt people.

This is a completely disgusting act. At the same time, he emphasized that it is necessary to express their demands so that such people are uncomfortable.

### Sapugaskanda refinery temporarily shut in July for ‘major turnaround’

*2024-03-01 23:57:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97673/sapugaskanda-refinery-temporarily-shut-in-july-for-major-turnaround) · `en`

The daily operations of Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery will be temporarily halted for 45 days starting this July for a major turnaround (TAR), the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) announced on Friday (March 01).

In a statement, the CPC said this essential maintenance and repair process is mandatory, in compliance with international norms, to ensure safe and reliable operations at the refinery for three more years.

Sapugaskanda oil refinery’s previous TAR took place in February 2021.

Once the facility resumes functions after the pre-planned extensive maintenance and repair operation, the CPC said it will be subjected to upgrades designed to boost its contribution to Sri Lanka’s changing product requirements.

During the period the refinery remains shut, the CPC will maintain a buffer stock of refined products to ensure an uninterrupted supply.

### Modi’s civilisational duty and connectivity bordering soft colonisation

*2024-03-01 23:23:05* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Modi-s-civilisational-duty-and-connectivity-bordering-soft-colonisation/4-759067) · `en`

Never in the history of independent Sri Lanka (SL) had its economic ties with neighbouring India grown so strategic and deep as during Prime Minister Modi’s decade from 2014 to the present. During that decade, SL had seen seven prime ministers and four presidents of whom a couple had been re-elected or appointed to those positions more than once. But what made Indo-Lanka economic connections so strategic and deep is the island’s rapid descent into financial bankruptcy and economic chaos in 2021 because of systemic mismanagement over several decades.

Even then and historically, although India’s economy is a giant in comparison to that of tiny SL, in terms of GDP per capita and measures of economic development and welfare the island had an enviable record in comparison to her neighbour. In other words, SL did not have the necessity to beg for economic assistance from India as long as the doors of trade and commerce were kept open.

### UN’s credibility at stake—as Russia and Israel continue to remain defiant

Israeli missile strikes have caused widespread destruction in Gaza – Pic credit: World Health Organization (WHO)

UNITED NATIONS (IPS): The two devastating military conflicts—Russia vs. Ukraine and Israel vs. Hamas—have exposed once again the stark reality that the United Nations, created 79 years ago to maintain international peace and security, has failed in its political mission – while its credibility is at stake.

Russia is accused of violating the UN charter by invading a sovereign nation state and causing hundreds and thousands of deaths over two years — with no signs of a peaceful settlement.

The accusations against Israel include war crimes, genocide, ethnic cleansing and the disproportionate killings of over 30,000 civilians, mostly women and children in Gaza—in retaliation for 1,200 killings by Hamas last October.

### Best option is to seek an interpretation from Supreme Courts: Minister

*2024-03-01 23:01:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Best-option-is-to-seek-an-interpretation-from-Supreme-Courts-Minister/108-278055) · `en`

Colombo, March 01 (Daily Mirror) - The best option to determine whether the course of action followed by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana in appointing Deshabandu Tennakoon as the IGP is to seek an interpretation from the Supreme Court, Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today.

Minister Rajapaksa came out with this remark, speaking to journalists after the inauguration of a road development project in Pannipitiya, Colombo. “It is best that Supreme Court gives an interpretation of the action taken by the Speaker,” he said.

Also, he said the Executive does not have any power to influence the Constitutional Council in any way.

He said the issue which the Speaker has faced when appointing the IGP is the non-appointment of the member of the constitutional council (CC) who represents minority parties.
