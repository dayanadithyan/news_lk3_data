### A Bleak Forecast For 2024 & Beyond: Politics (Security), Economics & Military

This piece uses the vast amount of information on the web, social-media, broadcasts and news sites. My role is to use what limited intelligence providence has endowed me with to select and filter. I hope this will be of service to readers who do not have the patience to explore all the available information themselves. Nations are fretful above all else of existential concerns, that is politics in the sense of security, not politics in the familiar but vulgar sense of endemic corruption. Once existence is assured the second matter to focus on is material wellbeing; prosperity, employment, wealth and so on broadly falling under the umbrella term ‘the economy’. My accent in this piece is on the Great Powers (America, China and Russia) though discussion of the Middle East (the Muslim World and Israel) is unavoidable.

### Sajith urges Speaker to postpone parliamentary debate on Online Safety Bill

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has written to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena urging the postponement of the upcoming parliamentary debate on the Online Safety Bill.

The Second Reading of the Online Safety Bill is scheduled for January 23 and 24, as per a decision taken by the Committee on Parliamentary Business earlier this month.

In his letter, Premadasa pointed out that, if passed, the Bill would permit the proposed Online Safety Commission and the minister in charge of the subject to exercise unlimited powers, restricting the people’s right to freedom of speech and expression.

In other countries of the world, adequate time and an opportunity to create wide public space are given before bringing forth such Bills, the opposition leader said, alleging that the government has not followed such process when presenting the Online Safety Bill.

Instead of protecting the victims of online harassment, this Bill will only serve political interests, Premadasa said further.

The measles vaccination rollout was kicked off after observing a decrease in measles vaccination rates both globally and regionally during the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

Epidemiology Unit says this decrease resulted in a significant surge in the incidence of measles cases on both a global and regional level.

Adding to this global challenge, Sri Lanka is currently experiencing an imported Measles outbreak since May 2023.

A considerable number of cases have been reported to date predominantly among vaccine refusal communities and subsequently spreading to those who were partially vaccinated (between 9 months - 3 years), the Epidemiology Unit emphasized.

### Pathfinder calls for streamlining overseas missions

COLOMBO (News 1st) – Founder of the Pathfinder Foundation Milinda Moragoda called Sri Lanka to slash its overstretched network of overseas missions, citing outdated practices and resource constraints in a connected world.

Moragoda advocated a "zero-based budgeting" approach, scrutinizing each mission's value and suggesting a 10-mission reduction.

He said, "At present, Sri Lanka has over 60, most of which are understaffed and under-resourced. In telling contrast, Singapore, with foreign exchange reserves of close to USD 325 billion, has around 50."

He said savings could bolster remaining embassies, prioritizing functionality, affordability, and national interest.

Empowering select missions for regional oversight, with ambassadors potentially stationed at the foreign ministry, is another proposal. He argued that this mirrors Singapore's efficiency and adaptability.

### Japan makes history, becoming fifth country to land spacecraft on moon

*2024-01-20 09:43:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96559/japan-makes-history-becoming-fifth-country-to-land-spacecraft-on-moon) · `en`

Japan on Saturday became the fifth country to put a spacecraft on the moon, but solar power issues threatened to cut short the nation’s mission to prove a “precision” landing technology and revitalise a space programme that has suffered setbacks.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said its Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) landed the moon’s surface at around 12:20 a.m. (1520 GMT Friday), but its solar panels were not able to generate electricity, possibly because they are angled wrong.

JAXA prioritised the transfer of SLIM’s data to earth as the probe relied only on its battery, which would last for “a few hours” despite “life-sustaining treatments” such as turning off its heater, Hitoshi Kuninaka, the head of JAXA’s research centre, told a press conference.

JAXA will maintain the status quo rather than take risky actions and hopes a shift in the sunlight’s angle will hit the panels in a way that can restore its functions, he added.
