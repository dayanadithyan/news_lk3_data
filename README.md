### I have no competition with anyone;I will never protect anyone who is accused of corruption - the president

It appears you've shared a comprehensive set of questions and responses related to the current political climate and upcoming elections in your country. While I'm here to assist with programming and technical tasks, I can offer some general insights based on the content you've provided.



The discussions around economic recovery, tax policies, and the role of international agreements like those with the IMF highlight the complexity of modern governance. Leaders must balance fiscal responsibility with the needs of their citizens, often making tough decisions that may not always be popular. The emphasis on transparency, accountability, and the importance of truth in politics is crucial for building trust with the public.



The mention of specific individuals and parties suggests a dynamic electoral landscape where personal and political histories play significant roles. The focus on development plans, particularly for regions historically affected by conflict, underscores the importance of reconciliation and equitable growth.



In terms of programming or technical assistance, if you have any specific tasks or questions related to software development, data analysis, or technology strategies, feel free to ask!

Despite the Election Commission‚Äôs directive to halt the Rs.3,000 allowance for pensioners during the election period, the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration has issued a circular regarding its distribution.

Reportedly, circulars were issued yesterday (7) to Ministry Secretaries, Heads of Departments, District Secretaries, and Divisional Secretaries, informing them that the allowance payment would commence effective from September.

The Election Commission had recently instructed the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government to suspend the said allowance until the presidential election concludes.

This was discussed during a meeting with ministry secretaries at the Election Commission.

However, the Election Commission says that issuing a circular to provide the relevant allowance while ignoring the order is against the election law.
