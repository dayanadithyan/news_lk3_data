நாட்டின் பொருளாதாரம் வீழ்ச்சியடைந்த ஒவ்வொரு சந்தர்ப்பத்திலும் ஐக்கிய தேசிய கட்சியே அதனைக் கட்டியெழுப்ப நடவடிக்கை எடுத்துவந்துள்ளது. என்றாலும் எமது வேலைத்திட்டத்தை பூரணப்படுத்துவதற்கு முன்னர் எங்களை வீட்டுக்கு அனுப்பினார்கள். ஆனால் இந்த முறை மக்கள் சரியான தீர்மானத்தை எடுக்காவிட்டால் நாடு பாதாளத்துக்கே சென்றுவிடும் என ஐக்கிய தேசிய கட்சியின் உபதலைவர் அகிலவிராஜ் காரியவசம் தெரிவித்தார்.

ஐக்கிய தேசிய கட்சியின் கம்பஹா மாவட்ட சம்மேளனம் ஞாயிற்றுக்கிழமை (11) யக்கல பிரதேச சபை  கேட்போர் கூடத்தில் இடம்பெற்றது. அதில் கலந்துகொண்டு உரையாற்றுகையிலேயே இவ்வாறு தெரிவித்தார்.

சர்வதேச நாடுகளின் உதவி இல்லாமல் வீழ்ச்சியடைந்திருக்கும் நாட்டின் பொருளாதாரத்தைக் கட்டியெழுப்ப முடியாது. அதனை விளங்கிக்கொண்டதாலே ஜனாதிபதி சர்வதேச நாடுகளுக்கு விஜயம் மேற்கொண்டு, அந்த நாடுகளின் உதவிகளைப் பெற்றுக்கொள்ள நடவடிக்கை எடுத்து வருகிறார். ஆனால் ஜனாதிபதியின் இந்த சர்வதேச விஜயங்களை எதிர்க்கட்சி அரசியல் வாதிகள் தொடர்ந்து விமர்சனம் செய்து வந்தார்கள். ஆனால் தற்போது அவர்களும் சர்வதேச நாடுகளைச் சுற்றிவர ஆரம்பித்துள்ளனர்.

### Air quality in several districts drop to unhealthy levels

*2024-02-11 18:55:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97187/air-quality-in-several-districts-drop-to-unhealthy-levels-) · `en`

The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) has warned that the quality of air in parts of the island has dropped further to unhealthy levels.

Accordingly, the NBRO highlighted that apart from Nuwara Eliya, the air quality in all other districts is at an unhealthy level, with Colombo, Kandy and Jaffna recording particularly high levels of unhealthy air quality.

The NBRO further warned that according to the US Air Quality Index (AQI), the quality of air recorded in Colombo, Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Badulla, Kurunegala, Kandy and Matale is likely to cause adverse health effects.

The NBRO says that an influx of dust particles contaminating Sri Lanka’s air space through strong winds from neighbourng countries and the extreme dry weather are likely causes for this alarming drop in air quality.

Thus, the NBRO urged for those suffering from respiratory or cardiac diseases, and elderly persons and children to wear face masks when outdoors.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s recent visit to India, on an invitation extended by the Indian government, underlies a tectonic shift in Sri Lankan politics, a sign of things to come.

The responses to the visit by other parties have, so far, been lukewarm. The UNP’s Vajira Abeywardena, for instance, welcomed the move, and stated that his party hoped the JVP-NPP would contribute towards national policies which would “revive the nation”, adding that he looked forward to seeing the party work with the UNP, just as it had worked before with Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa.

### Hungarian President resigns over child sexual abuse pardon

*2024-02-11 08:42:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97177/hungarian-president-resigns-over-child-sexual-abuse-pardon) · `en`

(Reuters) - Hungarian President Katalin Novak resigned on Saturday after coming under mounting pressure for pardoning a man convicted of helping to cover up sexual abuse in a children’s home.

Novak, a close ally of conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orban, resigned a week after her presidential pardon was first reported by local news site 444.hu.

The revelation caused a public uproar and demands from the opposition for her and former Justice Minister Judit Varga to quit. Varga, who has been a rising star in Orban’s ruling Fidesz party, resigned as a lawmaker on Saturday.

The scandal was a rare setback for Orban, who has been in power since 2010, and who faces European parliament elections just as the country emerges from an inflation crisis.
