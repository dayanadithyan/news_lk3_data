### Guns and Sri Lankan ‘Roses’ - EDITORIAL

*2024-01-26 00:38:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Guns-and-Sri-Lankan-Roses-EDITORIAL/172-275724) · `en`

Yesterday was a Poya Day (Duruthu Poya), and people placed flowers in front of Buddha statues all over the country, but we can safely say that roses have not been the favourite of Buddhists. This isn’t because roses are criminally expensive, but because this religion doesn’t have a close relationship with the ‘rose’. Buddhists prefer the lotus when an offering needs to be done; largely due to the lessons the flower symbolises.

But roses have entered our culture and quite secretly encroached the minds of peace-loving people as well as rebels and protesters. We remember in 2022 April (8) how a female undergraduate went in front of a barricade near the Sri Lankan Parliament and offered a rose to the Police, who were in their numbers to quell a protest. That gesture was ‘sweet’ like the rose itself, but those who love roses can love guns as well; in case you’re pushed to the wall and there is no solace from the law.

Palestinians fleeing Khan Yunis on a donkey cart with their belongings as Israel pressed its blistering assault on the city yesterday. AFP

As Israel’s inhuman onslaught on the Gaza Strip continues, the talk of a two-state solution is being bandied about by world leaders, especially those from the Global South.

Though the two-state solution requires thorough scrutiny and resurrection, some see this as an attempt to deflect global attention from the Gaza horror, which has killed more than 25,000 people; 70 percent of them being women and children. Whether this horror is gross genocide will be known today when the International Court of Justice delivers its provisional order.

The new law has come under fire for the problematic aspects of several clauses of the Bill, which threaten the freedom of expression, innovation and privacy.

Chung emphasized that the ‘vague and overly restrictive’ Online Safety Bill can hinder investment and development of a digital economy, undermining Sri Lanka’s much-needed economic growth.

On that account, the United States has urged the Sri Lankan authorities to prioritize transparency and ensure any legislation does not stifle the voices of its people.

Mr Rubiales grabbed Ms Hermoso's head and kissed her during the presentation after Spain's victory in Australia.

She said the kiss was "not consensual", a statement denied by Mr Rubiales.

A judge has found there is enough evidence for the matter to proceed to trial.

During a hearing at the Audencia Nacional, or High Court, in Madrid, the judge described the kiss as "not consensual and... a unilateral and surprising initiative".

Penalties for such a kiss range from a fine to four years in prison.

Colombo (News 1st) – The humble tea pluckers of Sri Lanka’s central highlands may not know it, but their world famous cuppa is at the centre of an unusual storm that is brewing between the United States and the United Kingdom.

On Wednesday (24th), the UK Cabinet Office put out an official statement, disputing the method of making tea that had been suggested by the U.S. embassy in London.

”In response, to the statement put out by the US Embassy in the UK: We appreciate our Special Relationship, however, we must disagree wholeheartedly… Tea can only be made using a kettle.” the UK Cabinet Office said on X (formerly Twitter).

Hours before, the US embassy had stated, perhaps tongue in cheek, that the proper way to brew a cuppa is “by microwaving it”.

The British drink an estimated 100 million cups of tea a day, and consider it their national drink.
