тАЬAdditionally, the President highlighted the importance of promoting the Tamil language alongside Sinhala. He noted that with the┬аanticipated economic growth in Tamil Nadu soon, Tamil-speaking Sri Lankans would have unique opportunities that others might not have.тАЭ

My salute to the people of Bangladesh led by their student youth, who have overthrown an autocrat in an unarmed uprising, sacrificing over 300 lives. We can also be proud of ourselves as Sri Lankans, since the autocrat mentioned our Aragalaya as an inspiration for the Bangladeshi youth. So much for so-called тАШanti-imperialistsтАЩ who revile it and are suspicious of PeopleтАЩs Power revolts.

In Sri LankaтАЩs election season, wannabe tyrants should tremble, and be deterred from any power-grab they may be planning.

TV news has shown President Wickremesinghe saying repeatedly on his recent visits to the North and East that тАЬin this country we have 10 governments, 9 of which are Provincial GovernmentsтАЭ.
