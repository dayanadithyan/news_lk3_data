Prabowo had about 58% of votes according to four pollsters, based on ballots counted in a sample of voting stations nationwide. The number of votes they had tallied ranged from about 52% to 67% as of 0912 GMT.

Rivals Anies Baswedan and Ganjar Pranowo had about 25% and 17% respectively, according to the independent pollsters that were conducting “quick counts” at the close of voting.

Counts by reputable outlets have proven to be accurate in previous elections. An official result is not expected until several weeks after the vote.

The pattern could signal a first round win for Prabowo. To win in a single round, a candidate needs more than 50% of votes cast and 20% of the ballot in half of the country’s provinces.

If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held in June.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka continues to lag behind in its integration into global production networks due to short-sighted goals of producing non-tradables over tradable goods that can be exported, oppositional legislator Harsha De Silva has said.

“There has been a significant growth in the non-tradable sector and production of non-tradable goods between 2010 and 2019. From the growth in the total economy’s production, 70 percent was from the non-tradables sector which cannot be traded in the international market,” the opposition MP said during a debate in Parliament recently.

Non-tradable goods include items such as public services, real estate and construction, goods with very high transportation costs, and commodities produced specifically to meet local retail consumers.

The MP said that due to shortsighted large infrastructure investments such as the development that has gone into the Hambantota area, Sri Lanka’s production has shown exponential growth in the non-tradables sector.
