மக்கள் இறக்கும் போது நாட்டை விட்டுக்கொடுக்கும் எவரும் உண்மையான புரட்சியாளர்கள் அல்ல. நாடு வீழ்ச்சியடையும் போது மக்கள் இறப்பதைத் தடுக்கும் புரட்சிகரமான சவாலை ஏற்றுக்கொண்டவர் ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்ரமசிங்கவாகும் என  தொழில் மற்றும் வெளிநாட்டு வேலைவாய்ப்பு அமைச்சர் மனுஷ நாணயக்கார தெரிவித்தார். அம்பாறையில் ஞாயிற்றுக்கிழமை (23) இடம்பெற்ற ‘ஸ்மார்ட் யூத் கிளப்’ நிகழ்ச்சியில் கலந்துகொண்டு கருத்து தெரிவிக்கும் போதே இவ்வாறு தெரிவித்தார்.

கடந்த காலங்களில் வடக்கு மற்றும் தெற்கில் உள்ள இளைஞர்களின் இலக்குகள் தவறான திசையில் திசைதிருப்பப்பட்டன. இதனால் நாடு வீழ்ச்சியடைந்ததுடன், இளைஞர்கள் தமது ஆற்றலைச் சரியான திசையில் செலுத்தவில்லை.

சேகுவேரா ஒரு புரட்சியாளர். அதனால்தான் அவரைப் படித்து நம்பும் இளம் தலைமுறையினர் இருக்கிறார்கள். ஒரு புரட்சியாளர்க்கு இருக்க வேண்டிய சிறந்த குணம் அன்பு என சேகுவேரா ஓர் பத்திரிகையாளரிடம் தெரிவித்தார்'  எனவே  ஒரு உண்மையான புரட்சியாளர் அன்பின் உயர்ந்த உணர்வுகளால் வழிநடத்தப்படுகிறார்.

The reports of the Auditor General over the years has been a testament to the diligence with which public officials empowered with a mandate pursue their tasks and find out the misuse of resources that has taken place. One of its reports is on a petroleum scam that has gone on for years and has come up before the Committee on Public Enterprises in parliament. The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has refused approval to award procurement of the 484 MW wind power plant in Mannar and Pooneryn to Adani Green Energy SL Ltd. (AGESL), saying the information submitted to it by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was not adequate to assess least cost and technical compatibility.

Inflation was falling, the Central Bank had just begun its interest rate easing cycle, the currency and stock market were seeing a rebound from the bottom, and tourism was starting to pick up momentum.

### Sri Lanka must renegotiate IMF Agreement for sustainable recovery from crisis

*2024-06-24 23:37:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-must-renegotiate-IMF-Agreement-for-sustainable-recovery-from-crisis/4-763403) · `en`

A minimum condition for any progressive and humane way out of this crisis is that the democratic space for citizens must be defended and extended

There should be a change of orientation in dealings with the IMF and Sri Lanka’s creditors. The aim must be to protect the living standards of the people and to promote the growth of the economy in ways that expand incomes, create good-quality jobs, and improve the trade balance. This means that the debt restructuring process has to be based on ensuring that the debt stock does not increase with interest payments; on a haircut on commercial debt that is far more than 30%; on multilateral and bilateral agencies also accepting a reduction of their contribution to the debt stock

We were invited to Sri Lanka between 9-11 June 2024, where we participated in consultations in Colombo with academics, researchers, activists and political parties.

### Request for immediate publishing of National Socio-economic Recovery Program of party for social discourse

Following is a letter to political party leaders of SLPP, SJB, JVP/NPP, SLFP, UNP, TNA and SLMC

With elections, possibly the Presidential election first, followed by a parliamentary election thereafter, we see mainstream political parties focussing on elections, with heavy criticism of previous Governments, they were also party to at different times in different alliances. It is an irony therefore, the whole focus of all Opposition parties is on “corruption and economic crisis” with no mention of their responsibility for any of them. They also have only vague deviations from the IMF Program pursued by President Wickremesinghe-led Government. Shared perception nevertheless in both the Government and the Opposition is the IMF remains the sole saviour this moment, while the crisis is not merely economic.

### New property taxes are coming: Key changes and impacts

*2024-06-24 23:28:29* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/New-property-taxes-are-coming-Key-changes-and-impacts/4-763401) · `en`

The new property taxes are on the horizon, bringing significant changes to property taxation in Sri Lanka. Here’s a brief overview of what you need to know about the new imputed rental income tax, its impact, and how it might affect your financial planning.

The primary change is the introduction of an imputed rental income tax. This tax targets the notional income homeowners could earn from renting their properties, ensuring a fair contribution to public finances. It will be implemented before 1 April 2025.

Currently, Sri Lanka does not have an imputed rental income tax. Under the new policy, owner-occupied and vacant residential properties will be taxed with an exemption threshold and graduated rates. Importantly, interest repayments on loans related to the property can reduce the taxable portion of rental income.

### Price or quality: Is NMRA barking up the wrong tree?

Instead of harping on price, however politically popular it may be, the authorities should concentrate on preserving the quality of medicines

I recently had to see my doctor (who is also a personal friend) regarding some infected skin wounds that I had developed on my forearms. Little did I know that this would lead to the horrific realisation of the problems that the public are facing when obtaining their medications.

I was prescribed a cream called Fusidic acid and the doctor, being a friend, wrote it by brand and told me that this is the original product which would be a little difficult to find. With that recommendation I went to almost a dozen pharmacies and was informed at each one that it was not available and was offered various substitutes, some of the same medicine and some of a similar nature. The reason given for unavailability was that the manufacturer had withdrawn from the country.

### Nimal prefers solo scene

*2024-06-24 23:08:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/nimal-prefers-solo-scene/) · `en`

The guy who created a sensation with the song ‘Ranpota Thelabuwa’ has decided to do his thing as a solo artiste…

Nimal Jayamanne says he quit the band scene in December last year.

“I told the boys to carry on while re-stepping into my solo career, due to personal reasons.”

The singer also worked on a new song, called ‘Mage Pana’, with a video to go with it, as well.

It was, in fact, the song ‘Ranpota Thelabuwa’ that made Nimal a star, literally, overnight.

I remember him performing this particular song at an Island Music Awards show, years ago, and the crowd response was terrific.

Probably we may see a few more big hits come our way from Nimal, now that he has decided to go solo.
