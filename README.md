ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka says bondholders have made further concessions during the latest round of negotiation which will see the present value benefit increasing from 27 percent in a July deal to 33 percent in the September deal, if the economy performs better than expected.

Sri LankaтАЩs bondholders sought so-called macro-linked bonds where the hair cut will reduce if the economy grows faster than the International Monetary Fund expects in a debt sustainability analysis.

If the economy grows as expected, bond holders will concede 40.3 percent in net present value terms at a discount factor of 11 percent, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.

The July deal with bondholders were deemed by the IMF as not meeting its debt sustainability framework, a statement said.

Compared to the July deal with bondholders, coupons at the highest economic performance level would reduce by roughly 160 basis points and second highest by 60 basis points.

It will be wise to mark a second preference in this election тАУ Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Sri Lanka awaits the election of its 10th President in a political landscape that has not been seen before in history. For the first time, at least three frontrunners are contending for the presidency тАУ as opposed to the usual bi-candidate race тАУ with a certain possibility of none achieving an over-half majority vote. This new structure of contest has affected many socio-political dimensions of the election.

However, in this article, we wish to focus on how the presence of more than two major candidates would affect the existing voting system and the mathematics governing its outcome. This simulation тАУ rather than a modelling to predict the next president of Sri Lanka тАУ is a critique of the systems designed to measure our social choice, their strengths and limitations in upholding the fundamental notions of democracy.

These voters have during all the previous elections casted the vote to the candidates of their choice. The important factor here is how they change their choice from time to time

Since of late, Sri Lankan Presidential elections have become a battleground with the number of candidates progressively growing. Last Presidential election held on 16 November 2019 fielded 36 contestants while the 2024 candidacy increased to 38 numbers but ironically due to the demise of one candidate the number came down to 37 as of today.

When we look at the results of the last Presidential election in 2019, the contest was polarised between two main candidates, and the final result was:

All 33 other candidates polled a total of 2.6% of the total valid votes with the highest polling 0.37%.

### No economic policy will work with rampant corruption

Going to the IMF 17 times is adequate proof that all economic policies of the past have not worked due to rampant corruption

Generally, at crucial times like elections, many people try to become economic wizards by expressing concerns of economic policy without having even a semblance of understanding of how a countryтАЩs economy, the Central Bank and the Treasury work, and in the present scenario, how the IMF is formed, operated and funded. It is of course trendy to say about good or bad economic policies purely to promote political bias without any knowledge in what is generally perceived as an esoteric domain.

To understand and analyse economic policies is very good. Then, policies of all competing parties ought to be critically analysed impartially. But what invariably happens is to dismiss policies of others due to preconceived notions. That is really the reluctance to deviate from narrow-minded political affiliations.

Sri LankaтАЩs ninth Presidential election will be held on Saturday 21 September. More than 17 million (17,140,354) Sri Lankans are registered as eligible voters. Nominally 38 candidates are in the ring but only three are regarded as the leading contenders. The hectic election campaigns ended on 18 September but election fever is high. A large voter turnout is expected on election day.

It is indeed an irony that there is so much of enthusiasm over the election of the executive president despite the criticism directed against the executive presidential system in past years. The Executive Presidency is blamed extensively on the one hand while the country gets involved in presidential poll excitement on the other.

### Why A Trump 2.0 Could Benefit China?

As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, the prospect of Donald TrumpтАЩs comeback to the White House has sparked considerable debate across the political spectrum both domestically and internationally. While many analysts think China fears his potential second term, there are compelling reasons to believe that the 45th presidentтАЩs return to the Oval Office could significantly benefit China. From his ambiguous stance on defending Taiwan to his history of straining transatlantic relations, which could weaken EuropeтАЩs unity and NATOтАЩs resolve, TrumpтАЩs policies may inadvertently provide strategic opportunities for Beijing. The former Apprentice hostтАЩs return, combined with his domestic controversies might shift the global balance of power and provide China with a stronger foothold to establish a тАЬnew world orderтАЭ on the world stage. This analysis explores why a Trump presidency could be advantageous for China, and what that means for international relations.
