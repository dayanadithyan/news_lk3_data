He said this during a media briefing held in Jaffna on Wednesday (31).

I have a compassion for the country now. That is, there is a situation where riots may erupt after the election. There is no one who can get fifty percent of the Sinhala candidates.

But although many people say they are contesting in the election, Ranil, Sajith and Anura are the three war.

What kind of competition is going to happen between the three.If you ask what the party's role in this election is, I think that the party will be completely destroyed if an election comes back.

That is, it is my opinion that all their seats in the south will go to the JVP party.Their betrayal of this country is in the mind.

They have been raging in this country in particular, and they have raised themselves because of the war war.All of these are well known now.
