We Sri Lankans, in the majority are fatigued with annoyance, battling rising prices, facing a gloomy future and having to contend with capricious politicians, ineffectual MPs and religious mavericks; the last of three men performing free from constraints, guidelines and permissive interpretation of Buddhism. Thus we earnestly seek personalities or events that inspire hope and admiration. This last week I read about two persons who interested me immensely, restored hope in humanity and impacted on my emotions.

Peter Julian Robin Morgan, CBE, is my first person of interest. He was born on April 19, 1963, in Wimbledon, London, to immigrant parents: father a Jew who escaped Nazi Germany in 1933 and a Roman Catholic mother who fled Poland under the Soviets. His father died when he was nine. He grew up in London and attended two schools in London and Somerset and obtained a fine arts degree from Leeds University.

Fifty years ago  in January 1974, the  International Association of Tamil Research (IATR) held the fourth World Tamil research conference  in  Jaffna. Violence was unleashed against Tamil civilians attending a cultural event linked to the conferency by a Police contingent led by the then ASP Chandrasekera. The background to the Jaffna conference and an outline of the Police attack was related in the first part of this article published last week. Further details  of the Conference and  the Police attack will be the focus in the  second and final part of  this article.

But the majority of the organizing committee wanted  it to be held in Jaffna. The disgruntled Govt acted in a puerile manner and allegedly adopted obstructionist tactics.
