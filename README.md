### Russia is the fourth economic force in the world

*2024-07-22 12:34:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189023) · `ta`

In early June, the World Bank ranked Russia as the fourth-largest economy globally based on PPP, surpassing Germany due to cheaper gas and political instability. Russia's economic growth, initially lagging, surged post-Ukraine invasion, aiming for global dominance. Despite challenges, including sanctions and a shift towards militarization, Russia's economy boomed, with the World Bank tripling its growth forecast to 3.2%. However, Russia still trails India and China in size, with the shadow economy potentially underestimating its true GDP.

🟩

According to the World Bank's data, published in early June, the Russian economy has become the fourth developed country in the world based on Purchase- Power and Balance (PPP).

According to PNE report last August, Russia has already behind Germany to become the fifth largest economy. The cheapest Russian gas was cut off, and German has now been stagnant and suffered from recent political events and fell to sixth place in the World Bank rankings.

Purchase-Power-Balance (PPP) and Gross National Production Measurement is preferred by many economists. This is because it takes into account the difference between local prices and nominal prices.

The World Bank has upgraded Russia's ranking after reviewing its data. And Russia says that Japan has actually overtaken Japan in 2021 and has since retained the fourth place since.

Its earlier calculations were based on 2017 data, but these are now updated to reflect 2021 statistics.

“We are looking at an alternate proposal which would still be under the previous plan to invite investors. It’s sensitive at the moment but we hope to announce the new plan in two to three weeks,” said a source close to the negotiating team.

“Instead, the airline will undergo restructuring under an alternate plan,” stated Sri Lankan minister of ports, shipping and aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva. However, he did not share what the alternate proposal was.
