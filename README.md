The center boasted a comprehensive array of facilities, from consultation rooms to a dedicated counseling space. Witnessing this well-equipped unit function as a whole solidified the meaning of Family Medicine translating into tangible patient care.

She got jaadi  from Aachcho (my grandmother), who boasted that her jaadi was the best in the Kalutara district. Aachcho produced jaadi at home twice a year. I remember her making Jaadi in 1963. I was then 12 years old and was on holiday at her place.

üü©

Senthil Thondaman, President of the Ceylon Workers Congress and Governor of the Eastern Province, said there was no compromise with the companies.

He said this while questioning the refusal of plantation companies after the state gazette was published on the 1,700 rupee salary increase of plantation workers.

Senthil Thondaman told the media that the Employers Federation's media spokesman Roshan Rajadurai said that the plantation workers would be paid a salary of Rs 1,200.

Initially, companies said that the salary hike could not be paid when the plantation workers were negotiated on the salary hike.. They said they were ready to pay only the promotion after heavy pressure.

In this case, the state gazette notification has been issued, and now the companies have come forward to pay a base salary of 1,200 rupees.. The company said the company could not even offer a one -rupee salary hike for a year and is now the reason why the government has come up with an increase of 200 rupees.

As each day passes and the death toll rises in Gaza, the West‚Äôs complicity in Israeli atrocities becomes clearer and sharper. South Africa‚Äôs case against Israel is a clear indictment of the Global North‚Äôs inaction regarding those atrocities. Israel‚Äôs defence team has attempted to rationalise what Israeli forces are doing in Gaza, but this has effectively been undermined by the Israeli government itself: each day, its official social media channels tweet or post one ridiculous claim against not just South Africa, but also the ICJ.

Against this backdrop, it makes very little sense to continue defending a country against which half the world has rallied in solidarity. Even Sri Lanka‚Äôs decision to send vessels to the Red Sea and local youths to Israel does not diminish its continuing support for Palestine at the United Nations, and the Foreign Ministry‚Äôs support for a two-state solution, an end to all hostilities, and a humanitarian ceasefire.

Our jackal is the only island subspecies of the Eurasian Golden Jackal across its range. Historically, it was even considered a species endemic to Sri Lanka. It is the sole wild dog on the island and stands as the third-largest carnivore present; only second to the charismatic Leopard and the sluggish Sloth Bear. These features already make it an iconic species, but for some reason, it has been overlooked. Photographers have missed its stunning moves, artists have forgotten to paint it, tourists hardly ask for sightings, and scientists failed to study it. Instead, the narrative of our Nariya is abandoned to folklore‚Äîa cunning, selfish creature, a forgotten soul that nobody really likes

### Risk for boys with bodice -powered sports materials

*2024-05-11 11:06:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183211) ¬∑ `ta`

Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa warns that sports materials containing chemicals like lithium, silver oxide, and alkaline can pose a risk to boys, potentially causing severe damage if swallowed. The short esophagus can lead to these materials reaching the stomach, causing respiratory blockage and even death. Immediate hospitalization is advised, with honey administered as first aid.

üü©

The Assistant Secretary of the Government Medical Officers Association, Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa, said that the children will be affected by the sports material.

He said that the games played by the boys may be swallowed, or that there are potentials, or the ear and nose, as the types of chemical compounds such as lithium, silver oxide and alkaline are in the form of button.

The reason is that the first part of our diet canal (esophagus) is naturally short, so that when swallowing the bark can go into the stomach and cause severe damage.

This can cause a sudden explosion in the stomach, causing respiratory tract blockage and death.

Therefore, the children should be taken to the hospital immediately if they get caught in such accidents. He said that until the first aid is taken to the hospital, two teaspoons of clean honey should be given to the affected children once in 10 minutes.

More than 100,000 packets of sliced bread have been recalled in Japan after parts of a rat's body were discovered inside two of them, the manufacturer said.

Food recalls are rare in Japan, a country with famously high standards of sanitation.

Pasco Shikishima said it is investigating how the remains of the rodent had crept into its products.

The company said it is so far unaware of anyone falling sick after eating its processed white Chojuku bread, long a staple of Japanese breakfast tables.

"We would like to apologize deeply for causing trouble to our customers and clients," the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

"We will strengthen our quality management system to ensure there won't be a recurrence," it added.
