### US approves plan to strike Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq

*2024-02-02 08:42:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96934/us-approves-plan-to-strike-iranian-targets-in-syria-and-iraq) · `en`

The US has approved plans for a series of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials have told the BBC’s US partner CBS News.

The strikes will take place over a number of days, officials said, and weather conditions will likely dictate when they are launched.

It comes after a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday.

The US blamed an Iranian-backed militia group for that attack.

That group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards force. It has said it was responsible for Sunday’s strike.

Iran, meanwhile, has denied any role in the attack which injured 41 other US troops at the military base, known as Tower 22.

US officials have said that US intelligence believes that the drone used to attack the facility was manufactured by Iran - and is similar to the drones Iran has been sending to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

The island-wide strike action launched by the collective of health sector trade unions yesterday entered its second consecutive day today (Feb.02).

President of Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) Upul Rohana said a final decision is expected to be taken on proceeding with the strike later today at the discussion planned to be convened with the participation of trade union representatives.

Health workers decided to carry on the trade union action on account of not receiving a favourable response from the government with regard to their demands.

A collective of 72 trade unions from the health sector resorted to a one-day strike across the country last morning (Feb.01), urging the government to address the issues concerning allowances without delay.

The doctors’ unions and the All Ceylon Nurses’ Union, however, decided to refrain from joining the strike action, alleging that the planned strike action was a conspiracy by the government.

### Efficient public sector operations possible with fully digitalized workforce of 200,000: Suresh Shah

*2024-02-02 06:24:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Efficient-public-sector-operations-possible-with-fully-digitalized-workforce-of-200-000-Suresh-Shah/108-276176) · `en`

The public sector can smoothly run with a workforce as low as 200,000 persons through digitalization, against the current public sector workforce of 1.3 million, according to the Head of State-Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit (SOERU) Suresh Shah.

He noted that even without digitalization, the public sector workforce can be cut by half and the public services can be maintained efficiently.

Sri Lanka’s bloated public sector shrunk by 135,000 to 1.393 million by the end of 2022 from 1.401 million in 2021 and from 1.528 million in 2020 as the government started to reduce the excess cadre while freezing recruits.

Shah claimed that if the public service is fully digitalized, the public sector cadre could be brought down to 200,000 people.

However, Shah was quick to rule out any radical move to reduce employment in the public sector.

Sri Lanka known formerly as Ceylon gained independence from British rule on 4 February 1948. The island nation celebrates the 76th anniversary of her “tryst with destiny” on Sunday. Events marking freedom day festivity are scheduled for the week-end.

Even as the greater part of the island is enveloped in a melodious mood, a discordant note is struck in the Tamil dominated Northern Province and the Tamil majority Eastern Province. The Jaffna University Students Union and organisations representing the families of disappeared persons have proclaimed 4 February 2024 as a “Kari Naal” (black or dark day) and declared it as a day of mourning.

### Electoral prospects spark optimism for Sri Lanka’s underprivileged

The forthcoming general election holds promise for Sri Lanka’s impoverished majority – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

As the spectre of a general election looms over Sri Lanka, the political elite and the economically powerful are gripped with panic. Recent newspaper articles have been rife with speculations about the potential upheaval that such an election could bring. However, amidst their apprehension, it’s crucial to recognise that elections present a beacon of hope, particularly for the impoverished masses of Sri Lanka.

The anticipation of a general election has sent shockwaves through the corridors of power, primarily because it threatens to dismantle the entrenched privileges enjoyed by a select few. Despite the prevailing economic and debt crises plaguing the nation, a significant segment of society continues to benefit from a system riddled with corruption, mismanagement, and poor governance.

### Thai central bank chief says current policy rate neutral, economy not in crisis

BANGKOK (Reuters): Thailand’s central bank chief, under fire from the prime minister for not cutting rates, said slower-than-expected economic growth was not a crisis as portrayed by the government, nor would it be revived by its quick-hit stimulus measures.

The Bank of Thailand’s current policy rate is broadly neutral, Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput told Reuters on Tuesday ahead of the central bank’s next rate meeting on 7 Feb. adding that the country was not facing a deflationary situation.

His comments came after Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin – a real estate mogul and political newcomer – urged the central bank to cut the policy rate, which is at a decade-high of 2.50%, to help revive the economy.

“If you want to raise the long-term potential growth rate, you’ve got to do the structural stuff. You’ve got to get productivity up. But the way to get there is not just by engaging in short-term stimulus type measures,” Sethaput said.

Maintains images were from a previous meeting between duo who are close friends

In a statement issued yesterday, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) denied that its latest member, former Army Commander Daya Ratnayake has defected to the Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) led by business tycoon Dilith Jayaweera.

The party was forced to issue a clarification after images depicting Ratnayake in a seemingly one-on-one discussion with Jayaweera surfaced online yesterday. The images were accompanied by reports suggesting that the two had met yesterday at the MJP office in Borella, leading to speculation that Ratnayake had left the SJB to join the MJP.

Palestinian civilians including children stage a demonstration in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, calling for continued international support to UNRWA. AFP

Peace-loving people worldwide are probably sick and tired of seeing and hearing the triumph of evil and injustice. Each time they hoped for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip so that the besieged people could breathe the air of melancholic freedom, they were dealt yet another blow by the war party.

The latest is what followed the International Court of Justice’s ruling on January 26. The world court ruled by a majority decision that Israel should “take all measures within its power” to prevent acts of genocide in the Gaza Strip. The court also ordered Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Although it stopped short of ordering a ceasefire, most jurists believe a ceasefire is implied.

ECONOMYNEXT – Some of Sri Lanka’s bondholders who were willing to negotiate a deal before a judgement was delivered in a case filed by holdout investor Hamilton Reserve, are frustrated at what is seen as no progress in discussions, sources familiar with their thinking said.

While Hamilton Reserve has gone to court claiming to represent a 250 million dollar or 25 percent share in a billion-dollar bond with a so-called ‘single series’ collective action clause, a large majority of bondholders who have other bonds, have formed a committee to negotiate with Sri Lanka.

Western governments including the US and France have asked that the court action be stayed until negotiations with other bondholders conclude, but prospects of a deal being concluded by the time the first deadline given by the court has now dimmed.

It is not clear yet whether a second extension could be obtained from court.

People's Representation: Women who entered the national politics after the death of husbands, fathers, brothers

A major issue faced by representative democracy is that women's representatives are not represented in politics compared to the population.

Countries such as Europe and the United States have made some progress in this regard, but African and Asian countries are still facing this problem.

The South Asian region is the first countries that have become the first countries that have become the leaders of the heads of state.

Despite such situations, why are women still undergoing politics in these countries?

One of those who can observe where they have been highlighted or enormous in South Asian countries from the outset since the beginning of the country, they have been the victims of their husband instead of their power.
