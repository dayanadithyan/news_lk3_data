India’s economy grew at its fastest pace in one-and-half years in the final three months of 2023, led by strong manufacturing and construction activity and bolstering Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic record just months before a national election.

Asia’s third largest economy grew 8.4% in the October-December quarter, much faster than the 6.6% estimated by economists polled by Reuters and higher than the 7.6% recorded in the previous three months.

“The ongoing growth momentum is indicative of the Indian economy’s resilience, notwithstanding global headwinds,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, economist at India Ratings, noting that industrial growth continued its good run in the quarter.

India has consistently beat market expectations and is ranked as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with China struggling to recover after the pandemic and the euro zone narrowly escaping a recession.

India revised its growth estimate for the current fiscal year to March 31 to 7.6% from 7.3%.

Colombo, March 1 (Daily Mirror) - Health experts advise parents to avoid providing their children with sweet food and beverages before they turn two years as it could affect the baby’s development.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Dr. Deepal Perera, a Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Children's Hospital in Colombo said sweet food is only recommended after infants turn two while prioritizing breast-feeding during the first six months.

“Consumption of sugar-sweetened food and beverages is linked with increased risk of overweight or obesity,” Dr Perera stressed.

“Added sugars are used in processed foods and beverages to sweeten, and differ from the natural sugars that are part of a piece of fruit or glass of milk,” he underscored.

Thus, he reiterated the importance of prioritizing breastfeeding until children turn two.

Meanwhile, the health expert cautioned people to avoid consuming food and beverages with added sugars in light of rising temperatures.
