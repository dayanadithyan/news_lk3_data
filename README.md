### The appointment of the Inspector General of Police is legally and constitutional: Speaker

*2024-07-26 11:54:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189418) ¬∑ `ta`

Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena defended the appointment of the Inspector General of Police as constitutional and correct, despite criticism. He denied allegations of wrongdoing, stating decisions were made in accordance with the constitution. The process involved the approval of both the Constituent Assembly and Parliament, marking an unprecedented move. He suggested that in cases of vacancy, there should be established procedures or judicial intervention, emphasizing that even the President cannot make such appointments unilaterally.

üü©

The police chief affair is very complicated. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said that allegations are being made against me that this situation was due to the wrong decision taken by me.

The Speaker said this while commenting on the appointment of the Inspector General of Police in Parliament today (26).

We have not taken any wrong decision. We have taken a reasonable, right resolution of the constitution deeply. That resolution may seem incorrectly for you (awakening the opposition). But we made that decision in the right way.

I have taken this decision from the house and is completely false. 41 (d) - I used the word for me in Article 5. The appointment of the Inspector General of Police with the approval of the Constituent Assembly and the approval of the Parliament was unprecedented.

So there are steps to solve this post in case of vacuum. Or the court must provide a solution for this. He said that even the president could not decide on this.

Mexican drug kingpin Ismael ‚ÄúEl Mayo‚Äù Zambada and the son of his ex-partner, Joaquin ‚ÄúEl Chapo‚Äù Guzman, were arrested on Thursday in El Paso, Texas, in a major coup for U.S. authorities that may also reshape the Mexican criminal landscape.

Both Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of El Chapo, face multiple charges in the U.S. for funneling huge quantities of drugs to U.S. streets, including fentanyl, which has surged to become the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45.

Zambada, who is believed to be in his 70s, and Guzman Lopez, who is in his 30s, were detained after landing in a private plane in the El Paso area, two U.S. officials told Reuters.
