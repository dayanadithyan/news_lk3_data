President Premadasa did not give the three UNPers nominations but appointed them to Parliament though the national list. He made one MP a member of the Cabinet and two others as State Ministers,” Marikar recalled.

### Ramadan begins in Gaza with hunger worsening and no end to the war in sight

Palestinians began fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Monday with cease-fire talks at a standstill, hunger worsening across the Gaza Strip and no end in sight to the war between Israel and Hamas.

Prayers were held outside amid the rubble of demolished buildings. Fairy lights and decorations were hung in packed tent camps, and a video from a U.N.-school-turned-shelter showed children dancing and spraying foam in celebration as a man sang into a loudspeaker.

But there was little to celebrate after five months of war that has killed over 30,000 Palestinians and left much of Gaza in ruins. Families would ordinarily break the daily sunrise-to-sundown fast with holiday feasts, but even where food is available, there is little beyond canned goods, and the prices are too high for many.

“You don’t see anyone with joy in their eyes,” said Sabah al-Hendi, who was shopping for food Sunday in the southernmost city of Rafah. “Every family is sad. Every family has a martyr.”

The producer prices provide a forerunner for what could look like the consumer prices.

In February, the consumer price inflation, according to the officials’ preferred Consumer Price Index, softened to 5.9 percent over the last 12 months, from 6.4 percent in January, as the supply conditions improved while the one-off impacts from the Value Added Tax hike were dissipating.

The northern town of Vavuniya which was once at the front lines of the war is now a peaceful and bustling urban centre. Its physical infrastructure leaves much to be desired, with rundown buildings, and open drains that emit a foul odour. Vavuniya has not had the fortune of a political patron vested with governmental power to transform it like Polonnaruwa and Hambantota have been. But the town itself is peaceful. It is difficult to imagine that it was once under threat of bombardment and thousands of soldiers transited through it on the way to the front lines or back to their homes in the south. In the past there were a large number of security checkpoints at which busloads of people had to disembark and walk on foot from point to point while their vehicles were checked.

Accusing CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe of undue influence, Mahawatte claimed that there are alarming discrepancies in the bank’s operations.

“Recently, a bundle of cash went missing, however, when the investigations were conducted by the Fort Police the Governor did not know how much was missing from the stack of money printed at that time. This shows his lack of oversight,” Mahawatte charged.

He also alleged Dr. Weerasinghe of implementing policies that disproportionately affect private sector workers, by reducing the EPF rate to 9%, while exempting CBSL employees from such measures.
