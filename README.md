Is it bearable, this oppression by reactionary elites who have captured the state, for the sake of ostensible stability in the short term... even if exploring the alternatives – and there is a raft of these – means facing and overcoming the ‘fear psychosis’ (or false propaganda) of the much-dreaded return to vistas of austerity? Or do we owe those who were arguably the worst off – some of my readers may be in the same boat or at the bottom of the same pool – under a cabal that brought a country to its knees and a nation to bankruptcy?

Over the ‘long weekend’ a few days ago, an immersive editorialist – like a few other ordinary folks in Sri Lanka lucky enough to be able to savour it – was pleased to be tasked to enjoy some down time on an out-of-town getaway.

### Measuring, preventing, and responding to non-economic loss caused by climate change

There is a broad range of climate-induced losses that are difficult to restore, reverse, or quantify

Climate-induced loss and damage refers to the impacts of climate change that exceed the practical or theoretical limits of adaptation. It is increasingly recognised as an important challenge for countries across the world and seen by many as the third pillar of the Paris Agreement in addition to mitigation (the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation.

While economic losses and damages—such as destruction of property, assets, infrastructure, or the loss of agricultural production—can potentially be repaired and compensation payments might enable affected communities to rebuild and recover, there is a broad range of losses that are difficult to restore, cannot be reversed, or not easily quantifiable in financial terms. These “non-economic” losses can affect individuals, communities, or the natural environment, and result from a variety of climatic events and processes.
