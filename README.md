### Govt. revenue in January surge 62% on economic turnaround, higher taxes

*2024-05-20 03:50:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Govt-revenue-in-January-surge-62-on-economic-turnaround-higher-taxes/108-282928) ¬∑ `en`

The revenue to the government, including the grants, rose by a staggering 61.8 percent in January 2024. This is a result of the government raking in billions of rupees out of people‚Äôs pockets to appease the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs revenue targets.

The government revenues and grants for January were Rs.283.19 billion, out of which Rs.257.57 billion was raised via taxes. This was 63.8 percent higher from the same period last year.

The staggering increase in the tax revenues in January compared to the same month in 2023 was predominantly due to the recovering economy which was supported further by the 3 percent increase in the value added tax rate from January 1, 2024 onwards.

Between then and now, there wasn‚Äôt a single other tax imposed or raised except for the value added tax, and hence the bulk of the growth in tax income came from the recovering economy due to the normalising foreign currency inflows.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs last official census was taken in 2012. According to that census, Sri Lanka‚Äôs majority ethnic community the Sinhalese comprises 74.9 % of the island nation‚Äôs population.  Numerically, the second largest ethnicity is the Sri Lankan Tamils who are 11.1% of the population. The third largest ethnicity is the Sri Lankan Muslims or Moors who comprise 9.3% of the population. The fourth largest ethnic group is the Tamils of  Indian origin known as ‚ÄúMalaiyagath Thamizhar‚Äù (Hill Country Tamils) who are 4.1%.

The three numerical minorities namely the Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims and Indian Tamils together are 25.5% of the population. These three ethnic groups form the majority in some Sri Lankan districts. In other districts they are a substantive segment of the population. Since the people of all districts vote together in the Presidential elections, the entire island is transformed into a ‚Äúsingle‚Äù constituency with a 74.9% Sinhala majority and 25.5 % non ‚Äì Sinhala minorities.

Soldiers have gone to the lower level of the poverty line due to the lack of relief in the economic crisis, which has risen to the country.. So they have gone abroad in search of other income. Others have to go to Russia and go to the front of the battlefield.
