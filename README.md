But when the Cabinet was formed in 1936, it was a separate cabinet council. Fifty -fifty demands of GG Ponnambalam. In fact, even if the executive committee selects its chairman, he can only hold the post of Minister if the President accepts it. In this, the patriotism was the silence of the patriot.

The politics of the Jaffna youth Congress, which was moving this way, moved parallel to the politics of the Jaffna Congress until 1934.. The Jaffna Youth Congress boycotted the 1931 cosmic elections. The reason is that Donamur Yapu did not give Sri Lanka a complete independence. Due to this boycott, the election has not been held in all four constituencies of Jaffna. Many Sinhalese political leaders have retreated but later retreated. The Jaffna Youth Congress was left alone in this regard.

Our defeat was always implicit in the victory of others; our wealth has always generated our poverty by nourishing the wealth of others – the empires and their native overseers. In colonial and anti-colonial alchemy, gold changes into scrap metal and food into poison. ~ Edward Galeano[1]

The opening of Edward Galeano’s book looks at the historical origins of Latin America’s underdevelopment, the central theme being the genocide of the native population by the Spanish and Portuguese ‘civilising’ colonial project in the Americas. This involved hunger, overwork, communicable diseases, and massive damage to the cultures, flora and fauna of the continent. Echoes of this are found in the thirty year civil war in Sri Lanka and in the Palestinian struggle for self-determination.

### Sri Lanka fall behind in blacklisting corrupt contractors: Verité Research

Colombo, Feb 18 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka has the worst record among South Asian countries in blacklisting corrupt contractors in public procurement, according to a new report by Verité Research.

The report shows that Sri Lanka is the only country in South Asia that 1) does not recognise engaging in corrupt and fraudulent activities during procurement as a valid reason for blacklisting 2) has not blacklisted contractors that have defaulted on contractual obligations despite having the provisions to do so.

The first issue can be attributed to gaps in the procurement guidelines of 2006, which govern almost all public procurement in Sri Lanka — except in a few instances such as pharmaceutical procurement.

The report emphasises the importance of urgently fixing these gaps to combat corruption and restore fiscal governance.

The United Nations Security Council is likely to vote on Tuesday on an Algerian push for the 15-member body to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, said diplomats, a move the United States signaled it would veto.

Algeria put forward an initial draft resolution more than two weeks ago. But U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield quickly said the text could jeopardize “sensitive negotiations” aimed at brokering a pause in the war.

Algeria requested on Saturday that the council vote on Tuesday, diplomats said. To be adopted, U.N. Security Council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, China or Russia.

“The United States does not support action on this draft resolution. Should it come up for a vote as drafted, it will not be adopted,” Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement on Saturday.

A trade union action is set to be launched from Kandy on Tuesday (20) by the Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU), demanding the government to fulfill its promise of granting the remaining salary increment.

General Secretary of the CTU, Joseph Stalin, addressing the media said that while the government had granted one-third of the installment, they had not specified a timeline for providing the balance.

"We received only a fraction of the promised increment after enduring 120 days of aragalaya. The soaring cost of living has made it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. With no indication of further progress, we are left with no choice but to resume our protest," Stalin emphasized.

The demonstration, slated to commence from Kandy, is expected to witness the active participation of teachers, principals and teacher trainers alike.

### Sri Lanka upfront import duties, para tariffs keep foreign investors out: ex-BOI chief

*2024-02-18 08:35:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-upfront-import-duties-para-tariffs-keep-foreign-investors-out-ex-boi-chief-151242/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s excessive protectionist taxes with import duties and para-tariffs on capital goods are a barrier to foreign direct investments in the island rather than income tax, a former head of the island’s investment promotion office said.

Sri Lanka has been trying to phase out tax holidays and concessions given for Board of Investment approved firms, especially under the Strategic Development Project Act where discretionary concessions are believed to be fostering corruption.

But the excessive import protection and para tariffs on capital are not found in other countries with open or export-oriented economies. East Asian nations in particular are subject to stringent free trade requirements under the ASEAN.

Sri Lanka is taxing building materials in particular at high rates, including, steel, tiles, aluminum and also cement to some degree to give ‘rents’ or excessively fat profits to politically powerful ‘domestic industry’ businessmen, critics say.
