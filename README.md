### வியட்நாம் ஜனாதிபதி இராஜினாமா : பாராளுமன்றம் அங்கீகாரம்

*2024-03-21 10:53:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179295) · `ta`

வியட்நாம் ஜனாதிபதி வோ வான் துவோங் இராஜினாமா செய்துள்ளார். அவரின் இராஜினாமாவை அந்நாட்டுப் பாராளுமன்றம் இன்று அங்கீகரித்தது.

நேற்று நடைபெற்ற, ஆளும் கம்யூனிஸ்ட் கட்சிக் கூட்டத்தின் பின்னர் ஜனாதிபதி துவோங் இராஜினாமா செய்ததாக  அரசாங்கம் அறிவித்தது.

இந்த இராஜினாமாவுக்கு பாராளுமன்றத்தின் அங்கீகாரம் பெறப்பட வேண்டும். இந்நிலையில், இன்று வியாழக்கிழமை கூடிய வியட்நாம் பாராளுமன்றம், ஜனாதிபதி துவோங்கின் இராஜினாமாவுக்கு அங்கீகாரம் வழங்கியது.

கட்சியின் விதிகளை துவோங் மீறியதுடன், கட்சின் நம்பிக்கையை குலைக்கும் வகையில் செயற்பட்டுள்ளார் என வியட்நாமின் கம்யூனிஸ்ட் கட்சி குற்றம் சுமத்தியுள்ளது.

எனினும், துவோங்கின் சொந்த மாநிலத்தில் ஊழல் சர்ச்சையொன்று தொடர்பாக அவர் பதவிவிலகியுள்ளார் என நம்பப்படுகிறது.

துவோங்குக்கு முன்னர் ஜனாதிபதியாக பதவி வகித்த ஜனாதிபதியும் ஊழல் சர்ச்சை காரணமாக இராஜினாமா செய்திருந்தமை குறிப்பிடத்கத்கது.

Global investors and Sri Lanka officials expect to start negotiations aimed at restructuring $12 billion in defaulted global bonds next week, according to people familiar with the matter. The nation’s dollar bonds rose.

A group of bondholders, known as a steering committee, will begin talks as they weigh a proposal from the government to rework the overseas debt that has been in default since 2022, the people said, declining to be named because negotiations are private. The goal is to reach a deal quickly, the people said, particularly as Sri Lanka is scheduled to hold presidential elections later this year.

The nation’s central bank governor and treasury secretary are due to travel to Europe for discussions with bondholders, President Ranil Wickremesinghe was cited as saying in a Sinhala-language statement from his media unit March 20.

### Indian Adani Group says “vicious campaign” against its Sri Lanka wind project

*2024-03-21 06:53:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/indian-adani-group-says-vicious-campaign-against-its-sri-lanka-wind-project-155428/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – India’s Adani Group, which is in discussion to get clearance for two renewable energy projects in Sri Lanka, has complained of a possible “vicious campaign” against its 250 MW wind-powered energy project in the island nation’s Northern district of Mannar.

Sri Lankan officials have said the Adani’s wind power project has been facing some delays as a Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee (CANC) has been raising concerns over the project components including tariff.

In a fresh blow, Rohan Pethiyagoda, a prominent Sri Lankan biodiversity scientist, in a recent video said Adani’s wind project is “yet another wasteful scam” and questioned about its Environmental Assessment Impact (EIA) and the pricing.

“The EIA for Adani’s Mannar power project is little more than a shame, a stamp, a whitewash,” Pethiyagoda, a conservationist and a public-policy advocate, told in a self-explanatory video posted by himself in his own YouTube platform.

He told the Daily Mirror that there has been a notable lack of rainfall from mid-January until now. He mentioned that as a result, the present water capacities of hydro and irrigation reservoirs are at a significant level.

Ethical banking encourages transparency, helps build strong communities and establishes a set of principles and ideals that govern all banking activities

Any business depends and improves mainly based on the trust placed by the customers. In order to gain and enhance this trust, application of ethics in business is of paramount importance. Banking is a business that purely depends upon the trust placed by not only its customers but also by the general public. Transparency, fairness and sound decision-making are the cornerstones of a strong banking business. All these are more related to ethics in banking than of complying with rules and regulations.

### Strengthening anti-corruption measures in private sector

In recent years, Sri Lanka has taken significant strides in its battle against corruption, marked by the transformation of the once exclusively Government-focused Bribery Act into the more comprehensive Anti-Corruption Act. This legislative evolution now extends the arm of accountability to encompass private sector entities, marking a pivotal shift in the nation’s anti-corruption landscape.

Under the amended Anti-Corruption Act, private sector individuals, such as purchasing managers, are now subject to scrutiny and potential legal ramifications for engaging in bribery. The Sri Lankan Anti-Corruption Authority wields authority to investigate and prosecute such offenses, signalling a newfound commitment to root out corruption across all sectors.

### Transforming Government institutions: A beacon of development in Sri Lanka’s fishing industry

Government institutions often carry a reputation for bureaucracy, inefficiency, and stagnation. But this need not be the case. With visionary leadership, effective management, and a commitment to progress, these institutions can evolve into powerful catalysts for positive change.

It’s a common misconception that Government institutions are inherently resistant to development. While challenges exist, they are not insurmountable. Proper administration, strategic planning, and a results-oriented mind-set can drive transformation.

Effective management is the cornerstone of success. Leaders must prioritise transparency, accountability, and collaboration. A well-functioning team, aligned with a shared vision, can overcome obstacles and achieve remarkable outcomes.

Humane Peoples’ Alliance Leader Dayasiri Jayasekra yesterday said Sri Lanka urgently requires a  new program aimed at nurturing leaders who, through their political campaigns, can articulate their vision and strive to progress accordingly.

Speaking at the new alliance’s launch in Colombo, Jayasekara said the current system does not have such leaders.

“We must emphasise the necessity of a robust political program for the forthcoming decade,” he emphasised.

“Are we content with a system where 250,000 individuals live in luxury while millions suffer, or should we aspire for a more equitable future?” he asked.

Jayasekara emphasised the significance of establishing a new generation of leaders who are incorruptible, refrain from using political power to enrich their families and demonstrate foresight.

Over 20 political parties and civil society organisations joined the newly formed alliance during the event yesterday.

New European Union (EU) regulations on deforestation-free products (EUDR) are applicable for Sri Lanka’s exports, the Foreign Ministry announced yesterday.

Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane chaired a meeting at the Foreign Ministry with the participation of the EU Ambassador Carmen Moreno to brief key industry stakeholders on the new EUDR.

As a direct beneficiary of the EU GSP+ concessions, Sri Lanka’s rubber exports to the EU market will have to adopt due diligence to prove that products do not originate from recently deforested land or have contributed to forest degradation.  The EU adopted the EUDR in June 2023, to ensure that agricultural products consumed by EU citizens do not contribute to global deforestation or forest degradation. The regulation will apply to the production of commodities like cattle, wood, cocoa, soy, palm oil, coffee, rubber, and their derived products.

President Wickremesinghe’s first public political rally at Kuliyapitiya was odd. He delivered a zestful, even rollicking speech, remaining in the high spirits he displayed in the Mustang’s tent at the Royal-Thomian Big Match. He was rude and crude about his former lecturer at Colombo’s Faculty of Law, Prof. G.L. Peiris. He praised his pet members of the SJB, Dr. Harsha de Silva and Eran Wickramaratne. He insulted SJB leader Sajith Premadasa while pitching for the SJB to join him. He lavished praise on himself. A vintage Wickremesinghe performance, it elicited no praise outside the (small) UNP.
