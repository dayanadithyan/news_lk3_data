The top United Nations court ordered Israel on Friday to immediately halt its military operations in the southern Gaza city of Rafah ‚Äî but stopped short of ordering a full cease-fire.

Criticism of Israel‚Äôs conduct in the war in Gaza has been growing, particularly on operations in Rafah ‚Äî and even from its closest ally, the United States. This week alone, three European countries announced they would recognize a Palestinian state, and the chief prosecutor for another U.N. court requested arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, along with Hamas officials.

### Over 300,000 power disruptions due to bad weather

Colombo, May 24 (Daily Mirror) - Over 300,000 power disruption incidents were reported during the past few days with more than 30,000 occurring within a single hour on some days, the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers' Union (CEBEU) said.

While issuing a media release they said they had experienced significant delays in restoring power outages caused by recent severe weather conditions.

The CEBEU has expressed regret over these delays, attributing them to the limited number of technical staff available to address the issues.

Additionally, the high volume of calls has overwhelmed CEB telephone operators, leading to many calls from consumers going unanswered.

The union has urged the public to exercise patience and caution, advising them not to touch any live wires during outages, while the technical teams work to restore power as quickly as possible.

### Scientists find Earth-like planet that could be home to alien life

May 24 - Scientists have found a new Earth-like planet that could support alien life ‚Äì just 40 light-years away.

The planet is a remarkable discovery in the search for habitable worlds: it is slightly smaller than the Earth, and thought to be just a little hotter. Many planets outside our solar system, called exoplanets, tend to be much larger and hotter than our own world.

The newly discovered planet is called Gliese 12b and researchers say that even if we cannot find whether it is home to alien life then it will help in our search for other worlds that might be.

The planet planet orbits its host star every 12.8 days, and is comparable in size to Venus - so slightly smaller than Earth.

It has an estimated surface temperature of 42C, which is lower than most of the 5,000-odd exoplanets (planets outside of the solar system) confirmed so far.

After the 2009 end of Sri Lanka's civil war, tensions flared between military leaders and politicians. Sarath Fonseka, a popular figure credited with the war's victory, faced backlash from the Rajapaksa brothers, leading to his demotion and eventual run for president against them.

When the war against the LTTE ended in 2009, the rival attitude of who set up the Tigers' strategies arose to the Rajapakse brothers and army commander Sarath Fonseka.. Soldiers who sat on the field more than the officers who sat in the refrigerator and waited for the country. Army Commander Sarath Fonseka said they should be honored with them. He indirectly pointed out Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the Secretary of the Ministry of Defense.. The Sinhalese Buddhist people of the country thought that Sarath Fonseka was responsible for the victory of the war. The Rajapaksa brothers, who thought he would be more famous than Mahinda, resigned from the post of Army Commander, raised to the post of security governing leader with less power and status.. It was only then that Fonseka announced his retirement and went on the presidential election against the Rajapaksa.

### The International Court of Justice on Israel's war on Gaza today

*2024-05-24 11:04:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184359) ¬∑ `ta`

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is set to deliver a verdict on Israel's Gaza conflict amidst US concerns over Israel's international isolation. Expectations are high for the ICJ to halt Israel's military operations. The court will also consider a request to indict Israeli Prime Minister and Hamas leaders. Despite previous disregard for ICJ orders, they hold significant global importance. Israel has stated it won't comply with the ICJ's decision to cease hostilities.

üü©

The verdict will be issued in a situation where the US is concerned about the diplomatic isolation of Israel internationally.

There is an expectation that the ICC may order Israel to stop its military action.

Meanwhile, the judges will also look into the request of the International Criminal Court to issue a cabinet against Israeli Prime Minister Hamas leaders.

South Africa has appealed to the International Court of Justice to stop its actions on Israeli Gaza last week.. South Africa has specially appealed to Rabba.

International court orders have been ignored in the past, but they are internationally important.

Israel has said it will not accept the International Court of Justice to stop the war.

### Czech president injured while racing motorcycle

*2024-05-24 10:44:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/international/Czech-president-injured-while-racing-motorcycle/107-283287) ¬∑ `en`

May 24 (BBC) - Czech President Petr Pavel has been taken to hospital after injuring himself while riding a motorcycle, his office has said.

It said the injuries "are not serious", but a "short observation" was required. It gave no further details.

Czech police said they were not investigating the accident because it happened on a closed racing circuit - not on the road.

Mr Pavel, aged 62, is known for his love of motorbikes. He is believed to be currently racing a BMW R1200 GS.

It is not the first time he has attracted trouble over his hobby.

Last year, he had to publicly apologise after being spotted riding a bike without a helmet.

### Family mother-son join

*2024-05-24 10:28:55* ¬∑ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/clmmxdnyz5go) ¬∑ `si`

It seems like you've shared a detailed conversation involving various perspectives on family dynamics, especially focusing on the relationship between mothers, sons, and daughters-in-law. This discussion touches on several themes including cultural expectations, personal growth, and the challenges of balancing familial obligations with individual desires.



From the conversation, several key points emerge:



1. **Cultural Expectations vs. Personal Growth**: There's a tension between traditional cultural expectations (such as the importance of respecting elders and maintaining family harmony) and the need for individuals to grow and assert their independence. This is evident in the discussions around how sons and daughters-in-law navigate their relationships with their mothers.



2. **Communication and Conflict Resolution**: Effective communication is highlighted as crucial in resolving conflicts within families. However, the conversation suggests that misunderstandings and miscommunications often lead to deeper rifts, especially when it comes to decisions regarding marriage and lifestyle choices.



3. **Role of Elders in Decision Making**: The conversation underscores the significant influence elders, particularly mothers, have over their offspring's lives. This influence extends to whom they marry and how they conduct themselves post-marriage. However, it also raises questions about the autonomy of adults and the rights of spouses to make their own decisions.



4. **Impact of External Interference on Marital Harmony**: External interference, especially from mothers, is seen as a source of stress and conflict in marriages. The conversation suggests that while parental advice and guidance can be beneficial, excessive involvement can undermine marital stability and happiness.



5. **Psychological Perspectives**: The inclusion of psychiatric insights highlights the importance of mental health in family dynamics. Issues such as anxiety, depression, and the impact of societal pressures on mental well-being are discussed, emphasizing the need for empathy and understanding in family relationships.



6. **Cultural Specificity**: The conversation reflects specific cultural nuances, particularly from a Sri Lankan perspective. Understanding these nuances is essential for addressing the unique challenges faced by families in different cultural contexts.



In summary, the conversation delves into the complexities of family relationships, highlighting the interplay between cultural traditions, personal aspirations, and the evolving roles of family members. It underscores the importance of open communication, mutual respect, and the recognition of each individual's right to self-determination in fostering healthy and harmonious family dynamics.
