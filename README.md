12.05 PM -¬†Veteran actor Raj Babbar is leading in Gurgaon seat on Congress ticket by over 30,000 seats

11.58 AM -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alliance raced to a majority in early vote counting trends in the general election, but the numbers were well short of the landslide predicted in exit polls. Opposition gains are higher than expected.

11.48 AM - When Narendra Modi launched his campaign with the slogan ‚ÄúAb ki baar, 400 paar,‚Äù he aimed for more than 400 seats for his BJP-led NDA alliance. The most optimistic exit polls even predicted a clear 400 seats for them.

However, early trends indicate a much tighter contest with the Congress-led INDIA alliance, a centre-left coalition. Speculation is already rife about whether the BJP alone will reach the 272 seats needed for a majority in the 543-seat parliament.

The lead between the two coalitions appears narrower than expected, with early trends showing a difference of only 60 to 70 seats.

Last year, the Netherlands returned six Kandyan artifacts, including gold and silver ceremonial swords, two wall guns, and Lewke Disave‚Äôs cannon, after a formal request.

‚ÄúWe have made similar requests to the British government. However, the challenge is that many of these artifacts are in the possession of individuals, not the state,‚Äù Wickremenayake told EconomyNext.

‚ÄúWe cannot ask private British citizens to return these items in the same way we request from the British government. We have a substantial list of artifacts taken during the British period.‚Äù

A party or coalition needs 272 seats to cross the majority mark in the 543-member Lok Sabha, the lower house of India‚Äôs parliament.

Exit polls show Modi is well on track to return to power for a third consecutive term, while the Indian National Congress party-led opposition bloc hopes to upstage him.

The Election Commission says a record-breaking 642 million voters cast their ballots in the staggered election as it dismissed opposition concerns over how the votes would be counted.

However, the voter turnout this year was 66.3 percent, about one percentage point lower than 2019.
