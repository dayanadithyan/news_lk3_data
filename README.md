The startup world is founded on daring dreams, fuelled by relentless passion and the fearless pursuit of innovation. Yet, for most, the path to success is obstructed by a crucial obstacle – securingg adequate funding. While headlines celebrate lucrative funding rounds, many would-be founders have quit steady jobs, invested their lifetime savings, and work night and day for a venture that was teetering over before it had a chance to get started, all thanks to lack of funding.

When promising ventures fall short of an investor’s expectations, bridging the funding gap seems near impossible. Here, are some of the major culprits behind fundraising failures.

### Clean energy or clean Government?

*2024-07-18 03:37:55* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Clean-energy-or-clean-Government/4-764404) · `en`

Clean energy, such as wind energy, can never be clean unless its procurement is also clean

This is my final response to Gerald L. Samaranayake (my time is precious), who keeps repeating himself ad nauseam while erecting ever more strawmen (see Daily FT, 13 July: https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Adani-wind-project-Is-it-a-controversy-created/14-764216).

### What will it take to keep the lights on?

Sanjiva Weerawarana, whose software company WSO2 was recently acquired for $ 600 million, was asked by an interviewer what he wanted of Government. Keep the lights on, he said.

It’s a succinct answer that embodies much. It can be interpreted as a statement that the State should focus on providing what we cannot provide for ourselves: law and order, most infrastructure services, and even things like identity and authentication services. But for the moment, let’s take just the literal meaning: uninterrupted electricity.

Transmission and distribution losses are relevant when comparing electricity supply from a far-off plant against distributed generation where electricity production is closer to the consumer

News media reports that the Power and Energy Ministry is to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Indian Government relating to the planned Indo-Lanka cross-strait power grid connectivity within a few months. According to Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, GOSL has made it a priority to complete the grid connection by 2030.

This milestone (electricity import via SL-India grid intertie) along with other 2030 milestones of thermal plant fuel switching (diesel to LNG) and meeting 70% of electricity demand via use of renewable energy (RE) resources leads towards a complex outcome.

This article highlights the commercial challenge faced when determining the optimal mix of; a) electricity received from India, b) electricity from LNG generation, and c) RE based electricity.

### Doing things differently and doing different things

Doing things differently and doing different things are two primary mechanisms we must embrace to come out of this economic mess that we are in. Well, the answer to why change is because repeating the past that led us to this present predicament is not at all a sound idea. I am not yet sure that we have understood this. Even with our backs against all the walls in and around us we still plan, and discuss doing more of the same that we were doing before.

### False Terrorism Cases Enable Repression; Politically Motivated Detentions, Surveillance, Threats

*2024-07-18 02:42:25* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/false-terrorism-cases-enable-repression-politically-motivated-detentions-surveillance-threats/) · `en`

Sri Lankan authorities continue to use the notorious Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to target perceived opponents and minority communities without credible evidence to support the allegations despite repeated pledges to end the practice, Human Rights Watch said today. While some victims have suffered years of arbitrary detention and torture, others are persecuted even after the case against them is dropped.

The law, widely known as the PTA, has provisions allowing for extended administrative detention, limited judicial oversight, and inadequate protections against torture. In a 2022 speech to the United Nations Human Rights Council, the then foreign minister pledged a moratorium on its use, but under President Ranil Wickremesinghe, detentions under the PTA have continued. Such is the chilling effect of the law that in September 2023 the International Monetary Fund found that “broad application of counter-terrorism rules” restricts civil society scrutiny of official corruption.

Early in his presidency or rather, the balance of Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s presidential term, to complete which he was selected by the Rajapaksas and elected by the vote of the discredited ruling SLPP, Ranil Wickremesinghe chaired a conference at the Presidential Secretariat. He said “we can talk about holding elections after fulfilling the agreement with the IMF, completing the debt restructuring efforts and placing the economy firmly on a high-growth path”. This wasn’t at a secret conclave of plotters planning to subvert the Constitution. It was on TV news.

Just recently, in Mahiyangana, Ranil contributed to political theory by proclaiming outrageously: “I have said earlier that judicial power doesn’t rest with the judiciary; judicial power rests with the legislature…so that ends there.”
