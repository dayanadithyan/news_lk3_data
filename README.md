### Double Trouble for Namal as Sri Lanka Nominations Set to Close

*2024-08-13 21:21:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/double-trouble-for-namal-as-sri-lanka-nominations-set-to-close-176685/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – The heir apparent of the Rajapaksa dynasty will face an unusual challenge in the September 21 presidential election, with his loyalists confronted by another Namal Rajapaksha on the ballot paper.

With 36 candidates having paid their deposits to get on the ticket by Tuesday evening and one more day left to pay, the 2024 ballot paper is set to be the longest yet.

Adding two Namals with the same last name makes the voting slip potentially the most confusing—at least for Namal’s loyalists. Fielding candidates with names similar to main contenders has been a tried-and-tested tactic before, notably by the Rajapaksas themselves.

In 2015, the Rajapaksas not only fielded another “Sirisena” in an attempt to confuse voters of Maithripala Sirisena—the opposition’s common candidate—but also gave him a makeover to resemble the man from Polonnaruwa.

After an unprecedented economic and foreign exchange crisis in 2022, Sri Lanka has been considering becoming a regional hub for education in order to cut foreign exchange outflow of the country as more students go abroad for higher education.

Sri Lanka banned dollar payments in mid-2022 to contain the dollar outflows from the country after it faced a severe shortage of forex following the rupee being floated in March 2022.

Sri Lanka has been spending around $3 billion for those who spend for education from foreign countries.
