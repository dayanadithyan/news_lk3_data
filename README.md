Sri Lanka politician Hizbullah claims Anura Kumara Dissanayake's election manifesto supports opening gay stations, brothels, and alcoholism nationwide. He accuses Anura Kumara Dissanayake of insulting him instead of addressing allegations.

🟩

Former Governor of the Eastern Province MLA has said that if Anura Kumara Dissanayake comes to power, he said that he would respond to my comment that gay stations and brothels would be opened throughout the country.. Hizbullah said.

He was speaking at a speech at a campaign meeting organized by the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress on Tuesday (17) night in support of Sajith Premadasa in Karadivu, Karadivu, Ampara district.

Muslim Congress House East Regional Organizer. H. Former Governor MLA. Hizbullah further stated

If the National People's Power Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake comes to power, homosexual stations, brothels and alcoholism will be opened legally.. Even in schools, the Ulama cannot speak to them.

I have been saying this again and again when I read the election manifesto of Anuragumara Dissanayake. That is how Muslims cannot celebrate their majority in their respective days. The majority of all religions can be celebrated in a single day and can be celebrated in one day.

### Elite establishment’s last stand

*2024-09-19 02:17:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Elite-establishment-s-last-stand/4-766866) · `en`

It was always going to come to this. The first Sri Lankan election in generations where even a remotely leftist party stood a chance of winning was always going to end with an almighty Red Scare. So it is that the presidential campaign of National People’s Power (NPP) candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) is inspiring lurid visions of an impending violent, dystopian regime, splayed across news and social media. This is the prophecy of the Sri Lankan elite establishment, a select cross section of the country’s businesspeople, policymakers, professionals, journalists and academics who have been proximate to state power, especially in the last two years. Scrutiny of them and their crescendoing hysteria reveals much about how power and privilege work in Sri Lanka, and what happens when their wielders are threatened.

### Raja Bhavatu Dhammiko: May the ruler be righteous

When we reflect on our current predicament we can see how we have treaded the vicious instead of the virtuous cycle expounded in the Dhamma

At the end of almost all Buddhist chantings and during Independence Day celebrations we hear this four-line stanza being chanted. Over the years this has become part of our culture. May be because of that we have forgotten to reflect on the deeper meaning of this wish. It is a blueprint for a comprehensive governance system for the nation.

The four wishes though appearing to be independent are in fact interdependent.

If one refers to the Agganna Sutta (DN2), when the king is not righteous the minister becomes the same and so would the officers and eventually the people to move away from the righteousness. This would impact the total ecosystem which results in poor harvest; when the harvest is poor the population becomes poor. This is a vicious cycle.

### Political culture will keep changing for better, with or without NPP

As it turns out, the winning proposition of the NPP is the new political culture they hope to usher in.

According to the interview of Anura Kumara Dissanayake (or AKD) of the National People’s Power (NPP) party carried out by Kalindu Karunaratne of Ada Derana on 16 September, NPP has all but conceded the economic issues. What remains is a new political culture of austerity, self-sacrifice and accountability which leaders will demonstrate, and others will emulate. The new political culture is expected to catalyse the socio-economic changes needed to take the country forward.

The good news for the country and the bad news for NPP is that the political culture has changed and will keep changing, with or without the NPP. Further changes will happen not because of a cadre of austere and self-sacrificing politicians, but institutions, laws and economic realities, and social norms driven by these.

### Election 2024 choices for change: Weaponised negativism or progressive centrism

Unless you reject change and vote Ranil, the choice is between two types of change-- as represented by Anura and Sajith.

Anura represents the risk of uncertain, disequilibrating, ‘wild’ change, mainly from below.

Sajith represents the assurance of steady, stable, sustainable, constructive, calibrated change, mainly from above.

As a boy one thing I picked up from Mervyn de Silva, my father, is that every story has to be checked from more than one side and source, and that “the truth usually lies somewhere in the middle”.

This month, September, would have marked his 95th birthday had he lived, but he died with his 70th birthday just out of reach. He’s the one after whom the pinnacle prize of the Annual Journalism Awards presented by the Editors’ Guild and the Publishers’ Society– the Mervyn de Silva Journalist of the Year-- is named.

That’s why in politics I tend to look for the position in-between; the third space—and to persuade players to occupy that space.

The choice of the most suitable Presidential candidate for Sri Lanka depends on several key factors, including the candidate’s vision for economic recovery, governance, accountability, and social welfare, among other areas. Here are a few qualities and areas of focus that could guide the evaluation of a suitable candidate:

Economic expertise: Given Sri Lanka’s ongoing economic challenges, including debt restructuring and inflation, a candidate with strong economic management skills is essential. They should have a track record in promoting sustainable development, attracting investment, and creating jobs.

Reform-oriented mindset: The candidate should prioritise structural reforms in governance, the judiciary, and public institutions. Addressing corruption and implementing transparency measures are key to restoring public confidence.
