Considering the amendments to be proposed at the Parliamentary committee stage based on the Supreme Court determination in November 2023, 31 of the 56 articles in the Bill are expected to be revised in line with the principles of democracy and the Constitution of Sri Lanka, reflecting on the freedom of expression of the media. Accordingly, the proposed amendments are expected to alter the functions and the framework of the Commission, including its autonomy and the definitions of offences.

Value Added Tax (VAT) can be reduced to 15% to equalize with its previous level if all businesses in Sri Lanka register for VAT, Bandula Gunawardena, the Minister of Transport, Highways, and Mass Media said on Saturday.

He said so while visiting a food factory in Kolonnawa where fruit dices and floats are produced for the wider cake industry.

“Young people in this country have opportunities to stand on their feet without engaging in hateful rhetoric about the society if they reimagine and rekindle the entrepreneurial spirit within them and start their own businesses. We have the opportunity to produce goods and deliver services to countries such as India, China, Japan and South Korea. They are huge economies and we can access those markets with tax-free benefits. When such a manufacturing and business culture is embedded in our society, there would be enough liquidity to ease the burden on the vulnerable sections of the society.

As far as the Tamils are concerned in Ceylon/Sri Lanka, their situation during the pre-independence era was hunky-dory, whereas in the post-independence era, it has stirred up a hornet’s nest and hamstrung the political and social fabric, which was a consequence of the act of political hanky-panky and the hegemony of the native rulers. The plight of Tamils has been agonizing and antagonistic, with deaths and destructions, wounds, loss of limbs, disabilities, enforced disappearances, property losses, internal displacements, even the rape and murder of a schoolgirl and women, and so on.

### Price Controls Needed to Protect Poorer Sections of Society - EDITORIAL

*2024-01-22 00:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Price-Controls-Needed-to-Protect-Poorer-Sections-of-Society-EDITORIAL/172-275439) · `en`

Since the economic meltdown, many of us realise that bad practices of the past – spending far more than we earn – has led us down to the sorry path we find ourselves in. Political leaders claim that we are no longer a bankrupt nation and have substantial dollar reserves. The reality sadly is, the situation is not so rosy.

A portion of these ‘reserves’ comprises credit lines, funds lent by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other multi-lateral lending agencies. Some funds are also tied to particular conditions.

So while we do have a certain amount of ‘money in the bank’ so-to-say, it is not ours to spend as we would wish. Far worse, we have as yet not commenced repaying our international creditors as the negotiations are ongoing. So the situation is not as good as portrayed.

Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan, in an interview with Daily Mirror, discusses the current status of bilateral ties, and what is being planned for the future.

Q  How did the recent visit of a top level Russian delegation help elevate bilateral ties?

We are satisfied with the current level of our bilateral relations. Another indication of it was the visit of a high-ranking Russian delegation.

It was a rather big delegation of more than 40 people, headed by Nikolai Patrushev, the Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.   He had a very important meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe on   December 6, 2023. He had a meeting with Defence Secretary, Major General (Rtd) Kamal Gunaratne. The latter was in Moscow in May, last year. So it’s a continuation of bilateral dialogue. Also, Mr. Patrushev, when he was in Colombo last December, extended his invitation to Mr. Gunaratne to visit Russia in the coming year.

Followers of wholesome Dhamma need not be disturbed by individuals like Jeromes, Sepalas, Natashas, Ruwans, or Avalokiteshvaras; these are insignificant ‘outside’ influences, a phenomenon that existed even in the times of the Buddha. The growing concern lies in the emerging threat posed by ‘Devadattas’ operating within the Sasana.

Urbanisation, smart cities, climate change, temporariness and aged populations are a few among many other reasons as to why firms and nations should focus on Society 5.0

In an ever-changing world, one cannot find a risk-free venture, investment, event, or an activity. Risk should necessarily be examined by looking at the probability of occurrence and the impact. Technology can play a vital role in mitigating the risks by addressing both the impact and probability of occurrence.

Instead of being rational choosers, they have acted on emotions created by political leaders of all hues  – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

At an election, political leaders would emotionalise voters to gain power but after the election, they simply forget about it leaving the voters in the lurch. Hence, acting rationally is a must for voters at the forthcoming elections

In 2024, Sri Lankan voters will be given the choice of electing their leaders through the power of the ballot. This is an important occasion for Sri Lanka which is a long surviving democracy in South Asia, next only to India. However, a common allegation is that, throughout the post-independence history, the voters have not done their job correctly. Instead of being rational choosers, they have acted on emotions created by political leaders of all hues.

When late Queen Elizabeth II was in Sri Lanka during the time of late JR Jayewardene in late 1970’s, during her speech, she mentioned that the Rule of Law was fundamental to civilized living. While I am no admirer of the Royal family, I am a strong admirer of the British form of Democracy. It is clean.

The rule of law is that everybody is equal under the law. While this is a simple statement, the meaning of it is gigantic for civilized living. Now how does a society ensure the concept of equal justice under the law? The simple answer is that by keeping the criminal justice system out of the control of those who manage the country.

Here is where a smart constitution comes into play. A smart constitution will ensure that the executive or the members of the legislature cannot stick their fingers into the process of the law enforcement and the criminal justice system. This is easier said than done in SL and here is why.

### Ram Mandir At Babri Masjid Site: Death Of Secular Democracy & Rise Of Hindutva Fascism

The ancient town of Ayodhya, in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, has been known for its rich diversity of religious denominations, predominantly Hinduism and Islam. For centuries Hindus and Muslims lived in peace and harmony in this town where, in the year 1528, Mughal King Barber built a mosque, which later came to be known as Babri Masjid. Though there was no dispute of any kind for more than two centuries, controversy was sparked off when some Hindus started to claim that this mosque was built on the spot where the Hindu mythical deity Ram was born.

The controversy resulted in the first religious violence almost three and half centuries later, in 1853. In view of the sensitive nature of the issue, six years later, in 1859, the British colonial rulers erected a fence to separate places of worship for Muslims and Hindus. Under this arrangement Muslims were allowed to use the inner court for their prayers while the outer court was allocated to Hindus.
