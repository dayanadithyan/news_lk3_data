*2024-02-04 18:21:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175535) · `ta`

போர்க்காலத்தில் இடம்பெற்ற மீறல்களை நிராகரிப்பவராக மாத்திரமன்றி அந்த காலகட்ட சம்பவங்களுக்கு பதிலளிக்க வேண்டியவர் என்பதால் தான்,  தயா ரத்நாயக்கவின் இந்த நியமனம் சர்ச்சையை உருவாக்கி இருக்கிறது.

தயா ரத்நாயக்கவுக்கு  ஆலோசகர் பதவியை வழங்கியிருப்பதன் மூலம், கோட்டாபய ராஜபக் ஷவுடன், நெருக்கத்தை ஏற்படுத்த சஜித் பிரேமதாச முற்படுகிறாரா என்ற சரத் பொன்சேகாவின்  கேள்வியும், பொறுப்புக்கூறல் தொடர்பான ஐக்கிய மக்கள் சக்தியின் நிலைப்பாட்டின் மீது அம்பிகா சற்குணநாதன் எழுப்பியுள்ள ஐயமும்  கூர்ந்து நோக்கப்பட வேண்டியவை.

### பின்லாந்து தேர்தலும்  மூன்றாம் உலகப்போரும்?

*2024-02-04 18:20:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175537) · `ta`

இரு­வரில் யார் தெரி­வா­னாலும் அவ­ருக்கு அடுத்­து­வரும் 6 வரு­டங்­களில் தலை­யிடி காத்­தி­ருக்­கி­றது என்­பது மாத்­திரம் உண்மை. உக்ரேன் போரில் ரஷ்யா வெற்றி பெற்­று­விட்டால் அது ஏனைய அயல் நாடுகள் மீது படை­யெ­டுப்பை நடத்தக் கூடும் என்ற வதந்­திகள் மேற்குலகில் வெளிவரத் தொடங்கி விட்டன.

ஐரோப்பாவினுள் நுழையும் அகதிகளைக் கட்டுப்படுத்தும் நோக்கில் ரஷ்யாவுடனான தனது எல்லைகளை அண்மையில் பின்லாந்து மூடியிருந்த நிலையில், ரஷ்யாவின் தொடரப் போகும் எதிர்வினைகள் மற்றொரு மோதலுக்கு வழிவகுக்குமா? நேட்டோ ஆதரவு நாடு ஒன்றுடன் ரஷ்யா மோதும் நிலை உருவானால் அது மூன்றாம் உலகப் போருக்கு வித்திடுமா? அத்தகைய ஒரு போரை உலகம் தாங்குமா?

இவை தற்போது வரை விடை தெரியாத கேள்விகள். ஆனால் இந்த ஒவ்வொரு நிலையிலும் பின்லாந்தில் புதிதாகத் தெரிவாகும் அரசுத் தலைவர் சம்பந்தப்பட்டே ஆகவேண்டும் என்பது மாத்திரம் உண்மை.

### தாயக ஒருமைப்பாடே முக்கியமானது

*2024-02-04 18:19:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175539) · `ta`

பொதுச் செயலாளர் கட்சியின் நிர்வாக வேலையில் ஈடுபட வேண்டியிருப்பதனால் தேர்தல் அரசியலில் அவர் இறங்காமல் இருப்பது நல்லது. ஜே.வி.பி. இல் அந்த ஒழுங்கே இருக்கின்றது. அங்கு அதன் செயலாளர் ரில்வின் சில்வா தேர்தலில் போட்டியிடுவதில்லை.

பொதுச் செயலாளர் தெரிவை மீள கலந்துரையாடலுக்கு உட்படுத்தி போட்டிகள் எதுவும் இல்லாமல் ஏக மனதாக தெரிவு செய்வதே நல்லது. போட்டி தவிர்க்க முடியாததாக இருப்பின் தலைவர் தெரிவு போல இரகசியமான வாக்கெடுப்பின் மூலம் தெரிவு செய்யப்படுவதே ஆரோக்கியமானது. இங்கே தேர்தலை விட முக்கியமானது தாயக ஒருமைப்பாடு . கிழக்குத்தரப்பு அதிருப்தியுடன் வெளியேறிச் செல்லும் நிலையை உருவாக்க ஒரு போதும் முனையக் கூடாது. அவ்வாறு முனையும் எந்த முயற்சியும் பெருந்தேசியவாதத்திற்கு சேவகம் செய்வதாகவே அமையும்.

### மீண்டும் குறைவடையவுள்ள கடன், வைப்பு வட்டி வீதங்கள்?

*2024-02-04 18:13:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175556) · `ta`

2048 ஆண்டில் இலங்கை வளர்ச்சியடைந்த நாடாக மாறவேண்டுமானால்  இலங்கை வருடாந்தம் 7.8 வீத பொருளாதார வளர்ச்சியை பதிவு செய்யவேண்டும்  என்று  பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினரும் பொருளாதார நிபுணருமான ஹர்ஷ டி. சில்வா கூறுகிறார்.

அதனால் அடுத்து வரும் காலங்களில் நாட்­டில் பொருளாதார வளர்ச்சியை ஏற்படுத்த வேண்டுமாயின் உற்பத்திகளை அதிகரிக்க வேண்டியது அவசியமாகும். அதற்கு வங்கி  வட்டி விகிதங்கள் மேலும் குறைவடைய வேண்டும். மக்கள் அதிக அளவு கடன்களை பெற்றுக் கொள்ள வேண்டும். அதாவது தனியார் கடன்கள் அதிகரிப்பது அவசியமாகவிருக்கிறது.   அதனூடாக முதலீடு­களை செய்ய வேண்டும்.  சாவியும் பூட்டும்  இருக்கின்றன. சரியாக திட்டமிட்டு திறப்பதே முக்கியமாகவுள்ளது.

### பின்னிப் பிணைந்த உறவு

*2024-02-04 18:08:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175554) · `ta`

பாதுகாப்பில் மாத்திரமன்றி அபிவிருத்தியிலும் இது முக்கியமானது. அதனால் தான் இந்தியா இப்போது இலங்கையில் தனது முதலீடுகளை விரிவாக்குவதில் கவனம் செலுத்துகிறது.

இந்தியாவும் இலங்கையும் விரைவில் பெரும் தேர்தல்களை எதிர்கொள்ள உள்ள சூழ்நிலையில் இரண்டு நாடுகளும் பாதுகாப்பு மற்றும் அபிவிருத்தி நலன்களில் தங்களுக்கிடையில் உள்ள, தொடர்புகளை விட்டுக் கொடுக்கத் தயாராக இருக்காது.

இதனை நிலை நிறுத்துவதற்காக- இந்த உறவுக்கு பாதிப்பு ஏற்படுத்தக் கூடிய விடயங்களில் விட்டுக் கொடுப்புகளுக்கும் சமரசங்களுக்கும் தயாராக இருக்கும்.

### Democratic path

*2024-02-04 17:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175518) · `ta`

There is no doubt that the two great ideological sides are interested in ensuring that the strength of the Tamil people is going to be a Western force with a democratic strength, or that the Maldives is going to be a democratic face -like autocratic ideology.. It is very important that political leadership take advantage of this position in favor of the concept of their homeland theory.

It is inevitable that every political party in the world has different ideas and positions. It is not forgotten that the best characteristic of a political party is to solve all of them independently.

At the same time, other political parties and organizations are working through their general conferences through internal election democracy and their democratic values transparency.. Also, thinkers, civil organizations, journalists and writers are felt that they should continue to act as the guards of national sovereignty.

### International Court and Gaza genocide!

*2024-02-04 17:34:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175513) · `ta`

The verdict does not deal with South Africa's main allegation of Israeli genocide in Palestine. On the contrary, the actions demanded by South Africa are aimed at protecting the rights of the Palestinian people under the genocide.

Temporary measures demanded by South Africa are demands to be put before the final judgment of the main case, and it may take years to the final judgment.

It is true that the rulings of the International Court of Justice are controlled by all sides, but there is no way to implement them.

Anuragumara Dissanayake has used India to express its pro -Indian status by welcoming the country through national unity.

It is noteworthy, however, that his party is providing China's relief packages in the North.

Creating conflict on the island of Sri Lanka may be rulers. The JVP was also the cause of those conflicts.

Especially in 2006, the role of the JVP in pushing the country into war was not underestimated by anyone.

It is only through those who have felt the mistakes of the past, and those who accept those mistakes and provide remedy justice can be embraced by the Tamil people.

### Yemen’s Houthis vow response after U.S., British strikes

*2024-02-04 17:31:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96998/yemens-houthis-vow-response-after-us-british-strikes) · `en`

The United States and Britain launched strikes against 36 Houthi targets in Yemen, in the second day of major U.S. operations against Iran-linked groups following a deadly attack on American troops last weekend.

The strikes late on Saturday hit buried weapons storage facilities, missile systems, launchers and other capabilities the Houthis have used to attack Red Sea shipping, the Pentagon said, adding it targeted 13 locations across the country.

They are the latest blows in a conflict that has spread into the Middle East since Oct. 7, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed Israel from the Gaza Strip, igniting a war that has drawn in an array of armed groups backed by Tehran.

Residents said the strikes shook buildings in Houthi-controlled Sanaa. The group’s military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said the U.S. strikes “will not pass without a response and consequences.” The group did not announce any casualties. Houthi-run media called these “the most violent” strikes yet.

### Will the unity of evolving?

*2024-02-04 17:28:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175553) · `ta`

India is in a state of confusion as to whether the Tamils are excluded to handle Colombo - whether to handle the Tamils and handle the Tamils.

India has not yet moved towards the choice of handling Tamils with Tamils.

Until that situation is created, India will keep the 13th Amendment and the time to create a united position among the Tamil national parties.

However, the Tamil issue has not resolved and the blame for India has abandoned them.

Speaking during a service held in Colombo to mark the 76th year of independence, Cardinal Ranjith said the current leadership class should be removed from power.

"Those who ruled our nation during the latter years have only thought of their future instead of the people's wellbeing. Therefore it is essential to remove this class of leadership and replace them with a new class of leadership," he said.

The Cardinal who compared the Singaporean leaders with the Sri Lankan counterparts said Sri Lankan leaders used certain sections of the population to capture power and safeguard power. Singaporean leaders brought, Chinese, Indian origin and Malay people together," he recalled.

Of course, there are arguments against taxation. Some argue that taxes are high and they are free of economic growth. Others argue that the taxes are unfair and that they are burdened with proportions for the poor.

The debate on taxation will continue for many more years. However, one is clearly. Taxes are essential in any modern society, and they play an important role in financing the public goods and services we all believe in.

In any case, the bill has been passed as most of our MPs voted in favor of the deepest and widths of the status law.. The law has come into effect with the similarity of the Speaker. So people need to understand this reality and act very carefully.

What is important here is that the issue in Sri Lanka is a law or legalization;Is not about. Its proper implementation is on. Whatever the laws are written, it is not properly implemented. We have repeatedly condemned the law that the law does not go on all.

Therefore, the government should not forget that if the new law is implemented in that way or against freedom of expression, its consequences may not be predicted.

The strikes hit buried weapons storage facilities, missile systems, launchers and other capabilities the Houthis have used to attack Red Sea shipping, the Pentagon said, adding it targeted 13 locations across the country.

It was the latest sign of spreading conflict in the Middle East since war erupted between Israel and Hamas after the militant Palestinian group’s deadly assault on Israel on Oct.7.

“This collective action sends a clear message to the Houthis that they will continue to bear further consequences if they do not end their illegal attacks on international shipping and naval vessels,” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said.

Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said the U.S. strikes “will not pass without a response and consequences.”
