Parliamentarians urged to avoid false allegations against state officials, as Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena highlighted concerns over baseless accusations.

ЁЯЯй

Members of Parliament should avoid the presence of the state's top officials and their service to insult fake allegations. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena informed the House that state officials have expressed concern over the fake allegations of MPs.

It is observed that the Member of Parliament is baselessly presenting to the honor of the state's top officials.

The lack of chance of state officials to clarify the allegations made by a few MPs will be considered unjust.

If there are any problems with state officials, there are instructions for handling it properly. Therefore, MPs must avoid the proposal of false accusations to insult state officials. Therefore, I urge you to remove the allegations leveled at state officials in accordance with the Secondary Command (91) (9).

Colombo, Mar. 5 (Daily Mirror) - After a splendid batting performance from Sri Lanka's top order, they will aim for a Twenty20 International (T20I) Series win against Bangladesh when the two teams clash in the second match at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium tomorrow.

Sri Lanka are likely to replace young fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana for the second T20I with either Dilshan Madushanka or Nuwan Thushara.

Pathirana showed signs of injury concern during the first T20I, bowling nine wides and three no-balls in a lengthy spell.

Despite Pathirana struggling, Sri Lanka's top and middle order performed well, with stand-in Captain Charith Asalanka providing a strong finish after impressive knocks from opener Kusal Mendis and middle-order batter Sadeera Samarawickrama.

Apart from Pathirana's struggle, Sri Lanka's overall performance was excellent and changes are unlikely, the Daily Mirror learns.

Colombo, March 5 (Daily Mirror)- Former President Chandrika Kumaratunge today refuted claims by Mihintale Raja Maha Viharadhipathi Ven. Walaha Hengunawewe Dhammarathana Thera that she was getting two pensions.

A statement issued by her office said the allegations by the Thera are false and baseless.

The statement said she was getting only the pension entitled to her as the former President.

It also said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his tenure, increased the pension of the President upto Rs. 97,000 and that the pension of Ms. Kumaratunge and former president D.B. Wijetunge were not increased even though the retired Presidents should also have enjoyed an increase in line with the salary hike of the President.

However, the statement added that the situation was rectified after Maithripala Sirisena was elected President in 2015 and the pension of Ms. Kumaratunge which is credited to her bank account is used only for social services.
