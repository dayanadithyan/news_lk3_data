ECONOMYNEXT — Days after extending an apology to Sri Lanka’s Muslim community on behalf of the government, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said the government has decided to introduce new legislation allowing people to choose between burial and cremation.

“In response, the government has decided to introduce new legislation allowing individuals to choose between burial and cremation according to their wishes. Additionally, provisions have been made for bodies to be donated to medical faculties if desired. These measures aim to prevent similar issues from arising in the future,” he said.

Based on official statements and reports from diplomats involved in their countries’ responses, an AFP tally last week put the toll at more than 1,100.

The dead came from more than 10 countries stretching from the United States to Indonesia, and some governments are continuing to update their totals.

Arab diplomats said last week that Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths — 630 of them unregistered pilgrims.
