A Thai court on Monday acquitted former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, now living in exile, on charges of mishandling funds for a government project in 2013, the latest legal victory for the powerful family of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra.

The action comes shortly after Thaksin, Yingluck’s brother, was released on parole for corruption-related offenses. Last year, he returned home after more than a decade of self-imposed exile, and was detained in a hospital for six months before being granted clemency because of his age and ill health.

Thaksin’s release, after almost two decades of antipathy between his populist political machine and Thailand’s conservative royalist ruling class, raised speculation that Yingluck also might be returning soon.

### Can workers get the salary of the lease agreement?

*2024-03-04 14:37:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177873) · `ta`

Workers' salaries in lease agreements are a complex issue. The Ceylon Workers Congress and unions argue for higher wages, but companies warn of stopping welfare services if basic salaries increase. The 1995 lease agreement between the government and plantation companies led to a joint contract for workers' welfare, but it's unclear if this affects the lease agreement's terms. The 2003 Labor Welfare Joint Agreement, made every three years, includes provisions for fair additional allowances and specific conditions for workers. Despite these agreements, plantation workers' welfare has declined over the years, leading to calls for negotiations and reforms. The government has decided to extend the lease agreement, but unions argue that companies have not complied with agreed salaries.

🟩

Talks about the agony of plantation workers may have begun a goal. When the General Secretary and Minister of the Ceylon Workers Congress, Jeevan Thondaman, during a media briefing held last week, responded to this, the companies say that if the basic salary was paid Rs 1,700, other welfare services would be stopped.. If that happens, he said he would have to lease with companies in this regard.

The unions must understand that the workers' pain and the leasing agreement with the government with the government. At the same time, the unions have forgotten that there is a joint venture on the welfare of the workers.

The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Myanmar Janaka Priyantha Bandara says that unverified reports have been received claiming that a group of eight Sri Lankans who were held hostage at a Cyber Slave Camp in Myanmar have been rescued.

These workers had reportedly travelled to Myanmar without registering with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE).

The Sri Lankans forcibly detained at the terrorist camp in Myawaddy – an area infested with cybercrimes under the grip of an armed group – were reported to be working as cyber slaves forced to commit internet scams.

### Globally, a rightward political shift is visible

*2024-03-04 13:24:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/globally-a-rightward-political-shift-is-visible/) · `en`

The global political scene was very left-inclined from about the mid-1960s to say 10 or 15 years ago. The sweeping trend to social democracy in post-war Europe, a surge to the left throughout Asia (Chinese Revolution, defeat of US Imperialism in Vietnam, post-war USSR, our own JVP) and a little later in Africa (Patrice Lumumba, revolution in Mozambique, Nelson Mandela etc), signposted what may be loosely called a period of global shift to the left. That ended about 10 years ago. The last spurt was perhaps Obama’s re-election. The reverse trend became prominent in the US with Trump and internationally a dynamic that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.

### Factum Perspective: Increasing tensions in the Indian Ocean

*2024-03-04 12:59:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177862) · `ta`

Increasing tensions in the Indian Ocean due to Israel's attack on Hamas, leading to indiscriminate opposition and the involvement of Houthis, Yemen, and Somali pirates. The conflict escalated globally, affecting the US-led coalition and the global economy, with Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, and Syria also involved. The US's handling of the situation, including its contacts with Israel, has been criticized. The situation has become a "universal conflict," with governments supporting different sides, impacting global behavior and order. India plays a significant role in the Indian Ocean, dealing with the Middle East crisis alongside the US. However, India's own issues, including the Gaza crisis and the Maldives, complicate the situation. The situation is further complicated by Sri Lanka's actions in the Red Sea. The UN's role, particularly through Article 99, could have mitigated the conflict.

🟩

When Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, the world's sympathy was seen with the Israeli people. This is a terrorist act and it was formally condemned.

By November, the world began to reflect differently as Israel's opposition became indiscriminate. Palestinian politicians failed to use the support and help of the Arab states to develop their country, thereby allowing Hamas to ensure their position and to undermine the legalization of their justification, and the suffering of the world was so vulnerable.

Then the Houthis began to respond from Yemen, first targeting the ships associated with Israel and gradually expanded to the Western team. We found that the Somali pirates began to work again as a combination of this crisis.
