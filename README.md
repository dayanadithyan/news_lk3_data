### More support for SLPP, UNP than either party’s presidential candidate: IHP poll

ECONOMYNEXT — There is substantially more support for the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s United National Party (UNP) than there is for either party’s presidential candidate, the Institute for Health Policy (IHP)’s monthly poll has found.

(IHP)’s Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) polling director Dr Ravi Rannan-Eliya was quoted as saying in a statement from the institute that its parliamentary election voting intent survey has revealed “substantially more support for the SLPP in a general election than for their presidential candidate, and similarly more support for Wickremesinghe’s presidential candidacy than for the UNP”.

“It would be unwise to write off the SLPP as a political force, since many SLPP voters appeared in August to be switching their presidential vote to Ranil Wickremesinghe. Of course, they could also do this using their second preference votes, which suggests limited voter understanding of that option,” he said.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central government debt fell to 99.83 percent of gross domestic product by June 2024 from 105.49 percent in December, amid exchange rate stability, a reduced budget deficit, and an expanding economy, official data show.

Public debt with guaranteed debt of state enterprises fell to 105.7 percent of GDP in June 2024, down from 112.74 percent in December 2023.

Rolling GDP to June went up to 28,909 billion rupees, from 27,629 in December 2023.

Guaranteed debt includes a credit to the Reserve Bank of India which the central bank is paying down.

When central banks use proceeds of swaps or other debt, it prints money to keep policy rates down and acquires government debt in the process (to sterilize the intervention by running inflationary policy), driving credit and imports.

As a result, central bank dollar borrowings or reserves which are spent to finance private imports, are fully backed with government debt which have already been issued.

### For New Dawn In Post-Election Sri Lanka, Pivot To The BRICS In A Multipolar World

In the run up to elections the post-Marxist National People’s Power (NPP), has run a high-gloss, foreign-funded election campaign to market its policies as a ‘new dawn’. Remarkably, the NPP and rival political parties alike had ignored wider geopolitical developments that may contribute to such a dawn given the globally networked nature of the geostrategic island’s ‘poly crisis’.

Re-orienting the Sri Lankan economy toward the BRICS that is challenging the ‘exorbitant privileged’ of the US dollar as global reserve currency would be one such step. The US dollar has been long used to debt colonize the Global South. However, all major political parties have done little to educate voters about Sri Lanka’s wider geopolitical challenges, or the need to pivot away from the West’s tired debt trap, neocolonialism.

### Janaka Ratnayake criticises political rallies as ‘business ventures’

*2024-09-18 03:45:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Janaka-Ratnayake-criticises-political-rallies-as-business-ventures/56-766838) · `en`

Eksath Lanka Podujana Peramuna Presidential candidate Janaka Ratnayake yesterday expressed concerns over the state of politics in Sri Lanka, claiming that the political landscape has transformed into a business enterprise over the past 76 years, causing significant hardship for the people. Speaking at a media briefing, Ratnayake alleged that candidates routinely organise large election rallies with the help of companies that specialise in assembling crowds.

He further claimed that individuals attending these rallies are paid between Rs. 3,000 and Rs. 5,000, creating an artificial image of public support.

“These gatherings, featured on social and State media, are not representative of genuine political movements,” Ratnayake said.

He claimed that most people are still undecided on whom to vote for. “Our people have become disillusioned with politics,” he said.

### Sri Lanka’s next leader: can make or break the nation

*2024-09-18 02:03:38* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-next-leader-can-make-or-break-the-nation/4-766815) · `en`

As Sri Lanka prepares for its upcoming Presidential election, the stakes have never been higher. In 2022, the country faced an unprecedented economic crisis that brought the nation to a standstill, marked by fuel shortages, soaring inflation, and widespread protests. Since then, the country has taken steps toward stabilising the economy, but much remains to be done. This election is not just about choosing a leader but about securing the nation’s future and ensuring continued recovery from the devastating economic collapse.

The road to recovery has been difficult, but significant progress has been made since 2022, largely supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. However, Sri Lanka remains vulnerable, and the next president must navigate the country through this challenging period with a steady hand. Voters, therefore, must consider candidates who possess the qualities necessary to complete the recovery process and set the nation on a path to sustainable growth.
