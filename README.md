He emphasized the importance of transitioning towards an export-driven economy to prevent another economic collapse, highlighting the need for long-term thinking, especially among the youth.

üü©

President Ranil Wickremesinghe says that if the government's economy will collapse again, the country's economy will fall.

The President pointed out that the people should think about their future and have to take a ging in the presidential election.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed his views participating in the "ASKNIL" program to answer the questions presented by Social Media Brook.

It should be translated as an export economy. If we don't go that far, we cannot rely on. It collapses. Think about the future for the next 3 - 4 years of all of you. Think of what young people have the country in 20 years. Think and vote ... "

Summary so far: There are 39 Presidential hopefuls seeking the mandate from voters to rule Sri Lanka for the next five years. Since Sri Lanka is a country that had been embroiled in an unparalleled economic crisis and still struggling to recover, it is necessary to adopt a suitable policy strategy to push the economy through a high growth path to facilitate it to deliver prosperity and wellbeing to people. This requires the policymakers to give the highest priority to build an innovative or a creative economy.

In this context, the development of human knowledge will generate inventions, but those inventions should be commercially produced by entrepreneurs through a process, identified by the Austrian American economist Joseph Schumpeter as innovation. Then, to lead those innovations to continued economic advancement, as also identified by Schumpeter, the knowledge should be diffused or made known to others, and they should imitate the early innovators.

### Memories of the past of the photos!

*2024-08-19 16:35:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191440) ¬∑ `ta`

Photos capture moments, immortalizing them for future generations. They remind us of growth and change over time, celebrating milestones like birthdays. Poet Vairamuthu's verse, "Don't carry old age, run as a child," resonates with us when viewing old photos, evoking both joyous and poignant memories. Photography, beyond being a mere hobby, is an art form that conveys photographers' talents and ideas. Its evolution, from the Daguerreotype Process in the 19th century to modern digital cameras, reflects humanity's fascination with capturing reality. Today, photography continues to play a crucial role in documenting our world, from personal snapshots to historical images like the iconic "Tank Man" photo. Recognizing the impact of photography, World Photo Day serves as a reminder of its power to convey stories and emotions, making it a vital part of our cultural heritage.

üü©

Photos are the ones that we live in and live in this world forever!

The indirect meaning that we celebrate birthdays is that one year has increased in our lives. The photos taken during the passing of years have been reminiscent of the time they have passed and keep us young.

When we look at those photos in the present, we have a refreshing thing that we will go for that time!

Poet Vairamuthu's concept poetry is "Do not carry out the old age, and run the child ..". When we look at our old photos, these lines are the ones that tap our minds. They are the treasures of the time that bring the happy moments and tragic events in our lives.

Photo is not a movie alone. It is a classic art that expresses the talent of photographers.

It is their artistic art for the famous photographers to express many ideas at the same time.

At the beginning of the 19th century, Louis Daguerre and Joseph Nicephore Niepee designed the operational method of the photo known as "Daguerreotype Process".
