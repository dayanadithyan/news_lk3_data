He further emphasized that transforming Sri Lanka’s healthcare infrastructure cannot rely solely on traditional public investment and funding. Instead, he advocated for a fresh approach that includes a robust foster care system for every Medical Officer of Health (MOH) division and hospital across the country.

Premadasa proposed the introduction of a charity system to supplement government funding. “While various stakeholders often highlight allocations as a percentage of GDP, we need to recognize that government investment alone is insufficient to revitalize our health system,” he noted.

Despite the change in so much politics, Sajith Premadasa has no talk again. Tissa Attanayake goes to Kandy and tells the procession if a government's government's government is. Charitha Herath says that if a government's powerful government is stopped at the elephant. Everyone who read it, we get into court. "
