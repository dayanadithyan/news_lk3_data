Katunayaka, June 5 (Daily Mirror) - A 34-year-old youth from Jaffan was arrested this morning at the Bandaranike International Airport (BIA) while attempting to flee to Canada using a forged passport.

The Immigration and Emmigration officers attached to the airport arrested the suspect and revealed that the suspect had attempted to flee to Canada on the promise of getting Rs. 13 million from a broker in Anuradhapura.

The suspect had completed his flight clearance and presented his passport to the immigration officer. The officer who was suspicious of the photograph in the passport entered the information into the computer system. Later, he revealed that the passport belonged to some other person.

The actual owner of the passport was a person who was banned from leaving the country by the Trincomalee courts.

Accordingly, the suspect was taken to the Immigration Department's Border Enforcement Unit.

Following a search the real passport of the suspect was found in the suspect's bag.

### Modi and allies to meet after India election verdict, key ally pledges support

*2024-06-05 13:19:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99676/modi-and-allies-to-meet-after-india-election-verdict-key-ally-pledges-support) ┬╖ `en`

A key ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged support to him on Wednesday and was set to attend a meeting to discuss forming a coalition government, boosting ModiтАЩs chances of a record-equalling third term in office.

ModiтАЩs Hindu nationalist party lost its outright majority in parliament in a surprise election verdict on Tuesday, and he will need support from partners in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to form the government.

On Wednesday, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), a key regional player in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh which is in the alliance, said it stood firmly with Modi and his party.

тАЬWe are with the NDA, I will be attending the meeting in Delhi today,тАЭ Chandrababu Naidu, the leader of the TDP, told reporters.

The NDA won 293 seats in 543-member lower house of parliament, more than the 272 needed to form a government.

### Step-motherly treatment for Sri Lankan team in US: Sajith tells Parliament

Parliament, June 5 (Daily Mirror)- The Sri Lankan cricket team touring the USA for the World Cup T20 series has faced step-motherly treatment by the International Cricket Council (ICC), Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said today.

He told Parliament that the Sri Lankan team has had to face serious issues with regard to logistics and scheduling of the matches.

He said according to ICC regulations, the team must be located in a hotel within a maximum of 45 minutes distance from the stadium where the match is to be played and that the Sri Lankan team had been located in a hotel with a distance of one and a half hours.

The Opposition Leader said the team has missed practice matches due to these issues and said that only the Sri Lankan team has faced these issues.

"Why this step-motherly treatment only for our team? We cannot expect victory unless they are provide with the necessary facilities. This will affect their outcome," he said.

### тАШProsecutorialтАЩ vs. тАШvictim basedтАЩ approaches to accountability

Why is all the attention to address accountability only fixated on the Sri Lankan State and none on the LTTE?

Although violations by the Government forces and LTTE would be judged by Common Article 3, the fact remains that the leadership of the LTTE who ordered the taking of 300,000 plus civilians, hostage is not among the living or has disappeared, and cannot be subjected to a trial despite the fact that the act of taking civilians hostage amount to a war crime and a crime against humanity. Thus, the exercise of gathering evidence against Government perpetrators pales in significance compared with endangering the security of 300,000 plus civilians that were taken hostage. Despite this, a prosecutorial process would mean a skewed outcome of any trial because of the strong possibility that violations perpetrated by the Sri Lankan Government would dominate the trial

### Economic Transformation Bill: Finally, an opportunity to do things differently

The challenge for the major political parties is to accept the concept and then work out any areas of contention, and areas of improvements

The concept of a legislated economic plan that incorporates economic parameters (or targets) is an opportunity to end 76 years of insanity. The challenge for the major political parties is to accept the concept and then work out any areas of contention, and areas of improvements. Opposing the concept is insanity and a disservice to future generations.

The Economic Transformation Bill is expected to provide for the National Policy on Economic Transformation and for the establishment of the Economic Commission of Sri Lanka, Investment Zones, Office for International Trade, National Productivity Commission, and Sri Lanka Institute of Economics and International Trade, and for the repeal of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law No.4 of 1978 and other matters connected.

### Interventions of a freelance intellectual: A review of Dayan JayatillekaтАЩs selected writings

British philosopher and historian Perry Anderson defines Western Marxism as the product of defeat. Unlike in the Soviet Union and China, there were no successful Marxist revolutions in the West. The Western Marxist is then a vanquished and disenchanted figure. Never having known the taste and trials of success, the Western Marxist reduces socialism to an abstract ideal and an impotent exercise in scholasticism.

The theologian and Marxist scholar Roland Boer identifies the тАЬfreelance intellectualтАЭ as the chief proponent of Western Marxism. In short, the freelance intellectual is the academic, journalist, cultural critic, etc. who purveys a form of Marxist analysis but is, for the most part, independent of the discipline and accountability enforced by membership in a Communist Party or trade union. In China, to be a Communist means to be a Community Party member. In the West, one is free to adopt any label one pleases.

### Are we ready to accept our migrants again?

It is necessary to identify the silver lining of the current migration wave and harness the maximum benefit from┬аSri Lankan migrants for the countryтАЩs future prosperity

While accepting migration trends and waves, Sri Lanka must implement policies that encourage migrants to contribute back to the country. This could strengthen Sri Lankan society in two ways: demotivating unnecessary migration while embracing those who have migrated with the same fraternity. Given the global and historical trends, it is high time to establish state migration and diasporic policies to address these issues and turn brain drain into an opportunity

тАЬMigrationтАЭ is a prevalent topic in Sri Lanka today, affecting all social and age groups. It brings both positive and negative consequences for individuals who could be felt both short-term and long-term. While migration has recently come under the spotlight in Sri Lankan society, it is an age-old phenomenon with a vast global history.
