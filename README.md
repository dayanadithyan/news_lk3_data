### New Acting Attorney General takes oath

*2024-07-01 10:44:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100213/new-acting-attorney-general-takes-oath) ┬╖ `en`

Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe took oaths as the Acting Attorney General before the Chief Justice, Ada Derana reporter said.

Last week, it was reported that the proposal to extend incumbent Attorney General Sanjay RajaratnamтАЩs term by another 06 months was defeated for the second time at the Constitutional Council meeting.

The proposal, which was submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, was defeated with 05 votes against it while 03 members voted in favour.

RajaratnamтАЩs current term is set to expire at the end of this month, and the President had proposed an extension for an additional six months.

However, the proposal requires the approval of the Constitutional Council, which twice defeated it.

Accordingly, Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe, who is the son of former Chief Justice K. A. Parinda Ranasinghe has been appointed as the Acting AG.

### US says elections in Iran тАШnot free and fairтАЩ, wonтАЩt change regimeтАЩs direction

IranтАЩs elections are not тАШfree and fair,тАЩ the US State Department told Iran International on Sunday, in its first comments on the results of FridayтАЩs votes that led to a runoff between a moderate and a hardline candidate.

The June 28 presidential election marked the lowest voter turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic, with only 39.92 percent participation. This breaks the previous record set during the last election, in which the late President Ebrahim Raisi won with a turnout of 48 percent.

тАЬThe elections in Iran are not free and fair,тАЭ a State Department spokesperson said.

тАЬUnfortunately, we have no expectation that these elections, whatever the outcome, will lead to fundamental change in IranтАЩs direction or more respect by the Iranian regime for the human rights of IranтАЩs citizens,тАЭ the spokesperson added, as the Iranian government prepares for a runoff presidential election slated for July 5.

R. Sampanthan, a key figure in Sri Lanka's Tamil National Alliance, passed away, leaving a significant void in Tamil politics. Known for his dedication to public service over a legal career, Sampanthan's diplomatic efforts were pivotal in the Tamil community's struggles. His loss is deeply felt, especially in the Trincomalee district, where he represented Tamil interests. A unifying force within the party system, his absence marks the end of an era in Tamil political history. Condolences pour in for his family, friends, and supporters, with prayers for his soul.

ЁЯЯй

Former leader of the Sri Lanka Tamil National Alliance (TNA), Tamil National Alliance leader, former opposition leader and Trincomalee district parliamentarian R. Sampanthan's death. Parliamentarian

The loss of Annar is a disaster for the Tamil national political area. He is a great man who sacrificed his legal career and engaged in people's politics.

It must be remembered at this moment that he used his political sort of politicalism and experience as diplomacy on many occasions during the three kinds of struggle of the Tamils.

His loss, which was the ultimate belief in the Tamil representation of the Trincomalee district, is not compensated.

He is the only one who coordinated the historic party and the federation of parties that traveled in different currents, and in all his enabled times, his personality would not be shattered.

Our race today has lost a long -term experience of the political history of Sri Lankan Tamils.

Sri Lanka should advocate for genuine and impactful change from the next UK government while also striving for systemic change within its own country

The anticipated victory of the Labour Party in the forthcoming general election in the United Kingdom presents a pivotal opportunity for political activists campaigning for a fairer and more sustainable Sri Lanka. This potential shift in power offers a chance to press for significant changes in the global economic order. For Sri Lanka to overcome its external debt crisis and economic difficulties, LabourтАЩs commitment to strengthening and reforming multilateral institutions, tackling corruption and illicit money flows, and supporting the recovery of stolen assets is crucial.

The table illustrates the accumulated foreign currency inflow gap for Sri Lanka over the past five years compared to 2018, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Easter Sunday attacks. To emerge from the current crisis, it is crucial to strengthen and expand these verticals. According to the table, Sri Lanka has experienced a loss of about $ 26 billion over the past five years, compared to if it had maintained the same inflow numbers as in 2018 each year.

The impact from tourism over the past five years amounts to approximately $ 13.9 billion. During this period, the industry was severely affected due to a global tourism slowdown. Consequently, we failed to maintain hotel standards even at their previous levels. This has resulted in poor conditions of the facilities, pressing room rates down compared to regional competitors.

A pulse check of corporate Sri Lanka reveals that there are mixed feelings about the appropriateness and effectiveness of Performance Reviews (PRs). While there are some who swear on the positive role which PRs play through their focus on goal setting, performance monitoring and employee development under an overarching umbrella of performance management, there are others who believe that PRs do more harm than good because they are not conducted methodically, transparently and/or democratically and because they are too focused on the past, time-wasting, one-sided, inaccurate, unfair, pre-meditated and biased.

### Rock, paper, scissors: Sri LankaтАЩs mineral merry-go-round

We can achieve little in isolation in this modern milieu, and this rings true even in the muddy business of minerals and mining

Sri LankaтАЩs mineral resources were once again in the spotlight recently, when news broke that India had shown interest in acquiring mines in Sri Lanka. As detailed in a study by the Institute of Policy Studies earlier this year, the local graphite industry must reposition itself with adequate international partnerships to take maximum advantage of the resource. Sri Lanka has about 1.5 million tonnes of graphite, which is inadequate to meet serious international demand, but the quality of the deposit promises a high price.

German investment via Bogala Graphite Ltd. over the past two decades have seen significant value addition and enhanced operating standards, and despite a 70% decline in operating profits last year due to global exigencies the sector has grown well with foreign participation.

### Imputed Rental Income Tax is an additional burden

*2024-07-01 05:30:31* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Imputed-Rental-Income-Tax-is-an-additional-burden/14-763699) ┬╖ `en`

Many owners of houses (that are somewhat small) located in Colombo have given these on rent and have moved to more spacious houses in the suburbs.

This they are compelled to do when family members increase when their children get married. The rent received from these houses is not enough to pay the rent for the relatively bigger house. Inevitably they have to pocket out an extra sum of money to bridge the difference.

With the proposed imputed rental income to be implemented in mid-next year, this will become an additional burden for the home owners who have given their houses for a smaller rent and paying a bigger amount for the occupation of a larger house. Hope the President will rescind the move to impose the тАЬImputed Rental IncomeтАЭ for the above reason.

### Complaint filed against SIS over COVID-19 forced cremations

Activist Chirantha Amerasinghe filed a complaint against the State Intelligence Service (SIS) over the controversial forced cremations of COVID-19 dead. Amerasinghe and several others filed the complaint at the Sri Lanka Police Headquarters on Saturday.

Speaking to the media, Amerasinghe said the mandatory cremation policy was imposed to target the Muslim community in an attempt to oppress them.

He noted that while the Easter Sunday attack mastermind Zahran Hashim at one point could not find followers for his cause, the various attacks against the Muslim community helped him recruit over 35 members at the time.

Amerasinghe claimed that the SIS had informed the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) that COVID-19 could spread through water contamination. Based on this SIS information, he said he was detained by the police in 2020 after he posted on social media that there was no evidence of negative impacts from burying COVID-19 victims.

The MP made this claim while attending a political talk show on a private radio channel on Saturday.

During the show, the MP emphasised that estate workers are weary from protesting for wages that meet their basic livelihood needs. He highlighted the cycle where increased wages lead to higher living costs, stressing the need to break this cycle.

The MP proposed that workers should receive maximum benefits from their labour, suggesting a solution by dividing current plantation estates and making workers small estate owners, granting them management responsibilities.

*2024-07-01 03:42:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187346) ┬╖ `ta`

The obstacle to granting land rights to workers includes internal government delays, opposition from companies owning plantation lands, and lack of political pressure. Despite Cabinet approval, policy preparation and company consent delay implementation. Political alliances and promises unfulfilled contribute to the complexity.

ЁЯЯй

There are no political pressures to grant land rights to workers. Reports suggest that other parties, including the PA, should not implement this to Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena.. This is one of the reasons why the Ceylon Workers Congress broke the alliance with Mahinda Rajapaksa.

The government is being successfully implemented by the government's permanent land providing scheme.. President Ranil Wickremesinghe goes to the country and gives land to the people who have been enrolled under the scheme.. But under his leadership, the plantation workers submitted by three ministers in the Cabinet are allowed to grant land rights.

Despite the approval of the Cabinet, the plan to provide land rights to the plantation people is not immediately implemented because it takes time to prepare a policy plan document.. Although the document is currently being prepared, the companies and some political parties have expressed their opposition to the project.
