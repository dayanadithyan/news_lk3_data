### Tamil Nadu and the Central Government of India should abandon the Kacha island for politics - Secretary of the Northern Province Fisheries Internet

*2024-04-08 17:17:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180751) ┬╖ `ta`

### Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda

*2024-04-08 17:05:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180713) ┬╖ `ta`

Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda criticized villagers for protesting lime excavation in Ponnaveli, Kilinochchi. He was previously aware of anti-Tamil activities. Devananda's actions, including land acquisition for sand and stone sales, are seen as plundering Tamil resources. The village, a traditional Eelam site, has been protected by native communities for years. The minister's plans to create saltwater warehouses and dig up the Murukkalis have sparked concern.

ЁЯЯй

The villagers were opposed to the villagers on the 05th of last month for a lime excavation in the village of Ponnaveli, Poonakari Divisional Secretariat, Kilinochchi.

Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda has also attacked the people who participated in the protest.

Parliamentarian Sivagnanam Sreedharan held a media briefing on Sunday.

Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda's actions were not yesterday, but when he was a Member of Parliament, he was openly aware that he had the anti -Tamil activities of the Tamils..

If he has identified himself as a Member of Parliament who represents the aspirations of a legitimate honorable Tamils, he should not plunder the resources of the Tamil people and maintain the resources of the Tamil people.

But it is not a matter of fact that it is not a matter of identification as a minister who takes the land of the Tamils, selling sand and selling stone.

### Sri Lanka Hones Its Balancing Act

*2024-04-08 13:20:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lanka-hones-its-balancing-act/) ┬╖ `en`

Colombo has demonstrated its own brand of strategic autonomy on issues from RussiaтАЩs war in Ukraine to ChinaтАЩs global footprint

Most South Asian governments tend to have nonaligned foreign policies, balancing their relations with major powers. This maximizes their diplomatic flexibility and ability to operate independently on the world stage, also known as strategic autonomy. India and Pakistan are two prominent examples: They both balance their relations with the United States and at least one of its core rivals (Russia and China, respectively).

But itтАЩs important not to overlook Sri Lanka: In the last two years, Colombo has quietly and successfully navigated global conflict and great-power rivalry. Like many other countries in the region, Sri Lanka has not condemned RussiaтАЩs war in Ukraine, even though resulting price shocks exacerbated its own economic crisis in 2022. Yet it has┬аcalled┬аfor an end to the war and┬аannounced┬аnew measures that step up economic and energy ties with India.

### If the Kalmunai North is the Eastern Balance of the East - Kanakaratnam Sukash

Kanakaratnam Sukash warns that losing Kalmunai North could disrupt the eastern balance and remove Ampara from the Tamil nation map. The Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat, independent for 34 years, faces administrative repression. This is seen as state terrorism, as it violates the Cabinet decision and the law. The Tamil nation is rallying for justice, with protests continuing for 14 days. The Tamil National Alliance has filed a lawsuit, and the struggle will continue until justice is served.

ЁЯЯй

If the Kalmunai North is lost, the eastern balance will go into question. Ampara will be removed from the Tamil nation map. The Tamil National People's Front media spokesman Kanakaratnam Sukash said that the people should think.

He was speaking at a special press conference as the public on Sunday (07) is carrying out a protest rally against the continuous administrative repression of the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat in Ampara District.

Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat has been an independent Divisional Secretariat for 34 years. But here is not a separate Divisional Secretary. This is one of the surprises of Sri Lanka. There is no one who is an accountant. The Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat is in line with the illegal order of the Kalmunai South Divisional Secretary. This is the state's power.
