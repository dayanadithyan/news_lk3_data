*2024-01-21 17:03:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174455) · `ta`

தற்­போது முஸ்­லிம்­களைப் பற்றிய புரிதல் பௌத்த சிங்­கள மக்­க­ளி­டையே ஓரளவு ஏற்­பட்­டுள்­ளது. அதனால், முஸ்­லிம்­களின் அச்­சமும் குறைந்­துள்­ளது. ஆனால், முழு­மை­யாக நீங்­க­வில்லை. அதற்­கு­ரிய நட­வ­டிக்­கை­களை முஸ்லிம் தலை­வர்கள் மேற்­கொள்­ள­வில்லை. ஆட்­சி­யா­ளர்­களும் அதனைச் செய்­ய­வில்லை.

இவ்­வாறு  இஸ்­லா­மிய மார்க்­கத்தின் அடிப்­ப­டை­யி­லான தனித்­து­வ­மான அடை­யா­ளங்கள் கேள்­விக்­குள்­ளாகிக்கொண்­டி­ருக்­கின்ற நிலையில், முஸ்­லிம்­களின் அர­சியல் தனித்­து­வமும் இல்­லாமல் செய்­யப்­பட்டுக்கொண்­டி­ருக்­கி­றது.

“On April 21, 2019, the dead in churches sacrificed their lives for their belief. They came to the church because they believed in Christ that day. They sacrificed their lives because they loved Christ like other saints, "he said.

“One can name him as a saint only after five years of sacrifice. Therefore, we will move forward to the victims of Easter Sunday as saints on April 21 this year, ”he added.

"Christianity is not just about engaging in religious worship in churches. We have to stand for justice. We need to speak for the justice of others. This is what Pope Francis has taught us in his scripture how to act. ”
