Dasun Shanaka produced a solid all-round performance, including bowling figures of 4/23, as former champions Sri Lanka overcame some jittery moments to down Ireland by 41 runs in their T20 World Cup warm-up game.

Put in to bat at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground here on Friday, Sri Lanka saw their batting misfire in the initial phases of the game.

They lost half of their side for 82 runs in 11 overs before managing to post a respectable 163/8.

All-rounders Wanindu Hasaranga (26), Angelo Mathews (32), and Shanaka (23) fired up the proceedings down the order to take them to a competitive total.

In reply, quick-fire knocks from Paul Stirling (21) and George Dockrell (17) were the bright spots in the initial stages of the Irish chase, but former skipper Shanaka swung the momentum with his medium pace bowling as Ireland were bowled out for 122 in 18.2 overs.

### India votes in final phase of elections as both Modi and Rahul Gandhi eye victory

*2024-06-01 12:08:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/India-votes-in-final-phase-of-elections-as-both-Modi-and-Rahul-Gandhi-eye-victory/108-283878) ¬∑ `en`

FIROZPUR/KOLKATA, June 1 (Reuters) - India voted on Saturday in the final phase of a long-drawn general election, held in record summer heat in many parts, as both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his challengers said they would win the polls centred mostly on inequality and religion.

The seven-phase vote, in which nearly a billion people were eligible to cast their ballots, began on April 19 and will end with polling in the last 57 seats - including in Modi's constituency in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi.

More than 100 million people are registered to vote across eight states and federal territories on Saturday, including in the northern state of Punjab and the eastern states of Bihar, West Bengal and Odisha.

"Calling upon the voters to turnout in large numbers and vote," Modi said as polls opened. "Together, let's make our democracy more vibrant and participative."

### Colombo inflation cools to 0.9% in May

*2024-06-01 11:25:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Colombo-inflation-cools-to-0-9-in-May/108-283870) ¬∑ `en`

The Colombo district inflation eased further to 0.9 percent in May, from 1.5 percent in April, as both food and non-food prices continued their months-long streak of declines, although the prices could firm up slightly in the coming months, due to somewhat higher prices for staples, as a result of the current weather and revving up of economic activities with the lower interest rates.

Measured on a monthly basis, the prices fell 0.6 percent in the month, adding to the 1.9 percent and 0.8 percent falls in the prices in both March and April, respectively.

After a sharp rise in prices in the nearly last two years, the prices came back to better balance from 2023 onwards, due to the easing of global energy prices and other commodities prices.

Meanwhile, the availability of foreign currency in the country, due to the normalising tourism and remittances, also helped the prices to come back to the acceptable level, as the imported goods could be made in sufficient supply.

Health experts have raised concerns about the rising use of tobacco products among schoolchildren in Sri Lanka.

Speaking on World No-Tobacco Day which fell yesterday (31), Dr. Shakya Nanayakkara, Chairman of the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board, highlighted that tobacco products are becoming increasingly common in schools.

Dr. Nanayakkara emphasized that children who become addicted to these products are likely to progress to smoking cigarettes.

He also noted the growing popularity of e-cigarettes globally, cautioning that individuals who develop a nicotine habit through e-cigarettes are at a high risk of transitioning to smoking traditional cigarettes.

Further, he warned that the ingestion of nicotine can lead to adverse effects such as dizziness, vomiting, and general physical discomfort.

As such, Dr. Nanayakkara urged parents and teachers to educate children about the dangers of nicotine and the reasons for its use.

He argues the suspension, due to alleged exam misconduct, is suspicious and linked to intolerance towards Zahira College's growth.

‚ÄúThe suspension was based on the accusation that they closed their ears in the exam hall.

Writing the examination of the examination should be noticed in the exam hall. It is not a matter of affecting other examiners.

It is immensely suspicious that the results have been suspended even after all sides have made it clear to all sides.

It is very clear that this is the manifestation of the ethnic discrimination of those who cannot tolerate the development of Zahira College.

This can be understood by the mood of the exam supervisor who brought this issue to be resolved in the exam hall.

It is not healthy that we speak the same language. Those who are concerned about the sad state of today's sad state of children and children must understand.

‚ÄúCurrently non -academic staff are on strike. This is an unfortunate thing. This is because the students of the future are affected by this. This results in a direct loss of about 150 million rupees a day. This is only a financial loss. Human times are wasted there.

So the government does not need to waste more than one more hour. I think the strike as a parent is also impact. So they do not want to follow this. Now we need to see how to find the right solution.

### Red herrings, referendums, poverty and postponing elections

Even though an election has not been officially announced by the Commissioner of Elections, election fever has hit our political parties. The Secretary of the United National Party (UNP) suggested a possible postponement of elections. Was he drawing a red herring to test the political waters?

The ordinary man on the street though, has not been drawn into this conversation. They are looking for ways and means to keep the wolf from the door. But this does not mean they are disinterested.

On 29 May, nearly all news media carried the pathetic tale of a mother of four living in Padaviya, having had electricity and water supply to her house being disconnected. Four months ago her husband-the sole breadwinner of the family died in a tragic accident. She has been unable to make ends meet since then.

The youngest child is 40 days old! The two elder children study in the fourth and second grades at their school, while the third child is a two-year-old.

### Referendum to extend President‚Äôs term: Is it ploy to avoid election defeat?

It is undoubtedly election phobia of the United National Party (UNP) headed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe that prompted Palitha Range Bandara, the General Secretary of the Party to suggest on Tuesday to hold a referendum to extend the term of the President and Parliament for two more years.

‚ÄúThis is the best option at this moment to save the nation. The Government has reached agreements with the IMF, World Bank and other donors on economic reforms and it is essential to extend the terms of the President and Parliament to make this exercise a success,‚Äù Range Bandara told the media.

Although Wickremesinghe and several other UNP leaders have disowned their General Secretary‚Äôs statement, the general perception is that this is not his personal opinion but a collective decision of the top most few inner circle leaders of the party to test the waters ‚Äì to feel the response of the people and the Opposition.

### Four Sri Lankans arrested in India for smuggling; here Rohan Gunaratne accuses Muslims of radicalisation

Four Sri Lankans were arrested on Monday, 20 May 2024 at the Ahmadabad Airport in India for smuggling of gold and drugs.

According to Daily Mirror of 23 May 2024 Sri Lanka‚Äôs state intelligence has asked for further information from India‚Äôs state intelligence to verify the background of these alleged suspects, as well as to probe if they are actually linked to the ISIS network.

Thus so far there was no report of their involvement in any organisation promoting violence. One should not forget the government in power in India is extremely hostile to Muslims. They demonise and unleash violence against Muslims. On the other hand it is ridiculous to state that they went to India to commit crime for a mere Rs. 100,000 each.

Colombo, May 31 (Daily Mirror)- President Ranil Wickremesinghe is trying to open doors to economic hitmen like billionaire Elon Musk, George Soros and James Packer by introducing the Economic Transformation Bill, NPP Economic Council member Sunil Hadunnetti said.

Addressing a meeting with the business community in Badulla recently, he said President Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed that Elon Musk is coming to Sri Lanka to provide WIFI.

"Ranil said in 2015 that free WIFI will be made available to all. He has now dropped the word 'free' and says WIFI will be given in 2024. Elon Musk will never give free WIFI," he said.

He said Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed earlier that James Packer is coming to invest in Sri Lanka. But he never came with any investments.

Hadunnetti said a publicity stunt is being operated through a separate company by using government funds to show that foreign investors are coming to the country.
