ECONOMYNEXT – India’s unprecedented invitation to Sri Lanka’s Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) for an official visit is seen as positive to proceed with Delhi’s plans in the island nation without resistance but also has raised political concerns ahead of presidential polls this year.

The JVP-led coalition National People’s Power (NPP) has gained more popularity in the recent past after the 2022 mass protests that forced former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and his brother, ex-Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, to resign amid an unprecedented economic crisis.

Political analysts and diplomats say JVP has now become a formidable political force in Sri Lanka after the policies of two main parties with center-right and center-left thoughts have failed the nation in their 76 years of ruling since the 1948 independence.

### Has The JVP Come Of Age Or Is It Bluffing? - EDITORIAL

Anura Kumara Dissanayake is presently in India. The head of the JVP/NPP alliance is actually on an official visit to India, at the invitation of the Indian government. Believe it or not, AKD – as he is popularly known – has in addition to holding discussions with Indian External Affairs Minister, Jaishankar, also held meetings with Indian Defence Advisor, Ajit Doval!

The JVP has come a long way from its initial foray into international analyses where in 1971 it saw Lanka’s only real proletarian worker group (the Indian Tamil estate workers) as Indian fifth columnists; it spoke of uprooting tea bushes and replanting these areas with potatoes.

In the late 1980s, the JVP warned the Sinhala electorate of Indian expansionism, and led a bloody revolt based on its opposition to the establishment of the Provincial Councils system. Today, the JVP has embraced Provincial Councils.

Tamil nationalism would take the same perilous journey, dragging the country down with it

When pro-Palestinian groups planned protests on Armistice Day last year, policymakers in Europe were livid, calling, rightly so, the conduct ‘disgraceful’. No matter the context – in this case, the Israeli military campaign on Gaza in response to the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7th – such protests held on a special day of the collective memory are an affront to the majority, insensitive and provocative.

This country can never improve as long as there is a decision in the election, without considering the future of the future.. President Ranil Wickremesinghe boasts that the land certificate has been issued through the Urithi project.

The president is working on the presidential election this year. It is doubtful how true this land certification is, because the president is talented in referring to the fake promises.

If people like Keheliya Rambukwella should not be appointed as the Minister of Health in the future, the National Pharmacy Control Authority should be free from the Ministry of Health and act as an independent authority.

### Plans to ship human ashes, drink container to Moon spark legal debate

An array of unconventional, privately funded plans to exploit the moon, including as a site for human ashes and sports-drink containers, has gathered steam in recent years as NASA pushes to make Earth’s natural satellite more accessible.

Concerns about possible gaps in U.S. oversight and legal questions about proper use of the moon have rocketed to the forefront.

Landers built by private companies and emerging space powers are expected in the next few years to join the U.S. flag and other vestiges of past programs to the moon. Other initiatives could include using the moon as a site for capsules of human remains, advertising sports drinks, and maybe even a two-story-tall Christian cross made of the moon’s own dirt.

“We’re just at the beginning of exploring the moon, and ... we need to be careful we’re not contaminating it - not just with biological and chemical contamination but with litter,” said Leslie Tennen, an attorney practicing international space law.

Colombo (News 1st) – Donald Trump’s hopes of avoiding a trial over alleged attempts to falsify the results of the 2020 presidential election that he lost, were dealt a serious blow on Tuesday (6th) when a Federal Court of Appeal handed down a scathing ruling that the former president does not have presidential immunity for such actions, U.S. media reported.

The federal appeals court in the District of Columbia, the nation’s capital, said his immunity claims would reject "the most fundamental check on executive power."

In addition, they said that Trump's stance "would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the President beyond the reach of all three Branches."

The all-female 3-judge bench also gave Trump very little time to appeal to the highest court in the land, with a deadline of next Monday (12th) to approach the Supreme Court to suspend their ruling. Trump’s attorneys said they would appeal.

India has rapidly emerged as an economic giant and a technology hub in the past two decades, while Singapore has solidified its position as a regional hub for businesses. Fortunately, Sri Lanka finds itself in close proximity to India and not far from Singapore. Yet, the key lies in leveraging these two economic powerhouses for enhanced collaboration to attract business, investments, and crucially, for market access.

Should Sri Lanka cultivate stronger ties with these hubs, as it stands to position itself as a crucial point in the value chain? Beyond considerations of South Asia and Southeast Asia, looking at the broader Asia Pacific region underscores the significance of partnering with Australia. However, the geographical distance may pose challenges.

The union told the Daily Mirror that the water capcity of reservoirs were initially at full, reaching 100 percent. However, with the commencement of dry weather conditions, the water capacity has now decreased to 87 percent.

Accordingly, thermal power generation accounted for 56.7 percent, with 45 percent of this generated through the use of fuel, while the remaining power generation was attributed to furnace oil.

Additionally, the Lakvijaya Power Station, commonly referred to as the Noracholai Power Station, plays a crucial role in contributing to Sri Lanka's overall electricity production, generating a substantial 900 MW.

### Motion filed against NPP’s registration as a political party

A motion was filed before the Supreme Court today (Feb.06) challenging the registration of the National People’s Power (NPP) by the Election Commission.

Vinivida Foundation’s secretary Attorney-at-Law Nagananda Kodituwakku has put forward the motion pertaining to a petition filed against the Election Commission’s decision to reject the registration of ‘Vinivida Foundation’ as a political party.

Kodituwakku claims that the registration of NPP, which is part of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), as a political party is completely against the law.

Pursuant to Article 103(2) of the Constitution, registering different branches of one party as separate political parties is in violation of the election laws, he alleges.

It also violates the right to free and fair elections guaranteed by the Constitution, Kodituwakku pointed out further, seeking permission from the Supreme Court to make submissions in this regard.

Political leaders lacked wisdom to bring about an all-embracing national revival, but a Sinhala Buddhist revival

To consider what the future holds for Sri Lanka, a glance at its past and present should prove useful as we could thereby contextualise and perhaps begin to understand what that likely future could be. Unless we look at our past mistakes dispassionately, attempt to learn from them and take meaningful steps to re-chart our national course, we are most likely to continue to allow history to repeat itself.

According to the Supreme Court's decision. Since the legislative process of Parliament is jointly accompanied by the Attorney General's Department and the Department of Law, there is no chance of acting in contrast to the High Court's decision on the Bill or in violation of the Constitution.

The Speaker's Office's dissatisfaction is that it is worrying that even those who are familiar with the legal system and the constitution are negatively speaking to the existence of the Supreme Court.

Any Member of Parliament is invited to discuss all the documents and actions regarding the implementation of the Ceremony Act and consult intellectual authorities on the issue.

It is not a beneficial tactic to dismantle the legislation or undermine its credibility. The Speaker's Office wants to remind all members that the overall assessment in the democratic system is based on the collective functioning of all parts, including legalization.

### Donald Trump does not have presidential immunity, US court rules

Donald Trump does not have presidential immunity and can be prosecuted on charges of plotting to overturn the 2020 election, a US court has ruled.

Mr Trump had claimed in the landmark legal case that he was immune from criminal charges for acts he said fell within his duties as president.

But Tuesday’s ruling in Washington DC struck down that claim.

It is a setback for Mr Trump who has for years cited presidential immunity while battling multiple cases.

The former president is expected to appeal against the ruling, meaning the case could ultimately go to the Supreme Court where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority.

US Special Counsel Jack Smith has charged Mr Trump, 77, with conspiring to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election and committing fraud to stay in office.

The trial in that case was initially scheduled for 4 March, but was postponed pending a ruling on the immunity claim.

It could be delayed for weeks, if not months, if the case ends up before the Supreme Court.

### JVP: From Idealism Of Anti-Indianism To Pragmatic Realism(?)

*2024-02-06 20:29:39* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/jvp-from-idealism-of-anti-indianism-to-pragmatic-realism/) · `en`

The official visit of Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the JVP/NPP leadership team to India this week marks a significant departure from the party’s historical stance on Indo-Lanka relations. Originating in the Sixties with an ingrained anti-Indian rhetoric, the JVP’s recent responsiveness to India’s call suggests a pragmatic shift, signaling its readiness to engage with India should it assume power in Sri Lanka’s next government.

Amidst widespread frustration towards the Ranil- Rajapaksa regime, the current political climate in Sri Lanka presents opportunities for alternative political forces. The JVP, attuned to the discontent among ordinary citizens deprived of basic necessities and hope for a better future, appears poised to capitalize on this sentiment. While facing competition from Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, who enjoys significant support among the marginalized masses, the JVP’s evolving politics and strategic realignment make it a formidable contender.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Egypt’s president on Tuesday as part of a 48-hour, four-nation flurry of shuttle diplomacy in search of a ceasefire in Gaza’s war, while Israel pressed its onslaught in the south of the enclave.

Israel said its forces had killed dozens of Palestinian gunmen throughout Gaza in the past 24 hours with fighting focused on Khan Younis in the south, with a threatened assault looming on a nearby border town teeming with displaced people.

Blinken arrived in Egypt after a stop in Saudi Arabia, and then departed for Qatar, for meetings with the main countries acting as mediators in the Gaza war. Palestinians hope the U.S. top diplomat’s Middle East swing will nail down a ceasefire before Israeli forces storm Gaza’s southern fringes where over a million displaced people are sheltering.
