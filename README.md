The executive board of the International Monetary Fund confirmed a deal with Egypt to increase its bailout loan from $3 billion to $8 billion, in a move that is meant to shore up the Arab country’s economy which is hit by a staggering shortage of foreign currency and soaring inflation.

In a statement late Friday, the board said its decision would enable Egypt to immediately receive about $820 million as part of the deal which was announced earlier this month.

The deal was achieved after Egypt agreed with the IMF on a reform plan that is centered on floating the local currency, reducing public investment and allowing the private sector to become the engine of growth, the statement said.

Egypt has already floated the pound and sharply increased the main interest rate. Commercial banks are now trading the U.S. currency at more than 47 pounds, up from about 31 pounds. The measures are meant to combat ballooning inflation and attract foreign investment.

### Russian Presidential Election Results

*2024-03-30 18:39:19* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/russian-presidential-election-results/) · `en`

Russia is exultant about the outcome of the Presidential election. The poll was 77% of the electorate and Putin secured 87% of the votes cast; a landslide on both counts.

Russians are enjoying themselves mocking America and the West: “When has your President ever won 87% of the vote in a poll where 77% of the electorate participated?” Actually, never since 1904 has the turnout at a US election exceeded 66% and, in any case direct comparison in not possible because of the American “Electoral College System”.

Colombo, March 30 (Daily Mirror)- India remains unresponsive to the request by Sri Lanka to allow an innocent passage through the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for its fishermen to enter the Arabian Sea, a top source said.

The President embarked on a two-day visit to India in July last year, his first since taking office last year after a tumultuous period that saw the island nation’s economy tank, and protests erupt on its streets leading to ouster of former leaders.

### Baltimore bridge collapse: Insurance loss could hit $3 billion

The collapse of a bridge in the US city of Baltimore will result in the largest single marine insurance loss ever, a British insurance marketplace said.

Six people were presumed dead after a ship crashed into the bridge, and divers have recovered two bodies.

Experts say the damages could cost as much as $3 billion (£2.3 billion).

“I would say it’s certainly going to be one of the largest marine losses in history,” said John Neal, chief executive officer of Lloyd’s of London.

“Of that there is little or no doubt,” Mr Neal told the BBC. “But genuinely the good news is it’s insured.”

Mr Neal said the port and the ship that crashed into the bridge are also insured.

“So from a financial point of view, there is a process that will allow for financial compensation to be made and for the claim to be settled,” he said.

The Maryland Department of Transportation has so far asked the Biden administration for $60m in emergency funds to help clear debris and clean up after the incident.

### Sri Lanka seasonal food protectionist tax to replace SCL from Jan 01

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will replace a ‘special commodity levy’ with a new protectionist tax from January 01, State Minister Ranjit Siyambalapitiya said, which will give extra profit to farmers and keep food prices high.

“The special commodity levy, which was used to protect domestic farmers and domestic producers, will be removed from January 01,” Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

The special commodity levy was advocated by then trade minister Bandula Gunawardana, as the US fired a commodity boom ahead of the collapse of a US housing bubble in a bid to reduce the tax on tax effect of duties, para-tariffs and make food taxes more transparent, according to some analysts.

However, the tax came under fire due to being slapped at midnight as tax payers and the hungry were sleeping and its alleged manipulation to give profits to some importers.
