### ஜனநாயகத்தில் தேர்தல்களுக்கு ஏற்புடைய மாற்று எதுவுமில்லை

*2024-06-05 02:09:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185335) · `ta`

ஜனாதிபதிக்கும் பாராளுமன்றத்துக்கும் அரசியலமைப்பு ரீதியான ஆணையின் பிரகாரம  உள்ள ஐந்து வருட பதவிக்காலத்துக்கும் அப்பால் பதவியில் இருப்பதற்கான சகல தெரிவுகளையும் அரசாங்கத் தலைவர்கள் பரிசீலிக்கின்றார்கள் போன்று தெரிகிறது.  ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலையும் பாராளுமன்ற தேர்தலையும் இரு வருடங்களுக்கு ஒத்திவைப்பது குறித்த யோசனை ஒன்றை ஐக்கிய தேசிய கட்சியின் பொதுச் செயலாளர் பாலித ரங்கே பண்டார கடந்த வாரம் அறிவித்தார். தேர்தல்கள் ஒத்திவைக்கப்படக்கூடிய சாத்தியங்கள் குறித்து கணிசமான ஊகங்கள் தெரிவிக்கப்பட்டே வந்திருக்கிறது.  உண்மையில் இது ஒரு வருடத்துக்கும் அதிகமான காலமாக அரசியல் கலந்துரையாடல்களின் ஒரு அங்கமாக இருந்துவருகிறது.

பொருளாதார மீட்சியின் பயன்கள் மறுதலையாவதை தடுத்து அவற்றை  வலுப்படுத்தவேண்டியது அவசியம் என்பதே பொருளாதார மீட்சி உறுதிப்படுத்தப்படும் வரை அரசியலை

முடக்கவேண்டும் என்ற வாதத்துக்கு கற்பிக்கப்படும் நியாயமாகும். பொருளாதார மீட்சியை உறுதிப்படுத்துவதற்கு தற்போதைய அரசாங்கமே உகந்தது என்பதும் அதன் இரு வருடகால செயற்பாடுகள் அதற்கு சான்று பகர்கின்றன என்பதுமே இந்த வாதத்தின் அடிப்படையாக இருக்கும் எண்ணமாகும்.

As has been usual in our country, at every monsoon season especially during the South-West monsoon flooding, landslides and displacement of citizens have become normal. Every year this newspaper has highlighted this fact and called on authorities to draw up plans to prevent these disasters.

To date, 16 people have died, 5 remain missing and 84,749 persons have been displaced. Sadly, nothing has changed. Have our engineers run out of ideas as to how such disasters could be prevented?

Media reports show 2017 was perhaps the worst year since torrential rains soaked the country in May 2003. The Disaster Management Center reported more than 150 deaths, over 1,800 damaged homes and almost half a million people becoming homeless. The worst-affected area was Bulathsinhala in the Kalutara District.

### Modi claims victory for his alliance in India’s general election

(AP) — Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed victory for his alliance on Tuesday in India’s general election, despite a lackluster performance from his own party as it faced a stronger than expected challenge from the opposition, which pushed back against his mixed economic record and polarizing politics.

Modi told a crowd at his party’s headquarters that his National Democratic Alliance will form the government for the third consecutive time, saying Indian voters had “shown immense faith” both in his party and the coalition alliance.

“Today’s victory is the victory of the world’s largest democracy” he said.

Still, for the first time since Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it appeared unlikely it would secure a majority on its own, and the prime minister would instead need the support of the other parties in his coalition for his third five-year term in the world’s largest democratic exercise.

Three decades ago, President Ranasinghe Premadasa was killed by a LTTE suicide bomber, while addressing the United National Party (UNP)’s May Day rally. This year as many as 19 rallies were held in Colombo. The presidential election poised to be held in Sept-October added interest to the rallies. Notable among them was the rally of the UNP addressed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The large number of people who turned up at the rally probably cheered Wickremesinghe, after the historic drubbing the UNP suffered in the last parliamentary poll.

### Defying  Doomsday Predictions of Exit polls  the Congress -led INDIA -Bloc of Opposition Parties  Shock  the Ruling  BJP in vital states, thereby resetting India’s political landscape.

*2024-06-04 18:09:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84140) · `en`

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost its national majority after suffering major losses in key states, marking a dramatic shift in a political landscape it has dominated for the past decade.

The BJP emerged, comfortably, as the country’s single-largest party in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s parliament. But with most votes counted after India’s six-week-long election on Tuesday, the BJP was well short of its performances from 2014 and 2019.

Unlike both those elections, when the BJP won clear majorities on its own in a house of 543 seats, it was poised to end up with 240 seats this time around. The halfway mark is 272 seats.

By contrast, the opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party, was projected to win more than 200 seats, significantly higher than exit polls had predicted. Released on June 1 after the final phase of India’s election cycle, the exit polls had suggested that the BJP would outdo its 2019 tally of 303 seats.

### Stunning   Election Results  Humble  India’s Strongman  Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is  Forced to Form Coaition Govt with Alliance Partners – “The Economist”

*2024-06-04 18:00:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84145) · `en`

Ahead of the general election that concluded on June 1st Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, was expected to romp home. His charisma, combined with an emphasis on infrastructure development, welfare payments to the poorest and a polarising Hindu nationalism, looked unbeatable. Mr Modi exuded a confidence that matched those predictions. He claimed that his Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp) and its allies would win upwards of 400 seats in the 543-seat parliament.

Early results from the vote count on June 4th appeared to put that target out of reach. After more than 50% of the votes had been counted, Mr Modi’s alliance still looked headed for victory, with the bjp and its allies ahead in 290 seats, compared with the opposition’s 235. Yet the bjp itself appeared to be on course to lose more than 60 seats compared with the last election in 2019, with results mid-afternoon putting its tally at 238, down from 303 in 2019.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a third term in power on June 4, but he will be dependent on allies as the BJP fell almost 32 short of the halfway mark of 272 seats in the Lok Sabha.

Its hopes of expanding in West Bengal were dashed. However, Odisha went according to the BJP’s script where it rose to power for the first time and posted wins in 19 out of 21 Lok Sabha seats.
