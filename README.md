Having watched recent TV performances by JVP leaders and NPP‚Äôs Dr. Harini Amarasuriya‚Äôs charming admission that though she reads Marx she is not a Marxist-Leninist nor is the leftist NPP, the SJB‚Äôs shadow finance minister Dr. Harsha de Silva experienced a ‚Äúgotcha moment‚Äù.

Tell me one country that does?‚Äù harsha de silva vcut (youtube.com)

The obvious answer is Ceylon/Sri Lanka and Dr. N.M. Perera, Minister of Finance, whose first visit to the IMF was in 1970. He was the Marxist leader of the country‚Äôs oldest and largest Marxist party. The IMF and World Bank engagement under his stewardship was critiqued by two widely-read books of the day, Cheryl Payer‚Äôs The Debt Trap and Teresa Hayter‚Äôs Aid as Imperialism.

### The Falcon and Falconer

No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable.

‚ÄúThe difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones.‚Äù

It is showdown time. I borrowed the caption from the ‚ÄòThe Second Coming‚Äô by W.B. Yeats. Things fall apart and the centre cannot hold. Passionate intensity dictates debate.

The next election, Presidential or Parliamentary will be a ‚Äòhead-to-head‚Äô encounter between the ‚Äòdominant‚Äô and the ‚Äòdominated.‚Äô

Despite polls and engineered parades, the dismantling of the hegemony of the dominant class is not a certainty. Since hope is not optimism, I would say that it is a near certainty.

The Bastille will be breached. If not totally, substantially. 2024 is the year when people of Sri Lanka will prove Heraclitus right. ‚ÄúNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it‚Äôs not the same river and he‚Äôs not the same man.‚Äù

### World Athletics introduces $50,000 prize money for Olympic gold medallists

Paris, April 10 (The Guardian) - Sebastian Coe has defended World Athletics‚Äô decision to break with 128 years of Olympic tradition by becoming the first sport to give athletes prize money if they are victorious in Paris this summer.

Coe said the surprise move, under which gold medal-winning athletes in each of the sport‚Äôs 48 events will walk away with $50,000 (¬£39,360), was merely a reflection that the world has changed and said it was time his sport gave more to its stars.

However the decision clearly blindsided the International Olympic Committee, which has never awarded money for participating or winning a medal, as it believes that to compete at a Games is reward enough.

Asked whether the announcement would violate the Olympic spirit, Coe was clear. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it does,‚Äù he replied.
