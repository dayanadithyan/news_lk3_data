### CEB to reduce electricity tariff rates by 18 percent?

Colombo, Feb 21 (Daily Mirror) - The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is planning to reduce electricity tariff rates by 18 percent soon, Daily Mirror learns.

Earlier, the CEB said the price reduction is possible mainly due to the increased percentage of hydropower in the energy mix of the country. Sri Lanka received sufficient rainfall recently increasing the power generation capacity of major plants.

It is now expected to submit proposals for tariff reduction to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka. The tariff rates were increased for the last time in October, last year.

The decision to raise tariffs came after the Ceylon Electricity Board requested the PUCSL to adjust electricity prices to offset the costs incurred during periods of arid weather conditions in the South Asian country.

Also, the CEB raised the tariff by 66 percent in February, and there was a reduction in the rates by 14 percent with effect from July.

*2024-02-21 05:01:37* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/False-interpretation-of-secularism-to-deny-freedom-of-religion-to-Buddhist-students-at-Royal-College/14-758702) · `en`

An old boy who has expressed opposition in an article in the Daily FT recently, to the chanting of pirith in a Buddhist religious ceremony at Royal College on grounds that it is ‘anti secular’, has given a false interpretation of secularism.

Moreover, he has made false allegations against the school authorities that:

1) The authorities were forcibly collecting funds from non-Buddhist children

2) The giving of Atapirikara to 100 monks is being done based by forcing parents of children to contribute

4) Placing of Buddha statues within the school environment increasingly is intimidating to non-Buddhist students

The author of the article admitted in another correspondence last year that he is a “devout Christian, and an Elder of the St. Andrews Scots Kirk Galle Face where he has also been the Treasurer”.

The Royal College Principal has responded to these wild allegations as follows:

During my visit to Australia recently I took a keen interest to engage with several young persons of Sri Lankan origin in different cities. They were among the second and third generation youth from Sri Lanka’s migrant community resident Down Under.

The idea of engaging with the youth came in the backdrop of “Sri Lanka Fest” – an expatriate cultural event that took place at the Federation Square in Melbourne on 25 November 2023.

A good many people of Sri Lankan origin and others were thronging the venue at the time I entered. There were several food stalls selling Sri Lankan varieties. A stall run by the Consulate of Sri Lanka in Melbourne exhibited some Sri Lankan items, but ‘Appe Kade’ appeared to be the attraction and the big earner (two plain hoppers, one egg hopper and lunu miris at AUD 20).

Main Opposition SJB Parliamentarian Eran Wickramaratne yesterday questioned the Speaker by raising a question under the standing orders, whether the Constitutional Assembly, which has been established as an independent institution, has approved the rules for approving Bills adhering to proper methods.

He also questioned whether the Secure Transactions Bill, which was taken for debate in Parliament, was referred to the Consultative Council (CC) of the concerned Ministry and received its approval.

In the recent past when Parliament hastily passed online security Act, there was no required oversight committee report for it. Therefore, this question is especially directed because when an act is passed, it should be done constitutionally and in accordance with standing orders, he said

The comments came in the wake of expressions of concern from the US Ambassador in Colombo and US Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy Elizabeth Allen regarding the potential impact of the proposed amendments on freedom of expression, innovation and privacy.

Agriculture made a massive contribution to the last economic crisis in Sri Lanka. President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that agriculture and tourism have been identified as two main sectors that can quickly rebuild the country.

The President said this while addressing the inauguration of the 37th session of the Asia and Pacific Regional Conference of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization in Colombo yesterday.

We are focusing on modern agricultural methods in recent times. It takes 10 - 15 years. However, our purpose is to achieve that goal in 10 years. For that, we will bring new agricultural systems into the country.

But we have another problem. Young people come to the cities from the villages. They do not engage in traditional farming. Modernization of agriculture can be retained again in the villages. Accordingly, the subjects of the Ministry of Agriculture, which were divided into three parts, were brought under a minister.

Iranian Foreign Minister Amir Abdullahian met top Sri Lankan government officials including President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, and his counterpart Ali Sabri on Tuesday (20).

Sri Lanka is unable to pay for Iran investment and imports due to the US sanctions, but it has successfully started paying for the dues in crude imports before 2012 through a “tea for oil” deal.

Iranian Foreign Minister comes after an official visit from Sri Lanka Foreign Minister Ali Sabri when he went to Tehran in August last year.

If you want to see the residual of feudalism alive and kicking in this country, look no further than the health sector. Deputy Director of the Colombo National Hospital, Rukshan Bellana became the unannointed spokesman of the condescendingly lowly status the doctors hold the support staff in the profession. This may not be the uniform stance where individual interactions are concerned. Still, it appears to be a de-facto official position if you are to survey the Government Medical Officers Association’s (GMOA) reaction towards nurses, midwives, paramedics and other support staff.

Negotiations for a FTA with Thailand have reached fruition, while discussions with India, Bangladesh and China are currently in progress. Additionally, trade negotiations with Indonesia and Malaysia are set to commence shortly. Sri Lanka has submitted a Letter of Intent to become a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

Since the changed economic policies in 1977 led to a partial dropping of protectionist policies, various interest groups from professionals to trade unionists have been up in arms against the idea of FTAs in general and with India in particular.

### US again casts veto of UN action in Israel-Hamas war

*2024-02-20 22:08:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97419/us-again-casts-veto-of-un-action-in-israel-hamas-war) · `en`

The United States on Tuesday again vetoed a draft United Nations Security Council resolution on the Israel-Hamas war, blocking a demand for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire as it instead pushes the 15-member body to call for a temporary ceasefire linked to the release of hostages held by Hamas.

Thirteen council members voted in favor of the Algerian-drafted text, while Britain abstained. It was the third such U.S. veto since the start of the current fighting on Oct. 7.

“A vote in favor of this draft resolution is support to the Palestinians right to life. Conversely, voting against it implies an endorsement of the brutal violence and collective punishment inflicted upon them,” Algeria’s U.N. Ambassador Amar Bendjama told the council before the vote.

### Voice of Migrants condemns Israel’s policy against Palestinian migrant workers

*2024-02-20 21:14:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Voice-of-Migrants-condemns-Israels-policy-against-Palestinian-migrant-workers/108-277424) · `en`

Colombo, Feb 20 (Daily Mirror) - The recent decision by Israeli authorities to terminate the employment of 72,000 Palestinian migrant workers has sparked widespread condemnation and calls for justice from international organizations and human rights advocates.

Israeli officials cited security concerns as the basis for the mass dismissal, which targeted workers primarily employed in construction projects across the country.

However, critics argue that the move represents a blatant act of discrimination and a violation of labour rights.

Organizations such as the Voice of Migrants Network have issued strong statements denouncing Israel's actions, emphasizing the need for fair treatment and equality for all workers, regardless of their nationality.

The Voice of Migrants said that Israel has opened job opportunities for migrant workers from other countries, including Sri Lanka, in a situation where many countries hesitate to send their workers due to Israel's actions being considered unethical.

### Chamari Athapaththu eyes big team goal in 2024

Feb. 20 (ICC) - Sri Lankan superstar Chamari Athapaththu has set her eyes on the big prize at the ICC Women's T20 World Cup later this year.

The Sri Lankan skipper recounted her incredible year in 2023, culminating in the big ICC award, and stated that going unsold at the Women's Premier League [WPL] auction was a big motivating factor behind it.

"Internationally it was the best year I have had in my career," Athapathuthu told Cricbuzz.

"Not just as a batter, but as a captain, and even as a team, we performed really well in 2023. Thanks to those performances, I was nominated for the ICC Player of the Year, T20 Player of the Year, and I won the ODI Player of the Year award.

### ILT20 slaps one-year ban on Noor Ahmad

*2024-02-20 20:20:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/ILT20-slaps-one-year-ban-on-Noor-Ahmad/108-277418) · `en`

Feb. 20 (cricbuzz) - Afghanistan leg-spinner Noor Ahmad has been banned for 12 months by ILT20's disciplinary committee for breach of contract with his franchise Sharjah Warriors. Noor becomes the second player after fellow countryman Naveen-ul-Haq to be banned by the ILT20 for the same reason.

The 19-year-old, who was retained by the Warriors, opted against signing the retention notice and instead to ply his trade in the SA20 tournament where he represented Durban Supergiants. Noor's refusal to sign the player agreement contract forced the Warriors to approach the ILT20 for further action on the matter. The disciplinary committee held separate hearings for the player and the franchise before coming to a final decision.

Initially Noor was meted out a 20-month ban, like Naveen-ul-Haq, but given that the former was a minor ahead of the first ILT20 season, the punishment was trimmed down to 12 months.
