*2024-07-21 22:02:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100677/israel-shoots-down-missile-fired-from-yemen-after-striking-houthis) ¬∑ `en`

Israel said it shot down a missile launched from Yemen on Sunday and the Yemeni Houthi movement said it had fired several missiles at the Israeli city of Eilat after Israel‚Äôs first public strike against the Iran-aligned group a day earlier.

The Houthis have launched missiles and drones at Israel and disrupted global trade through the Red Sea in response to Israel‚Äôs assault on Gaza, further destabilising the Middle East as war in the Palestinian enclave rages on after nine months.

Israel says the Houthis have launched 200 attacks against it since the Gaza war began, many of them intercepted and most of them not deadly.

But a rare Houthi drone strike on Friday hit Tel Aviv and killed one person, prompting Israel to announce its first strikes against the group on Saturday. The strikes by warplanes hit near the Yemeni port of Hodeidah and killed six people, local medics said.

The Houthi movement, known formally as Ansar Allah, said on Sunday it would continue to attack Israel in response.

### Russia is the fourth economic force in the world

*2024-07-21 18:29:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189023) ¬∑ `ta`

In early June, the World Bank ranked Russia as the fourth-largest economy globally based on PPP, surpassing Germany due to cheaper gas and political instability. Russia's economic growth, initially lagging, surged post-Ukraine invasion, aiming for global dominance. Despite challenges, including sanctions and a shift towards militarization, Russia's economy boomed, with the World Bank tripling its growth forecast to 3.2%. However, Russia still trails India and China in size, with the shadow economy potentially underestimating its true GDP.

üü©

According to the World Bank's data, published in early June, the Russian economy has become the fourth developed country in the world based on Purchase- Power and Balance (PPP).

According to PNE report last August, Russia has already behind Germany to become the fifth largest economy. The cheapest Russian gas was cut off, and German has now been stagnant and suffered from recent political events and fell to sixth place in the World Bank rankings.

Purchase-Power-Balance (PPP) and Gross National Production Measurement is preferred by many economists. This is because it takes into account the difference between local prices and nominal prices.

The World Bank has upgraded Russia's ranking after reviewing its data. And Russia says that Japan has actually overtaken Japan in 2021 and has since retained the fourth place since.

Its earlier calculations were based on 2017 data, but these are now updated to reflect 2021 statistics.

Conspiracy theories often arise when official explanations lack clarity, especially regarding incidents like shootings. They suggest a "shadow government" operates outside democratic norms, using power secretly. This concept isn't new in U.S. history; it's been linked to events such as presidential assassinations. These theories serve as political tools, highlighting the potential misuse of conspiracy narratives.

The shadow government is seen as contrary to democracy because of the exercise of power beyond the selected government. As far as the United States is concerned, the assassination of the president and the unleashing of assassinations on them is not new.

The lesson we can learn from American history is that conspiracy can be used as political weapons.

‚ÄúThe postponement of the presidential election is beneficial to the whole country. Especially for the Tamils.

As for this presidential election, no candidate can get more than 50 percent of the votes. So they will try to get the votes of the minority people.

At the same time, when no one gets more than 50 percent of the votes in the presidential election, the political stability in the country will be left.

There are already economic crises in the country. If there is no political stability, the country will face the worst economic setbacks.
