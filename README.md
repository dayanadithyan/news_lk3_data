Mar. 22 (BBC) - Former Brazil international football player Robinho has been arrested to serve a nine-year prison sentence for rape.

He was convicted two years ago in Italy for his part in the gang rape of an Albanian woman at a night club in Milan in 2013.

Robinho, 40, was arrested at his flat in his home city of Santos.

The Italian government had requested that he serve his sentence in Brazil after failing to get him extradited.

On Wednesday, a court in Brazil upheld the decision and also ruled that he should serve his time behind bars instead of under house arrest.

Earlier on Thursday, a Supreme Court judge rejected a request to halt his detention.

The decisive action taken by Brazil's justice system has been praised by many on local media, who feared that Robinho would evade justice thanks to his fame and his wealth.

The police refused permission even when the court had allowed the Hindus to observe Shivaratri at the Adilingeswarar Temple at the Attukkunnarimalai.

If the rituals are damaged, the police must have seen the damage to them without being damaged if they are damaged.. As well as the Shiva Temple. So the Hindus will not damage their temple.

The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council on Friday to back a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an Israel-Hamas hostage deal, increasing pressure on its ally Israel to allow more humanitarian aid and better protect civilians.

The resolution marks a further toughening of Washington’s stance toward Israel. Earlier in the five-month-long war, the U.S. was averse to the word ceasefire and vetoed measures that included calls for an immediate ceasefire.

The draft resolution, seen by Reuters, says an “immediate and sustained ceasefire” lasting roughly six weeks would protect civilians and allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance.

The enormous independence given to the CBSL in the determination of salaries of its employees has been the bane for this unethical and anomalous situation

The famous dictum made by John Acton, a British jurist (1887) that absolute corruption corrupts absolutely comes to my mind when I read the unilateral decision taken by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in granting an obnoxious salary revision (70%) to its employees across the board, behind the cover of the unfettered autonomy and independent status given to the CBSL by Act No. 16 of 2023. One could argue whether the CBSL’s sense of morality has lessened to such a low ebb with the discretionary powers it has secured with the new Act at a time when the CBSL itself had declared the country as a bankrupt state in terms of economic and financial terms.

### Meeting in Court; COPE; poem read at Oscar Awards 76

*2024-03-22 05:54:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/meeting-in-court-cope-poem-read-at-oscar-awards-76/) · `en`

One of two headlines in The Island of Monday March 18 was “Let’s meet in court, JVP tells Rohitha.” The proposer JVP will be represented by former COPE Chairman Sunil Handunetti and Vijitha Herath and of course Rohitha is Abeygunawardena, always in the news. The challenge is consequent to the newly appointed Chairman/COPE threatening to bring legal action against Vijitha Herath who, Rohitha accuses, made a defamatory statement against him. Handunetti states: “We accept the challenge and dare Abeygunawardena to go before the courts. We will get an opportunity to prove all allegations against him.”

Will Rohitha A institute legal action against these two stalwarts of the JVP? Cassandra places a sure bet: he won’t. Our politicians usually threaten to go to courts but definitely fight shy of doing so. If they are as white as their kapati suits, they need not fear appearing in any court or public forum. But many have skeletons rattling in their cupboards. And they rattle loud and clear.

### Economic recovery must become more broad-based

*2024-03-22 05:49:13* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Economic-recovery-must-become-more-broad-based/4-759809) · `en`

President Wickremesinghe with China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) Chairman Wang Tongzhou. CCCC through CHEC Port City Colombo, has invested $ 1.4 billion on Port City Colombo and committed a further $ 300 million. FDI and exports are key to Sri Lanka’s economic recovery

Sri Lanka is now clearly emerging from an unprecedented economic crisis that imposed significant hardships on its people, especially the most vulnerable. There are now some clear signs of recovery. The IMF has projected that the economy will expand in 2024 and that growth will accelerate. Tight borrowing conditions and reduced disposable income still holds back domestic consumption whilst the reform momentum is hurting the poor in some ways.

### Elections and the economy

*2024-03-22 05:42:24* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Elections-and-the-economy/4-759808) · `en`

The next election if it were to be dominated by economic issues would be a contest between NPP’s system change with a market model cleansed of its rigidities and the IMF path embraced by its opponents – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Election fever is gripping Sri Lanka. It appears that a General Election could precede the Presidential Election mainly because of Ranil Wickremesinghe’s (RW) rising unpopularity largely due to his IMF led economic recovery path.

IMF for its part has no choice but to slow down its program after completing its second review, because election fever demands more time and energy from parliamentarians outside the legislature than inside, and consequently it would not be possible for the Parliament to pass the necessary reforms required for the recovery. Economy therefore is destined to take the back seat and allow politics to dominate national attention for the rest of the year.

### 'People's Faith in Parliament' Breaded ': What happens if you go?

*2024-03-22 05:36:41* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/cy0zjp9pjjno) · `si`

"People's faith in Sri Lanka's Parliament is eroding, with criticisms ranging from wasteful spending to political instability. A survey shows the current government's approval rating has dropped to 7%, down from 9% last October. Parliament, a pillar of democracy, is crucial for maintaining public trust. Efforts to restore this trust include dissolving Parliament and holding a general election, focusing on electing representatives who prioritize the people's interests, and improving parliamentary debates to be more productive and less divisive."

'People's Faith in Parliament' Breaded ': What happens if you go?

The people's confidence in the functioning of the Parliament of Sri Lanka can be seen from a stake.

For many years, many have been viewed, "parliament is a white elephant," and the opinions "do not be eliminated."

These ideas show how the faithy is collapsed on the functioning of parliament among the people of Sri Lanka.

In the meantime, some allege that it is a waste of Rs. 4 million for one day of Parliament.

The new two new events that have a breakdown on parliament are the crisis that the COPE is the crisis on the COPE.

Dilan Perera and Wimal Weerawansa addressed Parliament Thursday (March 21) that the no-confidence motion against the Speaker was defeated by the people.

In 2019, Ranil Wickremesinghe was removed from the post of Prime Minister, obstructing the parliamentary assault in Parliament, had fallen into the public confidence in Parliament.
