ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì In India‚Äôs East Gujarat, more than fifty thousand Indigenous families are no longer considered encroachers but legal landowners with the right to better their standard of living using the resources of the forests.

The road to that change has neither been easy, nor short, but decades of non-violent pushback with the guidance and support of Trupti and Ambrish Mehta, Co-Founders of Action Research in Community Health (ARCH) Vahini. The organisation, along with several other entities campaigned tirelessly for legislation that would provide marginalised communities the security of tenure on the lands they had lived on, cultivated and utilised as resources for decades.  As Trupti Mehta explains the main obstacles to securing these rights have been the bureaucracy and lack of awareness amongst the indigenous communities.

(Bridgetown) - Australia crushed England by 36 runs in Barbados on Saturday to leave the defending champions' T20 World Cup hopes in the balance.

Defeat means Jos Buttler's men are still winless after their opening game against Scotland was wrecked by rain.

But Australia, who posted 201-7, are top of Group B with two wins after restricting their fierce rivals to 165-6 in their 20 overs.

Australia's openers raced out of the blocks and the team posted the first score of 200-plus at the tournament even though no batsman reached 40.

Phil Salt and Buttler gave England a solid platform in their reply, reaching 54-0 after six overs before going up a gear, taking 19 off Mitchell Starc's third over.

But spinner Adam Zampa bowled Salt (37) with his first ball to leave England 73-1 in the eighth over and took the prized wicket of Buttler in his next over for 42.

Lakdasa (Lucky) Kodituwakku was the Inspector-General at the time the Waymaba Provincial Council elections took place early in 1999. He was blamed for the violence and the malpractices that took place during those elections. The 17th Amendment to the Constitution was the result of a political initiative launched by MPs in the Opposition led by the UNP in 2001 as a response to the Wayamba election incidents.

This was the second betrayal by a Head of State/Government. President¬†Chandrika Kumaratunga decided to appoint Lucky Kodituwakku the 26th IGP ignoring so many seniors over him just because of the special position he enjoyed as the Personal Security officer (PSO) of a VVIP that gave him an advantage over his seniors to canvass for the post. The Wayamba election bungling and the 17th Amendment to the Constitution was the result.

A desire to visit Burma (Myanmar since 1989) having seen the film ‚ÄòThe Story of Dr. Wossell‚Äô as a school boy was fulfilled recently. The film was about a dedicated British Army Medical Officer who during World War II fell in love with the country and more deeply with a lithesome and compassionate Buddhist Burmese lady and chose to remain with her in her country after demobilization.

Several books, fiction and non-fiction of the country read over the years made the desire greater. However, Burma‚Äôs isolation from the rest of the world since 1962 when the military junta known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) seized power, rumours of political unrest, and later the house arrest of the Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of the National League for Democracy, Aung San Sun Kyi made one think twice about making the journey. However, recently people spoke of trickles of tourists flowing into the country and we, a party of five, including my sister followed suit.

### The non-debate and two questions from Sajith and AKD

SJB and Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa faced two significant setbacks last week, the repercussions of which are expected to unfold in the coming days. The most notable was the backlash on social media following his failure to attend the highly anticipated debate with JVP/NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. After weeks of boasting and challenges, the debate was scheduled for Thursday at the ITN studio. While the JVP leader arrived promptly, Premadasa was conspicuously absent.

This triggered a wave of negative feedback and disappointment, not only among SJB members but also among many who had eagerly awaited the debate for weeks. The ramifications of this absence and the resulting damage will become clear in the days ahead.

### Tissa and Sonia Weeratunga

*2024-06-09 00:25:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/tissa-and-sonia-weeratunga/) ¬∑ `en`

I will be turning 59 in a few days. Strangely or maybe not so strangely as I grow older I think more often of my late parents, how they were when they were my age, what they did and this makes me reflect on what I do now.

My father, Tissa Indraka Weeratunga, the first four-star general of the regular forces of the Sri Lanka Army, was promoted on his 55th birthday, August 29, 1985. He was the first ever Chief of Defence Staff and the ninth Army Commander in independent Sri Lanka. This is not the place to roll out his extensive curriculum vitae. To me, he was the person who understood me most, cheered me on when I excelled in sports, never missing a single rugger match when I played for Royal and CR&FC, and encouraged me to show similar commitment to my studies.

### Thaththa‚Äôs Wireless

*2024-06-09 00:24:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/thaththas-wireless/) ¬∑ `en`

Thaththa(my late father) was an avid radio listener. He called the radio a ‚Äòwireless.‚Äô Early in the morning, he listened to the news and, after dinner, to Sinhala and English songs. He allowed no one to talk aloud while he listened to the radio. Listening to the news and music was a struggle because of poor reception. He said the poor reception was because of the remoteness of Hambantota, where we lived. His friends advised him to buy a ‚Äòsix-valve‚Äô Grundig radio for better reception. They coaxed him, saying he could, of course, as the Principal of St. Mary‚Äôs College, afford to buy a powerful radio. But Thaththa refused to discard his old Philips radio. Its front screen looked like an old rag, and the pilot light on the upper left corner was dead.

NATO allies honor 80th anniversary of D-Day invasion of Normandy

Former President of the United States of America, Donald Trump was found guilty on 34 counts of felony in the recently concluded hush money case in the district court of Manhattan, New York. Trump has gone down in history as the only convicted felon who has served as the President of the United States. He is currently on bail on his own recognizance, until the date of sentencing, July 11, 2024.

Trump‚Äôs only chance of avoiding imprisonment is to win re-election in November. As president, the pending cases against him, indeed all punishments currently imposed on him, will be dismissed. If not, he will probably be jailed for life. He is literally fighting for his life. And losing.

(New York) - South Africa overcame a stunning early batting collapse before sealing a four-wicket victory over bogey team the Netherlands in their T20 World Cup Group D clash in New York on Saturday.

David Miller's unbeaten 59 off 51 balls saw the Proteas safely home at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, the South Africans finishing on 106-6 after restricting the Dutch to 103-9 from their 20 overs.

For a moment however it looked as if the Dutch were poised to inflict another famous upset on the South Africans following wins at the 2022 T20 World Cup and 2023 ODI World Cup.

The Proteas were left reeling at 12-4 after 4.3 overs and had even been 3-3 at one stage as the Dutch bowling attack broke through early.

But Tristan Stubbs and Miller hauled South Africa off the ropes with a fifth wicket partnership of 65 to leave the Proteas in a winning position.
