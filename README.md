### Sri Lanka to breach inflation target till 2025 first quarter: Central Bank

*2024-08-16 07:31:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-breach-inflation-target-till-2025-first-quarter-central-bank-176979/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s inflation is expected to be below 3 percent up to the first quarter of 2025 the central bank said, after maintaining inflation around the same levels in the past several months, breaching the lower level of a 5 percent inflation target.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has proposed a 5 percent inflation target, plus or minus two percent to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has apparently accepted it without question.

The agency now projects inflation, giving baseline forecasts and probable projected inflation.

“Given that the quarterly average inflation recorded during Q2-2024 was also below the target by more than 2 percentage points, the projections imply a possible breach of the inflation target, as stipulated in Section 26(5) of the CBA, on the downside in Q3-2024 for the first time, as inflation would have been below the target by more than 2 percentage points during two consecutive quarters,” the central bank said.

Almost 20 years ago, I received a call from Don Harold Stassen Jayawardena. Of course, at the time I knew him as ‘Harry Jayawardena’ as did many SriLankans, especially in business circles. I was in England, veritably forced into exile by political circumstances which included the abduction and torture of the deputy editor of ‘The Nation,’ a newspaper published by Rivira Media Corporation, of which I was at the time the Managing Director, and a brutal attack on Upali Tennakoon, the editor of our sister newspaper in Sinhala. These attacks came just after my friend Lasantha Wickrematunge implored me to leave the countryand not too long before he himself was killed.

It was a time not just of exile but abandonment; for reasons of convenience or fear almost all those I considered friends avoided me. There were a handful who didn’t give a damn about possible consequences or cared enough to be supportive. I didn’t count Harry among them.

### Elections, regime shift, and transformation of the State

The resulting battles will thus to a large degree continue to determine the ultimate significance of any regime that emerges in the immediate aftermath of the election – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Elections offer an opportunity to measure the re-composition of social forces. New coalitions are tested, new alliances become possible, and ultimately there is a period of policy convergence. Under ideal circumstances, this process results in the consolidation of a new regime capable of governing over the long run. In a parliamentary democratic system, such a hegemonic bloc can accommodate the rotation of parties in and out of power. The clearest examples in Sri Lanka’s post-independence history, of course, are the ‘intermediate regime’ from 1956 to 1977 and the neoliberal ‘open economy’ that has characterised policy making from 1977 up to the present.
