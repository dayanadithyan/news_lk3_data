### Controversial new French immigration law promulgated by President Macron

The administration of French President Emmanuel Macron published the formal text of a new immigration law in its Official Journal on Saturday, with the first instructions on applying the legislation already presented to officials.

The law’s promulgation comes after France’s Constitutional Council censured 35 of its 86 articles, including contentious additions insisted on by the right, such as measures restricting access to social benefits and the introduction of immigration quotas.

While the bill was seen as one of the signature reforms of Macron’s second term, some in his camp had baulked at the stricter version, with about a quarter of his allies in parliament voting against it or abstaining.

The final text upheld by the council retains key elements initially desired by the government, with a large part of it dedicated to simplifying procedures for expelling delinquent foreigners -- one of the objectives of Interior Minister Gerard Darmanin.

COLOMBO (News 1st);  Sri Lanka's rehabilitation initiative faces a new obstacle, as authorities discover drug traffickers and criminals mingling among those referred for addiction treatment.

Retired Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi who is the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation confirmed that stricter procedures will be implemented to filter individuals entering rehabilitation programs.

Following the "Yukthiya Operation" that commenced in December 2023, over 300 individuals were sent for rehabilitation.

However, intelligence revealed the presence of non-addicts, including drug traffickers and criminals, within the group.

In response, Hettiarachchi announced a shift in strategy noting that moving forward not every person referred by the courts or police will be automatically admitted to rehabilitation.

He said that officials will prioritize those with genuine addiction problems.

This development comes amidst heightened tensions at the Kankakadu Treatment Rehabilitation Center.

BBC - A New York jury has decided Donald Trump should pay $83.3m (£65m) for defaming columnist E Jean Carroll in 2019 while he was US president.

Mr Trump was previously found to have defamed Ms Carroll and to have sexually assaulted her in the 1990s.

The jury's penalty in the civil trial is made up of $18.3m for compensatory damages and $65m in punitive damages.

Mr Trump vowed to appeal, calling the case a witch hunt and the verdict "Absolutely ridiculous!"

The compensatory damages are meant to account for the harm his comments did to her reputation and emotional wellbeing.

The panel also had to come up with a punitive penalty intended to stop Mr Trump from continuing to speak out against her.

It took the jury of seven men and two women less than three hours to reach a verdict on Friday afternoon.

"This is a great victory for every woman who stands up when she's been knocked down, and a huge defeat for every bully who has tried to keep a woman down," Ms Carroll said in a statement.

Sydney, Jan 27 (CNN) — “Australia Day is Dead!” Indigenous activist Gwenda Stanley chants into the loudspeaker, as a crowd of thousands breaks into applause.

It’s Australia’s national day, but the crowd in central Sydney seethes in anger and cheers in solidarity with Indigenous Australians, many of whom view January 26 as nothing but the anniversary of their colonial dispossession, 236 years ago this Friday.

“Australia is stolen land and we need to be united and firm in our resistance and sustain that resistance until justice is achieved under our terms,” protest organizer Lynda-June Coe, a Wiradjuri woman, told CNN.

The Sydney crowd is diverse, and it’s replicated in Australian cities nationwide.

Each year an increasing number of non-Indigenous Australians find it impossible to celebrate Australia Day, in the knowledge that many of their Indigenous fellow citizens treat it as a day of mourning.

The latest estimates from IHP’s revised SLOTS MRP model (revised 01/2024) show that the NPP/JVP maintains a lead in General Election voting intent with 39% of Sri Lankan adults in December 2023.

This was significantly ahead of the SJB on 27%, the SLPP on 10%, the UNP on 6%, and ITAK and SLMC on 3% each. The December estimates are provisional and are associated with a margin of error of 2.0–3.5% for the four leading parties.

The revised IHP SLOTS model estimates reveal more clearly that the current NPP/JVP lead is based on a continuous rise in support since early 2022. The SJB has also increased its support, but a slower pace, lying in second place since mid-2022. The December 2023 estimates also confirm a decline in support for the UNP since July 2023, with SLPP support holding steady.

### The Attack on ITAK  Jaffna MP,  Shritharan in  Anuradhapura

*2024-01-27 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-Attack-on-ITAK-Jaffna-MP-Shritharan-in-Anuradhapura/172-275815) · `en`

A noteworthy incident was the attack launched on the vehicle he was travelling in by “unknown” gunmen more than 23 years ago. In the news story appearing in the “Uthayan”, Shritharan was quoted that the attack was a planned attempt to kill him and that his Tamil political opponents who were aligned with the government for concessions and ministerial posts were responsible.

Shritharan has been projecting himself as a supporter and fellow traveller of the LTTE from the time he entered Parliament. This has earned him bouquets from pro-Tiger elements and brickbats from anti-Tiger elements. While the pro-LTTE label has helped him in politics, it has at times placed him in jeopardy too

### Can The New ITAK Leader Help Bring About Reconciliation?

*2024-01-27 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Can-The-New-ITAK-Leader-Help-Bring-About-Reconciliation/172-275802) · `en`

With the end of the war in 2009, the ITAK again gained its clout as the main Tamil party in the country as well as within the TNA. Despite other Tamil parties in the north having grown as a threat to its hegemony in the north and the Tamil politics, the ITAK is still a force to be reckoned with

Many in the south seem to confuse the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) with the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), the group that can be considered to be the main Tamil political party in the country, especially in the north. This confusion was evident by the news items carried by some of the south based newspapers on the election of the Leader of the ITAK last Sunday (January 21).

Some Sinhala newspapers said that Sivagnanam Sritharan was elected as the Leader of the TNA, while the others rightly described him to be the new President (Leader) of the ITAK.

Election fever is in the air. Whether it be in the south with over 70 percent of the population or the Northern Province (which is home to the largest minority), elections are a hot topic. In the south, three political parties - namely the National People’s Power (an alliance of individuals and organisation centred around the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna - JVP), the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the United National Party (UNP) have named their candidates for the upcoming Presidential election.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake popularly known as ‘AKD’ is the nominee of the NPP/JVP combine. The SJB nominee is Sajith Premadasa, and President Ranil Wickremasinghe is the nominee of the UNP

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) have not put forward candidates of their own, and are expected to support either the UNP or SJB candidate.

Startups, entrepreneurs, and SMEs can play a crucial role as pioneers for a just transition towards a more sustainable, climate-friendly, and resilient economy

The climate crisis presents a critical challenge for countries across the world. In particular, climate-vulnerable developing countries such as Sri Lanka are facing severe climate impacts as well as losses and damages, affecting all economic sectors and constraining fiscal space, development efforts, and climate action.

Against this backdrop, there is a clear need for economic transformation and transition. On the one hand, existing livelihoods and business models need to adapt to climatic changes and become more resilient to shocks; on the other hand, there are also opportunities to invest in more sustainable and climate-friendly products, practices, and services across key sectors and at all levels.

### Sri Lanka scales up preventive healthcare with impressive results

The Kopay Divisional Hospital in the Jaffna District in northern Sri Lanka is one of the primary medical care institutions in the country – Photo: World Bank/Chameera Laknath

A recent visit to Sri Lanka took me to the Kopay Divisional Hospital in the Jaffna District in the northern part of the country. For the close to 16,000 people living in the area, this hospital serves as the first point of care. It is also one of the primary medical care institutions that is part of Sri Lanka’s primary healthcare reorganisation strategy, implemented with support from the World Bank.

What impressed me the most about the hospital is its investment in preventive care and the shift in approach from episodic to continued care, which has been successfully introduced over the last few years. Now, patients are routinely screened for noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, and connected to appropriate treatments.
