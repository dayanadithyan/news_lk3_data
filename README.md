“March Madness” is an annual ritual in the USA, the climax of the National College Basketball tournament that keeps Americans glued to their TVs for weeks.

### It is up to India to settle the issue of poaching in Sri Lankan waters

*2024-04-07 03:18:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/it-is-up-to-india-to-settle-the-issue-of-poaching-in-sri-lankan-waters/) · `en`

Kachchativu island when I visited it in 1974 was an uninhabited and desolate place occasionally visited by fishermen to dry their nets. A small Catholic shrine stood there for protection of fishers from storms and the sea.

The Lankan newspaper in late 1960s published a photograph of what was described as a group of pilgrims from India visiting the island. Serious fishing started when Indian fishermen depleted stocks on their side of the boundary and switched to more lucrative poaching of prawns, trawling on the Sri Lankan side on the muddy bottom of the basin South of Kachchativu.

When arrested by the SLN, Indian authorities exerted undue diplomatic and political pressure for the release of poachers and boats which are owned by influential people on Indian side. The Sri Lanka Navy effectively reduced poaching to zero but Indian political counter pressure even saw the overnight removal of the SLN commander then responsible for countering illegal fishing.

However, it was officially recognized after it was observed by the French astronomer Jean-Louis Pons in the 19th century and rediscovered by British American astronomer William Brooks in 1883.

The massive comet is also known as the “devil comet” due to its formation of two “horns” made up of ice and gas and periodic explosions.

According to NASA, the 18.6-mile-wide ‘Devil’s Comet’ is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun and shine the brightest on the 21st of April.

### Jetwing takes off and then July 1983 hits

*2024-04-06 20:18:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/jetwing-takes-off-and-then-july-1983-hits/) · `en`

(Excerpted from The Jetwing Story on the Life of Herbert Cooray by Shiromal Cooray)

Though conscientious about records, accounts and compliance with regulations, Herbert Cooray was never a number- cruncher. His decision-making did not involve the detailed scrutiny of feasibility studies, balance sheets and financial analyses. Like most entrepreneurs of his generation, he navigated by intuition. He would consider a proposition, talk the matter over with those who could inform or advise him, and then make his decision. He never rushed into things – nor, on the other hand, did he waste time when it was of the essence. His instincts rarely let him down.

### Karuna”s Rebel Tigers   May Have Lost the Eastern Battle but Ultimately the Prabhakaran-led LTTE Lost the Eelam War.

*2024-04-06 18:18:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83881) · `en`

The once powerful Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) waged war against the Sri Lankan state for over thirty years. The LTTE known popularly as the tigers was the determining force in Sri Lankan politics for nearly two decades. The  decline of the LTTE began in 2004 when its Batticaloa and Amparai district  special commander Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan  alias “Col”Karuna led an eastern tiger revolt against the LTTE supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran. Although “Col” Karuna –  also  known as “Karuna  Ammaan”  – was defeated militarily by the LTTE, subsequent events demonstrated that the Eastern split weakened the LTTE considerably and ultimately led to its downfall in 2009.

### What Is NPP Presidential Candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s Position on Thorny Issues like “!3 Plus”, “Federal Solution” and Militarisation of the State?

*2024-04-06 18:09:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83888) · `en`

National People’s Power (NPP) presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s pronouncement in Jaffna earlier this week that he did not come to bargain for votes by assuring that he would give ’13 plus’ or a ‘federal solution’ begs the crucial question as to what exactly is the NPP’s public position in regard to these and other thorny issues including the militarisation of the Sri Lankan State?

To be clear, these core dysfunctions have monstrously perverted constitutional democracy in this country, reducing the Sinhala majority as well as Tamil and Muslim minorities to pathetic ‘nothing-beings’ in their own land. As we may recall, an ‘ethnic war’ and the emergence of a ‘Sinhala Buddhist saviour’ became weapons of choice for majoritarian demagogues, most particularly the Rajapaksas, to inflict cruel injustices on Sri Lankans, including their slavishly supplicating loyalists from the South.
