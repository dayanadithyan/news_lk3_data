### Bangladesh partially restores telecommunication services as protests taper off

*2024-07-24 12:07:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100743/bangladesh-partially-restores-telecommunication-services-as-protests-taper-off) ┬╖ `en`

Bangladesh partially restored telecommunication services on Wednesday although Internet connection was slow and social media remained suspended, days after deadly protests against reservations for government jobs killed almost 150 people.

The country has mostly been calm since Sunday when the Supreme Court scaled down reservations for various categories to 7 percent, overruling a high court verdict reinstating a 56 percent quota in government jobs that had been scrapped in 2018.

Prime Minister Sheikh HasinaтАЩs government said on Tuesday that it would heed the Supreme Court ruling.

As demonstrations against the quotas ┬аwhich included a 30 percent reservation for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan ┬аtapered off, the government started easing the curfew imposed last week.

Restrictions will be relaxed for seven hours on Wednesday and offices will also be open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., officials said.

### Minister sounds warning to egg producers over prices

Minister of Trade Nalin Fernando has stated that it is possible to reduce the retail price of an egg to Rs. 40.

He warned that if egg producers fail to reduce prices for the festive season, the government will once again resort to importing eggs from India.

The minister further stated that the egg prices have suddenly dropped by Rs. 6 and that he will thoroughly look into this by obtaining reports from the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA).

He expressed concerns stating that if an egg cannot be sold for at least Rs. 40, they would have to import eggs from India. He pointed out that during the festival season in December, cake manufacturers will also be purchasing a large quantity of eggs.

Therefore, he emphasized that if the egg prices are not reduced by then, the government will have to import eggs or ensure customer protection by providing eggs at the correct price.
