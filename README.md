тАЬTowards the end of this month, officially, we are done and dusted with the restructuring process, then of course, in line with that, we need to start payment,тАЭ he said.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka will need an extra 275 billion rupees to give 20,000 rupee salary hike to state workers, requiring value added tax to be raised by 4 percent, State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe said.

To generate money for a 20,000 rupee salary hike, value added tax on the people will have to be raised from the current 18 percent to 20 percent, he said.

Meanwhile import duties will also have to be raised by around 42 percent.

Sri Lanka has already given a 10,000 rupee salary hike to state workers from taxes collected from the people.

Sri LankaтАЩs debt sustainability path set in an International Monetary Fund program will also be undermined, he said.

Sri LankaтАЩs current default was also linked to forex shortages that emerged when rates were cut with printed money claiming inflation was low (flexible inflation targeting), as deficits expanded in part due to 20,000 rupee salary hike in 2015, analysts have said.

In 2024, Sri Lanka will be negotiating a challenging economic environment that includes persistent budgetary issues, efforts to stabilise macroeconomic circumstances, and the post-pandemic recovery. Remittances from foreign workers, advances in the tourism industry, and increased agricultural output have all contributed to the nationтАЩs GDP growth.

Madam BlavatskyтАЩs name is not strange for Sri Lankans as one of the early stalwarts to aspire to the Buddhist resurgence in the late 19th century. In the backdrop of British-sponsored Missionary activities, her audacity to stand with the natives in a British colony illustrates her compassion for the Easterners who suffered under foreign subjugation. After the tragic end of the 1883 Kotahena riots, Blavatsky defended the Buddhists, when the colonial government tried to frame them to be the culprits. In an article she authored for тАЬThe TheosophistтАЬ, Blavatsky argued that the arrogant attitude of the Christian priests and their condescending remarks over Buddhism sparked the riots in 1883 and the following year she accompanied Col.

### Appreciation For Lionel Fernando

*2024-07-08 17:10:33* ┬╖ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/appreciation-for-lionel-fernando/) ┬╖ `en`

Lionel Fernando was more than a public servant; he was a beacon of humanity and national integration in Sri Lanka. As a top official who held numerous positions in public service, local government, and diplomacy, his career was a testament to his dedication to his country and its people. My admiration for Lionel began long before our personal encounters, rooted in his transformative tenure as the first Sinhala Government Agent in Jaffna during the 1970s. His service-oriented approach endeared him to the Tamil communities, illustrating his commitment to bridging ethnic divides and fostering unity.
