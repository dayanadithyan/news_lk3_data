### Limiting Factor Analysis crucial in decision making amidst resource constraints

Policymakers must determine the level of full capacity national output in understanding the state of the economy and in

The Sunday Times of 28 April 2024 reported that plans are underway to lift the restrictions on the import of motor vehicles because a committee of Treasury Officials has stated that in the absence of duties on motor vehicle imports the country would not meet the revenue targets set by the International Monetary Fund. The news report states further that the trade-off is an $ 800 million drain on foreign reserves against the earning of a SL Rupee denominated tax revenue of Rs. 340 billion. Whilst accepting that there would be different views re the logic of this trade-off, I see this as a situation which calls for Limiting Factor Analysis (LFA).

When President Ranil Wickremesinghe announces his candidacy, we will hear people sing of dark times

‚ÄúFor every complex problem, there is a solution that is clear, simple, and wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄòSustaining Stability‚Äô is the oxymoronic title of the recent panel discussion organised by the Central Bank.

How to make a three-legged stool stand on two legs would have been a more commonsensical, down to earth title for the profoundly perplexing exchange of views by five panellists ‚Äì all steeped in the science of economics.

That makes it easy. A repetition of remarks made by participants or attempting to qualify who said what, is not necessary.

It was a seriously choreographed discussion. It was in English ‚Äì the language of Global Commerce, the IMF, and holders of our International Sovereign Bonds.

Therein lies another tale. All this brouhaha is to appease creditors for us to get back to the business of borrowing.

Every year around late April we all speak about the Easter bomb disaster which affected thousands of people in the country.

During that period there were several public requests for action to be taken against all who are guilty of failing in their duties.

In an article on 2 May 2019 which was published in the papers soon after the disaster where I clearly mentioned:

‚ÄúIt is absolutely necessary that those responsible, starting from the top two leaders and all others holding political office, be compelled by law to face appropriate penalties for their indifference and negligence.‚Äù

As it has happened in the last 75 years after Independence, whenever a disaster takes place in the country we talk about it for some time and conveniently forget about it.

Transparency and widespread consultation is vital for an FTA Feasibility Study that reflects the interests of the country rather than vested interests of a few politicians and their business henchmen

It is important to realise that the mere reduction of an import duty at the border, through an FTA does not mean free market access for Sri Lanka goods to the Indian or any other market since there are many non-tariff barriers and trade facilitation documentation issues facing our exports to those markets. An UNCTAD Study on Non Tariff Measures in China and India (2020) noted that despite reduction in import duties at the border, a host of NTMs as sanitary and phytosanitary/technical barriers to trade, quotas, financial exchange and price changing measures, registration and administrative, non technical issues can adversely affect price and quantities traded.

The Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday approved a power wheeling facility for private entities to collectively use the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) transmission network to transport electricity to different locations subject to a payment of fee.

The progressive move aims to promote renewable energy adoption and boost energy self-sufficiency in Sri Lanka. The approach, known as ‚Äòpower wheeling‚Äô, allows electricity users to utilise existing supply from another location through the grid, subject to a fee, thereby reducing costs effectively.

Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena yesterday said under the approved proposal, electricity users will be allowed to build renewable energy plants, such as mini-hydro facilities and transmit the generated power through the CEB grid to other locations owned by the same party for personal use.

### Dr. Fernandopulle presents two private member bills to push for more women representation in Parliament

Two private member bills have been presented to parliament with the aim of increasing women‚Äôs representation in the legislative body.

The two bills, reportedly submitted by parliamentarian Dr Sudarshini Fernandopulle as private member proposals, aim to address the issue of female representation in parliament. One bill seeks to amend the Parliamentary Elections Act, advocating for a minimum of 30% female representation in every recognized political party.

Additionally, another proposal submitted to Parliament as a draft bill aims to amend the Constitution as the 22nd Amendment. This proposal suggests that not less than 50% of women members be included in the national list nominated to represent the Parliament of a political party or an independent group.

Fernandopulle told journalists that despite her requests to political parties to take steps to enhance women‚Äôs representation, she opted to introduce the necessary legislation herself due to the absence of a positive response.

President Joe Biden has slapped major new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment, taking potshots at Donald Trump along the way as he embraced a strategy that‚Äôs increasing friction between the world‚Äôs two largest economies.

The Democratic president said on Tuesday that Chinese government subsidies ensure the nation‚Äôs companies do not have to turn a profit, giving them an unfair advantage in global trade.

‚ÄúAmerican workers can outwork and out-compete anyone as long as the competition is fair,‚Äù Biden said in the White House Rose Garden. ‚ÄúBut for too long, it hasn‚Äôt been fair. For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not competition, it‚Äôs cheating.‚Äù

He criticizes the dual approach of fundraising for Palestine while facilitating Israeli entry into the country, advocating for a unified stance in support of Palestine.

üü©

Opposition member Mujibur Rahman said the government, including the president, said that instead of collecting money for Palestine, the Israeli government should put pressure on the Israeli government.. The President, who sends our navy to suppress the Hawdi militants, said that the Indian fishermen would not take any action to prevent the fishermen coming into our waters.

He said this while addressing the adjournment motion on the current state of Palestine held in Parliament on Tuesday (14).

All the heads of state who ruled Sri Lanka have supported Palestine since the early days. Despite our political disagreements with Mahinda Rajapaksa, he was firm on the Palestinian issue.. Similarly, Ranasinghe Premadasa took steps to evict the Israeli office in our country.

The President is starting a fund for Palestinian people and raising money. But when he rallies money to Palestine, there may not be children in Palestine, where there are no people.. There are things that can be pressed.

Sri Lanka's handling of Tamil issues contrasts sharply with its stance on Palestine. TNA MP MA Sumanthiran criticized Sri Lanka for its "hypocrisy" and "dual role," highlighting the disparity between condemning international crimes like those in Palestine while dismissing similar atrocities against Tamils as internal affairs. He referenced the Mullivaikkal massacre, where hundreds of thousands were trapped without food, contrasting it with the international outcry over Palestine. Sumanthiran questioned whether Sri Lanka's selective concern for international law applies equally to its own citizens, calling for an independent inquiry into the treatment of Tamils.

Imtiaz Pakir Makar accuses media of covering up the Palestinian crisis, likening it to the apartheid era. He criticizes the media for not exposing the ongoing disaster in Palestine, despite social media revealing some truths. Last week, the UN granted Palestine full membership, despite threats from Israel to cut US aid to the UN. This move was supported by 143 countries, with only nine, including the US and Israel, opposing it. Makar highlights the ongoing challenges to international justice and human rights.

United People's Power MP Imtiaz Pakir Makar said that the genocide and disaster that has been carried out on Palestinian soil for more than six months, the world's mighty media and some of our country's mighty media are covering up.

He said this while addressing the debate on the proposal on the present stage of Palestine in Parliament on Tuesday (14).

The forces that saved the South African apartheid regime, in the same manner, are still trying to cover up the injustice and repression of Palestinian soil, and go against the mandate of the people of the world, and seek refuge for the separatist and inhumane rule.

Although the mighty media is covered, the reality of Palestine is almost exposed to the community through social media.

### Lankan mercenaries fighting in Russo-Ukraine war - EDITORIAL

Media reports have been circulating of Sri Lankan ex-military personnel being involved in the Russo-Ukraine conflict. With the war raging in Ukraine, many Ukrainian males of military age have fled to neighbouring EU countries to avoid military service. It should not be unexpected that recruiters would seek battle-hardened military men from foreign lands.

Our country with a large number of battle-hardened troops either idling in camps or having deserted military service is therefore a soft target for foreign recruiters. All they needed were locals with insider knowledge and capacity to help them recruit.

According to media reports a former Major General and an ex-sergeant have been among their local point men.

In the aftermath of the war, former veterans have had all their special allowances cut. They now depend on their basic wage.

Like the rest of his ilk in this part of the world, Mahinda Rajapaksa overstayed his welcome in the power. He ran the economy to the ground as he did with the national carrier, which he re-nationalized out of a fit of rage after its Emirates management refused to deplane fee-levying passengers to make room for his entourage.

He tried on a dynastic power grab that went spectacularly wrong, ending in the worst-ever financial crisis since the independence.

But, like every crook and conman in Third World politics,¬† Mahinda Rajapaksa thrives in a sense of inviolability and a culture of impunity fostered by the very system that sustains their political existence.

The picture shows one of the beams of the highway after it collapsed

The construction of the phase from Kottawa to Pinnaduwa- of the project titled ‚ÄòExpressway Network of Sri Lanka‚Äô- was completed in 2011. During its construction, a medical student died as a result of a minor collapse of a bridge on the expressway in 2008. This incident sparked widespread concern regarding the quality and reliability of this expressway facility. Although the concept of expressways was relatively new to Sri Lankans at that time, there was significant discourse regarding passenger safety; particularly in the event of a bridge or culvert falls apart while the facility is being used for travel. Investigations later confirmed that the cause of the collapse was the improper construction of the bridge.

The other beams at a 45 degree angle are unaffected by the collapse of one beam

The Committee on Public Finance (CoPF) expressed strong displeasure regarding the absence of officials from the Ministry of Public Security and the Department of Immigration and Emigration during discussions concerning the recent issues pertaining to the process of issuing online visa for foreigners visiting Sri Lanka.

The committee chair Harsha de Silva noted that officials from the Public Security Ministry and the Immigration Department had previously committed to attending the committee meeting but failed to do so, which was viewed as disrespectful to the committee. The late notice provided the evening before the meeting was deemed unacceptable, the Parliamentary Communications Department said.

As a result, it was decided to summon representatives from the relevant ministry and the department once again for further discussions regarding the appointment of GBS-IVS and VFS Global as authorized agents for online visa applications.

### A Call To Comrade Anura Kumara Dissanayake: Time To Reflect & Adapt

I write these words with a sense of urgency and anticipation, believing that the time has come to reflect and adapt. The seeds you sow knowingly or unknowingly have reaped a bitter harvest of division and discontent among the people of our Nation. Your brand of politics has had a lasting impact on our society, characterized by its bitterness and divisiveness. From the turbulent events of 71 to the unrest of 88 and 89, the scars of past conflicts continue to haunt us. The stagnant narrative of 76 years of curse and rejection of 225 has perpetuated, casting a shadow over our collective aspirations.

Your ability to mobilize support and empower people to your cause cannot be denied. The meetings last May showed the strength of your organization. But this energy, though powerful, is not without its dangers. It serves as a warning not only to you but to the entire nation.

### If Tamil Eelam was origin

*2024-05-14 21:26:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183560) ¬∑ `ta`

Tamil Eelam, if it had originated, could have evolved into a South Asian Israel, akin to the transformation of Palestine. Wimal Weerawansa, a Sri Lankan parliamentarian, suggested the US's interest in ending the LTTE war was influenced by Israel. The comparison draws parallels between the struggles of Palestinians and Tamils, highlighting the international community's role in conflicts. The narrative also touches on the failed attempts by Britain to establish Tamil Eelam within Sri Lanka, contrasting it with their success in Palestine. The mention of the US's involvement, including a Marine Squadron visit to protect LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, and the use of veto power at the UN to support Sri Lanka, underscores the complex international dynamics in these conflicts.

üü©

If the war with the LTTE did not end, Tamil Eelam would have been originated in South Asia. It would have been transformed into Israel.. National Freedom Front leader and parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said that the US is tears to end the war by providing Israel and ending the war.

He was speaking at a debate on the adjournment motion on the Palestinian Affairs Affairs in Parliament on Tuesday (14).

Palestinians have been badly affected by the inhuman attack of Israel. We are worried about the present situation of the Palestinians.

When World War II intensified, the Great Britain signed a deal with the Jews to end the war. The Jews urged the British to have a country or kingdom after the end of the war.

Tamils live in the world. They are based on South Indian Dravidian language so that they are giving them a unique country within Sri Lanka, giving them a great British fake independence.

### Ransomware payments increase 500% in last year: Sophos

*2024-05-14 21:05:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/ransomware-payments-increase-500-in-last-year-sophos/) ¬∑ `en`

Sophos, a global leader of innovative security solutions that defeat cyberattacks, today released its annual ‚ÄúState of Ransomware 2024‚Äù survey report, which found that the average ransom payment has increased 500% in the last year. Organizations that paid the ransom reported an average payment of $2 million, up from $400,000 in 2023. However, ransoms are just one part of the cost. Excluding ransoms, the survey found the average cost of recovery reached $2.73 million, an increase of almost $1 million since the $1.82 million that Sophos reported in 2023.

Despite the soaring ransoms, this year‚Äôs survey indicates a slight reduction in the rate of ransomware attacks with 59% of organizations being hit, compared with 66% in 2023. While the propensity to be hit by ransomware increases with revenue, even the smallest organizations (less than $10 million in revenue) are still regularly targeted, with just under half (47%) hit by ransomware in the last year.

### Trends that Tamils and Muslims voted in the past presidential elections

*2024-05-14 20:24:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183559) ¬∑ `ta`

The upcoming 2024 presidential election in Sri Lanka is shaping up to be a significant event, with the potential for a close contest among the main contenders. The Sri Lanka Elections Commission has announced the election dates, and while the specific candidates have not been officially announced, the media has speculated on potential contestants, including Anura Kumarathisanayake from the Janata Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the National People's Power.



The election is expected to be a triangular contest, with the votes of the Sinhalese community, the largest majority in Sri Lanka, potentially being split among the main candidates. This could lead to a situation where no candidate secures the 50% required to win outright in the first round, necessitating a second round of voting.



The votes of minority communities, including Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims, and Indian origin Tamils, are crucial in this context. These communities, while constituting a smaller percentage of the total population, are significant in certain districts and could potentially sway the outcome of the election.



Historically, the votes of these minority communities have played a pivotal role in past presidential elections. For instance, in the 1999 election, Chandrika Kumaratunga's victory was attributed to a wave of sympathy following an assassination attempt, which also affected the outcome of the 2005 election. The 2015 election saw a significant shift, with the winning candidate, Maithripala Sirisena, receiving fewer Sinhalese votes but securing a majority among non-Sinhalese voters.



The 2019 election saw a return to a more traditional voting pattern, with Gotabhaya Rajapaksa securing a majority among Sinhalese voters, despite receiving significant support from minority communities.



As the 2024 election approaches, the role of minority communities, particularly the Sri Lankan Tamils and Muslims, will be crucial. Their support could potentially decide the outcome, especially if the Sinhalese votes are divided among the main candidates. The historical voting patterns and the strategic importance of minority communities in past elections suggest that their support could be decisive in the upcoming election.



In conclusion, the 2024 presidential election in Sri Lanka is expected to be a closely contested affair, with the votes of minority communities potentially playing a pivotal role in determining the outcome. The historical context and the strategic importance of these communities in past elections underscore their significance in the upcoming contest.

üü©

The Sri Lanka Elections Commission announced last week that the 2024 presidential election will be held on September 17 and October 16. The Elections Commission has repeated the matter already known. Although the exclusive date has not been announced, the election is possible to be held in late September or early October.

Many will compete for the presidency as in the past. While some have explicitly expressed their desire to contest the election, the names of other people who are contesting are published in the media.But, only the three are the main contestants with the opportunity to win.

The government's approach doesn't involve promoting the use of legal alcohol; instead, it focuses on regulation through tax hikes and implementing new license fees. The overarching goal seems to be enhancing state revenue while simultaneously curbing the proliferation of illegal alcohol," the State mMnister said.

India has extended the ban on the LTTE for another five years as it continues to develop separatism among the people and improves the LTTE's support base in India, especially in Tamil Nadu.

The Home Ministry said in a statement that the central government considers the LTTE to still engage in adverse activities for the integrity and security of the country.

Even after the defeat in Sri Lanka in May 2009, the LTTE has not abandoned the notion of 'Eelam' (independent country for Tamils) and has been working secretly for financial raising and Eelam.

Propaganda and the rest of the LTTE leaders or members have begun to reunite scattered activists and raise the organization at home and internationally.

‚ÄúThe LTTE -backed groups/components are continuing to develop separatism among the masses and promote the LTTE's support base in India and especially Tamil Nadu.

This will eventually have a strong influence on India's regional integrity, ‚Äùthe announcement said.

### Modern thermal radiation therapy that relieves varicose nerve impact

*2024-05-14 17:43:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183546) ¬∑ `ta`

Modern thermal radiation therapy, like Endovenous Laser Therapy, offers relief for varicose nerve issues, affecting many who work long hours. This treatment involves a small procedure to heat and eliminate the infection in the affected nerve area, improving blood flow and reducing discomfort. It's a welcome solution for patients, offering quick recovery and minimal downtime.

üü©

Many of us continue to work for more than five to eight hours a day. Most of them have a varicose nerve infection in their ankles and foot.

If this is easy to describe, the blood is pumped from the heart of all parts of our body with a balanced force.

Because of this, the blood that spreads throughout the body comes back to the heart. The blood vessel system is naturally in our body that we have one path to the body from the heart and another path to the heart from the other part of the body.

In this case, the blood that runs up to the quarter of the area is contaminated, and when they are weak, the contaminated blood is stagnant when they are weak, or when they are weak, or weak, due to various disturbances or due to various disturbances or exclusive blood vessels.. This causes the skin in the quarter and ankle area in the end. It also makes the nerves and causes discomfort and sickness.
