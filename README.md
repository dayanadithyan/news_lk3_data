### Lawyers group criticises Tiran Alles for personalising anti-drug initiative

The Lawyers Collective, a recently formed civil society group in a letter to Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, yesterday expressed grave concerns in the manner the Public Security Minister is exercising his powers in relation to the ‘Yukthiya’ Anti-Drug Campaign.

The organisation said the campaign must conform to the Rule of Law and cannot be a passionate, personal, initiative that the Minister seeks to implement outside the law.

“The manner in which you are conducting this campaign and making public statements on the media indicates that you will consider any laws that you think restrict your authority as obstacles that you have every right to disregard and that all who comment or criticise the manner in which the campaign is conducted are drug dealers and drug addicts,” it noted.

The organisation said the Minister has repeatedly referred to lawyers in this manner, despite a statement from the Bar Association of Sri Lanka objecting to this attack on the legal profession.

### 76 years on is Sri Lanka independent or in-dependence? What are we celebrating?

Sri Lanka has not had the benefit of a local Mahatma Gandhi, neither then, nor even today. So the country has to have a different model to India. The ideal model would be a collective leadership with a high level multiparty governing council for a period of time at least to chart a common economic program that sets some key parameters and strategies to set the country on a long term economic and social revival

There was no fight for . . . freedom which involved a fight for principles, policies, and programmes … No. It just came overnight. We just woke up one day and we were told, “You are a dominion now.” - S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, Ceylon Prime Minister

It sings of a stauncher freedom and untrammelled liberty, which we earnestly desire but often find to be out of reach year after year, generation after generation – Pic by Ruwan Walpola

As Sri Lanka parades past its 76th milepost on a journey of independence from colonial dominion today, there are a few factors to my mind that may help discern how the wind in that flag flies in the face of our march past.

It sings of a stauncher freedom and untrammelled liberty, which we earnestly desire but often find to be out of reach year after year, generation after generation.

The way we spend our days, of course, is the way we live our lives. This is as true of nations as it is of individuals.

There is therefore some merit in examining the way we dealt in the year past with diurnal events as individuals, as it may indicate the turn that our destiny as a nation is taking.

### SJB Protest Turns Out A Damp Squib

Electioneering is in the air. The usual rounds of protests are commencing. The NPP/JVP combine commenced their programme to ‘educate’ the electorate of issues at hand some time ago. On Tuesday, the main opposition party (SJB) held what it expected to be a massive demonstration against the ‘Online Safety Bill’ (OSB), the imposition of taxes, various price hikes and a skyrocketing cost of living.

The party expected to bring into Colombo 50,000 protestors. Unfortunately that expectation fell short by around 48,000. While many applaud the SJB sentiment of drawing attention to the dangers posed by the imposition of the OSB and the unbearable cost of living, everyone was aghast at the SJB’s claim of having led the ‘Aragalaya’ and the toppling of ex-President Gotabaya Rakapakasa.

### Fraud, corruption rampant at SPC : GMOF

Feb 2 (Daily Mirror) -  Fraud and corruption activities persisted at the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation of Sri Lanka (SPC) during the tenure of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, claims the Government Medical Officers' Forum (GMOF).

They further claim that these issues are ongoing, even following the appointment of a new Minister to the Health Ministry.

According to GMOF president Dr. Rukshan Bellana, tenders initiated during the former chairmanship of Sarath Liyanage at the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) were cancelled. However, he alleges that the same tenders are being reintroduced under the new SPC chairmanship, with the values inflated to ten times their previous amounts.

"Despite the new Minister being aware of these revised tender procedures, he maintains a silent approach. Consequently, the GMOF is compelled to take decisive action to draw attention to this situation and address the matter with the Minister," the GMOF president said.

*2024-02-02 22:49:51* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/independent-of-what-whom/) · `en`

It reminds us of the saying “Pride costs us more than hunger, thirst and cold” by Thomas Jefferson, when we see how rulers of an economically bankrupt nation are preparing themselves to celebrate their independence from the British colonialism. Even though it is true that the independence which is a process contributed by lots of men and women in the country should be celebrated and appreciated annually, the value of its financial cost is questionable at this crucial juncture where citizens are unprecedentedly taxed, inhumanely ignoring the capability of fulfilling even their basic needs. On the other hand, independence remains important and celebrate-worthy, given the fact that independence is gained from what or whom, especially how big the threat is. It is in that sense that we are able to figure out that the independence to be gained is more important and valuable than the one that our forefathers fought for.

### Two UK teens get life sentence for ‘sadistic’ killing of trans girl

Two British teenagers were ordered to be detained for life on Friday for the “sadistic” knife murder of a 16-year-old transgender girl that shocked the country.

Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both 16, killed Brianna Ghey in Warrington, northwest England, in February last year, in what the judge called a planned “frenzied and ferocious” assault.

Ghey was stabbed 28 times in the head, neck, back and chest after believing she was going to meet a friend. Her body was discovered by dog walkers in a park.

“You both took part in a brutal and planned murder which was sadistic in nature,” judge Amanda Yip told the pair as she handed down the sentence at Manchester Crown Court.

Yip said that Jenkinson’s “primary motivation” had been a desire to kill, but the pair had also been motivated in part by Ghey’s transgender identity.

The judge ruled that Jenkinson must serve a minimum of 22 years before being considered for release, while Ratcliffe must serve at least 20 years.

### Sri Lanka private creditors said to be frustrated over lack of progress

ECONOMYNEXT – Some of Sri Lanka’s bondholders who were willing to negotiate a deal before a judgement was delivered in a case filed by holdout investor Hamilton Reserve, are frustrated at what is seen as no progress in discussions, sources familiar with their thinking said.

While Hamilton Reserve has gone to court claiming to represent a 250 million dollar or 25 percent share in a billion-dollar bond with a so-called ‘single series’ collective action clause, a large majority of bondholders who have other bonds, have formed a committee to negotiate with Sri Lanka.

Western governments including the US and France have asked that the court action be stayed until negotiations with other bondholders conclude, but prospects of a deal being concluded by the time the first deadline given by the court has now dimmed.

It is not clear yet whether a second extension could be obtained from court.

Today (Jan 31) is the birthday of eminent constitutional lawyer, academic and politician Dr. Neelakandan Tiruchelvam. Neelan as he was popularly known would have completed eighty  years , had he been among the living today.

I had a close personal relationship with Neelan. He was my friend, philosopher and guide. He was greatly instrumental in moulding my career. He was in a sense my political mentor. It was as a journalist on the Tamil daily “Virakesari” that I first began interacting with Neelan Tiruchelvam.

### Tamil Nadu’s First DMK Chief Minister CN Annadurai known as “Anna” made very significant contributions to Tamil theatre, cinema,  and literature.

*2024-02-02 18:09:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83543) · `en`

Former Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai may have been instrumental in shaping the course of Tamil Nadu’s political history. But his artistic and literary persona played a major role in his achieving the rare iconic status he enjoyed.

His contributions as a writer and actor undoubtedly aided him in his propaganda all the way. However, when viewed sans the political agenda, his work can be seen as having made very significant contributions to Tamil theatre, cinema and literature.

Some of Anna’s plays were made into films and are regarded as very important productions in Kollywood. ’Velaikkari’ and ’Or Iravu’ are two of his most popular films.

Both were stage plays penned by him that were later made into films which also had Anna penning the story and dialogue. In fact, at one point producers began capitalising on the audience’s response to mere mention of ’Kadai, Vasanam – C.N.Annadurai’ on the title cards. So much so that it would precede even the actors’ and directors’ names.

Sri Lanka fought back to dismiss Afghanistan for 198, before ending day one of the one-off Test at the Singhalese Sports Club (SSC) on 80 for 0.

Left arm fast bowler Vishwa Fernando accounted for three of Afghanistan's middle-order batters, along with the scalp of opener Noor Ali, to finish with figures of 4 for 51, the best of the hosts’ bowlers.

Right-arm fast bowler Asitha Fernando and left arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya finished with three wickets a piece, as Afghanistan collapsed to lose their last six wickets for 43 and struggled to find big contributions outside of Rahmat Shah’s 91.

In his first outing as the next Sri Lanka Test captain, Dhananjaya de Silva bucked conventional wisdom by opting to bowl first at the historically bat-first SSC – a decision likely to have been influenced by the green-top pitch – with the hosts’ playing three fast bowlers, which include debutant Chamika Gunasekera.

Forum Asia, or The Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development is a network of 85 member organisations across 23 countries, mainly in Asia.

The Anti-Terrorism Bill and the Online Safety Bill, viewed by many as detrimental to human rights and freedoms, have drawn criticism from civil society organizations and rights groups across the country.

According to Forum Asia, the revised Anti-Terrorism Bill, set to replace the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), closely mirrors its predecessor, sparking concerns about its expansive definition of terrorism, limited judicial oversight, and constraints on the Human Rights Commission.

### Ahead of election, Pakistan seals plan to sell national airline

*2024-02-02 17:00:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96954/ahead-of-election-pakistan-seals-plan-to-sell-national-airline) · `en`

Ahead of elections next week, Pakistan’s caretaker administration is making binding plans for a new government to sell loss-making Pakistan International Airlines, according to the minister in charge of the process and other officials.

In the past, elected governments have shied away from undertaking unpopular reforms, including the sale of the flag carrier. But Pakistan, in deep economic crisis, agreed in June to overhaul loss-making state-owned enterprises under a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $3 billion bailout.

The government decided to privatise PIA just weeks after signing the IMF agreement.

The caretaker administration, which took office in August to oversee the Feb. 8 election, was empowered by the outgoing parliament to take any steps needed to meet the budgetary targets agreed with the IMF.
