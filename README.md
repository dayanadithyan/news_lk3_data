### Ex-President Sirisena draws an India connection - EDITORIAL

*2024-04-08 03:06:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Ex-President-Sirisena-draws-an-India-connection-EDITORIAL/172-280331) · `en`

Ex-President Sirisena is once again in the news for all the wrong reasons. Hardly had the ink dried on news stories of his sudden firing of three senior Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members, we learned that a court order has barred him from performing duties as chairman of that party.

The court order was based on a complaint to the court by Chandrika Kumaratunga for the removal of Sirisena from the post of SLFP Chairman, on the grounds he was unsuitable for the role. Among the reasons for his ouster were charges he was unlawfully holding the Chairmanship of the party in violation of the Party Constitution.

Additional charges arose from Sirisena’s actions during the constitutional crisis of 2018 being deemed incorrect. He was also found guilty of having violated the fundamental rights of people in the case of the Easter Sunday bombings.

### Auspicious times! Exposing incompetence or astrology a pseudoscientific myth?

*2024-04-08 03:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Auspicious-times-Exposing-incompetence-or-astrology-a-pseudoscientific-myth/172-280330) · `en`

Professional rivalry or jealousy often leads astrologers outside the official team to challenge the declared times

During the Sinhala Avurudda, also known as the Sinhala and Hindu New Year, people adhere to various religious rituals and cultural practices meticulously following auspicious times known as “nekath” provided by astrologers.

In response to past controversies surrounding nekath, the government appointed a team of astrologers in 1992  to determine the official auspicious times, which were widely accepted. However, professional rivalry or jealousy often leads astrologers outside the official team to challenge the declared times, citing various unexplained theoretical concepts unique to astrology. These contradictions caused anxiety among the general public and believers of astrology, leading to uncertainty and a loss of confidence in the auspicious times provided.

### Ukraine is fighting an increasingly desperate war

*2024-04-08 02:51:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Ukraine-is-fighting-an-increasingly-desperate-war/172-280329) · `en`

Ukraine is in trouble today because the EU’s aid package was blocked by Hungary, and no EU country is able to produce the munitions badly needed by Ukraine

There is a war in Ukraine? It seems to have been forgotten by everyone–except by Ukraine, Russia and their respective allies.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine in February 2022, many including myself expected it to be over in weeks. In my case, this was because, as much as I dislike Putin’s dictatorship, Russian superiority in armour, artillery, aircraft and manpower was so big it was hard to see how Ukraine could stop all those tanks rolling over the country’s eastern steppes and advancing into the country, encircling and destroying outnumbered Ukrainian forces.

### Racist policy of forced cremation

*2024-04-08 02:28:19* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Racist-policy-of-forced-cremation/4-760427) · `en`

The whole issue of forced cremation that shook the Muslim community in 2020/21 was entirely rooted in racism.

It is the Gotabaya Government which both piloted and enforced to the full measure this racist policy, aided by experts whom the President himself effectively appointed.

Now that it has been demonstrated, after a series of international setbacks for the Government and the erosion of public trust in Government leaders and experts, the question of tendering an open apology to the Muslim community and to those who opposed the policy tooth and nail as it was ruthlessly enforced has now come up.

As admitted, Thondaman’s Ministry of Water Resources has found out that the COVID-19 virus doesn’t spread through ground water. Perhaps, Ali Sabry’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs may have found out that the damage that this racist policy implemented by the Government, of which he remained an integral part (as Justice Minister), heaped on the country internationally was avoidable but horrendous.

If this is not a crime against humanity to some extent one wonders what crimes against humanity are – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

With reference to the subject news report titled “Thondaman calls for formal Govt. apology to Muslim community over forced COVID cremations” appearing on the front page of your widely circulated and read newspaper of Friday 5 April 2024, I wish to bring the following to the attention of your readers with regard to the article.

The apology from an individual on behalf of the Government which as a collective acted in contravention of prevalent and established ethical, scientific and moral grounds to selectively target a section of its own citizens indeed must not and should not be accepted as the decision to forcefully cremate COVID-19 dead during the pandemic was solely a political decision.

### How to miss five industrial revolutions

*2024-04-08 01:55:38* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/How-to-miss-five-industrial-revolutions/4-760419) · `en`

The signs of having gone through industrial revolutions are the country becoming wealthy, and population having a high level of per capita income

Sri Lanka did not have a complete set of Government institutions to maintain a corruption-free economy. This incompleteness later led to countrywide corruption and creating a generation of rent seekers whose primary objective was to profit from the Government, at the expense of the welfare of the general public. This should have been obvious to the political leaders and bureaucrats of Sri Lanka who oversaw the transition of political power from the colonial master. Thus, the need to import and adopt technology and the need to install the full set of institutions should have been a top priority of the country. In similar situations, countries like Japan and Singapore adopted correct strategies

### Two Experiments In Social Psychology & Their Relevance To Sri Lanka

Mired in corruption, communal disharmony, crooked political leadership and religious nationalism, Sri Lankans would benefit from stepping back from all that has happened over the last fifty or more years and taking a meta view of interethnic conflict and other ailments that have overshadowed the more pressing problems of economic development, peace and prosperity. A social psychological approach may provide such valuable insights. Here we discuss two ground- breaking studies in social psychology that may provide an understanding into the group dynamics that underpin our interethnic problems.

The first was an experiment called the Minimum Group Study (or Paradigm) devised and carried out by Henry Tajfel in UK in the 1970s and the other is by Muzafer Sheriff called the Robbers Cave experiment carried out in the 1950s in the US. These studies have been repeated by other social psychologists and the results have been the same.
