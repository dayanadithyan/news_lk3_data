### Bus carrying Shiite pilgrims from Pakistan to Iraq crashes in Iran, killing at least 28

A bus carrying Shiite pilgrims from Pakistan to Iraq crashed in central Iran, killing at least 28 people, an official said Wednesday.

The crash happened Tuesday night in the central Iranian province of Yazd, said Mohammad Ali Malekzadeh, a local emergency official, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.

Another 23 people suffered injuries in the crash, 14 of them serious, he added.

The pilgrims had been on their way to Iraq to commemorate Arbaeen, which marks the 40th day following the death of a Shiite saint in the 7th century. Pilgrims gather in Karbala, Iraq, in whatтАЩs regarded as the largest annual public gathering in the world.

Authorities offered no immediate cause for the crash. However, Iran has one of the worldтАЩs worst traffic safety records with some 17,000 deaths annually. The grave toll is blamed on wide disregard for traffic laws, unsafe vehicles and inadequate emergency services in its vast rural areas.

### Ranil Wickremesinghe's election symbol is illegal -Vijayadasa Rajapaksa

*2024-08-21 01:01:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191573) ┬╖ `ta`

Vijayadasa Rajapaksa criticizes the Election Commission for assigning an election symbol to a committee during ongoing local government elections, arguing it's premature and undermines public trust in the commission's ability to manage elections efficiently.

ЁЯЯй

It is illegal to give the election symbol to a committee in the presidential election as the local government elections are not yet over.. However, the National Democratic Front's presidential candidate Vijayadasa Rajapakse said that the Election Commission has done so.

He was speaking at a press conference held at his election office in Colombo on Tuesday (20).

Elections have begun as the nomination has been filed for the local government elections. But the election has not ended yet. In this backdrop, the Election Commission has given a gas cylinder election to a group contesting the local government elections.. This is illegal.

At the same time, if the local government elections are over, there is nothing wrong with providing the election symbol to the election panel to the other election.. Local government elections were initiated, though. But not ending. That is why we say that the election symbol given to a group cannot be given to a different candidate.

Even months before the election date was set, the National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) began its campaign with a meticulously planned strategy, positioning itself ahead in the early stages. However, as other candidates entered the race, the competition has grown increasingly fierce. The current president, who started the race with minimal public support, has made considerable progress according to reports. Meanwhile, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has managed to pose a strong challenge to the NPP, forming a broad multiethnic coalition. Despite this, most surveys indicate that a majority of voters are still undecided, making the upcoming weeks crucial for securing victory.

In a true democracy, the selection of candidates and the election process should involve the entire population equally. Unfortunately, our current election rules allow only a select few to become candidates without requiring any public endorsement, such as a stepwise regional election process within the party. Our system favours existing politicians and makes it virtually impossible to register a political party to address specific issues. It is a significant obstacle to a fair and inclusive democratic process. Despite the wishes expressed by the ordinary people during тАШAragalaya 2022,тАЩ we are left with mostly the same 225 candidates to choose from once again, a situation that should concern us all.
