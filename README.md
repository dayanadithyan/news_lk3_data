Just 6,000 industrial entities account for 93% of the¬†industrial electricity

The CEA is now working to change the application process so that companies will be required to provide greenhouse gas-related data

Some industrial sectors are making changes to adopt renewable technologies

Of the 70,000 industrial entities supplied by the CEB, 350 consume 42% of all industry sector electricity

To change something, first you have to understand it. But unless you fully understand what you are trying to change, you will be moving forward with your eyes closed. You will be struggling to understand the situation as you will be feeling your surroundings in the dark.

On one occasion, they are pure white but commences a process of transformation that ends finally in pure blackness

Asoka Handagama is notorious for challenging our cognitive capacity through his artwork, be it through poetry, fiction, stage drama, teledrama, or movies. His newest stage drama, ‚ÄòA Death in an Antique Shop‚Äô, is the best, or worst in some sense, in this tradition.

### ‚ÄòA Death In An Antique Shop‚Äô: Challenge To Our Cognitive Capacity?

*2024-05-19 20:20:06* ¬∑ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/a-death-in-an-antique-shop-challenge-to-our-cognitive-capacity/) ¬∑ `en`

Asoka Handagama is notorious for challenging our cognitive capacity through his artwork, be it through poetry, fiction, stage drama, teledrama, or movies. His newest stage drama, ‚ÄòA Death in an Antique Shop‚Äô, is the best, or worst in some sense, in this tradition. You can watch it not on stage but on YouTube.

In many respects, watching the drama on YouTube is better than doing it in a theatre-environment. First, it is free from the attention deficiency which we will face in a theatre. As Salman Khan, creator of the Khan Academy, has told us in his autobiographical professional experience, The One World Schoolhouse: Education Reimagined, we can keep attention to a single object continuously not more than for about seven minutes; beyond that, we lose focus on the object. In a theatre where we sit for hours in an uncomfortable posture, it is certainly not possible to pay full attention to what is being unfolded on the stage for the whole duration of the drama.

‚ÄúIf a child can‚Äôt learn the way we teach, maybe we should teach the way they learn.‚Äù Ignacio Estrada. This is a quote that is lost on the Sri Lankan education system but bamboo rods and beatings still remain as the number one tool to teach. Contrary to our cultural beliefs, this method is the least effective way to teach and it‚Äôs particularly detrimental when it comes to children with learning disorders.

Take Dyslexia, for example, a disorder identified 130 years ago by ophthalmologist Rudolf Berlin. People with Dyslexia have difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and their relation to words and letters (University of Oxford , n.d.). Simply put, these are the children who struggle to read and write and saying ‚ÄúIdiot, open your eyes and read what‚Äôs on the page. For every spelling mistake, I will give you a beating with a ruler,‚Äù will not cure their dyslexia.

Colombo, May 19 - ¬†The Sri Lanka All Union Alliance of the Board of Investment (BOI) has issued a stark warning against the proposed Economic Transformation Bill, set to be submitted to Parliament on May 22.

The alliance cautions that the Bill will severely destabilize the investment sector, which is already grappling with economic challenges.

According to the coalition, the Bill caters to a select few individuals without consulting field experts or investors. This could prompt the departure of existing investors, further jeopardizing the sector.

The alliance calls for a transparent revision of the Bill, involving affected parties and economic experts.

While proponents claim the act will drive significant economic transformation, the alliance argues that its true aim is to secure financial gains by transferring 15 profitable investment zones under BOI control to private associates before upcoming elections.

### BOI concerned over proposed Economic Transformation Act

*2024-05-19 14:11:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/BOI-concerned-over-proposed-Economic-Transformation-Act/108-282895) ¬∑ `en`

Colombo, May 19 - ¬†The Sri Lanka All Union Alliance of the Board of Investment (BOI) has issued a stark warning against the proposed Economic Transformation Act, set to be submitted to Parliament on May 22.

The alliance cautions that the Act will severely destabilize the investment sector, which is already grappling with economic challenges.

According to the coalition, the Act caters to a select few individuals without consulting field experts or investors. This could prompt the departure of existing investors, further jeopardizing the sector.

The alliance calls for a transparent revision of the Act, involving affected parties and economic experts.

While proponents claim the act will drive significant economic transformation, the alliance argues that its true aim is to secure financial gains by transferring 15 profitable investment zones under BOI control to private associates before upcoming elections.

### Debate Or No Debate, Addressing Critical Issues Is Important For Voters

In recent weeks, we have observed a disheartening spectacle unfold between the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the Jathika Jana Balawegaya, (NPP) as they engage in a futile tussle, each blaming the other for the failure to arrange a debate between their respective leaders and economic policy teams. This debate, crucial for enlightening the voting populace ahead of both the Presidential and General elections, remains elusive due to the entrenched animosity between the parties.

Consequently, the electorate grapples with disillusionment and disenchantment, triggered by the pervasive negative posturing exhibited by these factions, all while professing to champion System Change and advocate for a governance model marked by inclusivity and transparency.
