### An assessment of China growing ties with the Arab world

*2024-06-06 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/An-assessment-of-China-growing-ties-with-the-Arab-world/172-284189) · `en`

Against the backdrop of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing on May 30, significant meetings took place between Chinese President and a number of top Arab leaders

China’s real aim was to further strengthen its economic ties with the Arab world, which are already strong

Another advantage that the Chinese have in the Arab world is that they do not point to human rights violations in the Arab countries; and the Arab countries in turn remain silent about the persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang

China’s strengths in the Arab world are its economic heft, willingness to take up expensive infrastructure projects, non-interference in internal affairs, and the declining political credibility of the US in the Middle East. But the impediments in China’s way are the West’s technological superiority, the unassailable position of the dollar, and transparency characteristic of Western systems.

### Lifestyles of politicians and the life of an artist

Sri Lankans are easily attracted to the lifestyle of successful individuals, but rarely do they wish to put in long hours to emulate those feats. Here some fishermen are seen engaging in the perplexing task of checking their nets; an activity which is a must to ensure a large catch at sea

Few common factors are found when analysing careers of politicians and artistes; the present generation engaged in these two professions are all out to earn maximum money during their careers

There are so many performing artistes who took to politics; some of them were in parliament till very recently, but most of them failed to make any impact in the field of politics

A politician’s ‘life’ is often hectic. It has to be; because he has to serve the people who elected him to office. But we also see the ‘lifestyles’ they live and often envy them. Talk about our lawmakers having hectic lives, there are some who are the opposite, are lazy and not worth the salaries they earn.

Devastating cricket fans across the country, South Africa beat Sri Lanka by six wickets at the T20 World Cup, on Monday (3).

It may be a cliche in the scorebook, but a famous saying lasts a lifetime. It goes like this: “For when the One Great Scorer comes to mark against your name, He writes, not that you won or lost, but how you played the Game.” Though often quoted, Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘If’ also applies to what we learn and what we should become through sports. Kipling’s poem goes like this:

In Sri Lanka, cricket is not only popular but an obsession among the people especially after the versatile Arjuna Ranatunga led us to victory in the world cup of 1996.

### Should The Economic Transformation Bill Proceed?

*2024-06-05 22:56:24* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/should-the-economic-transformation-bill-proceed/) · `en`

Given the pivotal role of debt restructuring in the Economic Transformation Bill (ETB), the debt-to-GDP ratio may not remain below 95% by 2032 and reach an optimal level of 60% by 2048. This uncertainty also extends to the gross financing needs, which may not stay below 13%. While a 5% increase by 2027 seems feasible regarding GDP growth, it is uncertain if it will continue to exceed 5% after 2027. The ETB does not clearly outline the necessary economic growth to achieve Advanced Economic Status by 2048. This is a crucial factor in determining investment and welfare and, ultimately, improving the well-being of the people. A clear and comprehensive economic policy framework is necessary, rather than relying on arbitrary targets or a legal framework.  Based on the current US$ 4000 per capita income in Sri Lanka, achieving Advanced Economic Status by 2048 without such a framework seems highly improbable.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has requested Maldives to revisit the limit imposed in foreign remittances sent by the island nation’s migrant workers in a move to ease the restriction and increase the inflow into the country.

The Bank of Maldives (BML) has announced a new limit for foreign transactions which has been between $250-$300 monthly to prevent large dollar outflow from the country with an aim to prevent a forex shortage.

A large number of Sri Lankans work in the Maldives in high executive jobs in the hospitality sector in other categories including and labourers and housemaids. Some of them earn around $3,000 worth salary monthly, paid in Maldivian rufiyaa.

It’s unimaginable now what must have been going through my aunt’s mind as she sat in the car with us, making our way to Palali airport in the dead of night. My brother and I, just fourteen at the time, couldn’t comprehend the gravity of the situation. We never had the chance to discuss it further with her, as our time together was cut short. Soon after we left the country, despite her illness, Akila threw herself fully into the local administrative work under the control of the LTTE. At times, she worked with Thamilselvan, the leader of LTTE’s political wing, who was killed by the Sri Lankan army in 2007 in a targeted airstrike. Akila also succumbed to her illness, which deteriorated mainly due to the demands of her work, requiring extensive travel across the North.

### “More Digital-Readers” Is A Consequence Of “Less Thinkers”

The article aims to clarify the relationship between reading and critical thinking. While reading is undoubtedly a valuable habit, globalization has provided us with countless reading options, leading to a decline in critical thinking. Here are my arguments to support this claim.

Digitalization has created a convenient space for people in the 21st century. As a result, many people are choosing to read online, which is especially beneficial for distance learning courses and online public lectures. Importantly, readers can access materials from the comfort of their homes without the need to travel or have massive bookshelves. In my academic career, both as a student and a lecturer, I have always relied on books and the basic support of digital resources. However, I have consistently preferred printed books over online reading because I believe that having a physical library with printed books offers unique advantages that online reading cannot fully satisfy.

### Two underworld gangsters arrested

Two underworld gangsters operating the drug trafficking network in the country on the directions of their leaders known named 'Alagoram Jothi Ruban' and 'Sedawatte Kasun' currently in hiding in Dubai, were arrested today.

The arrest was made by the Organized Crime Investigation Unit of the CID during raids in Kotuwila in Wellampitiya and Meegahawatta in Avissawella.

Police said the two suspects were close confidantes of the underworld leaders hiding in Dubai and responsible for a series of crimes and drug trafficking in Sri Lanka.

Under interrogation, one of the suspects provided information leading to the recovery of a foreign made revolver and 54 rounds of live ammunition that had been buried behind a house belonging to his brother in the Kotuwila area.

### Sri Lanka women legislators in gender pay gap survey

ECONOMYNEXT – A Women’s Caucus in Sri Lanka’s parliament has commissioned a survey on gender pay gaps with the intention of bringing legislation to narrow the gap, the group’s Chairperson Dr Sudarshani Fernandopulle said.

“We are conducting a survey to identify the places that have a gender pay gap, so we can bring in necessary legislation to minimise it,” Fernandopulle said during a debate to pass a bill on Womens’ Empowerment.

Though salary scales in the government sector are equal regardless of gender, it is not so in the private sector.

“Women are paid less than men for doing the same job.” Equality has not been achieved by appeals alone and legislation was necessary, she said.

“No matter how advanced our women are thanks to free education and free healthcare, their participation in formal employment is still at 35 percent.”

While state agencies set equal pay, women in decision making roles were still low within them, Fernandopulle said.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned early Wednesday that Israel was "prepared for very intense action in the north," as he visited a border city hit by wildfires sparked by Hezbollah rockets.

The escalation has piled pressure on Netanyahu from right-wing members of his government, who have also threatened to quit if he agrees to the U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal. President Joe Biden criticized Netanyahu in an interview published Tuesday, but also dispatched top aides to the region for new talks with mediators as Washington pushes for a deal that would end eight months of fighting in Gaza and secure the release of hostages held by Hamas.
