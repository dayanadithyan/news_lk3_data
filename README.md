It has now been circulated among the NGOs and individual activists for their views before being presented to the Cabinet for approval.

### JVP’s Love-Hate Relationship with India

No doubt, India invited the NPP leaders for the current visit (a privilege that was not awarded even to the official Opposition in Parliament), on the premise that the party is going to form the next government. The outcomes of a series of opinion polls conducted by the Institute of Health Policy (IHP) since late 2022 which have not been challenged yet even by the ruling parties, indicated a rapid progress in the popularity of the NPP

In case the election results and the opinion polls coincide, the NPP has to deal with India, as India has already chosen economic interests in the Trincomalee oil tank farm, Mannar wind power project, Sampur power plant, and many more which the NPP does not agree with

### Darkness in the Midst of a Heatwave

We are in the midst of a heatwave. Temperatures are rising, the days are bright, but for the majority of our people, this is a very dark era. Dark, because they can see no way to break out of the stark poverty-stricken situation they find themselves in.

Since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country in January 2020, the numbers of people who found themselves out of employment rose to an astounding 500,000, according to figures provided by the Central Bank. Most of these individuals were temporary workers at construction sites, as well as those working on road development projects around the country.

To make matters worse, the Covid-19 pandemic saw the forced return of our migrant workers; the inflow of cash from migrant workers makes up the biggest share of our foreign exchange.

### The Kaithady Explosion that Rocked the LTTE on Valentine’s Day

*2024-02-10 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-Kaithady-Explosion-that-Rocked-the-LTTE-on-Valentines-Day/172-276711) · `en`

The 14th of February 1987 remains an explosive date in the  annals of contemporary military history. A well-laid plan by the LTTE –  known popularly as the ‘Tigers’ – to attack the Navatkuli Army Camp on  Valentine’s Day went awry, due to the accidental explosion that killed  43 and injured 51 persons

Prabakaran wanted his cadres to re-draw plans and attack  Navatkuli again. But while preparations were in progress, the soldiers  expanded the camp area further by taking over the Andriesz factory and  the Thamby Walavu Coconut grove. The water problem faced by the Army was  solved.

The H-hour struck. The water bowser was substituted, and then filled with water at Kaithady, but the Tigers found to their dismay that in spite of their elaborate preparations, they had neglected one aspect. They had not tried filling their duplicate bowser with water, prior to the actual switching of both. When the water was filled, the outer pipes of the explosive laden bowser began leaking

### Tax files for everyone impractical to be done- Champika Ranawaka

*2024-02-09 23:55:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Tax-files-for-everyone-impractical-to-be-done-Champika-Ranawaka/108-276685) · `en`

Colombo, Feb 09 (Daily Mirror) - MP Patali Champika Ranawaka, leader of the United Republic Front underscores the impracticality of preparing tax files for every citizen of Sri Lanka.

He highlights the considerable time and manpower required, indicating that it takes approximately half an hour to process a single tax file while considering all requisite criteria.

With only nine officers tasked with this responsibility, the daily processing capacity is limited to 144 files, making the processing of millions of files a daunting and time-consuming endeavour.

He  contends that prioritising the collection of unpaid taxes from the 1272 defaulters identified by the Inland Revenue Department should take precedence over opening new tax files for every individual. However, he criticises the lack of action taken by the current government in this regard, resulting in an undue burden on the populace and the adoption of impractical measures.

### Pathum Nissanka runs riot; becomes first Sri Lankan to slam ODI double ton

*2024-02-09 23:51:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Pathum-Nissanka-runs-riot-becomes-first-Sri-Lankan-to-slam-ODI-double-ton/108-276712) · `en`

Feb. 9 (Daily Mirror) - An inevitable win for Sri Lanka was only delayed by Afghanistan’s sixth wicket pair, Mohammad Nabi and Azmatullah Omarzi, who both cracked tons and shared a 242-run stand, as it turned out to be insufficient and too late.

Afghanistan, in their massive run chase of 382 runs, put themselves in deep trouble as they lost their top five wickets with just 55 on the scoreboard and ended up with a score of 339 for 6 to give Sri Lanka a win by 42 runs in the first of the three-match ODI series played at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium today and take a 1-0 lead.

Earlier in the day, Pathum Nissanka was on fire whilst running riot as he sent the Afghanistan bowlers on a leather hunt by slamming an unbeaten knock of 210 runs in only 139 balls, which included 20 boundaries and eight towering sixes, to become the first Sri Lanka batsman to slam an ODI double ton to help Sri Lanka, invited to take first lease of the wicket, to end with a formidable score of 381 for 3.

### The depravity of Sri Lanka’s elite establishment

For the Government’s supporters, the evidence of “recovery” amounts simply to citing the absence of long queues for fuel and sky-high inflation

According to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Government he leads and his supporters, Sri Lanka has recovered from severe economic crisis. In reality, however, this “recovery” is a deepening of the economic crisis which is embedding extreme, near irreversible levels of deprivation and inequality in Sri Lankan society. This article interrogates Sri Lanka’s elite establishment, which is cheering on the Government, and its responsibility for the unfolding societal catastrophe.

### Israeli PM orders military plan to evacuate Rafah and defeat Hamas

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Israel’s military on Friday to draw up a dual plan to evacuate Palestinian civilians from the crowded southern Gazan city of Rafah and to defeat the last Hamas fighters there.

His office announced the move as pressure mounted on Israel over its threat to launch a ground assault on Rafah, the last refuge for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are trapped in the city after fleeing fighting elsewhere.

U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday Israel’s response to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas militants was “over the top” and Washington said it would not support any military operation mounted in Rafah without due consideration for civilians.

Aid groups said there would be a high Palestinian death toll if Israeli forces stormed Rafah, and warned of the growing humanitarian crisis in the city, on the coastal enclave’s border with Egypt.

### Ceasefire: Reading the ICJ Order regarding genocide in Gaza

A particular question pertains to why the ICJ has not indicated a specific provisional measure ordering Israel to cease fire

With regard to the Order delivered by the International Court of Justice indicating Provisional Measures against Israel in the case brought by South Africa under the provisions of the UN Genocide Convention, questions galore on different aspects addressed. A particular question pertains to why the ICJ has not indicated a specific provisional measure ordering Israel to “cease fire”.

It is important to refer to Article 51 of the UN Charter for guidance in this context.

“Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”

President Ranil Wickremesinghe says the Indian Ocean Region’s stability requires an early end to the Gaza war followed by the establishment within 5 years of an Independent Palestine State and a guarantee for the security of the state of Israel.

He made this remark while delivering the keynote address at the 7th Indian Ocean Conference in Perth, Australia on Friday (Feb.09).

Wickremesinghe hit out at the United States for supporting the war in the densely populated Palestinian enclave. “The ill-advised judgment of the US in supporting the Gaza war will diminish its influence in the [Indian Ocean] region.”

Commenting further, the President emphasized that the hostility of the countries forming the Islamic Arch in the Indian Ocean will prevent any close rapprochement with the US for some time.

With COP29 only ten months away, climate finance is among the key topics for climate negotiations in 2024

The 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) concluded at the end of 2023 with several important outcomes. On the one hand, it created a dedicated fund for loss and damage, wrapped up the first-ever Global Stocktake, and established a framework for the Global Goal on Adaptation that would serve to scale up and focus adaptation ambition. On the other hand, there is still a considerable amount of work to be done for operationalising the loss and damage fund and the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA), and several agenda items only resulted in procedural decisions and will be carried forward.

### Current economic crisis is political and can only be solved through political change

President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s statement in Parliament on Wednesday that “resolution of the economic crisis lies not in a political but economic and scientific solutions” is incorrect.

We need to categorically state that the economic crisis has a well-defined identifiable disproportionately large political component.

Incompetent corrupt democratically elected politicians taking unscientific and economically incorrect political decisions to meet their short and long term political goals which were justified and sustained by a cohort of absolutely incompetent cohorts of ‘yes sir’ spineless Government officials who were political appointees.

As such the solution to the current economic crisis is bringing about an immediate change in the mode and style of governance and government by politicians and bureaucrats through a process of elections where the people decide their political and economic future.

The stock market was initially sluggish yesterday but latterly picked up with buying interest proving notable in JKH stocks. This resulted in moving other stocks as well, market analysts said.

Amid those developments both indices moved upwards. The All Share Price Index went up by 26.6 points, while S and P SL20 rose by 10.4 points. Turnover stood at Rs 972 million with one crossing. The crossing was reported in JKH, which crossed 300,000 shares to the tune of Rs 55.6 million; its shares traded at Rs 185.25.

As much as we are living, so also will we die. Much is said (and written) about the “cost of living,” and rarely do we refer to the “cost of dying”. Such is considered morbid, inappropriate, insensitive, or less than genteel, or even vulgar. A mention in a recent news item, (The Daily Mirror of 7th February) under the enticing title “Death becomes costly affair for Colombo dwellers,” emboldens me to wade into taboo territory. The item states that the cost of a grave site costs a formidable Rs. 180,000/=, and Crematorium charges at a nearly unaffordable Rs. 10,000/=, (up from 1,000/=). The former on account of escalated Land Values (and the latter perhaps due to escalating prices of gas?)
