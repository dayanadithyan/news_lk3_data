I would like to make the following comments based on your Editorial.

I am in total agreement of your last sentence where you prophetically warn of the dangers of ageism.

I had made a comment two years ago (attached herewith) on similar lines.

In this comment I specifically focused on ‚Äòold‚Äô politicians (not by age but by duration of involvement in politics) and their continued adherence to ‚Äòold‚Äô political ideas (once again not due to age but due to outdated political economic and other ideas and not changing them to benefit the citizens of Sri Lanka).

### Political parties good for democracy; but not cults, fiefdoms and extremists

*2024-03-18 23:15:47* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Political-parties-good-for-democracy-but-not-cults-fiefdoms-and-extremists/4-759636) ¬∑ `en`

Although there is growing public disillusionment with party politics in a democracy and a renewed cry for a different system of governance, the majority support for party politics remains

Whilst there has been no grave damage to Sri Lanka‚Äôs democracy, to date, because of the activities of political parties, there are tell-tale signs of the emergence of cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men who are using party power in testing the limits of the Constitution. The voting citizens must be wary of such moves. Dissociation from cults of personality and fiefdoms is a must. Political parties are essential institutions of democracy

The heading in the Daily Mirror of 18 March 2024, ‚ÄúPublic Trust in Parliament and Political Parties Reaches All Time Low‚Äù, begs the question of the appropriateness, and efficacy, of political parties in democratic Sri Lanka. Further, the lack of consensus among political parties in most matters heightens these concerns.

### Three ways boards can drive data centricity

How do data-centric enterprises set themselves apart from their peers?

Boards can help companies accelerate the shift toward the next generation of data and analytics for a competitive advantage

Organisations are entering a new frontier of data and analytics, which will drive pivotal decisions, processes and interactions. Unsurprisingly, more than half (57%) of Asia-Pacific senior executives in the 2022 biannual EY study, Tech Horizon, identified data and analytics as their top investment priority in the next two years, up from 31% in 2020. What‚Äôs more, tech-enabled transformations in the region that exceed expectations are predicted to yield an average annual revenue growth of 6.2%, compared with 5.4% for transformations that fall short of expectations.

### Mitigating climate-related sovereign risk to accelerate action on the climate emergency

*2024-03-18 22:56:27* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Mitigating-climate-related-sovereign-risk-to-accelerate-action-on-the-climate-emergency/14-759632) ¬∑ `en`

https://www.asiapathways-adbi.org: Climate change poses a serious threat to the development of countries and can have material impacts on sovereign risk. Sovereign risk refers to the probability that a country may not be able to pay its debts. However, since the global financial crisis, interactions between fiscal balances, public and private debt, and the financial sector have proven to be very complex. Sovereign risk reflects this complexity.

For example, the devastating floods in Pakistan in 2022 were caused by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains and faster melting of glaciers. They killed more than 1,700 people, left half a million homeless, and cost around $30 billion. The events led to Moody‚Äôs revising downward Pakistan‚Äôs sovereign credit rating by one notch, citing amplified liquidity and debt sustainability risks alongside falling foreign exchange reserves.

### Trump unable to get $464m bond in New York fraud case, his lawyers say

New York, March 18 (BBC) - Donald Trump's lawyers have said finding a bond to cover the $464m (¬£365m) judgement in his New York fraud case is a "practical impossibility".

A judge ordered Mr Trump to pay the penalty in February for falsely inflating the value of his assets.

Mr Trump offered to post a smaller bond of $100m while he appeals, but that request was denied.

In a filing on Monday, his lawyers said they had approached 30 companies to back the bond without success.

"The amount of the judgement, with interest, exceeds $464m, and very few bonding companies will consider a bond of anything approaching that magnitude," his lawyers wrote in the nearly 5,000-page filing.

They are asking a judge to put the judgement on pause while Mr Trump appeals against the decision.

"The practical impossibility of obtaining a bond interferes with defendants' right to appeal," his lawyers said.

Mr Trump's two eldest sons also must pay millions of dollars in the case.

Gunmen in Nigeria have kidnapped at least 87 people, including women and children in Kaduna state, residents and police said on Monday, in a fresh attack after an armed gang seized 286 students and staff from a school in early March.

Kidnappings by criminal gangs demanding ransom payments have become an almost daily occurrence in Nigeria, especially in the north, with authorities seemingly powerless to stop them.

Kaduna police spokesperson Mansur Hassan confirmed the incident in Kajuru Station village on Sunday night but could not give a figure of those missing. He said security agents had been deployed to try to rescue the villagers.

Tanko Wada Sarkin, a village head, said 87 people were taken.

‚ÄúWe have so far recorded the return of five people back home who fled through the bush. This attack makes it five times that these bandits are attacking this community,‚Äù he told Reuters by phone.

If the temperature of the environment reaches body temperature, it will increase the image and reduce the supply of oxygen to the brain, causing the heat trauma, fainting and death, said the Seemati Rijway Hospital (LRH) consultant child health physician Vaidyar Deepal Perera said.

He said the normal body temperature of a person can be 37.5 ¬∞ C (98.6 ¬∞ F).When the temperature of the environment reaches 37 ¬∞ C, increased sweating is equal to human body temperature, resulting in increased sweating, resulting in excess water and minerals from the body, so some complications can occur.

Therefore, drink too much water to keep the body temperature balanced, drink more natural drinks, and should not allow children to play during the daytime with high temperatures.

He also urged to drink natural drinks and add a little salt to maintain the amount of sodium in the body.

Due to high temperatures, special attention should be paid to children to the elderly.

### Paediatrician warns of risks from matching environment-body temperatures

*2024-03-18 18:26:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Paediatrician-warns-of-risks-from-matching-environment-body-temperatures/108-279079) ¬∑ `en`

Colombo, March 18 (Daily Mirror) - If the environmental temperature reaches body temperature, it can cause an increase in palpitations and decrease oxygen supply to the brain, thus leading to heat shocks, fainting and potential death, Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) Consultant Paediatrician Dr. Deepal Perera said.

He said the normal body temperature of a person is 37.5¬∞C (98.6¬∞F). When the environmental temperature reaches 37¬∞C, equivalent to human body temperature, increased sweating occurs, resulting in the loss of more water and minerals from the body through perspiration and hence certain complexities can occur.

Therefore, we should drink more water and drink more natural beverages to keep the body temperature in balance, and children should not be allowed to play during the day with a high temperature.

They also requested that people to drink natural beverages, adding some salt to maintain the sodium level in their bodies.

But Rishad dispatched the first ball he faced over midwicket for six and did not look back.

The increasing incidence of dengue in India and Sri Lanka is not just a significant health concern but also exacts a hefty economic toll on these South Asian countries, say experts who estimate the annual losses to be in billions.

Researchers highlight the dire economic consequences of this affliction caused by a virus spread through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito species, reinforcing the benefits that the region would realise if the neglected tropical disease was substantially controlled.

As the sweltering heat swept across Colombo in June, Seetha, a 60-year-old daily wager found herself in the grips of dengue hemorrhagic fever, a severe and sometimes fatal form of the disease.

‚ÄúI had a fever, body aches, and a relentless headache for four days before being admitted to the hospital. I was catheterised and not even allowed to go to the toilet,‚Äù she told PTI.
