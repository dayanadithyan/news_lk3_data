### Complaint filed against SIS over COVID-19 forced cremations

*2024-07-01 04:53:27* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Complaint-filed-against-SIS-over-COVID-19-forced-cremations/56-763671) · `en`

Activist Chirantha Amerasinghe filed a complaint against the State Intelligence Service (SIS) over the controversial forced cremations of COVID-19 dead. Amerasinghe and several others filed the complaint at the Sri Lanka Police Headquarters on Saturday.

Speaking to the media, Amerasinghe said the mandatory cremation policy was imposed to target the Muslim community in an attempt to oppress them.

He noted that while the Easter Sunday attack mastermind Zahran Hashim at one point could not find followers for his cause, the various attacks against the Muslim community helped him recruit over 35 members at the time.

Amerasinghe claimed that the SIS had informed the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) that COVID-19 could spread through water contamination. Based on this SIS information, he said he was detained by the police in 2020 after he posted on social media that there was no evidence of negative impacts from burying COVID-19 victims.

In a press release, ADIC noted that while the ministries assert that their primary aim is to achieve economic benefits through cannabis exports, thereby enhancing Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange reserves, a comprehensive review by ADIC of financial records from leading cannabis firms worldwide suggests otherwise.

Despite initial criticism and social media roasts for leading Mumbai Indians to defeat themselves in the IPL, Hardik Pandya's exceptional performance in the T20 World Cup, including crucial contributions in both batting and bowling, has positioned him as a strong candidate for India's cricket captaincy.

His strategic decisions, such as bowling the final over effectively in key matches, have showcased his capabilities beyond just being a player. Despite the challenges and criticism, Pandya remains focused on proving himself through his actions, indicating a promising future as India's cricket captain.

🟩

Fans have roasted him on social media that Mumbai Indians defeat Mumbai Indians in the IPL.. But in the second twenty -twenty -two World Series, his best batting bowling is now the reason for the Indian team to win the bowl.

### Land Right to Workers: Who is the obstacle?

*2024-07-01 03:42:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187346) · `ta`

The obstacle to granting land rights to workers includes internal government delays, opposition from companies owning plantation lands, and lack of political pressure. Despite Cabinet approval, policy preparation and company consent delay implementation. Political alliances and promises unfulfilled contribute to the complexity.

🟩

There are no political pressures to grant land rights to workers. Reports suggest that other parties, including the PA, should not implement this to Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena.. This is one of the reasons why the Ceylon Workers Congress broke the alliance with Mahinda Rajapaksa.

The government is being successfully implemented by the government's permanent land providing scheme.. President Ranil Wickremesinghe goes to the country and gives land to the people who have been enrolled under the scheme.. But under his leadership, the plantation workers submitted by three ministers in the Cabinet are allowed to grant land rights.

Despite the approval of the Cabinet, the plan to provide land rights to the plantation people is not immediately implemented because it takes time to prepare a policy plan document.. Although the document is currently being prepared, the companies and some political parties have expressed their opposition to the project.

### Veteran Sri Lankan Tamil Political  leader   Rajavarothayam Sampanthan passes away in Colombo at the age of 91. He  dedicated his political life to pursuing a just solution to Sri Lanka’s Tamil question

*2024-06-30 19:41:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84303) · `en`

Veteran Sri Lankan Tamil leader Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, who dedicated his political life to pursuing a just solution to the island nation’s Tamil question, passed away in Colombo late on Sunday. He was 91.

Mr. Sampanthan, of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), was a sitting MP from the eastern Trincomalee district, and led the Tamil National Alliance,

the main grouping representing Tamils of Sri Lanka’s war-hit north and east. He was Leader of the Opposition between 2015 and 2018.

A parliamentarian for nearly half a century, Mr. Sampanthan was a bold and relentless voice in the House. Since the end of the civil war in 2009, he tirelessly demanded equal rights for Tamils, within a ‘united, undivided, indivisible’ country.

Trained as a lawyer, he based his arguments for a political solution on Sri Lanka’s constitutional history and the many promises that the southern Sinhalese establishment made in the past but failed to keep.

### Can A Country Swamped By Mythological Beliefs Prosper?

*2024-06-30 18:20:30* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/can-a-country-swamped-by-mythological-beliefs-prosper/) · `en`

Mythological practices are prevalent in many religions worldwide, ranging from visiting places of religious significance to ringing bells dangling on the testicles of a sage. This piece is not to entirely reject these practices, as some rituals have become traditions, but to highlight the absurd levels of indulgence in Sri Lanka, primarily driven by a segment of Buddhist monks.

Almost every family adheres to traditions such as consulting horoscope readers and waiting for auspicious times for significant events. Indigenous chanting and dancing, like Bali Thovil, are commonly accepted customs. However, there is an over-dependence on newly found practices and beliefs, where authorities need to act before these characters turn the youth into blind followers.

### Is The News Really Good?

*2024-06-30 18:06:46* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/is-the-news-really-good/) · `en`

When a bankrupt country receives good news, it raises great expectations in the hearts of its people. Last week, the government gave extensive publicity to this so-called good news. Consequently, various opposition groups were very concerned about this trend. Some were worried if this was genuinely good news, while others were anxious to learn more details about it. Nevertheless, at first glance, being able to restructure bilateral debts and officially come out of bankruptcy should be good news for the people of a bankrupt country. This is particularly true for those who have suffered in long queues for oil and gas, and for the business community that had to stop operations due to the inability to open letters of credit. However, it seemed that this news was not very favorable for political groups hoping to seize state power in the near future.
