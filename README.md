### Crucial Red Sea data cables cut, telecoms firm says

March 6 (BBC) - Several undersea communications cables in the Red Sea have been cut, affecting 25% of data traffic flowing between Asia and Europe, a telecoms company and a US official say.

Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications said it had taken measures to reroute traffic after four of the 15 cables were recently severed.

The US official said it was trying to find out whether the cables were cut deliberately or snagged by an anchor.

Last month, Yemen's internationally-recognised government warned that the Iran-backed Houthi movement might sabotage the undersea cables in addition to attacking ships in the sea.

The Houthis - who control much of western Yemen's Red Sea coast - denied last week that they had targeted cables and blamed US and British military strikes for any damage to them.

US and British forces have targeted Houthi weapons and infrastructure in response to the drone and missile attacks on merchant vessels passing through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

### Honouring the Unsung Heroes of Sri Lanka on International Women’s Day

As we celebrate International Women’s Day, it prompts us to wonder, what does it truly mean to be a woman? In a world marked by increasing competitiveness and relentless pace, women often find themselves questioning their place and value. Today, as we honour the spirit of womanhood, it is imperative to recognise the enduring legacy of women and address the scarcity of female role models to inspire the next generation.

Being a woman is a profound journey, marked by the diverse roles of daughter, wife, mother, educator, career woman and a caregiver to her family. From the moment a child is cradled protectively in her womb, she begins a journey of nurturing and guidance that extends far beyond birth. A mother’s love envelops her child, shaping their perceptions and experiences as they navigate the world.

Hooray and congratulations! Our national cricket team won a full series of matches. It was against Afghanistan, but no matter, at last we have won a whole series. It was refreshing to see our team win. The huge crowd at the third T-20 match, vouched for the regeneration of interest among the fans of the game in the country.

While we won all of the test matches, it was the absence of spectators which was prominent. Despite the fact entrance to the games were free, a sparse crowd attended the matches.

During an earlier era we were enthralled when we beat teams like India, Pakistan and Australia. In those days beating even England was no big deal.

But times have changed. At the Dambulla Cricket Stadium where the last T-20 match between Afghanistan and our national team took place, we witnessed a sad change for the worse in the spirit the game was played.

If dignity was what the retired general was after, higher pensions/benefits to lower rank retirees would have served better (especially the disabled/seriously injured)

Had Sri Lanka used a part of her massive defence budget to provide an honourable and viable way out for her soldiers post-war, the twin problems of high desertions and criminalisation of deserters could have been minimised. 10 years on, no political leader is interested in acknowledging the issue let alone addressing it
