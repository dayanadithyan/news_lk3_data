The Supreme Court has instructed the Attorney General to submit a report pertaining to the progress of investigations into Pastor Jerome Fernando, the self-styled ‘prophet’ who came under fire over his controversial comments on other religions.

This order was issued when a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed against Pastor Jerome Fernando was taken up before a three-member Supreme Court judge bench led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya today (13).

Several religious leaders had filed this petition seeking an order to prosecute Pastor Jerome Fernando under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) over his derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures.

Pastor Fernando found himself in hot water after a video of one of his sermons went viral on social media, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures.

EXCONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka might consider look into water price reduction due to lower cost of energy after sharp appreciation in the rupee, Minister of Water Supply Jeevan Thondaman said.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government has been implementing IMF-led pricing policies on utilities and the Water Supply Ministry has already come up with a formula.

However, the formula developed with the help of the Asian Development Bank, has yet to be implemented.

The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS & DB) increased the water tariff sharply in August 2023, claiming that the operating cost had been increased owing to high interest payment for bank loans and increased electricity prices.

“The biggest cost that we had was the energy cost. That is the cost we have been working on with and just to be transparent, according to the current formula, there was a 14% increase three months ago in the price of water,” Thondaman told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo.

Sydney (AFP) - New Zealand captain Sam Cane will retire from Test rugby at the end of 2024, the side said Monday, calling time on a World Cup winning 12-year international career.

"Having played 95 Tests - 27 as captain - the 32-year-old has decided to focus on spending more time with family and sign a long-term contract with Suntory Goliath in Tokyo," New Zealand Rugby said in a statement.

The All Blacks haven't played since they were defeated in the Rugby World Cup final by South Africa last year and Cane was already on a sabbatical in Japan.

Cane said the prospect of a three-year deal with the high-spending Tokyo club was too good to pass up.

"I had to weigh up everything and, in the end, with a young family, it seemed like the best decision to help set up our future," he said.

"It was a very hard one because I love the teams that I represent here in New Zealand."

### Indonesia flood death toll rises to 41 with 17 missing

The number of people killed by flash floods and cold lava flow from a volcano in western Indonesia over the weekend has risen to 41 with 17 more missing, a local disaster agency official told AFP Monday.

Hours of heavy rain caused large volcanic rocks to roll down one of Indonesia’s most active volcanos into two districts on Sumatra island Saturday evening, while flooding inundated roads, homes and mosques.

“Data as of last night, we recorded 37 dead victims... But from this morning it has grown again, the figure reached 41 (dead),” Ilham Wahab, West Sumatra disaster mitigation agency official, told AFP.

Rescuers were searching for 17 still missing, three in Agam district and 14 in Tanah Datar, both the worst-hit areas of the flood and home to hundreds of thousands of people, he said.

Ilham could not confirm the number of locals evacuated because officials had encouraged “people to evacuate to relatives’ places, which are safer” than tent shelters in heavy rains.

The government is considering lifting this ban, which could benefit MPs once implemented.
