The Minister clarified that non-cooperative companies would face lease agreement non-renewal and highlighted that some companies agreed to pay the increased salary along with arrears.

Sri Lanka will wrap up talks with international bondholders on its restructuring process in a few weeks, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said on Tuesday, a major step for the island nation to emerge from its worst financial crisis in decades.

Sri Lanka will also seek to balance its ties with giant neighbour India and China to ensure that there is no difference in dealing with the two, he said, as the rival Asian giants are key creditors and investors but are also jostling for geopolitical influence in the small Indian Ocean country.

тАЬHopefully within a couple of weeks,тАЭ Sabry said in an interview at the Reuters NEXT conference in Singapore, when asked when the nationтАЩs bond restructuring efforts with creditors will be finished.

тАЬTowards the end of this month, officially, we are done and dusted with the restructuring process, then of course, in line with that, we need to start payment,тАЭ he said.
