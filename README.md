Together with allied parties the BJP led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) obtained 293 seats in Parliament.

The election results have been continuously analysed and commented upon from the time of the poll. A significant aspect of these analyses and commentaries is the ‚Äúcaste factor‚Äù.

It is an acknowledged fact in India that caste plays a very influential role in determining the outcome of elections in many electorates, regions or states.

In the lead up to Presidential elections, the three leading political camps‚Äîthe President Ranil Wickremesinghe-led Government, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), and the National People‚Äôs Power (NPP)‚Äîappear to converge on two key issues, namely, an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led path to economic recovery, and the continuity of the Provincial Councils (PC) system.

On the economic front, the current IMF program is now backed, to varying degrees, by all three camps. The SJB and the NPP, from the Opposition, argue that they would negotiate the Government‚Äôs IMF deal to more favourable terms that especially benefit the more vulnerable, poorer sections of society. This indicates one side of the policy convergence that ‚Äòthere is no alternative‚Äô to the IMF.

### Harshana Rajakaruna can only be accepted if international companies declare that the country has recovered from the bank -

*2024-06-25 16:28:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186951) ¬∑ `ta`

Harshana Rajakaruna argues that without international acknowledgment of Sri Lanka's recovery from bankruptcy, any acceptance of this status by the government or its ministers is deceptive. He criticizes the current government's limited efforts in foreign debt restructuring and questions the credibility of claims about the nation's financial recovery. Rajakaruna emphasizes the importance of transparency and adherence to international standards in declaring such significant economic milestones.

üü©

If the country has recovered from the bankruptcy, international standards must be notified of the announcement.

Without doing so, the president or no other ministers cannot accept the announcement. United People's Shakti Gampaha District Parliamentarian Harshana Rajakaruna said this is a move to deceive the people.

Foreign debt restructuring is very important to recover from that state of affairs.

But the government has so far gone into a very narrow amount of debt renovation in foreign debt restructuring.

Based on this, the government is trying to release the report that the country is currently recovering from bankruptcy.

When many bankrupt countries recover from bankruptcy, the debt reorganization is very successful. But such a situation did not include the Ranil Wickremesinghe -led government.

How can the country recover from bankruptcy. We also wish to recover from the bankruptcy. We will be happy if such a situation happens. But it is not possible to take action to deceive people.
