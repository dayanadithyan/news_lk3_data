### Trade Ministry to issue price range to curb middlemen profits

Colombo, April 9 (daily Mirror) - The Trade, Commerce, and Food Security Ministry is to issue price ranges on essential items to curb excessive profits by middlemen in the retail market.

After a meeting held at the ministry, Minister Nalin Fernando said that the increase in commodity prices was a result of the economic crisis and inflation.

In 2022, Sri Lanka faced the challenge of being one of the countries with the highest commodity prices globally, primarily due to soaring inflation.

"In 2019, a kilogram of wheat flour was priced at Rs. 85. By 2022, this price had escalated to Rs. 485, leading to a loaf of bread being sold for approximately Rs. 195 to Rs. 200.

Similarly, in 2019, a kilogram of dhal was sold for around Rs. 120. By 2022, this price had surged to Rs. 585 but has since dropped to Rs. 295," the minister said.

The depreciation of the dollar exchange rate, which initially contributed to the rise in commodity prices, has now stabilized.

### Years' Quit: When did the skilled setting and celebration tradition begin?

*2024-04-09 05:56:16* ¬∑ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c0den0jljjyo) ¬∑ `si`

The skilled setting and celebration tradition began with the Sinhala Tamil New Year, celebrated on April 12-13, based on astrological predictions. This tradition, unique to a small island, marks the beginning of the solar year, contrasting with the global celebration of New Year's Day. The tradition's origins date back to the Kotte era, with the current solar-centric celebration not present in ancient kingdoms like Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Dambadeniya. The celebration includes auspicious rituals, such as planting auspicious shoots and writing the auspicious year, which have evolved over time.

### National Education Policy

*2024-04-09 02:49:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180772) ¬∑ `ta`

The Jaffna University Teachers Union opposes the National Education Policy Framework (NEPF 2023-2033), arguing it threatens Sri Lanka's long-term free education tradition by prioritizing profit over education quality and welfare. NEPF aims to transform education into a profit-making business, abolishing state education and the University Grants Commission (UGC), and introducing university fees. It also focuses on economics and digital education, ignoring broader educational goals like literacy and critical thinking. The union calls for the withdrawal of these reforms and prioritizes the interests of the people over market forces.

üü©

The Jaffna University Teachers Union alleges that the National Education Policy Framework (NEPF) is a significant threat to the tradition of long -term free education in Sri Lanka.

As a Federation of University Teachers' Association (FUTA), we strongly oppose the proposed National Education Policy Framework (NEPF 2023-2033), which is a significant threat to our country's long-term free education heritage.

The NEPF program transforms the education system into a profit -making business by highlighting the government's responsibility in education, the abolition of state education, and the abolition of the University Grants Commission (UGC).

These reforms prior the profit rather than the quality of education and the welfare of students and educators. By introducing tariffs at the university level and withdrawing state funds for higher education, the NEPF undermines the equal access policy for education centered on Sri Lanka's social structure after independence.
