Central bank officials must have a wider understanding than the economy.Their education must include social science, such as human behavior to understand the social impacts of sociology, peace and conflict studies and the social impacts of their decisions.

The current decision -making process is the risk of maintaining social unrest due to lack of this broader understanding.This recent incident, which was brought to light through social media, illustrates this.

### France becomes only country to explicitly guarantee abortion as constitutional right

*2024-03-05 09:04:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97734/france-becomes-only-country-to-explicitly-guarantee-abortion-as-constitutional-right) · `en`

French lawmakers on Monday overwhelmingly approved a bill to enshrine abortion rights in France’s constitution, making it the only country to explicitly guarantee a woman’s right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy.

The historic move was proposed by President Emmanuel Macron as a way to prevent the kind of rollback of abortion rights seen in the United States in recent years, and the vote during a special joint session of France’s parliament drew a long-standing ovation among lawmakers.

The measure was approved in a 780-72 vote in the Palace of Versailles. Abortion enjoys wide support in France across most of the political spectrum, and has been legal since 1975.

Many female legislators in the hall smiled broadly as they cheered. While a small group of protesters stood outside the joint session, there were jubilant scenes of celebrations all over France as women’s rights activists hailed the measure promised by Macron within hours of the Dobbs ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022.

While this process could take some time, he was confident that the bondholders, based on the recommendations of their advisors, would soon come onboard to reach an AIP with the government, possibly within the second review of the IMF programme.

### Gaza war, Red Sea crisis and sea of issues for merchants

Since the Houthis insist that they will not cease attacking ships in the Red Sea unless a ceasefire is enforced in Gaza, the Red Sea crisis will end only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza.

The Red Sea crisis, which is having a great impact on international trade, is unlikely to end anytime soon despite the US-led naval and air forces’ hitting Houthi targets in Yemen.

Since the Houthis insist that they will not cease attacking ships in the Red Sea unless a ceasefire is enforced in Gaza, the Red Sea crisis will end only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza. And that appears to be a far cry.

Neither the Israelis nor Hamas is willing to give in. Israel will not stop its brutal offensive until Hamas releases the 100 hostages it still holds, and Hamas will not release them so long as there is no ceasefire in Gaza.

We have successfully established bala mandalas in Kegalle and Ratnapura

Myself, MPs Hector Appuhamy and Nisroshan Perera were lobbying for justice for the Easter Sunday bomb victims

The Catholic vote had gone in favour of the UNP in the past. however SJB had captured a great portion of these votes in 2020

The Government promised to bring in Scotland Yard and carry out an international probe, but it has not kept its promise

It has reached a state where MPs in the Samagi Jana Balawgaya (SJB) have begun to admit that there are divisions within the party. One of the MPs who accept that there are disputes in the party is MP for Gampaha District Dr. Kavinda Jayawardhana. In an interview with Daily Mirror, the MP called for unity within the party. He stated that unity is of paramount importance when facing challenges posed by other parties during upcoming elections.

### Public sector lethargy and employee rights

In January 2016, in a rare show of accountability, the General Secretary of the Government and Provincial Council Public Service Trade Union Federation, Ajith. K. Thilakarathne had taken up an issue of time squandered by public sector employees with the then President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. No trade union leader had dared before to complain against his own members.

In a letter addressed to both the leaders, Thilakarathne had pointed out that 60 percent of the 1.5 million public servants (both under the central government and provincial councils) were engaged in browsing the Internet, Face Book and other entertainment sites using the office computers and their own smart phones for over two hours of their daily eight-hour duty.

Also in attendance, to provide the right music for such an occasion, will be Esric Jackson with the band No Limit.

Esric, known as the Country King, is hugely popular in Melbourne and the Sri Lankans, over there, love his singing…and his style.

This is Mirage’s final gig, in Australia, and they are scheduled to head for Colombo early next week.

### Curiosity never killed the cat in a culture of ‘question’ and ‘challenge’

Exemplary, and effective leadership is grounded, amongst others, in an insatiable desire to do things differently

Whilst acknowledging the importance of policies, procedures, and processes in maintaining discipline and order in an organisation, I also believe that it must have, parallelly, a deliberately structured platform, vehicle, or mechanism to arouse the curiosity, harness new ideas and ignite the innovation DNA of its leaders and employees. A haven for those individuals who, routinely, question existing norms and push for incremental improvement and innovative solutions. History shows that organisations have benefitted from these challengers

We have all had the experience of a dreary boss who, with his/her stifling, and controlling behaviour, routinely shot down our, and our team’s, progressive ideas in an environment where all that mattered to the boss was to get the job done by the stipulated timeline and in line with the prevailing rules and procedure.

During the event, a number of experts from Pharmaceris shared their knowledge, expertise and treatment methodologies available in Sri Lanka for the treatment of Alopecia. Alopecia, commonly known as loss of hair, is a growing issue among middle-aged and older Sri Lankans. Research has shown that loss of hair has a negative impact on a person’s mental and emotional health as they may struggle with feelings of unattractiveness and be self conscious in social situations or avoid them altogether. It could cause issues of self esteem and may even lead to depression at times, thereby greatly disrupting the individual’s way of life.

### Policymakers and academics have long rejected the quantity theory of money

*2024-03-04 23:04:42* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Policymakers-and-academics-have-long-rejected-the-quantity-theory-of-money/4-759152) · `en`

Many modern quantity theorists accept that central banks do not target and control the cash base, but rather set interest rates leaving the market to determine the quantity of cash put into the system. They argue, however, that in setting interest rates central banks can, and do, target the money stock with a view to controlling inflation. Critics of the modern quantity theory of money have long argued that the money stock depends on loans, i.e., when a commercial bank makes a loan they debit the account of the entity they are lending to, and when commercial banks need cash to meet reserve requirements the central bank has to accommodate this demand

The modern quantity theory of money is basically an explanation of inflation (and the external balance) by an increase in the quantity of money held by the public, the ‘money stock’ that is due to an increase in the cash injected into the system by the central bank of a country (an increase in the ‘cash base’ of the system).

Reforms lack the necessary legitimacy to garner widespread support and effectively address the challenges at hand

When unveiling the tax reform leakages and systematic issues, it is evident that the journey towards meaningful tax reform is far from over. When leakages and systematic issues persist within a taxation system, the legitimacy of any proposed reforms becomes questionable. Such deficiencies undermine the fundamental principles of fairness, transparency, and equity that should underscore any tax system. When taxpayers witness leakages and systematic flaws, they lose faith in the system’s ability to uphold their interests fairly

Sylhet, Mar. 4 (AFP) - Dasun Shanaka held his nerve under pressure to take two wickets in the final over, snatching a dramatic three-run win for Sri Lanka in the opening Twenty20 international of a three-match series against Bangladesh in Sylhet on Monday.

Set a target of 207 runs, lower middle-order batsman Jaker Ali took Bangladesh close with his maiden fifty before Shanaka ended his 34-ball innings of 68 with the third ball of the last over.

Shoriful Islam hit a four from the next ball, leaving Bangladesh requiring six from their last two balls.

But the hosts could manage only two runs to be restricted to 203-8, with Shanaka, who also dismissed Rishad Hossain in the first ball of the final over, finishing with 2-36.

Former skipper Angelo Mathews claimed 2-17 to inflict some early damage on the Bangladesh innings before veteran Mahmudullah Riyad struck 54 off 31 balls to revive the hopes of the home side.

### Trump wins Colorado ballot disqualification case at US Supreme Court

The U.S. Supreme Court handed Donald Trump a major victory on Monday, barring states from disqualifying candidates for federal office under a constitutional provision involving insurrection and reversing Colorado’s exclusion of him from its ballot.

The justices unanimously overturned a Dec. 19 decision by Colorado’s top court to kick the former president off the state’s Tuesday Republican primary ballot after finding that the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment disqualified him from again holding public office. The Colorado court had found that Trump took part in an insurrection for inciting and supporting the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.

But four of the nine justices, including the court’s three liberal members, faulted the rest of the court for announcing rules limiting how the constitutional provision may be enforced in the future.

The duo had reportedly visited a nightclub in Kollupitiya and had consumed liquor before attempting to return to their lodging on Muhandiram Road, relying on Google Maps for navigation.

During this time, officers from the Prime Minister's Security Division arrested the two individuals and handed them over to the Kollupitiya Police.

They were released on bail after being produced before court.
