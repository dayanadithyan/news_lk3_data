Responding to a question during a press conference held in Colombo this afternoon (17), the SLC CEO assured that: тАЬKusalтАЩs visa has not been rejected, but there is a process which we have to go through, and that the US Embassy in Sri Lanka is right now in touch with himтАЭ.

тАЬHopefully we should get the visa within another day or twoтАЭ, he added.

Speaking further, the CEO of SLC said: тАЬSo, I think the information which has been gone out saying that his visa has been rejected is not right. His visa is not rejected. It is in the process of issuing, but they have asked for more information related to an issue, which I think the public knows.тАЭ

The officials of the Sports MinistryтАЩs Anti-Corruption Unit stated that even though the voice sample has been recorded, the relevant report has not been received yet due to a machine used for the voice test breaking down.

PresidentтАЩs Counsel Kalinga Indatissa, who appeared on behalf of the defendant, then stated before the court that even though the voice test was carried out a year ago, his client has been treated unfairly due to the report not being received thus far.

### Lawmakers must note that stars in galaxy are dead - EDITORIAL

Sri Lanka is divided politically at present. Many years ago this country was divided in terms of race. Politics seems to be the cause of all this evil. Now we are told to prepare for a presidential election which is expected this year.

Exactly eight days ago (May 9) people of this country were reminded that two years had passed after the тАШAragalayaтАЩ (Protest) took place. Largely these protests were held in and around Colombo; some protests took place in other places outside Western province, but not with the same aggression and success. Talking about Colombo, there is a hotel put up near Galle Face, where the main protest took place. That hotel was opened on April 24 (2024) and among the invitees and special guests were individuals who the protesters wanted out of politics.

### Nakba continues amid Zionist newspeak

*2024-05-17 00:54:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Nakba-continues-amid-Zionist-newspeak/172-282771) ┬╖ `en`

Palestinian protesters take to the streets of the West Bank city of Ramallah on Wednesday to mark the 76th anniversary of the тАЬNakbaтАЭ or тАЬCatastropheтАЭ, which sparked the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in 1948. (AFP)

Nakba is indisputably a living testimony to the brutality of the beast among humans. The fact that it has been committed against victimised Palestinians for the past 76 years, again and again, is a damning indictment of the United Nations system. It is not a mere accusation to say that the United States, the United Kingdom, and their partners are as directly responsible as Israel for letting Nakba happen in 1948 and continuing it for 76 years with massacre after massacre and displacement after displacement. It is a fact.

The killing of civilians and other atrocities were widespread during the three-decade war mostly in the North and the East.

ItтАЩs rare that the Sri Lankan armed forces and police have been held accountable through domestic courts for such killings. Below are some observations and reflections on such a rare case, based on reading the case and talking to families of victims.
