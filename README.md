### An encounter with James Bond creator Ian Fleming in his newspaper days

*2024-05-18 21:50:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/an-encounter-with-james-bond-creator-ian-fleming-in-his-newspaper-days/) · `en`

Many journalists develop what may be called the grasshopper mind. In their work it is necessary to hop from one subject to another. If at the end of their lives they have little to show for their pains, they may have bitter sweet memories stored up squirrel-wise of unusual people and events.

There is of course, a certain vanity in being able to say, “Oh yes, I knew Mahatma Gandhi” or I saw Bradman making his first century at Lords.” Such a display of self-esteem may even provoke the reaction if unexpressed, “So what.” There is no reason why anyone else should be interested. But not always. If we have a hero or a favourite, we like to listen to someone who has met and talked with him.

So Browning’s – Ah, did you once see Shelley plain, And did he stop and speak to you And did he speak to you again? How strange it seems and new. I recall a sentimental journey made with a friend in search of the house near La Spezia to which Shelley’s body was brought after the drowning.

### Judges and judgments of the past

*2024-05-18 18:11:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/judges-and-judgments-of-the-past/) · `en`

(Excerpts from the speech mde by Ranjan Gooneratne at the launch of his book, Before Justice awakes: Birth of the jury in the Island of Ceylon)

To the Romans, Justice was a goddess whose symbols were ‘a throne that tempest could not shake, a pulse that passion could not stir, eyes that were blind to any feeling of favour or ill will and a sword that fell on the offender with equal certainty’.

Judges and lawyers from the nineteenth century were votaries of that goddess. They were blessed with the gift of grace, nobility of mind and intellectual humility.

In the early nineteenth century, we had Alexander Johnstone as our Chief Justice. He emancipated the slaves, introduced trial by jury to our country. Lord Grey in the House of Lords said, “His contribution to the advancement of the social and cultural life of the people of Ceylon has immortalized his name”.

In 1840, we had William Rough, a Sargent-at-Law, a classical scholar as our Chief Justice. He was the son-in-law of John Wilkes.

Adani Green Energy’s wind energy project, coming up in Sri Lanka’s northern Mannar and Pooneryn districts, has been challenged in the island’s apex court on grounds of potential environmental impact and “lack of transparency”.

The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS), one of Sri Lanka’s oldest environmental organisations set up over a century ago, on May 16 filed a Fundamental Rights petition at the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, with the aim of “protecting the unique ecosystem of Mannar Island”.

Mannar is the “southernmost point of the Central Asian Flyway used by innumerable migratory species”, while also being home to several indigenous water bird and bat species, the WNPS said, contending that Sri Lankan authorities’ decision approving the project disregarded Mannar’s “singular positioning as a biodiversity hub”.

"There are a total of 96 tamed elephants available in the country, but only 80 elephants can be taken for peraheras this season due to their physical health conditions and other issues.
