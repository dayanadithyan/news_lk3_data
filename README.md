ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì In South Asia, women face similar hurdles when breaking into the male-dominated political arena, a webinar on Empowering Voices: Exploring the Political Landscape for Women in South Asia heard.

Across the region, more often than not, women are nominated to fill a seat falling vacant by the death of a male family member, as the party leadership made up of men is confident of winning on the ‚Äòsympathy vote,‚Äô or simply to fill a quota, and not for their qualifications and capabilities.

In Sri Lanka, despite a hard-won battle for a 25 per cent quota for women at the Local Government level six years ago, the drive to have more women at decision making levels continues. It is yet to be seen if the new electoral system at the provincial level will yield the results women seek. Representation of women in the Sri Lankan Parliament is a dismal 5.3 per cent (only 12 of the 225 MPs are women), Dr Sudharshani Fernandopulle, MP pointed out.

### Bunker demand surges in Sri Lankan ports as India grapples with supply shortages

### Polar ice is melting and changing Earth‚Äôs rotation

CNN - One day in the next couple of years, everyone in the world will lose a second of their time. Exactly when that will happen is being influenced by humans, according to a new study, as melting polar ice alters the Earth‚Äôs rotation and changes time itself.

The hours and minutes that dictate our days are determined by Earth‚Äôs rotation. But that rotation is not constant; it can change ever so slightly, depending on what‚Äôs happening on Earth‚Äôs surface and in its molten core.

These nearly imperceptible changes occasionally mean the world‚Äôs clocks need to be adjusted by a ‚Äúleap second,‚Äù which may sound tiny but can have a big impact on computing systems.

Plenty of seconds have been added over the years. But after a long trend of slowing, the Earth‚Äôs rotation is now speeding up because of changes in its core. For the first time ever, a second will need to be taken off.

### Rise in hand-foot-and-mouth disease among children

Colombo, March 29 (Daily Mirror) - Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) Consultant Pediatrician Dr. Deepal Perera said today that there is an increase in the spread of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) among schoolchildren these days.

He said this disease spreads every year, especially between March and April.

If children have symptoms like small, oval, red or white blisters on the palms and soles of the feet, as well as in the mouth, if there is a red skin rash with a brown scale on it, or if the rash appears on the outer arms, then parents should keep in mind not to send their children to schools, daycare centres or public places.

HFMD is most commonly caused by the Coxsackie virus. The main way HFMD spreads is through contact with the fluid from inside the blisters or with the droplets spread from sneezing and coughing.

The virus can also be present in bowel movements (excrement) for up to several weeks after the person has recovered.

It‚Äôs almost comedic in its simple-minded analysis of complicated issues

In the end there was no conspiracy. The book proves once more that GR is a person so na√Øve and so completely out his depth in either running a country, or writing a book. Alas, it‚Äôs the truth though he may have had success as defence secretary once upon a time. There may have been others who may or may not have conspired against him, but certainly it wasn‚Äôt a foreign power and the book he trots out to prove otherwise is the greatest testimony underlining the fact that he had to leave because of his own folly, and not due to the machinations of some sinister foreign force. Folly, to be sure, seems to be his calling card

Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa‚Äôs book titled ‚ÄúConspiracy to oust me from the presidency‚Äù does in no way live up to its title.

That statement is typical of the way Gotabaya Rajapaksa (GR) ruled the country. He seemed to be so aloof that he was constantly seen to be out of touch when in power. Added to that was his rather supercilious attitude which seemed to make him think he knew more than the rabble he ruled over.

Our purpose in this world is to choose the resurrection where we join with Christ and seek his power of thought to restore our minds to its original glory

Birth and death have no special merit except that they both re-enact and perpetuate the separation notwithstanding the entry into or the exit of the lower state of vibration. Life in the physical plane manifests as though thought has no power or causal effect. We are buffeted and bruised by everything external and the impact of them is experienced by the body where it ‚Äúperceptually‚Äù witnesses to this schema. Thus, from a state of mindfulness to a state of mindlessness, the descent which reflects the separation from God, the body becomes the hallmark of all who ‚Äúhave sinned and come short of his glory.‚Äù But the resurrection, on the other hand, is one of great importance since it restores the function of Causation to cause in the mind
