### Sumanthiran confuses the issue of common candidate - CV Wigneswaran

*2024-05-29 12:40:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184766) ┬╖ `ta`

CV Wigneswaran accuses Sumanthiran of confusing the public regarding the Tamil general candidate's initiatives in the presidential election. Sumanthiran's arrangements in Jaffna were criticized as distractions. The civil society aims for a common Tamil candidate, dismissing concerns as distractions. Wigneswaran suggests Sumanthiran isn't a Tamil nationalist and isn't involved in the common candidate issue, implying he might seek southern support for personal gain.

ЁЯЯй

The leader of the Tamil People's Alliance CV Wigneswaran has accused Sumanthiran of confusion over the ongoing initiatives of the Tamil general candidate in the presidential election.

When asked about the Tamil general candidate, MA Sumanthiran's arrangement was held in Jaffna.

I have no invitation to this meeting on the Tamil general candidate. But such concept meetings are aimed at distracting us.

The civil society has come to the conclusion that one of the Tamil people is to be a common candidate. They are continuing to talk to the people and many political parties about the next steps.

Thus, when the general position is taken and strengthened, it is a distraction to bring this issue out of the public and call it an exchange of opinion.

If someone wants to say something against this position, let us say anything. We will give the answers.

This means that if the general candidate comes up, the Tamil people will not vote, or we are ready to give the answers to any reason.

BBC - A US luxury real estate billionaire and a deep-sea explorer are planning to travel in a submersible to explore the Titanic.

The private submersible industry was rocked after five people were killed when a vessel built by OceanGate imploded en route to the Titanic last year.

A spokesman for Mr ConnorтАЩs company said on Tuesday that the proposed voyage would only take place once a vessel was fully certified by a marine organisation.

The pair plan to use a sub dubbed the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer тАУ the тАЬ4000тАЭ refers to the depth in metres to which the craft can safely be deployed.

The Titan submarine built by OceanGate was constructed of carbon fibre and was only certified to 1,300m, far short of the depths of the ocean floor where the Titanic wreck lay.

ECONMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs retail sales are picking up and private credit is expected to follow in the second half of the year if businesses begin investing for expansion, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

Though private credit is positive it is still тАШsluggishтАЩ , the central bank said.

Businesses are trying to de-leverage after a currency crisis, and also re-negotiate old loans with lower interest rates as complaints from the SME sector shows.

De-leveraging is part of a credit cycle that improves the balance sheets of business across the board and leaves them in a stronger position to expand in the future.

To expand however retail sales have to pick up. Capital investments then start as existing capacity or slack runs out and there is more confidence in the future.

тАЬWe have seen retail sales picking up in the recent past,тАЭ Governor Weerasinghe said. тАЬI think that will push up some of the SME borrowings in the coming months.тАЭ
