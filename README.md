If Mr Modi wins, he will be only the second prime minister in India to hold office for three consecutive terms. The first to do so was Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first PM.

Colombo, June 1 (Daily Mirror) - A shortage of 5,000 private buses is making it difficult to provide adequate passenger transport services, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) chairman Gemunu Wijerathne claimed.

He told the Daily Mirror that 70% of buses with valid route permits are running in the country, while the remaining buses are not operating properly.

He noted that buses with valid route permits cannot provide proper services because some are undergoing major repairs or are engaged in other services.

As a result, the existing private bus fleet has been reduced to 13,000, and even these buses sometimes do not operate properly, Wijerathne said.

"As a result, people have to pay Rs. 100 for three-wheeler fares to travel a minimum distance of one kilometre. The shortage of private buses has severely impacted the transport sector, with people suffering the most when relying on public transport," he said.

### 2024 Lok Sabha election campaigns Modi

*2024-06-01 16:20:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185045) · `ta`

In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, faced unexpected challenges and criticism. Despite initial predictions of an easy win, the BJP engaged in aggressive tactics against opponents, including disabling Congress party bank accounts and arresting two chief ministers. The Election Commission's handling of the elections, especially regarding electronic voting machines, drew controversy and accusations of bias. Modi's campaign focused heavily on his leadership, with less emphasis on Hindu-Muslim politics until late in the game, where he addressed concerns directly. The Congress party responded with a focus on caste and class issues, criticizing the BJP's alleged favoritism towards wealthy capitalists. The unpredictable nature of the campaign highlighted the complexities and potential flaws in India's electoral system, raising concerns about democracy and fairness.

🟩

The Indian Lok Sabha elections are over and the results are being released.This time the general election campaigns were held. They were completely different for what we thought.

Most people thought that winning this election was an easy task for the Bharatiya Janata Party and that Prime Minister Narendra Damodaradas would consider himself a small work ahead of his third coronation.. We thought that he would be proudly proudly proudly, ignoring the opposition parties and taking the achievements of his ten -year regime to the people.

But most of us do not have campaigns as expected. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) falsely lied to all expectations and carried out attacks against its enemies with self -esteem and behaved in a defensive style. Congress party bank accounts disabled. Two chief ministers in office were arrested and jailed. Non -Bharatiya Janata Party of India was afraid that they could be arrested in their homes.

### Earliest and most distant galaxy ever observed

(BBC) - The James Webb Space Telescope has smashed its own record for detecting the most distant known galaxy. Called JADES-GS-z14-0, the collection of stars was spied as it was a mere 290 million years after the Big Bang.

Put another way - if the Universe is 13.8 billion years old, it means we're observing the galaxy when the cosmos was only 2% of its current age.

Webb used its huge 6.5m-wide primary mirror and sensitive infrared instruments to make the discovery.

The telescope's previous record holder was a galaxy seen at 325 million years after the Big Bang.

Astronomers say the most interesting aspect of the latest observation is not so much the great distance involved - as amazing as that is - but rather the size and brightness of JADES-GS-z14-0.

### Factum Perspective: Sri Lanka's existence in India's foreign policy

*2024-06-01 12:44:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185037) · `ta`

India's engagement with Sri Lanka's National People's Power (NPP), a significant third party challenging the traditional two-party system, indicates India's strategic interest in expanding its influence in the region, particularly as a counter to China. This move comes amid concerns about Sri Lanka's domestic issues, including the treatment of the Tamil community, which has historically impacted bilateral relations. Despite geopolitical complexities, India's foreign policy has consistently prioritized maintaining a strong presence in Sri Lanka, leveraging economic cooperation and political alliances to safeguard its interests and counterbalance Chinese influence.

🟩

The latest Indian visit to Sri Lanka's Sri Lankan parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the National People's Power (NPP) party, was founded in the media in the media. There was suspicion that India would invite the leaders of other parties contesting the Sri Lankan presidential election by the end of this year.

However, on its initial call for NPP, we can speculate that foreign parties are now properly measuring the status of Sri Lankan politics.

With its success and strong third party on populism, the NPP broke the NPP system of Sri Lanka's traditional two -party system. With a glimpse of the future, India is at the forefront to mark its relations with NPP ahead of its prominent contestant, China.

Sri Lanka has a strategic position in the Indian Ocean. India is the largest business partner in Sri Lanka. Even during the latest visit to the NPP group, there were constructive discussions on economic cooperation to expand India's hegemony in the region.

The Colombo district inflation eased further to 0.9 percent in May, from 1.5 percent in April, as both food and non-food prices continued their months-long streak of declines, although the prices could firm up slightly in the coming months, due to somewhat higher prices for staples, as a result of the current weather and revving up of economic activities with the lower interest rates.

Measured on a monthly basis, the prices fell 0.6 percent in the month, adding to the 1.9 percent and 0.8 percent falls in the prices in both March and April, respectively.

After a sharp rise in prices in the nearly last two years, the prices came back to better balance from 2023 onwards, due to the easing of global energy prices and other commodities prices.

Meanwhile, the availability of foreign currency in the country, due to the normalising tourism and remittances, also helped the prices to come back to the acceptable level, as the imported goods could be made in sufficient supply.

The rise of NPP from the ashes of Aragalaya and led by a new generation of JVP leadership, which has distanced itself from that party’s insurrectionary past, and NPP’s tireless campaign to convince the voting public that Sri Lanka’s economic malaise is not an isolated phenomenon, but part of an overall systemic paralysis that had been sapping for decades the vitality of a once peaceful and prosperous nation, and that it cannot be rectified unless there is a radical transformation of its political culture, economic management and socio-cultural ethnonationalism has created an atmosphere of political paranoia amongst the old guards who are now driven to a state of panic looking for a way out to avoid confronting the NPP at the ballot box. It is that paranoia and panic which has provoked the General Secretary of UNP to call for the postponement of elections for two years.  Although that call has drawn criticisms from several corners it did not come out of a vacuum.
