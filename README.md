Despite global lubricant price drops, immediate fuel price reductions in Sri Lanka are challenging due to the country's reliance on imported and refined fuel, influenced by international market prices, particularly from Singapore. About 35% of Sri Lanka's fuel demand is met through imports. While the cost of lubricant oil has decreased significantly since last September, affecting overall fuel prices, the situation remains complex.

ЁЯЯй

The Ministry of Power and Energy has said that despite the decline in lubricant prices in the world market, it is difficult to reduce the prices of fuels in the country immediately.

According to the government -approved purchases, fuel prices should be carried out in Sri Lanka.

The refined fuel is imported according to the Singapore Business Index. Accordingly, the secretary also stated that fuel supply should be supplied in Sri Lanka in accordance with the prices that are determined there.

Sulakshana Jayawardena also said that about 35 per cent of the country's total demand is imported and refined, and that the prices of refined fuel in accordance with world market prices cannot be corrected.

However, Professor Vasantha Attukorala of the Economics University of Peradeniya University said that the price of lubricant oil fell by 27 per cent compared to last September.

Efforts to stop a common candidate in the upcoming presidential election are underway, but Douglas Devananda, Secretary-General and Minister of the EPDP, believes these efforts will be futile for the Tamil people. He views this as an attempt to prolong the Tamil community's issues without addressing the root causes. Despite the lack of unity among them, he emphasizes the importance of relying on trusted leaders who have consistently communicated with the people.

Some people are talking about stopping the common candidate in the upcoming presidential election. It is also said that efforts are being made. I think it is not necessary to be a common candidate for me. Douglas Devananda, Secretary -General and Minister of the EPDP, said that the effort would not only be useless to the Tamil people.

He said this during a media briefing held at his party headquarters in Jaffna on Sunday (16).. In this regard, he said ..

In fact, I see this as an attempt to keep the problems of the Tamil people as long -standing problems.

Although they are all tied together in a potato bundle, they are scattered like a rolling in every direction, as Prabhakaran is not in the absence of today.

In this case, where is unity among them. What did you get for many years. Is it possible to control the destruction?Is there any improvement?In the absence of the election, they are talking about that again.
