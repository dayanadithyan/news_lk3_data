### NPP/JVP on 39% of all adults, ahead of SJB, SLPP

The latest estimates from IHP’s revised SLOTS MRP model (revised 01/2024) show that the NPP/JVP maintains a lead in General Election voting intent with 39% of Sri Lankan adults in December 2023.

This was significantly ahead of the SJB on 27%, the SLPP on 10%, the UNP on 6%, and ITAK and SLMC on 3% each. The December estimates are provisional and are associated with a margin of error of 2.0–3.5% for the four leading parties.

The revised IHP SLOTS model estimates reveal more clearly that the current NPP/JVP lead is based on a continuous rise in support since early 2022. The SJB has also increased its support, but a slower pace, lying in second place since mid-2022. The December 2023 estimates also confirm a decline in support for the UNP since July 2023, with SLPP support holding steady.

### The Attack on ITAK  Jaffna MP,  Shritharan in  Anuradhapura

*2024-01-27 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-Attack-on-ITAK-Jaffna-MP-Shritharan-in-Anuradhapura/172-275815) · `en`

A noteworthy incident was the attack launched on the vehicle he was travelling in by “unknown” gunmen more than 23 years ago. In the news story appearing in the “Uthayan”, Shritharan was quoted that the attack was a planned attempt to kill him and that his Tamil political opponents who were aligned with the government for concessions and ministerial posts were responsible.

Shritharan has been projecting himself as a supporter and fellow traveller of the LTTE from the time he entered Parliament. This has earned him bouquets from pro-Tiger elements and brickbats from anti-Tiger elements. While the pro-LTTE label has helped him in politics, it has at times placed him in jeopardy too

### Can The New ITAK Leader Help Bring About Reconciliation?

With the end of the war in 2009, the ITAK again gained its clout as the main Tamil party in the country as well as within the TNA. Despite other Tamil parties in the north having grown as a threat to its hegemony in the north and the Tamil politics, the ITAK is still a force to be reckoned with

Many in the south seem to confuse the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) with the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), the group that can be considered to be the main Tamil political party in the country, especially in the north. This confusion was evident by the news items carried by some of the south based newspapers on the election of the Leader of the ITAK last Sunday (January 21).

Some Sinhala newspapers said that Sivagnanam Sritharan was elected as the Leader of the TNA, while the others rightly described him to be the new President (Leader) of the ITAK.

Election fever is in the air. Whether it be in the south with over 70 percent of the population or the Northern Province (which is home to the largest minority), elections are a hot topic. In the south, three political parties - namely the National People’s Power (an alliance of individuals and organisation centred around the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna - JVP), the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the United National Party (UNP) have named their candidates for the upcoming Presidential election.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake popularly known as ‘AKD’ is the nominee of the NPP/JVP combine. The SJB nominee is Sajith Premadasa, and President Ranil Wickremasinghe is the nominee of the UNP

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) have not put forward candidates of their own, and are expected to support either the UNP or SJB candidate.

Startups, entrepreneurs, and SMEs can play a crucial role as pioneers for a just transition towards a more sustainable, climate-friendly, and resilient economy

The climate crisis presents a critical challenge for countries across the world. In particular, climate-vulnerable developing countries such as Sri Lanka are facing severe climate impacts as well as losses and damages, affecting all economic sectors and constraining fiscal space, development efforts, and climate action.

Against this backdrop, there is a clear need for economic transformation and transition. On the one hand, existing livelihoods and business models need to adapt to climatic changes and become more resilient to shocks; on the other hand, there are also opportunities to invest in more sustainable and climate-friendly products, practices, and services across key sectors and at all levels.

### Sri Lanka scales up preventive healthcare with impressive results

The Kopay Divisional Hospital in the Jaffna District in northern Sri Lanka is one of the primary medical care institutions in the country – Photo: World Bank/Chameera Laknath

A recent visit to Sri Lanka took me to the Kopay Divisional Hospital in the Jaffna District in the northern part of the country. For the close to 16,000 people living in the area, this hospital serves as the first point of care. It is also one of the primary medical care institutions that is part of Sri Lanka’s primary healthcare reorganisation strategy, implemented with support from the World Bank.

What impressed me the most about the hospital is its investment in preventive care and the shift in approach from episodic to continued care, which has been successfully introduced over the last few years. Now, patients are routinely screened for noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, and connected to appropriate treatments.

### Speaking truth to power – ‘Ethnics’ in ELT to the fore: the curtain falls (Part III of III)

It was an eye-opener, and an open invitation to other ethnics – indeed, the ethnic other – to similarly turn the lens of scrutiny upon themselves

English-Language Theatre (ELT) in Sri Lanka has great potential as a tool for civil society to engage critically with the political powers that be when our elected representatives get uppity or let us and themselves down.

It is a pity then that since 1994, when a humble arts editor (ahem) proposed a consortium of the creative and critical arms of the performing arts to this end, there have been few takers and even fewer serious contenders where ELT has dared to ‘speak truth to power’.

Many attempts were made – from politicised staging of Shakespeare and Orwell, through slapstick masquerading as satire, to original pieces in the shape and form of existential plays, stand-up comedy and (O, Dario Fo!) even musicals.

### UN and EU condemn first US execution using nitrogen gas

The United Nations and European Union condemned the United States on Friday after the country’s first execution of an inmate using nitrogen asphyxiation, an untested method that has reignited a debate about capital punishment, saying the method could amount to torture.

The southern state of Alabama put convicted murderer Kenneth Smith to death on Thursday by pumping nitrogen hypoxia into a facemask, causing him to suffocate. It was the first use of the execution method, rather than the usual lethal injection.

Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said “justice has been served” with Smith’s execution but UN human rights chief Volker Turk, the EU and US civil liberties groups expressed horror and concern.

“I deeply regret the execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith in Alabama despite serious concerns this novel and untested method of suffocation by nitrogen gas may amount to torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,” Volker Turk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said.

South Africa brought the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) earlier this month, asking it to grant emergency measures to halt the fighting, which has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians.

It accused Israel of state-led genocide in its offensive, begun after Hamas militants stormed into Israel killing 1,200 and kidnapping more than 240. Israel sought to have the case thrown out.

In Friday's ruling, the judges said Israel must take all measures within its power to prevent its troops from committing genocide, punish and must take steps to improve the humanitarian situation.
