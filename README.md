Sri Lanka is facing mounting pressure to maintain its current reform momentum, as experts continue to warn that any deviation from the path could potentially derail the country's progress and plunge it back into crisis.

Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe yesterday reiterated this imperative, echoing similar calls from global agencies such as the World Bank (WB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Just a month ago, these institutions stressed the absolute need for Sri Lanka to stay the course, emphasizing that there is no room to steer away from the current path.

The urgency of this call stems from the upcoming elections, which historically have been times when policies and reforms are often sidelined and sacrificed in favor of strategies to fetch votes.

### Seven reasons why I would not vote for a socialist utopia

Effectively steering the economic agenda of an entire nation requires an entirely different skill set

There is a certain age that socialism sounds super sweet. Who wouldn’t appreciate a system in which everyone lives merrily, receives free education and healthcare, shares their food with others, and experiences a sense of community and compassion? Who would not want a highly paying government job whether you study hard or not?

In this ideal society, there are no grievances about the contributions made for the greater good. Individuals are duly recognised with bronze medals for their exemplary efforts. We hold admiration for the industriousness displayed in factories and fields, where the masses work diligently and joyfully express their solidarity through revolutionary songs. We applaud when a leader reminiscent of Lenin emphasises that the best things are for the children. Truly, this superlative utopia leaves no room for comparison.

The aim of these states is to partner with Sri Lanka and create a positive opinion in the eyes of the people and those in governance as they continue their tug-of-war with China

In the lead up to Sri Lanka’s Presidential election in October 2024, there have been numerous visits by foreign governments to create a good rapport with the various candidates. Visits by great powers to Sri Lanka appear to be a tradition before a national election or during global calamities. My analyses over the years indicate an increase in the frequency of interactions and their breadth during the visits.

In order to ascertain this tug-of-war, this article is divided into three sections: first, the QUAD visits; second, the Chinese engagements, and third Sri Lanka’s future in the Indian Ocean.
