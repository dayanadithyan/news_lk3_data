ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka government has not allowed any rice imports and the permission to buy the staple food outside the country for the public consumption has not been granted to anybody, State Finance Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

The island nation, which is self sufficient in rice production, imports the staple food from time to time when there is scarcity or the traders stubbornly maintain high prices at retail level.

President Ranil WickremesingheтАЩs government reduced import tax on rice by 65 rupee per kilo to 1 rupee in January this year to import some rice and control high domestic prices.

The move came after millers and collectors drove up the price due to lack of free trade.

However, State Finance Minister Siyambalapitiya said no permission has been given for the import of rice and only the required quantity of Basmati rice has been given for the needs of tourist hotels.

The next election is going to be a presidential election and according to the constitution it will be held during September-October 2024. Last year we observed the postponement of the elections of local bodies and the explanation given was that there were not sufficient funds to allocate for the elections due to the economic crisis. As a country, solving the economic crisis should be the priority and not who solved it. The upcoming presidential election cannot be postponed while keeping the democratic status of the country.

The government agreed with the IMF the conditions of the revival plan and in return Sri Lanka is getting IMF assistance in the form of┬а 48-month Extended Fund Facility┬а of SDR 2.286 billion (around USD 3 billion) to be released in half yearly instalments. Next major step is external debt restructuring which is already delayed. With this delay the IMF delayed their second tranche and paid it last December amounting to USD 337 million.
