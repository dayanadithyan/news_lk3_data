They seek to build a collective power of the people most affected by debt in what they call exploited countries. Those people are exploited by their own rulers who exercise authoritative powers and by global players who are there to flood them with debt under unfair conditions. In that sense, they produce a global public good and their cry should not be dismissed outrightly

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has mopped up 546 billion rupees of domestic money, out of a total of 578.5 billion rupees created by the purchase of foreign exchange in the six months to June 2024, official data showed.

The central bank had generated 538.1 billion rupees from forex purchases from the market, a Market Operations Report showed.

The central bank had also generated 40.4 billion rupees net from buying official foreign loan proceeds after settling any loans.

Analysts had warned that one of the ways the rupee is pressured by the deeply flawed operational framework of an IMF-prone central bank is through the surrender by the Treasury of its dollar receipts, creating new money.

Government surrenders have a devastating effect on the currency, when the exchange rate is already under pressure, driving up credit and requiring an even greater contraction of the economy to end any external crisis triggered by mis-targeted short term rates, analysts have said.
