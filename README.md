இந்த நபர் தன் நெற்றியில் துப்பாக்கியை வைத்துக்கொண்டு எடுத்துள்ள செல்பியை வைத்து இது தற்கொலையாக இருக்கலாம் என  பொலிஸார் சந்தேகிக்கின்றனர்.

மகன் காலை வேளை எழுந்திருக்காத நிலையில் அறையின் கதவைத் திறந்தபோது, இவரது சடலம் தரையில் கிடப்பதைக் கண்டதாக தாய் பொலிஸாரிடம் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

உயிரிழந்த மகனின் அருகில் இருந்த துப்பாக்கியை கருவா தோட்டத்தில் வீசியதாக தாயாரும் பாட்டியும் விசாரணையின் போது பொலிஸாரிடம் தெரிவித்துள்ளனர். இந்நிலையில் அங்கிருந்து பொலிஸார் உயிரை மாய்த்துக் கொள்ள பயன்படுத்திய துப்பாக்கியை பொலிஸார் மீட்டுள்ளனர்.

மேலும், இந்த நபர் போதைக்கு அடிமையானவர் என்பதும், காதலியால் காதல் உறவு துண்டிக்கப்பட்டதால் மன உளைச்சலுக்கு ஆளானவர் என்பதும்  விசாரணையில் தெரியவந்துள்ளது.

உயிரிழந்த நபரின் கைத்தொலைபேசியை பொலிஸார் ஆய்வு செய்ததில் இவர் தன்னைத்தானே சுட்டுக் உயிரை மாய்த்து கொள்வதற்கு முன் அவர் எடுத்த செல்பியைக் கண்டுப்பிடித்தனர்.

### ICC arrest warrants on Israeli leaders: US protests and threats outrageous

Karim Khan seeks ICC arrest warrants on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and three top Hamas leaders

Israel has no intention to slow down its genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip, even after a series of blows it suffered this week in the form of the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor seeking arrest warrants for its leaders and the recognition of Palestine as an independent state by three European countries: Ireland, Norway, and Spain.

There is no letup in Israel’s killer intent. The Gaza Strip has been made uninhabitable. It is heartbreaking to watch on Al Jazeera the wounded, the sick, the elderly, and little children running for cover in search of not-to-be-found safety amid a severe shortage of food, fuel, and medicine, among other essentials.

### On a ‘divided’ road and heading for trouble - EDITORIAL

The Sri Lanka Police has caused a stir in the motoring scene by making great efforts to strictly follow an old law that relates to the ownership of vehicles. What stirred a hornet’s nest in social media was when a female police officer checked a vehicle recently and demanded to know details of vehicle ownership.

Now we come to know that the police have powers vested in them to check vehicle registration details courtesy a law passed in Parliament many years ago. This law was possibly passed to prevent unlawful activities linked to vehicles; example theft and unlawful assembling of vehicles.

However, the incident made motorists wake up to the requirement of keeping the ownership details of vehicles in order. In the past there was a habit of delaying the updating of the vehicle registration book when ownership of the ‘machine’ changed. Now new owners of vehicles have to be more responsible in having vehicle registration documents in order.

Battery energy systems storage (BESS) is one of the solutions identified in a long-term generation plan, the statement said.

A committee appointed to study the issue had recommended building battery banks.

The cabinet had approved the development of battery storage system as public private partnerships or private projects. (Colombo/May24/2025)
