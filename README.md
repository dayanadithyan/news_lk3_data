### Under Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka is going fast – in reverse

*2024-02-19 13:16:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/under-ranil-wickremesinghe-sri-lanka-is-going-fast-in-reverse/) · `en`

Although it is the Rajapaksas that nominated – and are propping up – their successor, many foreign observers, including in India and the United States, had hoped that things would change.

Related Sri Lanka central bank gets political nod to create up to 7-pct inflation

Legislators had already been misled by inflationists into passing the new IMF backed monetary law to target potential output (print money for growth) in the style of John Law, so positive inflation targeting was a piece of cake.

### Abolishing the Executive Presidency; Prudent Proposal  - But DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT FIRST

*2024-02-19 04:30:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Abolishing-the-Executive-Presidency-Prudent-Proposal-But-DISSOLVE-PARLIAMENT-FIRST/172-277270) · `en`

The movement to abolish the Executive Presidency is gaining traction and drawing significant interest as the deadline approaches

A prudent suggestion is to abolish the Executive Presidency through a referendum, ensuring that the process is not driven by ulterior motives. An alternative approach could involve the immediate dissolution of Parliament after securing the necessary two-thirds majority.  Following this, a two-in-one approach can be adopted by combining the referendum with the Parliamentary elections, streamlining the process and saving time, manpower and financial resources.

### Language: A Catalyst to foster National Unity - EDITORIAL

*2024-02-19 04:29:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Language-A-Catalyst-to-foster-National-Unity-EDITORIAL/172-277269) · `en`

Sri Lanka is described as a multilingual country but this definition could perhaps be deceptive when reflecting on the past and present. One may be quick to point fingers at various state policies that were implemented which made one language superior to the rest. However, language is an integral part of communication and is a key marker of identity. Sri Lanka witnessed a time when minority groups faced linguistic discrimination which in fact was a political recipe for disaster. As the world prepares to celebrate International Mother Language Day on February 21, it would be timely to reflect on the ‘mistakes’ that dragged Sri Lanka towards ethnic separatism.

The consequence for the developing countries with high levels of debt is a prolonged development crisis with capital extracted for debt repayments and little capital left for investment to stimulate growth.

Two years ago in February 2022, Sri Lanka rapidly descended into an economic crisis that had long been in the making. The war in Ukraine and the sudden escalation of global commodity prices made it very difficult to import essential goods such as fuel. Having exhausted its foreign reserves without prioritising the imports of essential goods, the government defaulted on its external debt two months later.
