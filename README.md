The National People’s Power (NPP) party issued a Letter of Demand (LoD) to Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Rauff Hakeem yesterday, alleging that a recent statement by Hakeem purposely distorted remarks made by NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

The Letter of Demand requested that Hakeem, who is also the leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), pay Rs. 2 billion to Dissanayake for the comments made or face legal action.

The offending remarks by Hakeem were reportedly made during a political meeting held in Kattankudy on 19 August. The NPP Presidential candidate has accused Hakeem of distorting, fabricating, and deliberately misrepresenting a comment originally made by him in 2019, and of repeating it in Tamil at the political meeting.

The Letter of Demand noted that Hakeem had claimed Dissanayake said in Parliament that “terrorism is growing in the womb of every Muslim mother.”

Is it bearable, this oppression by reactionary elites who have captured the state, for the sake of ostensible stability in the short term... even if exploring the alternatives – and there is a raft of these – means facing and overcoming the ‘fear psychosis’ (or false propaganda) of the much-dreaded return to vistas of austerity? Or do we owe those who were arguably the worst off – some of my readers may be in the same boat or at the bottom of the same pool – under a cabal that brought a country to its knees and a nation to bankruptcy?

Over the ‘long weekend’ a few days ago, an immersive editorialist – like a few other ordinary folks in Sri Lanka lucky enough to be able to savour it – was pleased to be tasked to enjoy some down time on an out-of-town getaway.

There is a broad range of climate-induced losses that are difficult to restore, reverse, or quantify

Climate-induced loss and damage refers to the impacts of climate change that exceed the practical or theoretical limits of adaptation. It is increasingly recognised as an important challenge for countries across the world and seen by many as the third pillar of the Paris Agreement in addition to mitigation (the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation.

While economic losses and damages—such as destruction of property, assets, infrastructure, or the loss of agricultural production—can potentially be repaired and compensation payments might enable affected communities to rebuild and recover, there is a broad range of losses that are difficult to restore, cannot be reversed, or not easily quantifiable in financial terms. These “non-economic” losses can affect individuals, communities, or the natural environment, and result from a variety of climatic events and processes.
