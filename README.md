The public had a negative opinion of all leading Presidential candidates, but A.K. Dissanayake had the least negative rating.

In IHP SLOTS polling for August 2024, the net favourability rating of SJB leader Sajith Premadasa improved to -32 (+10 points compared to July). Meanwhile, NPP/JVP leader A.K. Dissanayake and President Ranil Wickremesinghe saw their favourability ratings drop to -21 (-16 points) and -33 (-4 points) respectively. The favourability rating of Namal Rajapaksa, the SLPP Presidential Election candidate, was -89 in August.

### Second preference vote is second round in Presidential election

It may be important to pay attention to the second and third preferences in the current Presidential election, which seems to be a three-way battle

Presidential elections of most major democracies are held using two-round systems. It is a more democratic variant of the one-round first-past-the-post systems. Even in a two-round system, if a candidate gets more than 50% of the votes in the first round, there is no need for a second round. If no one gets more than 50%, only the first and second candidates will qualify for the second round.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs presidential election system is a unique one. It seems to be a composite of three systems that are currently used internationally to make the first-past-the-post systems more democratic. The three methods are ‚Äì Supplementary Vote, Ranked Choice and Two-Round methods. For now, I think it‚Äôs more practical for us to think of our system as a variant of a two-round system.

In the Presidential election to be held in a few days, this country faces its first test of public opinion since the Aragalaya
