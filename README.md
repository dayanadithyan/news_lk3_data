### Can A Country Swamped By Mythological Beliefs Prosper?

*2024-06-30 18:20:30* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/can-a-country-swamped-by-mythological-beliefs-prosper/) · `en`

Mythological practices are prevalent in many religions worldwide, ranging from visiting places of religious significance to ringing bells dangling on the testicles of a sage. This piece is not to entirely reject these practices, as some rituals have become traditions, but to highlight the absurd levels of indulgence in Sri Lanka, primarily driven by a segment of Buddhist monks.

Almost every family adheres to traditions such as consulting horoscope readers and waiting for auspicious times for significant events. Indigenous chanting and dancing, like Bali Thovil, are commonly accepted customs. However, there is an over-dependence on newly found practices and beliefs, where authorities need to act before these characters turn the youth into blind followers.

### Is The News Really Good?

*2024-06-30 18:06:46* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/is-the-news-really-good/) · `en`

When a bankrupt country receives good news, it raises great expectations in the hearts of its people. Last week, the government gave extensive publicity to this so-called good news. Consequently, various opposition groups were very concerned about this trend. Some were worried if this was genuinely good news, while others were anxious to learn more details about it. Nevertheless, at first glance, being able to restructure bilateral debts and officially come out of bankruptcy should be good news for the people of a bankrupt country. This is particularly true for those who have suffered in long queues for oil and gas, and for the business community that had to stop operations due to the inability to open letters of credit. However, it seemed that this news was not very favorable for political groups hoping to seize state power in the near future.
