### ‚ÄòNothing will be derailed but everything would be humanized‚Äô ‚Äì Sajith on renegotiating IMF deal

*2024-09-13 21:45:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101952/nothing-will-be-derailed-but-everything-would-be-humanized-sajith-on-renegotiating-imf-deal) ¬∑ `en`

Sri Lanka‚Äôs main opposition leader said he‚Äôll reopen negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on its $3 billion loan if he wins next week‚Äôs presidential election to ease the financial burden on working class people.

Sajith Premadasa, 57, wants rich individuals to bear more of the cost of the economic adjustment that came with the bailout program. The austerity measures that were imposed, such as tax and electricity-price hikes, and the debt restructuring, have made the incumbent leader Ranil Wickremesinghe deeply unpopular, creating a tight race for the Sept. 21 vote.

‚ÄúWe will make sure there is justice and fairness,‚Äù Premadasa said in an interview in his Colombo office. ‚ÄúThe burden should be shared by the super rich, not the working class poor.‚Äù
