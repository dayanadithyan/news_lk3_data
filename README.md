### Sri Lanka banks say lobbies oppose recoveries, while others say defaulters going free

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka Bank AssociationтАЩs say politicians are wrongly blaming them saying defaulters are going free while others are opposing recoveries.

Sri LankaтАЩs parliament passed a law to delay тАШparate executionтАЩ a recovery process till December in a sudden state intervention.

The SLBA said it was assuring depositors that monies being lent are being recovered, and that it is only a small number of borrowers that are resorting to aggressive lobbying to stop.

There have been claims made that recoveries are not being pursued against borrowers with political connections.

тАЬThis is most definitely not the case, and any impression being created that banks are lending on personal connections and political influence, that parate laws are being abused and customers exploited, are misconceived, inaccurate, misleading and unhelpful,тАЭ the SLBA said.

In Sri LankaтАЩs most recent currency crisis which came on top of a Coronavirus pandemic, bad loans in the banking system climbed to 13 percent.

### Honduras ex-President Hernandez sentenced to 45 years in prison on US drug conviction

*2024-06-27 11:52:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100137/honduras-ex-president-hernandez-sentenced-to-45-years-in-prison-on-us-drug-conviction) ┬╖ `en`

Former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez was sentenced by a U.S. judge on Wednesday to 45 years in prison for his conviction on drug and firearm offenses.

The sentence means Hernandez, 55, will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, unless his expected appeal succeeds.

A Manhattan jury found him guilty in March of accepting millions of dollars in bribes to protect U.S.-bound cocaine shipments belonging to traffickers he once publicly proclaimed to combat.

Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, while defense lawyers said a 40-year term, the mandatory minimum under federal law, was enough.

U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel said the 45-year sentence should send a message to well-educated, seemingly personable defendants who may believe they are insulated from prosecution.

He also said jurors saw through HernandezтАЩs тАЬpolished demeanorтАЭ during the two-week trial, where he took the stand in his own defense.

The Vadakkalur village leader said that this practice has been practiced for many generations.

There are complaints that caste leaders in the village are excluding romantic marriages near Annur in Coimbatore district. In addition, it was also reported that there would be a strange procedure for couples who were married to a married couple if they were paid a piercing line.

### Can the presidential election without 'flowers, temples'' can't win?

*2024-06-27 04:02:10* ┬╖ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/cd11r2vdkydo) ┬╖ `si`

Buddhism's influence on Sri Lanka's politics is profound, from its introduction by King Devanampiya Tissa to modern politicians leveraging Buddhist symbols and practices for electoral gains. Historical figures like King Dutugemunu and SWRD. Bandaranaike utilized Buddhist support effectively. However, critics argue that this reliance on religious symbolism for political advantage risks undermining the true principles of Buddhism and could lead to societal decay.

ЁЯЯй

History testifies that the Devanampiya introduced Buddhism in Tissa since the king of Tissa.

Accordingly, the kings ruled by the kings of Lakdiva have seen that the civilians acted accordingly.

Archaeologists have also pointed out that Buddhism has directly affected the building of a civilized society without a specific religious discipline.

The Constitution of Sri Lanka shall be Buddhist?

The dental relics brought to Sri Lanka about the 4th century BCE later became a symbol of state.

The king controlling the Lakdani relics early in the early days was assigned to a symbol of protecting noonomity.

Meanwhile, the facts of the history sources appear that the monk's direct blessing has been given to King Dutugemunu to unite the country.

King Dutugemunu had a good relationship with the Maha Vihara.

However, many historical analysts think that the Mahavamsa, who is a small space for the Maha Viharaya, who have not been a close role in the Maha Vihara.

### LetтАЩs do it with PotatoesтАж

*2024-06-26 23:23:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/lets-do-it-with-potatoes/) ┬╖ `en`

Hi! Since I havenтАЩt given my readers any beauty tips, with the potato as the main base, I thought of bringing the potato into the scene this week.

WhatтАЩs more, potatoes are freely available, so you wonтАЩt have any hassle going searching for this vegetable which is a favourite at most homes.

You will need 02 teaspoons potato juice, 02 teaspoons lemon juice and ┬╜ teaspoon honey (optional)

Mix the potato and lemon juice and add honey to the mixture and blend well.

Apply it all over your face and neck and leave it on for 15 minutes and then wash it off with water.

(Do this very alternate day. By the way, dilute the lemon juice if you experience irritation)

You will need 01 tablespoon potato juice or pulp, 01 tablespoon tomato juice or pulp and 01 tablespoon honey.

Mix the potato and tomato juice/pulp and add the honey to the mixture and mix until you obtain a smooth paste.

Apply it evenly on your face, focusing on the affected area.
