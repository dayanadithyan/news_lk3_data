(AP) — President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the lower house of France’s parliament in a surprise announcement sending voters back to the polls in the coming weeks to choose lawmakers, after his party was handed a humbling defeat by the far-right in the European elections Sunday.

The legislative elections will take place in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.

The announcement came after the first projected results from France put the far-right National Rally party well ahead in the European Union’s parliamentary elections, handing a chastening loss to Macron’s pro-European centrists, according to French opinion poll institutes.

Marine Le Pen’s anti-immigration, nationalist party was estimated to get around 31%-32% of the votes, a historic result more than double the share of Macron’s Renaissance party, which was projected to reach around 15%.

Macron himself wasn’t a candidate in the EU elections and his term as president still runs for three more years.

### Lawyers’ Collective opposes President’s proposal to extend AG’s term

Lawyers’ Collective, a civil society group comprising legal professionals, has voiced its opposition to the recent recommendation by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to extend the term of Attorney General Sanjaya Rajaratnam beyond the mandatory retirement age of 60. In a letter addressed to the members of the Constitutional Council, the Prime Minister, and other key figures, the letter outlined several serious concerns regarding the proposal.

The Collective recalled a similar situation in 2008 when an attempt to extend the term of an Attorney General resulted in a Fundamental Rights application before the Supreme Court. They noted that this legal challenge ultimately led to the Attorney General in question opting for retirement rather than accepting the extension. According to the Collective, the Constitution does not empower the Constitutional Council to approve extensions for officials who are subject to a mandatory retirement age, thereby rendering such a proposal legally questionable.

I must apologise for the lengthy delay. After eight and a half years of five days a week of mainly live TV programs I simply had to take a break and here I am writing to you – the powers that be, may give me a slot on TV again but that’s an entirely different trajectory.

For now, dear Sinna, let me share with you what I heard from my rather dear friend Raj Uncle who never left the North when Prabha started to be a pain in the side of JR and PrayMay and Chandrika Missy and the others who followed.

Best bit is, he never even contemplated leaving the land of his birth.

### Poverty and homelessness stare elders in the face - EDITORIAL

*2024-06-10 01:22:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Poverty-and-homelessness-stare-elders-in-the-face-EDITORIAL/172-284470) · `en`

Not many decades ago, our country was held up worldwide for its welfare state policies. Today, unfortunately, such praises are but a distant dream. Poverty rules the day-to-day life for a large number of our citizens.

Yet none of the political parties who are now canvassing for our vote, have come out with a single concrete proposal of how they intend to get this country out of its present dilemma.

In these columns, we have highlighted times out of number, the huge difference between the average wage and the cost a family of four needs to bear if they are to have two square meals a day. That cost amounted to over rupees one hundred thousand a month!

On the tea and rubber plantations -until the president recently forced owners to pay workers Rs. 1,700 per day workers were paid less than Rs. 1,000 per day. Daily paid or casual workers elsewhere in the country who form a majority of the country’s workforce receive less than Rs. 55,000 per month.

### UK centre-right media gearing up for a Third World War

Ukrainians fire at Russian forces in Donetsk province, a target of Russia’s current, narrowed offensive

Social media is agog with fears over a looming Third World War. According to the centre-right Daily Telegraph of the UK, it has already started.

According to this view, military action in Ukraine and Gaza is only a small part of a global war in which propaganda, influence buying, trade wars and misinformation are weapons as deadly as any conventional or nuclear arsenal.

But, before we examine this theory in more detail, it’s noteworthy that Third World War scares are hardly new. They have been there almost since the day the Second World War ended.

One could very well describe the Cold War between the West (the US and its NATO allies) and the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc satellites as war by other means – both sides vying to outdo each other with misinformation, propaganda and influence buying and trying to bully the other side into submission.

### Modi sworn in for third term as India’s prime minister

(AP) — Narendra Modi was sworn in Sunday for a rare third consecutive term as India’s prime minister, relying on his coalition partners after his party failed to win a parliamentary majority in a surprise outcome.

Modi and his Cabinet ministers took the oath of office, administered by President Droupadi Murmu, at India’s presidential palace Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi.

The 73-year-old popular but polarizing leader is only the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to retain power for a third five-year term.

His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which won by landslides in 2014 and 2019, failed to secure a majority to govern on its own in the latest national election. However, Modi’s National Democratic Alliance coalition won enough seats to form a government, with him at the helm.

This is the first time the BJP under Modi has needed support from its regional allies to form a government after a decade of commanding the majority in Parliament.
