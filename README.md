ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s International Monetary Fund program could slow down in the second half of 2024 after the current review is completed, as elections make it more difficult to maintain the pace of reforms, government sources said.

An IMF mission is in SriLanka for the second review of a bailout that has pushed up taxes, and stabilized the external sector which was shattered by 2020 rate cuts.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s popularity has declined amid electricity price hikes while middle class wage earners were hit by high progressive taxes on a low base, on top of cascading social security levy and a required needed value added tax.

Wickremesinghe is considering to contest under a grand coalition in the presidential poll which has to be held in one month from September 18 this year, his allies have told EconomyNext.

Trinity's Antonian 105th (Mountaineer) sapphire at Asgiriya Ground, Kandy, is heading towards an uninteresting decision. St. Anthony's team, after a strong start, faces challenges. Despite a promising opening, they struggle to maintain their lead, losing the match with 13 runs.

🟩

The first day of the Trinity - Antonian 105th (Mountaineer) sapphire at the Asgiriya Ground in Kandy is moving towards the uninteresting decision.

Perhaps, if St. Anthony loses the Trinity team twice, it is possible to make the match.

St. Anthony's team, who played the entire day in the match, started the match on Friday (15) and scored 232 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in the first innings when the game was stopped due to inadequate lighting.

Often the St. Anthony's team is expected to hold their first innings and give the Trinity team a chance to bat on the second day (16).

St. Anthony's team faced a stumbling block as the opening player Dinura Kanegoda (0) was playing in the first over of Trinity team man Manula Gularatne.

However, team captain Dissanayake Kaushika Kumarasinghe, both of them, shared 66 runs in the 2nd wicket.

Subsequently, Ekanayake shared 36 runs each in the 3rd wicket with Januka Ratnayake and Janith Ratnasiri 4.

“What did the others know of history? Passing ripples, little eddies, and breaking waves. They wondered at the changing forms of the surface and could not explain them. But we had descended into the depths, into the formless, anonymous masses, which at all times constituted the substance of history; and we were the first to discover her laws of motion. We had discovered the laws of her inertia, of the slow changing of the molecular structure, and, her sudden eruptions…” – Darkness at Noon- Arthur Koestler

### Gota’s book and conspiracy theories

*2024-03-16 00:38:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Gotas-book-and-conspiracy-theories/172-278977) · `en`

Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s book ‘The Conspiracy to oust me from Presidency” which was launched recently did not evoke much interest or create any stir among the people as its name suggests to do.

Nor did it reveal any hidden facts or details about any incident that would have contributed to his ouster. However, the book is said to have been sold like hot cake due to the curiosity about what it could have contained.

Hence, unlike the commotion that was created in September last year by the Channel 4 documentary which suggested a purported link between the State Intelligence Service (SIS) and the National Thowheed Jama’ath (NTJ), the terrorist organization that was behind the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks in 2019, the book seems to have now almost been forgotten even by Rajapaksa’s friends.

### Easter Sunday, nightmares of past and fears for the future

*2024-03-16 00:37:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Easter-Sunday-nightmares-of-past-and-fears-for-the-future/172-278976) · `en`

On the 31th of this month Catholics and Christians of all denomination will celebrate Easter Sunday. The festival without a doubt brings to mind the Easter Sunday bombing of 2019.

On Easter of 2019, terrorists exploded their deadly caches of explosives in three churches where Christians were celebrating what to the community was the most sacred of Christian festivals. Separately on the same day, in three five star hotels members of the same terrorist group carried out similar attacks on guests having their Easter breakfast.

To-date no one knows why these misguided souls chose that date to perform their ‘mischief’. The intelligence services of the US, UK, India, China, Israel Pakistan et al arrived in the country within hours of the bombing.

However, it was thanks to the immediate action taken by Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, -the head of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka- any further bloodshed was averted.

Karuna kept LTTE resistance alive during the days of the IPKF. He and his former deputy Reagan led the counter offensive against the ill-fated Tamil National Army after the withdrawal of the IPKF

Twenty years have passed and much water has flown under the bridge since the eastern tiger revolt. Nevertheless the episode that fragmented the LTTE, remains an important chapter in the history of the ethnic conflict

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) organization fought the armed forces of Sri Lanka for 33 years in pursuance of its political goal of establishing a separate state  called Tamil Eelam in the Northern and Eastern provinces of the Island.
