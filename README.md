The humanitarian crisis is in danger of intensifying the killing of humanitarian workers in Gaza, following the suspension of their humanitarian tasks.

Following the killing of seven humanitarian employees in the attack on World Central Kitchen's vehicle, many organizations involved in Gaza have suspended their work in view of the safety of their employees.

The Anara, a charity, has said that this is never a matter of fact, and we have come to the conclusion that there is no safeguard for humanitarian assistance as many humanitarian employees and their families have been killed.

We understand the worst effects of humanitarian aid suspension, but the risk of increasing during humanitarian aid distribution has created a position to suspend our tasks until our employees think they can work again.

Last month, the UN said that hunger and poverty could be developed at any time in Gaza.

Oxfam said the number of hunger facing hunger in the Palestinian region has increased several times.

### Stalin clashes with Modi

*2024-04-03 13:49:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180311) · `ta`

It seems you've provided a detailed narrative on the historical and political context surrounding the Kachchativu issue, including the involvement of various political figures and parties. This issue has been a point of contention for many years, involving territorial disputes, fishing rights, and the broader geopolitical landscape of India and Sri Lanka.



Given the complexity and the historical depth of the issue, addressing all the points you've raised would require a comprehensive analysis that goes beyond the scope of a single response. However, I can provide a brief overview and some insights based on the information you've shared:



1. **Tax and Flood Relief**: The specifics of why Tamil Nadu's tax proposal was met with a 29-penny return by the Union Government and the absence of a one-rupee flood relief during natural disasters are likely tied to broader political and economic considerations. These decisions would involve evaluating the financial implications for the Union Government, the strategic importance of Tamil Nadu's resources, and the overall budgetary constraints.



2. **BJP's Ten-Year Rule in Tamil Nadu**: The impact of the BJP's rule in Tamil Nadu over the past decade would depend on various factors, including policy implementation, governance, and the party's approach to development and welfare. The effectiveness of the BJP's policies in Tamil Nadu would be a subject of debate among political analysts and the public.



3. **Kachchativu Issue**: The Kachchativu issue is deeply rooted in historical and territorial disputes between India and Sri Lanka. The transfer of Kachchativu to Sri Lanka in 1974 was a significant event that has had lasting implications for the fishing communities in Tamil Nadu. The controversy surrounding this decision and its aftermath has been a point of contention among various political parties and has influenced the broader political landscape in Tamil Nadu.



4. **DMK's Relationship with Congress**: The relationship between the DMK and Congress, especially in the context of the Kachchativu issue, reflects the complexities of Indian politics. The DMK's stance on the issue, as well as its alliance with Congress, has been influenced by a range of factors, including historical grievances, political strategy, and the broader dynamics of power in Indian politics.



5. **Kachchativu's Geography and Historical Context**: Kachchativu's geographical location and its historical significance as a fishing ground for Tamil Nadu's fishermen have been central to the dispute. The island's strategic importance and the rights of its inhabitants have been at the heart of the controversy, with various political actors and international bodies involved in the resolution of the issue.



In summary, the Kachchativu issue and its broader implications for Tamil Nadu's politics and governance are multifaceted and deeply intertwined with the region's history, geopolitical dynamics, and the strategic interests of India and Sri Lanka. Addressing these issues requires a nuanced understanding of the historical context, the political dynamics at play, and the broader geopolitical implications.

🟩

When the Indian parliamentary election begins to warm up, people and candidates will be alerted. Free, cash banknotes will start chasing people.It is only the political leaders of the party, as they awakened from deep sleep. Many things that have been forgotten will be remembered. The electoral field will be heated by the right rivalry. That is the case in Tamil Nadu.

Voting for the 39 constituencies in Tamil Nadu will be held on April 19, and the counting of voting will begin on June 4.

Tamil Nadu ranks fifth in terms of Lok Sabha places. In the 2019 election, the DMK -led secular progressive Alliance won 38 seats of a total of 39 seats.

My friend Vajira Abeywardena is the UNP. So what else can he say to the success of the post of President?But if we look at the problem we face from the angle of being Tamils, he will not say this.

As Tamils, we have so far voted for a candidate from the majority community. They all promised to provide a solution to our political issue.

### Removal of special freight tax

*2024-04-03 12:02:14* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/விசேட-சரக்கு-வரியை-நீக்குவது-விலைவாசி-உயர்வை-ஏற்படுத்தும்/175-335562) · `ta`

The Essential Importers and Traders Association warns that removing the special freight tax on imported goods in Sri Lanka could lead to higher prices due to corruption. The government plans to abolish this tax from January next year, a move that was initially imposed in 2007 to combat corruption. The association argues that this tax, which charges based on the value of goods, helps reduce corruption by making it more difficult for importers to bribe customs officials. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has suggested replacing this tax to increase government revenue, but the association believes that advanced customs procedures will mitigate corruption.

🟩

The Essential Importers and Traders Association said that if there is no mechanism to control corruption in Sri Lanka, the removal of special freight tax on imported goods will be a price hike.

The Cabinet has decided to abolish the 17 -year -old tax law from January next year.

A spokesperson of the association told Daily Mirror that it was imposed by its members in 2007 for the sake of increased corruption when assessing the items.

“Then, the imported goods were rated for these charges to be imposed. Then, dishonest importers bribed the customs officials to lower their imported goods so that they could pay less on tax -basis. This has affected the real importers. So we asked the then government that this special freight tax should be imposed.

It charges on the amount of imported goods and leads to lower corruption. When the value of the goods is charged, it can lead to corruption. ”

He also said that the cost of imported goods consumed by the people can ensure stability.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s economy has stabilized by the recovery path which was narrow, World Bank officials said underlining the need to maintain stability and continue on the reform path.

The World Bank’s April 2024 Sri Lanka Development Update projected 2024 growth at 2.2 percent up from 1.7 percent projected last year and 2.5 percent for 2025.

Sri Lanka’s economy has stabilized and it was essential for stability and reforms to continue, Country Manager Chiyo Kanda told reporters Tuesday.

Sri Lanka’s inflation was low, interest rates were falling and the rupee was appreciating, World Bank’s Senior Country Economist Richard Walker said.

Results were already beginning to be seen, but there was unlikely to be a quick bounce back, he said.

Sri Lanka upcoming elections and the possibility of reform fatigue or reversals were, a key risk to the recovery path.
