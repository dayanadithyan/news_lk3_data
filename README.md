🟩

Ranil today is not as good as Ranil Wickremesinghe to be sent to the jail. But the Tamil and Muslim people will not go to that point.

He said this while addressing the adjournment debate of the House on Wednesday (07) in Parliament.

Most of the state side are rich despite the bankruptcy.

The state government has accused the government of not taking responsibility for the government during the economic crisis in the country. The then President of the Opposition, Sajith Premadasa, called for the government to take charge of the government. We have put forward the conditions of the party.

Ranil Wickremesinghe, who ignored our conditions, selected Ranil Wickremesinghe as the guardian of the Rajapaksa.

Ranil's fame today that Ranil Wickremesinghe will not sleep until he sends Ranil Wickremesinghe.. But members of the traditional PA and the Freedom Party, which are supportive of former President Mahinda Rajapakse, will not take an alternative political decision.

### Why AKD-NPP have fallen in the polls, may lose elections

*2024-08-07 23:33:15* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-AKD-NPP-have-fallen-in-the-polls-may-lose-elections/4-765259) · `en`

“Additionally, the President highlighted the importance of promoting the Tamil language alongside Sinhala. He noted that with the anticipated economic growth in Tamil Nadu soon, Tamil-speaking Sri Lankans would have unique opportunities that others might not have.”

My salute to the people of Bangladesh led by their student youth, who have overthrown an autocrat in an unarmed uprising, sacrificing over 300 lives. We can also be proud of ourselves as Sri Lankans, since the autocrat mentioned our Aragalaya as an inspiration for the Bangladeshi youth. So much for so-called ‘anti-imperialists’ who revile it and are suspicious of People’s Power revolts.

In Sri Lanka’s election season, wannabe tyrants should tremble, and be deterred from any power-grab they may be planning.

TV news has shown President Wickremesinghe saying repeatedly on his recent visits to the North and East that “in this country we have 10 governments, 9 of which are Provincial Governments”.
