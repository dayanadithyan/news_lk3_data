Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuтАЩs approach to the war in Gaza is a тАЬmistake,тАЭ U.S. President Joe Biden said in an interview published on Tuesday, offering further criticism of IsraelтАЩs handling of the conflict.

тАЬI think what heтАЩs doing is a mistake. I donтАЩt agree with his approach,тАЭ Biden said in comments to Univision, a U.S. Spanish-language TV network.

Biden has also previously called IsraelтАЩs bombing in Gaza тАЬindiscriminate,тАЭ and its military actions тАЬover the top.тАЭ

The White House said last week that the president, in a call with Netanyahu, threatened to make conditional, U.S. support for IsraelтАЩs offensive on it taking concrete steps to protect aid workers and civilians. That call followed an Israeli airstrike that killed seven staff, of the aid group World Central Kitchen.

### Expressway debts could take 160 years to settle despite profit: Minister

*2024-04-10 02:37:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Expressway-debts-could-take-160-years-to-settle-despite-profit-Minister/108-280516) ┬╖ `en`

Colombo, April 10 (Daily Mirror) - Despite earning a yearly profit of Rs. 5 billion from expressways, Minister Bandula Gunawardana revealed that it might take at least 160 years to fully pay off the Rs. 800 billion loan used to build them.

Gunawardana explained that even if someone lived for 80 years, it would still be impossible to settle the debt. He emphasized that even if someone reincarnated multiple times and worked throughout each lifetime, the debt would persist.

To prevent financial collapse, Gunawardana stressed the importance of following protocols set by the World Bank (WB), IMF, and Asian Development Bank (ADB). He warned that failure to comply could lead to ruin.

To tackle the debt, the minister proposed transferring the expressway system and its assets to the government-owned Sahasya Investment Company.

This, he believes, is necessary to prevent innocent individuals from bearing the burden for the rest of their lives.

### A bloc to confront global debt crisis: What role for Sri Lanka?

What proved to be particularly effective were the ways in which the IDEAs conference explored how powerful states and capitals reproduce a highly unequal global order with dramatic regional differences

Even if Sri Lanka is eventually able to тАЬsuccessfullyтАЭ exit the IMF program, the question is, at what human cost? The paucity of discourse about a short to medium-term relief strategy to cope with the immiseration of working people during the depression is an indictment of our ruling class. But considering the views expressed at the IDEAs conference, it further reflects tremendous short-sightedness in ignoring the paradoxes that have provoked serious researchers elsewhere.

### Peak state capitalism тАУ whatтАЩs next?

The limits of state capitalism are visible worldwide, from China, Sri Lanka, Egypt, and Nigeria to Ukraine. Globally, state-owned enterprisesтАЩ assets are worth the equivalent of half the global GDP, while government-owned real estate is worth twice that amount. Decades of research, including from the IMF, have shown that government-owned businesses are, on average, one-third less productive than private firms. This is hampering financial sector reform and the efficient allocation of capital, leading to constrained economic development and growth.

The Court of Appeal yesterday suspended the allocation of 3500 quotas by the Hajj committee given to Sri Lanka for the Hajj Pilgrimage.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had granted a quota of 3500 pilgrims to the island for the upcoming Hajj in June.

The Hajj committee was given discretion to allocate from the quota numbers of pilgrims to each travel operator.

In a writ petition filed before the Court of Appeal a travel agent who was not granted any allocation said the process adopted by the Hajj committee was arbitrary.

The Petitioners said that there was a large amount of money of pilgrims which were involved and that the process was susceptible to corrupt practices.

They said that they had been singled out and victimised after questioning the conduct of allocation of quotas of the Hajj committee in the year 2023.

The court of appeal also ordered the provisional registration of the Travel Agent United Travels as a Hajj operator.

KP Projects International Ltd., had previously obtained Enjoining Orders on against both the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and the China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) on the contract to the Jaffna Kilinochchi Water Supply and Sanitation Project.

The project is considered to be crucial for ensuring piped water access to Jaffna Peninsula residents.

CMEC argued that the dispute, involving a commercial transaction exceeding Rs. 50 million, warranted transfer to the Commercial High Court under the provisions of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996 and submitted that the Plaintiff has surreptitiously valued the action at Rs. 100,000 in order to institute action before the District Court.

### India loosens onion export ban to help neighbours

India is gearing up to supply thousands of metric tonnes of onions to Sri Lanka and UAE, days after it approved limited exports of essential commodities to the Maldives.

According to the Hindustan Times, India has supplied 10,000 metric tons of onions over and above the agreed 14,400-ton cap.

The worldтАЩs largest global exporter of onions, India has either banned or limited export permits for the in-demand vegetable, as well as for rice, wheat flour, pulses, and sugar, since last December.

Subsequently, onion prices are believed to have risen dramatically in neighbouring countries that have depended on onion imports from India to meet their domestic demand. Through a тАЬspecial quotaтАЭ arrangement, the Indian Government recently allowed exports to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Bahrain, and Bhutan.

We wish our readers a happy and bountiful New Year, as the country celebrates its cultural festival this month. On the 13th of this month, the two major communities in our country Tamils and the Sinhalese celebrate the Eastern or cultural New Year.

The тАШAdhi VasiesтАЩ- also known as the тАШVeddahsтАЩ also celebrate the New Year or тАШKona MangalayaтАЩ during this time. Within the month all communities celebrate.

This year too, since the Covid-19 pandemic hit our country in January 2020, New Year celebrations will be held on an austere basis. Over 500,000 persons lost employment due to the lockdowns imposed during that period.

Making a bad situation worse, the financial meltdown in 2022 led the country to announce it was bankrupt. The country was thus deemed not credit-worthy by the worldтАЩs financial institutions.

### Sri Lanka best  place for solo female travel and belittling country

The British travel magazine Time Out ranked Sri Lanka as the best place for solo female travel.

I have written in these pages that Sri Lankans, more than anyone else, have done a spectacular job in disparaging their country at home and abroad. The genesis of this particular penchant is multifaceted. Some are innately bitter, some are attention-seeking, and others seek validation. For certain others, this represents an escapism from an existential identity crisis. Most of them live in an eternal gripe. So whenever the country gets a positive mention, their egos are prickled, their heartbeat rises, and they resurface, like earthworms after the rain, to contest, talk trash and scandalize.

If solar light stops, trees lose biodiversity, plants survive a few years, and Earth's temperature drops, becoming ice in three years. Oxygen allows life to persist for thousands of years. The Earth has experienced a total solar eclipse, visible in places like England, Northern Ireland, and Mexico.

ЁЯЯй

What happens if the solar light of the earth stops forever?It was a question raised from long.

Karl Sagan, a well-known astronomer, had given such an answer.

In a day, all the trees begin to lose all natural biodiversity in the earth.

With the loss of the lightsynthesis, the massive plants can last for a few years.

In a week, the heat of heat can experience the failure of the earth due to the drop of the earth, as the sun does not fall from 0 degrees Celsius.

In a year, the Earth's temperature falls to 73 degrees Celsius can be expected to become ice in three years.

However, the oxygen in the atmosphere is capable of maintaining life thousands of years.

But it is difficult to paint a psychological to a world that does not have a waterholding in the sunlight.

The Earth suffered an experience in a fully deer eclipse of the sun.

But it was possible to see the full eclipse, England and Northern Ireland.

It was reported that the eclipse appeared for the North Arctic Pole.
