Current President then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had in 2015 assured justice over the murders, including that of former Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge and rugger player Wasim Thajudeen.

However, President Wickremesinghe and his administration have not provided any assurances to the families of the victims since taking office after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced out of office.

Dr. Kasippillai Manoharan, whose 20-year-old son, Ragihar, was among the five youths killed in Trincomalee in 2006, told Daily Mirror he has not heard anything from the Government over the investigations.

Known as the ‘Trinco Five’ case, five Tamil students were killed on January 2, 2006, allegedly by the security forces at point-blank range.

Dr. Manoharan said that Amnesty International had been pursuing his son’s case and now another foreign individual was assisting to ensure justice.

### The Iran-Israel conflict leaves Lanka at crossroads - EDITORIAL

Israel’s misguided (as the US President chooses to call it) attack on the Iranian Consulate in Syria, the retaliatory strikes by Iran on Israel and counter-strikes by Israel on Iran have set West Asia (referred to as the Middle East by the US and the West) in flames. By these actions, the taboo against direct attacks on each other has now disappeared.

If there is another round-a conflict over Iran’s nuclear advances or another strike by Israel on Iranian military officers- both sides will feel free to launch direct attacks on the other.

Relations reached a point of no return on April 1, 2024 when an Israeli air strike destroyed the Iranian Consulate annex building in Syria killing 16 people, including a senior Quds Force Commander.

At one point, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin even referred to Iran as one  of Israel’s “best friends.” However, sentiments shifted rapidly, and  Rabin later characterized Ayatollah Khomeini’s regime as “dark” and  “murderous.”

Global oil and gold prices surged, while stock markets plummeted, in the wake of reports that Israel had launched missiles at several sites in Iran.

Iran and Israel were once close allies during the reign of the Shah, as they shared common geopolitical interests and concerns regarding Arab nationalism. However, with the establishment of the Islamic Republic following the 1979 Islamic Revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini’s rise to power,Khomeini severed diplomatic ties with Israel and adopted a firm anti-Zionist stance.

### Market lending rate falls to two-year low as economy readies to take off

Prime rate hits a peak level of 29.67 percent in November 2022

The often watched market lending rate, which guides the rest of the rates on loans to small businesses to mortgages to consumers, touched a two-year low last week continuing its descent.

The average prime lending rate or the rate at which the banks lend to their most creditworthy clients for a short term fell 22 basis points to 10.41 percent last week.

This was the lowest level from 9.85 percent on April 1, 2022 just before the Central Bank raised interest rates by a bumper 700 basis points to rein in the inflation at the time.

Both government securities yields and the market lending rates are on the descent during the last 10 months since the time Central Bank pivoted to cut rates for the first time in June last year.

The prime rate hit a peak level of 29.67 percent in November 2022 when the monetary policy was  crushingly tight.

### United Nations pushes justice for Sri Lanka’s Easter victims

The United Nations on Sunday urged Sri Lanka to bridge its “accountability deficit” and ensure justice as the country commemorated the 279 victims of its worst-ever attack against civilians five years ago.

The UN’s top envoy to the country, Marc-Andre Franche, told a remembrance service in Colombo that there should be a “thorough and transparent investigation” to uncover those behind the Easter carnage in 2019.

Islamist bombers hit three churches and three hotels in the island’s deadliest suicide attack aimed at civilians, but grieving families say they are still waiting for justice.

Among the dead were 45 foreigners, including tourists visiting the island a decade after the end of a brutal ethnic conflict that had claimed more than 100,000 lives since 1972.

“Sri Lanka suffers from a continuing accountability deficit, be it for alleged war crimes, more recent human rights violations, corruption or abuse of power, which must be addressed if the country is to move forward,” Franche said.

*2024-04-21 21:09:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83924) · `en`

“ The  Dogs bark but the Caravan moves on”is a proverbial  saying of supposedly Turkish origin. Caravan  in this instance refers to a group of people, animals or vehicles on the move. As is natural members of the canine species  respond to the  strange sight of a caravan  in their midst by barking. This is especially so if there are animals in the caravan. Despite the dogs barking, the carava proceeds on its journey. The moral is that an individual or group must continue on the journey towards their destination even if  there is vocal opposition.

### United Nations pushes justice for Sri Lanka’s Easter victims

*2024-04-21 20:31:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98763/united-nations-pushes-justice-for-sri-lankas-easter-victims) · `en`

The United Nations on Sunday urged Sri Lanka to bridge its “accountability deficit” and ensure justice as the country commemorated the 279 victims of its worst-ever attack against civilians five years ago.

The UN’s top envoy to the country, Marc-Andre Franche, told a remembrance service in Colombo that there should be a “thorough and transparent investigation” to uncover those behind the Easter carnage in 2019.

Islamist bombers hit three churches and three hotels in the island’s deadliest suicide attack aimed at civilians, but grieving families say they are still waiting for justice.

Among the dead were 45 foreigners, including tourists visiting the island a decade after the end of a brutal ethnic conflict that had claimed more than 100,000 lives since 1972.

“Sri Lanka suffers from a continuing accountability deficit, be it for alleged war crimes, more recent human rights violations, corruption or abuse of power, which must be addressed if the country is to move forward,” Franche said.

### Gnanasara Thero’s  rhetoric, which eminently qualifies as hate speech during a press conference called by him, was directly aimed at the Muslim religion and its founder in referencing the Kuragala pre- historic archaeological site.

*2024-04-21 20:22:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83933) · `en`

That a State Minister has called upon President Ranil Wickremesinghe to pardon Gnanasara Thero now serving his most recent sentence of four years handed down by the Colombo High Court last month for ‘outraging religious feelings’ of adherents of the Islamic faith in 2016, should surprise no one.

No doubt, the State Minister in question is largely insignificant in the larger scheme of political realities. Even so, there is little doubt that his sentiments will be applauded by many in his party, the Rajapaksa-led Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).

That this monk has repeatedly thumbed his nose at the law and had been convicted previously (for contempt of court), later granted a Presidential pardon by Maithripala Sirisena is merely incidental to the matter.

### The Easter Sunday victims have been political pawns these past five years, just as the many others who lost family members in the various conflicts the country have been through.They too, are still awaiting justice.

*2024-04-21 20:20:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83931) · `en`

Five years on, Sri Lanka’s Easter Sunday bombings has left us with more questions than answers.

Both the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government and now the Ranil Wickremesinghe tenure has been shown up poorly in terms of ensuring the masterminds and those who failed to prevent the bombings are bought to book.

As one sifts through various reports and discussions on the Easter Sunday bombings which took the lives of 315 and injured at least 600, one must, as Sunanda Deshapriya, activist and investigative journalist told a webinar recently, ask whether that tragedy was preventable.

The webinar was organised by the Solidarity Movement for Justice and Truth (SMJT).

One interesting fact that investigators discovered, Deshapriya said, was that a phone number used by one of the bombers, was amongst a series used by the infamous ‘Tripoli Brigade’ that is alleged to be behind the Lasantha Wickrematunga murder.

### Mangala  Samaraweera was a leader who saw things that others didn’t see. He was bold and had the courage of his convictions, never afraid to stand up for what he believed, whether or not the world appreciated it,  and indeed whether or not it was a marginal or minority position that he was espousing.

*2024-04-21 20:15:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83929) · `en`

Mangala Samaraweera would have turned 68 today, and had he not succumbed to Covid-19, I am certain we would have met and raised a cheer for all that is worthy of celebration even in the worst of times.

He left us at a critical moment in our political history. Indeed, critical or not, his presence would have made a difference, for he was endowed not only with rare charisma but tirelessly used his bully pulpit to unite Lankans across ethnic, religious or age barriers, even sacrificing his parliamentary seat without a second thought.

Especially today, five years after the Easter Sunday attacks, with Catholics island-wide still feeling vulnerable from the absence of justice, Mangala would have reached out to honour the lives of those souls who perished in that barbaric assault. He would have had zero patience for any of the political gamesmanship that is denying closure to the 279 mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, husbands and wives who were slain that tragic Easter Sunday morning.
