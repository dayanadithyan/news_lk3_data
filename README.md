Colombo, April 9 (Daily Mirror) - Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation Minister Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi has directed the authorities concerned to promptly address the spread of the invasive plant species 'Koenigia Mollis' in the tropical rainforest surrounding the Sri Pada (Adam's Peak) mountain range.

Researchers at Sabaragamuwa University have discovered that a particular plant, typically found growing 6 to 8 feet tall near mountainous areas, gradually weakens the stability of its root system. This weakening contributes to an increased risk of landslides occurring at the mountain peaks.

### National Education Policy

*2024-04-09 02:49:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180772) · `ta`

The Jaffna University Teachers Union opposes the National Education Policy Framework (NEPF 2023-2033), arguing it threatens Sri Lanka's long-term free education tradition by prioritizing profit over education quality and welfare. NEPF aims to transform education into a profit-making business, abolishing state education and the University Grants Commission (UGC), and introducing university fees. It also focuses on economics and digital education, ignoring broader educational goals like literacy and critical thinking. The union calls for the withdrawal of these reforms and prioritizes the interests of the people over market forces.

The Jaffna University Teachers Union alleges that the National Education Policy Framework (NEPF) is a significant threat to the tradition of long -term free education in Sri Lanka.

As a Federation of University Teachers' Association (FUTA), we strongly oppose the proposed National Education Policy Framework (NEPF 2023-2033), which is a significant threat to our country's long-term free education heritage.

The NEPF program transforms the education system into a profit -making business by highlighting the government's responsibility in education, the abolition of state education, and the abolition of the University Grants Commission (UGC).

These reforms prior the profit rather than the quality of education and the welfare of students and educators. By introducing tariffs at the university level and withdrawing state funds for higher education, the NEPF undermines the equal access policy for education centered on Sri Lanka's social structure after independence.

In a statement, the SLJGJ points out that West Asia is Sri Lanka’s most important source of oil and gas as  well as the home of our migrant workers. Already, oil prices are volatile due to the existing  uncertainties regarding supply and the rising costs of shipping and insurance.

Meanwhile, in the recent months since the launch of the Israeli government’s military  operations against Palestinian territories, a war-like atmosphere has extended throughout the  entire neighbouring region.

### Role of Buddhism in fight against caste oppression in Tamil Nadu

*2024-04-09 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Role-of-Buddhism-in-fight-against-caste-oppression-in-Tamil-Nadu/172-280411) · `en`

Buddhism flourished in ancient India, including Tamil Nadu from the early years of the Christian era till about the 14th century. At its height, it enjoyed royal patronage and was the religion of the elite which at that time comprised the urban and mercantile classes.

Buddhism ceased to exist in India in the medieval period for a variety of reasons, and saw a revival of sorts only in the closing years of the 19th century.

The discoveries of British archaeologists and anti-colonial and religious revivalist movements in Ceylon and India spurred by Europeans interested in Eastern thought, were factors responsible for increasing interest in Buddhism at the end of the 19th century.

In Ceylon, the Buddhist revival was a part of a nationalistic upsurge, the search for a national identity. But in India, its revival was part of the movement to liberate the traditionally oppressed “untouchable” castes, now called Dalits.

### Sinhala originals…on the way

*2024-04-08 23:05:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sinhala-originalson-the-way/) · `en`

If you are to grab the spotlight, in a big way, in the scene here, and have the masses on your side, you have got to do songs in the official language, and that’s Sinhala.

Janaka Palapathwala, who has changed his stage name to JPal, and whose Elvis/Jim Reeves style of singing, has the support of music lovers, overseas, is now keen to broaden his fan base here.

Says Janaka: “You need Sinhala songs in your repertoire, and originals, as well. Without Sinhala songs, it’s very difficult to make it big in Sri Lanka.

“The masses, and the electronic media, won’t accept anything other than Sinhala, so we need to give them what they want.”

And, with that in mind, Janaka moved into action and is now in the process of completing two Sinhala originals.

“I have an extremely talented lot of folks helping me to put together my Sinhala originals and I’m quite certain both songs will be welcomed by the masses.”

The recordings are being done at one of the most modern studios in the island – Sonexco.

About a month and a half ago Harsha de Silva of SJB invited Sunil Handunneththi the shadow finance minister of the JVP/NPP for a debate on their economic program on TV, but Handunneththi’s position was, leaders as presidential candidates should explain their economic program to the people.

Even as long ago as the Greek and Roman eras, playwrights have been engaging with the idea of tragicomedy, the dramatic coexistence of the two opposite elements in the human condition. “All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players” suggested the Bard; characters are inter-changeable, the dramatists introduced men as gods, slaves as masters, a trivialising portrait exemplifying the inherence of the two elements in the one moment, tragedy and comedy. The tragicomedy exaggerates and glorifies the trivial, the banal is presented as climacteric, a burlesque denying authenticity.

### Hamas says Gaza truce talks still deadlocked despite reports of progress

(Reuters) - A Hamas official said on Monday no progress had been made at a new round of talks in Cairo on a ceasefire in the Gaza war after the Egyptian hosts said headway had been achieved on the agenda.

Israel and Hamas sent teams to Egypt on Sunday after the arrival on Saturday of CIA Director William Burns, whose presence underlined rising U.S. pressure for a deal that would free Israeli hostages held in Gaza and get aid to Palestinian civilians. Qatari representatives also attended.

“There is no change in the position of the occupation (Israel) and therefore, there is nothing new in the Cairo talks,” the Hamas official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. “There is no progress yet.”

Western powers have voiced concern over the high Palestinian civilian death toll and the humanitarian crisis arising from Israel’s military onslaught to destroy Hamas in the densely populated Gaza Strip.
