An obstacle course that spanned three continents just to process something as simple as ordering dinner from UberEats

I was born in Sri Lanka, live in the US, and visit my home country often. The very idea of having to get a visa to a country I lived in for a greater part of my life is discomforting. Nevertheless, in order to comply, three weeks before I travelled, I went through the process. No different from thousands of others. However this time, it turned out to be a bizarre obstacle course set up by an Indian outfit masked behind a bunch of acronyms.

Herath highlighted that the broad economic crisis has now evolved into a debt crisis. He criticised the prevailing focus on debt management, which he believes has led to a misconception that the ideal Presidential candidate is one who excels in debt management.

“This is wrong. No matter who is appointed, he must manage debt, but the reason for choosing a new President should not be his ability to manage debt. It should be someone with a broad vision to manage the economy,” Herath asserted.

He warned that economic management has been overshadowed by an excessive focus on debt management.

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said the government has adopted a double policy, even though the president claims to share pressure with transparency and balance.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said this while responding to his speech in Parliament on Tuesday (02).

Although the president claims to share pressures with transparency and balance, the government has adopted dual policy.

A policy on international bailouts and a different policy for the people of this country have been implemented.

Countries such as Ghana, Jamaica and Ecuador have been in harmony with the country and the people, but the president and the government of our country have not been able to achieve such compliance.

At one point, he said that Sri Lanka's debt restructuring was completed very quickly compared to other countries.

It lies. Countries such as Ghana, Argentina, Ecuador, Mongolia, Belize and Barize have implemented credit restructuring processes in a short time before our country.

At least 116 people, many of them women and children, were killed in a stampede at a Hindu religious gathering in north India on Tuesday, authorities said, in one of the country’s worst such tragedies in years.

The stampede happened in a village in Hathras district, about 200 km (125 miles) southeast of the national capital New Delhi, where authorities said thousands had gathered in sweltering late afternoon temperatures.

“The incident happened due to overcrowding at the time when people were trying to leave the venue,” Ashish Kumar, administrator of the Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, told reporters.

Chaitra V., another senior state official, told broadcaster India Today that people may have lost their footing as they sought water in the heat.

“There was wet mud at one place where people may have slipped. Also because of the heat, people may have made their way to the spot where water was kept and that could have caused the incident as well,” she said.
