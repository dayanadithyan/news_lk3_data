A rare and massive comet with a devilish nickname is set to pass by Earth for the first time in 71 years and may be visible during the highly anticipated April 8 total solar eclipse, according to NASA.

Officially named comet 12P/Pons-Brooks, the cryovolcanic comet is known as the "devil comet" due to its formation of two "horns" made up of ice and gas and periodic explosions.

Comets are made up of dust, frozen gases, ice and rocks bound together following the formation of the solar system, NASA says.

The devil comet is heading for its next perihelion passage, when it will reach its closest point to the sun and shine the brightest, on April 21, according to NASA. The agency says this astronomical event coincides with the April 8 total solar eclipse in North America, which will shadow parts of the United States from Texas to Maine when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth.

### To whom and to support the upcountry parties?

*2024-03-19 10:34:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179092) ┬╖ `ta`

The upcountry parties' role and support are a topic of debate. National parties are forming alliances, with the Tamil Progressive Alliance and Ceylon Workers Congress showing shifts in their political stances. The TNA has signed an agreement with Sajith, focusing on social justice and land rights, raising questions about the government's responsibilities. The CWC's support for President Wickremesinghe over the UNP indicates a shift in alliances. The TNA's demands, including housing, salaries, and land rights, highlight the government's obligations. The situation suggests a complex political landscape with shifting alliances and demands for social justice.

In this case, what is the point of the upcountry political parties. The Tamil Progressive Alliance, which is already a coalition, is working in favor of the Sajith -led United People's Power. The Ceylon Workers Congress initially supported the coalition of many parties called the PA. Now, it is directly supporting President Ranil Wickremesinghe. For that, the CWC cannot be assumed to support the United National Party.

In this case, the radiation engine is often damaged and the person who is not here is unable to get treatment on the day since it is not here from Jaffna or Colombo.

As a result, the hospital has to go to the hospital in the morning and wait till night and get treated for the night.

Therefore, the machine should have been appointed here as the machine is often damaged and the patients have to wait until the engineer is dark or three days later.

Therefore, the hospital administration focused on this and obtained a solution to this.

WCIC Strategy Consultant Tusitha Kumarakulasingam shared that many women were of the view that reporting such incidents may jeopardise their professional advancement or result in retaliation from

### тАЬSri LankaтАЩs political discourse and ageismтАЭ: A response

I read with great appreciation the Editorial titled тАЬSri LankaтАЩs political discourse and ageismтАЭ appearing in the Weekend FT of 16 March 2024 (https://www.ft.lk/ft_view__editorial/Sri-Lanka-s-political-discourse-and-ageism/58-759554).

I would like to make the following comments based on your Editorial.

I am in total agreement of your last sentence where you prophetically warn of the dangers of ageism.

I had made a comment two years ago (attached herewith) on similar lines.

In this comment I specifically focused on тАШoldтАЩ politicians (not by age but by duration of involvement in politics) and their continued adherence to тАШoldтАЩ political ideas (once again not due to age but due to outdated political economic and other ideas and not changing them to benefit the citizens of Sri Lanka).

### Political parties good for democracy; but not cults, fiefdoms and extremists

*2024-03-18 23:15:47* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Political-parties-good-for-democracy-but-not-cults-fiefdoms-and-extremists/4-759636) ┬╖ `en`

Although there is growing public disillusionment with party politics in a democracy and a renewed cry for a different system of governance, the majority support for party politics remains

Whilst there has been no grave damage to Sri LankaтАЩs democracy, to date, because of the activities of political parties, there are tell-tale signs of the emergence of cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men who are using party power in testing the limits of the Constitution. The voting citizens must be wary of such moves. Dissociation from cults of personality and fiefdoms is a must. Political parties are essential institutions of democracy

The heading in the Daily Mirror of 18 March 2024, тАЬPublic Trust in Parliament and Political Parties Reaches All Time LowтАЭ, begs the question of the appropriateness, and efficacy, of political parties in democratic Sri Lanka. Further, the lack of consensus among political parties in most matters heightens these concerns.

### Three ways boards can drive data centricity

*2024-03-18 23:00:28* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Three-ways-boards-can-drive-data-centricity/4-759633) ┬╖ `en`

How do data-centric enterprises set themselves apart from their peers?

Boards can help companies accelerate the shift toward the next generation of data and analytics for a competitive advantage

Organisations are entering a new frontier of data and analytics, which will drive pivotal decisions, processes and interactions. Unsurprisingly, more than half (57%) of Asia-Pacific senior executives in the 2022 biannual EY study, Tech Horizon, identified data and analytics as their top investment priority in the next two years, up from 31% in 2020. WhatтАЩs more, tech-enabled transformations in the region that exceed expectations are predicted to yield an average annual revenue growth of 6.2%, compared with 5.4% for transformations that fall short of expectations.

### Mitigating climate-related sovereign risk to accelerate action on the climate emergency

*2024-03-18 22:56:27* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Mitigating-climate-related-sovereign-risk-to-accelerate-action-on-the-climate-emergency/14-759632) ┬╖ `en`

https://www.asiapathways-adbi.org: Climate change poses a serious threat to the development of countries and can have material impacts on sovereign risk. Sovereign risk refers to the probability that a country may not be able to pay its debts. However, since the global financial crisis, interactions between fiscal balances, public and private debt, and the financial sector have proven to be very complex. Sovereign risk reflects this complexity.

For example, the devastating floods in Pakistan in 2022 were caused by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains and faster melting of glaciers. They killed more than 1,700 people, left half a million homeless, and cost around $30 billion. The events led to MoodyтАЩs revising downward PakistanтАЩs sovereign credit rating by one notch, citing amplified liquidity and debt sustainability risks alongside falling foreign exchange reserves.

Global inequality is at an all time high. According to a recent Oxfam report (Inequality Inc. January 2024), the richest 1% of the world owns 43% of global assets; the worldтАЩs richest five men have doubled their wealth since the onset of the pandemic while five billion people have been made poorer. Ever-reducing wages (for workers), tax concessions and evasion (for/by corporates), and the privatization of public services has concentrated wealth and power in corporates, increasing their influence in every policy domain, says Oxfam.

### Trump unable to get $464m bond in New York fraud case, his lawyers say

*2024-03-18 22:33:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/international/Trump-unable-to-get-464m-bond-in-New-York-fraud-case-his-lawyers-say/107-279090) ┬╖ `en`

New York, March 18 (BBC) - Donald Trump's lawyers have said finding a bond to cover the $464m (┬г365m) judgement in his New York fraud case is a "practical impossibility".

A judge ordered Mr Trump to pay the penalty in February for falsely inflating the value of his assets.

Mr Trump offered to post a smaller bond of $100m while he appeals, but that request was denied.

In a filing on Monday, his lawyers said they had approached 30 companies to back the bond without success.

"The amount of the judgement, with interest, exceeds $464m, and very few bonding companies will consider a bond of anything approaching that magnitude," his lawyers wrote in the nearly 5,000-page filing.

They are asking a judge to put the judgement on pause while Mr Trump appeals against the decision.

"The practical impossibility of obtaining a bond interferes with defendants' right to appeal," his lawyers said.

Mr Trump's two eldest sons also must pay millions of dollars in the case.
