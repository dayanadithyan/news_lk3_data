Due to the exclusion of several standardised components for modern cancer treatments in the original agreement, Sri Lankan oncologists recommended procuring advanced machines.

Do these migratory birds pick which project to hit or not hit, in this case they only hit the Adani wind project, is it?

The economic benefits of the Mannar project are substantial. It is expected to create 1,000 plus jobs, boosting the local economy. As are many infrastructural and developing projects of this nature developers are committed to working with local communities, addressing their concerns, and minimising disruption to their lives.

Furthermore, due to its wealth of natural and cultural resources, Sri Lanka has great potential for scaling up ethical, sustainable, and eco-friendly fashion—for example, through the use of natural dyes and fabrics or by repurposing factory waste and cutoffs.

It is the citizenry at the middle and lower end of the income scale who would be asked to bear the cost of this exercise rather dis-proportionately

“Don’t buy things you can’t afford with money you don’t have to impress people you don’t like”. This quote from Dave Ramsay which applies to individuals and families may as well apply to governments also. Why did Sri Lanka borrow so much, was there proper accounting of how it was spent, how many of the projects funded by borrowed money actually met the real needs of the country, and who really benefited, are all questions that still remain unanswered.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is in the process of starting spatial mapping on all tree species in the island nation before going for carbon credit trading in the global market, Senior Presidential Advisor on Climate Change Ruwan Wijewardene said.

The news conference was his first unscripted appearance after a disastrous debate with his rival Donald Trump, leading to calls from several Democratic politicians and donors for him to drop out of the race for president.

Mr Biden, 81, has faced continuous questions over his age and ability to serve another term, which intensified after the debate.

But at the highly anticipated news conference, he dismissed the concerns about his campaign that were posed again and again by a room full of reporters, and promised that he was fighting not for his legacy, but to finish the job he started when he took office in 2021.
