### All Blacks captain Cane to retire from international rugby

Sydney (AFP) - New Zealand captain Sam Cane will retire from Test rugby at the end of 2024, the side said Monday, calling time on a World Cup winning 12-year international career.

"Having played 95 Tests - 27 as captain - the 32-year-old has decided to focus on spending more time with family and sign a long-term contract with Suntory Goliath in Tokyo," New Zealand Rugby said in a statement.

The All Blacks haven't played since they were defeated in the Rugby World Cup final by South Africa last year and Cane was already on a sabbatical in Japan.

Cane said the prospect of a three-year deal with the high-spending Tokyo club was too good to pass up.

"I had to weigh up everything and, in the end, with a young family, it seemed like the best decision to help set up our future," he said.

"It was a very hard one because I love the teams that I represent here in New Zealand."

### Indonesia flood death toll rises to 41 with 17 missing

The number of people killed by flash floods and cold lava flow from a volcano in western Indonesia over the weekend has risen to 41 with 17 more missing, a local disaster agency official told AFP Monday.

Hours of heavy rain caused large volcanic rocks to roll down one of Indonesia’s most active volcanos into two districts on Sumatra island Saturday evening, while flooding inundated roads, homes and mosques.

“Data as of last night, we recorded 37 dead victims... But from this morning it has grown again, the figure reached 41 (dead),” Ilham Wahab, West Sumatra disaster mitigation agency official, told AFP.

Rescuers were searching for 17 still missing, three in Agam district and 14 in Tanah Datar, both the worst-hit areas of the flood and home to hundreds of thousands of people, he said.

Ilham could not confirm the number of locals evacuated because officials had encouraged “people to evacuate to relatives’ places, which are safer” than tent shelters in heavy rains.

The government is considering lifting this ban, which could benefit MPs once implemented.

### Tentative Recovery Of The Economy Will Not Be Stalled By The Presidential Election: Response To The Governor Of The Central Bank

*2024-05-13 09:10:19* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/tentative-recovery-of-the-economy-will-not-be-stalled-by-the-presidential-election-response-to-the-governor-of-the-central-bank/) · `en`

The Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka warned that the presidential election due later this year will stall tentative recovery from its economic crisis. This is a response to the above.

1. No element of substance in the warning by the Governor: The governor said, “Domestically, what I see as the challenge is to continue the same policies as we advance irrespective of the administration; this is an important one.” Furthermore, the Governor seems to agree with Wickremesinghe’s party’s concern that his two main rivals have said they want to renegotiate the terms of the IMF bailout, reduce taxes, and increase food and energy subsidies.

Two main rivals are JVP/NPP (Malimawa) and SJB. JVP/NPP and SJB have not stated that they will discontinue the IMF’s austerity measures. Instead, they want to renegotiate. Discontinuation and renegotiation are two entirely different things. It is up to JVP/NPP and SJB to renegotiate, as well as how and in what way.

“I am bringing to the attention of this house this massive fraud (visharler wanchawak).

The deal came despite procurement requirements and anti-corruption roadmap required in an International Monetary Fund deal, following a ‘governance diagnostic assessment’.

The votes from the Tamil and Muslim communities may determine who the 2024 Presidential hustings victor is likely to be

This is the fourth article in a series focusing on Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe and his evolving strategy to contest the forthcoming 2024 Presidential Elections. In a political climate where deliberate attempts are being made to mislead people about Wickremesinghe’s Presidential Election plans and prospects, the objective of this series is to analyse in detail the  game plan and stratagems adopted by Wickremesinghe to face the 2024 Presidential hustings. Since Wickremesinghe is the incumbent President, priority is being given to him. However, after this series is concluded, I do intend to write about other presidential aspirants and their election campaigns also in the future.

In a situation where the Sinhala vote is trifurcated, the Tamil and Muslim votes, if delivered en bloc, may determine who the 2024 Presidential hustings victor is likely to be

### Israel has lost its moral compass and conscience

*2024-05-13 05:22:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Israel-has-lost-its-moral-compass-and-conscience/172-282446) · `en`

A former IDF soldier, interviewed on another channel, admits that some of the IDF actions he witnessed in Gaza could amount to war crimes.

Most Israelis simply do not care about what happens to Arabs and Palestinians

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reflects this cynical insularity of the Israeli public

Protests against Israeli excesses in conducting its war against Hamas in Gaza are widening in scope daily. This is not a war against Hamas; it’s a total war against the Palestinians designed to drive them out of ‘Greater Israel.’

These protests are almost exclusively in the West. It isn’t that the rest of the world is deaf and blind to what’s going on. But this is a Western problem, because of the West’s troubled historical relationships with the Jews, culminating in a great deal of sympathy for Israel after its creation (essentially a Western creation because of British Middle Eastern politics after WWII).

### Who’s to blame for Ms. Diana’s flaws - EDITORIAL

*2024-05-13 05:20:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Whos-to-blame-for-Ms-Dianas-flaws-EDITORIAL/172-282445) · `en`

Oh dear, oh dear, a British citizen and non-Sri Lankan, MP Diana (not to be mistaken for Britain’s Princess Diana) has been unseated as a Member of our Parliament. O tempora, o mores we are once again being made the laughing stock of the world. A British citizen is not only a member of our Parliament, she is also a State Minister of this country.

The 60-year-old was (according to media reports) appointed a National List MP by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) in return for the transferring of control of the Ape Jathika Peramuna (AJP) to the SJB.

Ever-popular past Commissioner of Elections Mahinda Deshapriya -respected for his nonpartisan rulings during election controversies- and an expert on election practices, speaking to this newspaper days ago said: “Sri Lankan law only prevents a non-citizen from becoming a Member of Parliament, to contest an election, while the law also prohibits a non-citizen to vote in an election...”.

Indian High Commissioner Santos Jha: ‘The potential of India-Sri Lanka friendship is limitless’

Indian High Commissioner Santos Jha, in an interview with a select group of journalists, discusses the current status of bilateral ties and the future direction particularly with emphasis on connectivity.

Q  It has been a little over four months since you assumed duties as High Commissioner here. What are your initial impressions?

Coming to Sri Lanka as India’s High Commissioner was in some way a homecoming for me - in a role with greater responsibility. I was here from 2007-10 as Counsellor. Sri Lanka has always been close to my heart with many memories and several friends who will stay with me for the rest of my life.

Since December, I’ve had an action-packed 4-4.5 months. I’ve travelled the length and breadth of the country, met people across spheres - political, business, media, academia and so on - and everywhere I have experienced a sense of filial warmth.
