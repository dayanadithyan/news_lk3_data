The government’s plans to sell off certain national assets and state owned enterprises have given rise to discontent among trade unions, political parties and the general public. The present divestiture drive is ostensibly aimed at minimizing govt. expenditure on loss-making state owned enterprises and meeting certain IMF conditions in that regard. I ruled the country for more than nine years from November 2005 to January 2015 without ever selling a single state owned enterprise. In fact, my government actually re-acquired some state owned enterprises such as the Insurance Corporation, and Lanka Hospitals that had been sold off by previous governments and these enterprises continue to make profits for the state to date.

### Diana Gamage who came to Parliament on the Samagi Jana Balawegaya(SJB) National List, has been an MP for almost four years without being a citizen of any country.

*2024-05-12 06:28:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84019) · `en`

The Sri Lankan Supreme Court’s landmark judgment last week that State Minister of Tourism Diana Gamage was legally ineligible to serve as a Member of Parliament (MP) on the grounds that she was not a Sri Lankan citizen raises some crucial questions.

The Supreme Court gave the ruling after hearing an appeal filed by social activist Oshala Herath challenging the Appeal Court’s dismissal of his petition against Gamage’s membership in Parliament.

Gamage, who came to Parliament on the National List of the main Opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), began to support the then Gotabaya Rajapaksa Government.

Her support for the Government continued after Ranil Wickremesinghe took office as President and she was also appointed as State Minister of Tourism. She earned a dubious name for her ridiculously controversial speeches about the night economy and cannabis cultivation.

The Constitution states that a President who is elected by the people shall hold office for a term of five years. In the event of his death, resignation or removal, his successor shall be elected by Parliament to serve the unexpired period of his term of office. Any Bill that seeks to amend the Constitution to extend the prescribed term of office of the President is required to be passed by Parliament by a two-thirds majority and then approved by the people at a referendum. The Constitution also provides that the poll for the election of the President “shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months” before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office.
