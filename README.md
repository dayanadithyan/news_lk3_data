None contains none of the. Now the reservoir has bound. There is no need for the authorities. "

Fisheries Industry: 'Fish on paddy fields. Like the crash of the tsunami. '

The National Aquaculture Development Authority estimates that the reservoirs have been drifted away from the reservoirs due to reservoirs in January 2024.

According to the Senanayake Samudra, it has now reduced a yield of fish per day before spilling it, the fishermen said.

As a result, children's education has been hampered and unable to find the necessary costs for food, the fishermen said to the BBC Sinhala service.

However, there will take about another year to rebuild fish in the reservoirs.

Sri Lanka is celebrating 76 years of independence this year, and the country is just emerging from its worst ever economic crisis which erupted in 2022. With the support of the IMF Extended Fund Facility arrangement and debt restructuring, which aims to restore long-term public debt sustainability, the country is obligated to make certain structural economic policy reforms to avoid the repetition of a similar crisis in the future.

### Heatwaves and Dry Spell Warnings but no Remedial Alternatives - EDITORIAL

Sri Lanka is presently caught up in the middle of a heatwave. The Department of Meteorology had forecast the present spell of dry weather some months earlier. As is usual in our country, other than a few media outlets making passing mention of the forecast, neither the government nor the private sector has made plans to mitigate or counter the effects of the present spell of dry weather.

Even worse, the Meteorology Department authorities too are sending out mixed signals regarding the effects of the ‘heatwave’. On one hand, it warns the public to take protective measures by limiting exposure to the sun, recommends greater intake of liquids (water), etc, while at the same time claiming present conditions are merely statistics on a Heat Index.

### Navalny Died Trying to Politicise the Russians

The sudden, mysterious death of Aleksei Navalny, the charismatic Russian Opposition Leader imprisoned on trumped up charges, came as a shock to many. It’s not totally surprising, however, given the long list of Russians killed by gunmen or by poisoning over the past decade. They all have one thing in common, running afoul of the Kremlin (which is Vladimir Putin) for one reason or another.

The shadowy Yevgeny Prigozhin, Head of the Wagner Mercenary Group (with close ties to Putin) who led an armed rebellion against Putin from Ukraine in June 2023, died in a plane crash with top associates in August 2023.

Little noticed was the murder of Maksim Kuzminov, a Russian helicopter pilot who defected from the fighting in Ukraine. He was shot dead in February this year near Alicante in Spain. Spanish intelligence services accused the Kremlin of orchestrating the killing.

The reason for such mockery aimed at the recent taxes is the sheer disregard by the government for the two main principles of taxation, namely fairness and consistency

These days, tax has become the talk of the town, the laughing-stock and the attractive subject matter for cartoonists. The general public perceives it as a ‘legalized robbery’ executed by the state using rules and regulations, backed by the threat of legal consequences for non-compliances.

The reason for such mockery aimed at the recent taxes, is the sheer disregard by the government of the two main principles of taxation, namely the fairness (ability to pay) and consistency.

This perception of ‘legalized robbery’ is gaining momentum among the general public especially in the backdrop of the unparalleled financial crisis and sky-rocketing cost of living, while the income of the public has been drastically slashed.

Sri Lanka cannot promote its export sector while having an unproductive tariff structure and restrictions on imports

No country can get out of poverty, or indebtedness without having sustained economic expansion. It is the economic surplus that is produced that will be used to reduce poverty through new investments and repay the creditors without being indebted further. However, growth is necessary but not sufficient to sustain the expansion of an economy. Growth will produce a higher volume of goods and services for consumption by people. But unless the people within the country have purchasing power to buy the same, producers will find that they are saddled with unsold stocks

The Ukrainian leader said that he wouldn’t disclose the number of troops that were wounded or missing. He also said that “tens of thousands of civilians” had been killed in occupied areas of Ukraine, but said that no exact figures would be available until the war was over.

“We don’t know how many of our civilians they killed. We don’t,” he said.

Pope Francis on Sunday called for a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine that would lead to a just and lasting peace, as the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion was marked a day earlier.

“So many victims, wounded, destruction, anguish, and tears in a period that is becoming terribly long and whose end is not in sight. It is a war that not only devastates that region but also unleashes global waves of hate and fear”, Pope Francis said during his weekly Angelus message.

“I plead for that little bit of humanity to be found to create the conditions for a diplomatic solution in search of a just and lasting peace”, he said.

Heads of the Group of Seven major democracies on Saturday pledged to stand by war-weary Ukraine, and Western leaders travelled to Kyiv to show solidarity on the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion.

Francis said he was also concerned about escalating violence in the east region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

### Navigating The Economic Reawakening & Sustainable Growth

By any standard, Sri Lanka is recovering from economic bankruptcy today, though chief economic policymakers seem to be disputing the claim of bankruptcy.i In the case of a private venture, bankruptcy means inability to honour financial obligations to outsiders due to its financial net worth becoming negative. By the same token, the bankruptcy of a country means that it is not able to honour its debt obligations to foreign creditors or a given segment of foreign creditors.

In April 2022, Sri Lanka announced that it will not honour the debt servicing obligations – that is, repayment of the principal and payment of interest on the debt when they become due – in the case of two selected foreign creditors, commercial and bilateral creditors. Since then, several policy measures have been taken by Sri Lankan authorities to get out of the economic crisis and place the country on a sustainable growth path.
