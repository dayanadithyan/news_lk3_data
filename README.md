He said pet animals regulate their body temperature by panting. When the panting is not sufficient to get their temperature down, they can go on to develop heatstroke, he said.

Panting (this can progress to distressed or noisy breathing as the heatstroke worsens), restlessness or agitation, pacing, seeking shade or water, drooling, red gums, increased heart rate, and vomiting or diarrhoea can be mentioned as early signs of heatstroke in pet animals.

### APAC economies and commodity exporters most exposed to China stress scenario: Fitch

Fitch Ratings believes that economies in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) and commodity exporters would be particularly affected under a severe downside stress scenario in China. There would also be a dampening effect on international price pressures.

FitchтАЩs analysis released last week, based on internal modelling using the Oxford Economics Global Economic Model, sees vulnerabilities in Vietnam, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, through their strong economic linkages with China.

It also suggests Middle Eastern energy exporters, such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar and Oman, would see slower real GDP growth. However, this does not capture factors such as QatarтАЩs long-term LNG supply contracts, which we think should make its exports less sensitive to short-term shifts in Chinese demand, limiting the hit to its GDP.

Of the two countries that at each otherтАЩs throats now - Russia and Ukraine - it is Ukraine which appears to be the underdog despite massive American and Western arms aid.

While the Russian economy is growing despite severe US and European sanctions, Ukraine is facing a major arms and manpower shortage with dim chances of being rectified.

Given the possibility of Donald Trump returning to power in the US, even the current level of Western support to Ukraine may not be forthcoming. And unlike Russia, Ukraine has no indigenous capability to sustain itself, whether economically or militarily.

On the other contrary, Russia, has been able to circumvent the sanctions and keep its economy humming, according the Vienna Institute of International Economic Studies (VIIEC). And there has also been no let-up in its military efforts.

### NPP support surge linked to opposition weakness

*2024-03-12 23:23:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/NPP-support-surge-linked-to-opposition-weakness/108-278719) ┬╖ `en`

Colombo, March 12 (Daily Mirror) - The surge in the support for the National People's Power (NPP) led by Anura Kumara Dissanayaka can be attributed to the weakness of the Opposition, Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said.

The primary opposition should be prepared to assume governance. However, this opposition prepared prematurely.

Therefore, the emergence of a third party became prominent as uncertainty loomed over the effectiveness of the opposition.

As a result, the main opposition's only course of action may be to collaborate with the ruling party. If they choose not to unite without careful consideration, several key leaders from the main opposition may opt to join the government.

However, the selection of the common opposition or the President will be made by the Members of Parliament based on their personal opinions, but there is no relevance to being in the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or any other political party.
