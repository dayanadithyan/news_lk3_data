11 districts in the country are found in plantations. All those lands manage 22 companies. However, the companies are managing in violation of the human rights of the plantation people. Vadivel Suresh said a new law should be established against this.

He was speaking at a debate on regulations under the Justice Department Act on Tuesday (23) in Parliament.

All the common laws for other communities in the country should be paid to the upstate community as well as the salary of labor for them. Plantation companies are scratched despite the president's order. Plantation companies have gone to court against the salary increase, and now the salary increase has been issued.. I see it as one of the worlds that are nowhere to be held in the world. This is an injustice that has happened to the people of the hill country.

### Thousands of migrant kids reach Canary Islands alone; officials seek Spain’s help

The children sometimes won’t stop crying. Health workers dealing with migrants arriving on Spain’s Canary Islands try to understand if the tears are from illness, injury or, as is often the case, from pure shock.

One young Senegalese boy who disembarked recently kept fainting every few minutes, troubling doctors who couldn’t determine the cause. Other migrants finally explained: the boy had witnessed both parents die during the arduous boat voyage from West Africa. Their bodies were thrown overboard into the Atlantic Ocean.

“There’s no medicine for that,” said Inmaculada Mora Peces, a 54-year-old emergency doctor who treats migrants arriving on the island of El Hierro.

Mora Peces is among a growing number of people sounding the alarm as the archipelago struggles to deal with thousands of teenagers and children traveling alone to the European Union territory from Senegal, Mali, and other African nations, fleeing poverty, conflict and instability.
