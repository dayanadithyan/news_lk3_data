Illegal fishing harms marine life like turtles and dolphins, often leading to death from suffocation, injuries, and scale loss.

The Department of Wildlife Department said that marine boobs such as turtles and dolphins are killed in illegal fishing in the country's waters.

Sea breasts, including all the fish, die because of fish using prohibited nets.

In this case, department officials have recovered 10 turtle bodies within a week in the western coast.

An autopsy on the bodies of the recovered turtle has died due to difficulty in breathing, wounds and scales, wildlife veterinarians said.

Illegal fishing systems are not only destroyed by sea turtles, but also harmful to marine breasts such as dolphins.

Therefore, the Department of Wildlife has called for the public to be concerned about illegal fishing activities to protect the marine breasts and to inform the relevant authorities.

When promising ventures fall short of an investorтАЩs expectations, bridging the funding gap seems near impossible. Here, are some of the major culprits behind fundraising failures.

News media reports that the Power and Energy Ministry is to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Indian Government relating to the planned Indo-Lanka cross-strait power grid connectivity within a few months.

### False Terrorism Cases Enable Repression; Politically Motivated Detentions, Surveillance, Threats

Sri Lankan authorities continue to use the notorious Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to target perceived opponents and minority communities without credible evidence to support the allegations despite repeated pledges to end the practice, Human Rights Watch said today. While some victims have suffered years of arbitrary detention and torture, others are persecuted even after the case against them is dropped.

The law, widely known as the PTA, has provisions allowing for extended administrative detention, limited judicial oversight, and inadequate protections against torture. In a 2022 speech to the United Nations Human Rights Council, the then foreign minister pledged a moratorium on its use, but under President Ranil Wickremesinghe, detentions under the PTA have continued. Such is the chilling effect of the law that in September 2023 the International Monetary Fund found that тАЬbroad application of counter-terrorism rulesтАЭ restricts civil society scrutiny of official corruption.
