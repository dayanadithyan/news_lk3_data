### Remembering Mervyn de Silva on his 25th Death Anniversary

*2024-06-21 03:51:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/remembering-mervyn-de-silva-on-his-25th-death-anniversary/) ¬∑ `en`

When Mervyn de Silva left us on 22nd June 1999, it was not just the twentieth century that was drawing to a close. In retrospect one could sense, and now we know, that with his passing, an era in the literary history of Sri Lanka had ended. Because he was the last of a golden age of journalism, an illustrious tradition of English journalism in Sri Lanka that gave us H. A. J. Hulugalle, Jayantha Padmanabha, Tarzie Vittachi and Denzil Peiris. They were brilliant editors who provided us with not just world-class newspapers; they were also erudite men who helped build a Ceylonese literati that any society can be proud of.

I make no apologies for repeating what I have written before on my editor, my guru, my role model and my friend Mervyn de Silva, because all of it remains just as valid as it did a quarter of a century ago. The defining attributes of Mervyn and their importance bear repetition and deserve considered reflection.

üü©

We have provided state banks to provide bank loans to private university students. However, action will be taken to address the delay in it. Minister of Education Susil Prema Jayantha said that I have held a personal negotiation with the Chairman and Manager of the Bank of Ceylon in this regard.

Responding to a question raised by opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, the bank loan issued to students admitted to private universities has been severely delayed.

Students who are not eligible for state universities are given to 4000 private university students annually.

There has been a delay in lending to the seventh student group as this loan continues. The Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank offer the loan to the eighth student group.

There is no problem in the central bank. However, the Bank of Ceylon is delaying it.I had a personal discussion with the manager of the bank for the past two days ago. I have also discussed it with the new chairman of the bank.

*2024-06-20 18:27:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186595) ¬∑ `ta`

Sarath Weerasekera criticizes the Women's Reinforcement Bill for lacking clear definitions of "female," arguing it contradicts Sri Lanka's Constitution and culture. He highlights issues with the bill during a parliamentary debate, questioning its alignment with the country's laws and cultural norms.

üü©

Attempts to occupy the country through culture are carried out through new bills. The Women's Reinforcement Bill is contrary to the country's Constitution and Culture. Sarath Weerasekera, chairman of the National Security Department's Supervisory Committee, said that there was not sufficient definitions in the Bill.

He said this while addressing the debate on the Women's Empowerment Bill held in Parliament on Thursday (20).

We have presented a number of complications regarding the women's reinforcement bill, but they are not submitted to the council by the relevant parties. Who is the female in this bill?The formal definition is not mentioned. The woman who is identified as a woman can only be given the status of the woman. The woman cannot be considered a woman who is born and transformed into a woman through medical care. Therefore, the definition of a woman in the bill is not clearly mentioned.
