The symbolic first jab was given to a baby girl named Daniella at a health facility near Yaoundé on Monday.

Every year 600,000 people die of malaria in Africa, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Cameroon is offering the RTS,S vaccine free of charge to all infants up to the age of six months old.

Patients require a total of four doses. Health officials say these will be given at the same time as other routine childhood vaccines to make it easier for parents.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka central bank kept its policy rate unchanged at 10 percent in the first monetary policy meeting in 2024 saying market rates should fall further.

The central bank has operated largely deflationary policy (selling down its Treasury bills portfolio against dollar inflows), preventing pressure on the currency and building reserves (running balance of payments surplus).

Over the past month, the exchange rate has appreciated, which may also help offset a 3 percent hike in value added tax in traded commodities, analysts say.

“The Board took note of the effects of the recent developments in taxation and supply-side factors that are likely to pose upside pressures on inflation in the near term,” a statement said.
