"When we study the operation of justice, we were born in the work we set up the community committees. We thought a new way.. I remember Sepu 30 September 30 was to finish it. Then, October 10 demanded lasting time. I was told by October 10. Just as the IGP said, it has not done that in some sides. We have false information. I take the best action against such police officers. Because if all the cops do not do this together, they did not do this work together. If there is anyone, we can't do this work.

(Daily Mail) - UK aid to China has fallen by 90% since 2019 ‚Äì but transparency about how the money is spent is declining, a watchdog has warned.

The Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI) found that engagement with Beijing across all of Government dropped from ¬£80 million at the start of this Parliament to an estimated ¬£8.2 million in 2023-2024.

However, there is only limited information in the public domain on how some aid funding, including the British Council‚Äôs to China, is being used, according to a report by the watchdog.

Transparency has further reduced this year with the decision to stop routinely publishing official development assistance (ODA)-eligible administration costs on a country-by-country basis, the ICAI said.

It follows a change in OECD guidelines on donor reporting of such costs, which now requires that donors do not assign them to a specific nation.

Russia and China on Friday vetoed a U.S.-sponsored United Nations resolution supporting ‚Äúan immediate and sustained cease-fire‚Äù in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, calling the measure ambiguous and saying it was not the direct demand to end the fighting that much of the world seeks.
