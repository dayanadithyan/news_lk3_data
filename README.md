State parties say that we have retrieved the country who defeated the country's economy. Fuel and gas rows were formed in the country due to the Central Bank robbery that day. If the robbery had not taken place, none of those rows would have been formed. The economic downturn would not have occurred. It is funny to say that those who have fallen in this situation have rescued the country.

“Additionally, the President highlighted the importance of promoting the Tamil language alongside Sinhala. He noted that with the anticipated economic growth in Tamil Nadu soon, Tamil-speaking Sri Lankans would have unique opportunities that others might not have.”

My salute to the people of Bangladesh led by their student youth, who have overthrown an autocrat in an unarmed uprising, sacrificing over 300 lives. We can also be proud of ourselves as Sri Lankans, since the autocrat mentioned our Aragalaya as an inspiration for the Bangladeshi youth. So much for so-called ‘anti-imperialists’ who revile it and are suspicious of People’s Power revolts.

In Sri Lanka’s election season, wannabe tyrants should tremble, and be deterred from any power-grab they may be planning.

TV news has shown President Wickremesinghe saying repeatedly on his recent visits to the North and East that “in this country we have 10 governments, 9 of which are Provincial Governments”.
