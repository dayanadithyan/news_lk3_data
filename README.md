### Indian Lok Sabha election - a view

*2024-06-07 01:24:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185482) ¬∑ `ta`

In the recently concluded Indian Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, did not secure the expected 400 seats but still achieved a significant majority. This result limits the BJP's ability to unilaterally implement reforms. Despite this, Modi was re-elected for a third term. The election saw several surprises, including independent candidates winning against major parties. For instance, Amrit Pal Singh, despite being imprisoned, won in the Katur Sahib constituency, and Mohammed Haneefa triumphed in Ladakh over both Congress and BJP candidates. These outcomes highlight the dynamic nature of Indian politics and the potential for independent voices to impact electoral results positively.

üü©

The completed Indian Lok Sabha election has many interesting features. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been ruling in India for the past ten years, and the Prime Minister of the party, Narendra Modi, have not received 400 seats in the NDA's campaign.. Instead, only a large -scale majority to rule is to the people.

This has created an environment where the BJP is no longer able to decide for reforms in the country.. Although Indian voters have been given the opportunity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the third time.This time the BJP and the party's Prime Minister Narendra Modi have made the position that Telugu Desam Party leader Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, the leader of the United Janata Party, can be operated only after consultation.. Political observers have said that this is healthy for democracy.

### Why people shouldn‚Äôt fear  ‚ÄòMr. Talent‚Äô - EDITORIAL

*2024-06-07 00:53:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Why-people-shouldnt-fear-Mr-Talent-EDITORIAL/172-284317) ¬∑ `en`

These are days when people are working hard to make ends meet; even when the spouse is employed too. With regard to those frequenting the corridors of power, they too are working immensely hard to be in power when the next government is formed.

There was a recent meme (an image, video or piece of text) on Facebook which portrayed two candidates who are likely to bid for the presidency at the next big election. The one with a love for nature photography was saying ‚ÄòIt would be my way only and there is no asking questions‚Äô. The other was saying the total opposite. He states in the meme, ‚ÄúAsk any question and I‚Äôll give the answer again and again till you understand‚Äù. Great talent is needed to remain as a politician who wields power in the future because this is an era of discourse; not one of orders.

### Slaughter of the Gaza lamb: Israeli Pharaoh‚Äôs crimes against children

*2024-06-07 00:39:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Slaughter-of-the-Gaza-lamb-Israeli-Pharaohs-crimes-against-children/172-284316) ¬∑ `en`

Palestinian children carry water containers in the Jabalia refugee camp, in the northern Gaza Strip.

On Tuesday, June 4, the day the world was supposed to mark the International Day of Innocent Children Victims of Aggression, the silence of the pro-Israeli world powers was deafening. In Gaza, the day had little meaning as there was no let-up in the slaughter of Palestinian children.

The day is marked as a poignant reminder to all nations that they should not cause physical, mental, or emotional harm to children. The day calls on UN member states to recommit themselves to ending all forms of violence against children.

There was little or no attempt by most Israeli-friendly nations to make use of the day to issue a powerful statement calling the Zionist aggressor to stop its slaughter of the lambs in Gaza. They probably feared that if they did so, they would only expose Israel as the post-World War II world‚Äôs most gruesome child killer.

Meanwhile, in 1993, the Cabinet resolution on the issue of Kalmunai has been working as a Divisional Secretariat for 30 years.. I ask that the cabinet decision be passed by Hansat. I am asking why the government will not take action to appoint an accountant on this issue and solve the issue.

United People's Power Parliamentarian Kabir Haseem said that it was fun to support the PA in the Ceylon Electricity Board Reforms Bill.

He was speaking at a debate on the Ceylon Electricity Board Reorganization Bill held in Parliament on Thursday (06).

The Electricity Board (CEB) has made various allegations regarding the bill. The Electricity Board Trade Unions and Engineers say they have not been given enough time to investigate this. They also say that they did not discuss with them properly.

It has been brought to the Parliamentary Supervisory Committee two days ago. The court has also announced this. In this case, it is improper to bring the bill in a hurry.

Meanwhile, in August 2020, the electricity tariff was increased by 66 per cent. Then increased by 88 percent in October 2023. This was followed by an increase of cost by 18 percent. So that 5 lakhs of low incomes were cut off. This is what happened.

A proposed 1,700 rupee salary hike for plantation workers, announced via a May 21st gazette notification, faces opposition from employers who claim financial strain. Despite a court appeal hearing on June 3rd, no interim injunction was issued against the wage increase. Workers await confirmation of the new rate, but plantation administrators insist the old salaries will apply due to the completion of this month's payroll before the announcement.

üü©

The 1,700 rupee salary hike for plantation workers is suspected of getting workers on the 10th of this month.

The Secretary of the Ministry of Labor issued a gazette notification on May 21 to pay a daily salary of Rs 1,700 for plantation workers.

The Plantation Employers Federation was opposed to the fact that it could not afford the workers. The 21 plantation companies have filed a case in the Court of Appeal, challenging the salary increase gazette.

The Court of Appeal, which was heard by the case on the 03rd, ruled that an interim injunction was not issued against the Gazette.

In the meantime, workers are hoping that the monthly salary will be made at Rs 1,700.

However, the final account of this month's salary was completed by the plantation administrations on Wednesday 05th. Therefore, plantation union leaders say the old salary will be available.

Plantation administrations have told union leaders and union leaders that they have not been able to get any round of salary increases.

If political business is earning more profit than country‚Äôs industries, that country will never prosper but will manufacture menace

After the war when I was appointed as the Competent Authority in Wanni, I treated all the communities equally. In fact I gave preference to Tamil community

Military intelligence should not be there to find out the details of politicians, opponent parties, but to hunt for economic opportunities even outside the country

Our defence policy or national security policy should be ‚ÄòActive Defence‚Äô

Poverty is the worst enemy and it is a breeding ground for terrorism

National Security is very wide spectrum. Before we go further we must understand national survival

If there is no national economy there cannot be national security

The age-old adage ‚ÄúOnce Bitten, Twice Shy‚Äù is a well-known and frequently used phrase of admonition that many Sri Lankans, especially those from the middle and upper strata of society, have grown up hearing during their school years. This often-repeated saying typically forms the lower rungs of a ‚Äùdisciplinary ladder‚Äù that, for many of us, ended with corporal punishment in the principal‚Äôs or headmaster‚Äôs office, depending on the title of the chief administrative officer at our respective schools.

It is that paranoia and panic which has provoked the General Secretary of UNP to call for the postponement of elections for two years. Although that call has drawn criticisms from several corners it did not come out of a vacuum.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Fitch Ratings has confirmed Sri Lanka-based Hatton National Bank PLC‚Äôs National Long-Term Rating at ‚ÄòA(lka)‚Äô with a stable outlook, saying the economy was stabilizing but it also had the highest exposure to defaulted sovereign bonds.

HNB‚Äôs high risk profile, similar to peers, stems from its large exposure to sovereign risk, via the defaulted foreign-currency denominated sovereign bonds which at 10 percent of assets by end 2023, was the highest among local banks.

Another 33 percent of assets iwere rupee-denominated treasury securities, all of which make the bank vulnerable to the sovereign‚Äôs repayment capacity and liquidity position.

‚ÄúFitch expects HNB‚Äôs impaired (stage 3) loans to decrease in the near to medium term, buttressed by the improvement in borrower repayment capacity alongside the economic recovery and Fitch‚Äôs anticipated expansion in the bank‚Äôs loan book,‚Äù Fitch said.

### Sri Lanka Bank of Ceylon ‚ÄòA(lka)‚Äô rating confirmed

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs Fitch Ratings has confirmed an ‚ÄòA(lka)‚Äô rating of Bank of Ceylon saying the operating environment was improving but the exposure to state was high.

‚ÄúBOC‚Äôs asset-quality metrics remain highly influenced by the sovereign‚Äôs credit profile due to the bank‚Äôs large sovereign exposure via its loans, off-balance-sheet liabilities and securities holdings,‚Äù Fitch said.

About 60 percent of bank assets were exposed to the sovereign risk profile.

The bank had provided 55 percent for defaulted sovereign bonds which were 2 percent of its assets.

The bank‚Äôs core asset-quality metric ‚Äì impaired (stage 3) loan ratio ‚Äì increased to 13.5 percent by end-1Q24 (end-2023: 12.6 percent, 2021: 10.2 percent) primarily due to a contraction in gross loans.

‚ÄúWe estimate this ratio to be significantly higher if BOC‚Äôs foreign-currency loan exposure to the state and state-owned entities is included,‚Äù Fitch said.
