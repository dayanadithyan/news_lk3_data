Just a few weeks ago, the men from Havelock Town came well prepared to take on the dominating and unbeaten Ceylonese Rugby and Football Club, and turned the chips in their favour to bamboozle the home team in the first half. Being the second team on that weekend that believed in the old saying “the best form of defence is attack”, they pounced on the Hosts from the word go, before the red Jerseys could ever think of settling down.

Independence Day would be a day of joy and happiness. But that has not been so for the Ilankaith Thamizhar of Sri Lanka for many, many years – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Sri Lanka known formerly as Ceylon gained independence from British rule on 4 February 1948. The island nation celebrates the 76th anniversary of her “tryst with destiny” on Sunday. Events marking freedom day festivity are scheduled for the week-end.

Even as the greater part of the island is enveloped in a melodious mood, a discordant note is struck in the Tamil dominated Northern Province and the Tamil majority Eastern Province. The Jaffna University Students Union and organisations representing the families of disappeared persons have proclaimed 4 February 2024 as a “Kari Naal” (black or dark day) and declared it as a day of mourning.

### Electoral prospects spark optimism for Sri Lanka’s underprivileged

The forthcoming general election holds promise for Sri Lanka’s impoverished majority – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

As the spectre of a general election looms over Sri Lanka, the political elite and the economically powerful are gripped with panic. Recent newspaper articles have been rife with speculations about the potential upheaval that such an election could bring. However, amidst their apprehension, it’s crucial to recognise that elections present a beacon of hope, particularly for the impoverished masses of Sri Lanka.

The anticipation of a general election has sent shockwaves through the corridors of power, primarily because it threatens to dismantle the entrenched privileges enjoyed by a select few. Despite the prevailing economic and debt crises plaguing the nation, a significant segment of society continues to benefit from a system riddled with corruption, mismanagement, and poor governance.

### Thai central bank chief says current policy rate neutral, economy not in crisis

*2024-02-02 05:31:23* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/Thai-central-bank-chief-says-current-policy-rate-neutral-economy-not-in-crisis/34-758064) · `en`

BANGKOK (Reuters): Thailand’s central bank chief, under fire from the prime minister for not cutting rates, said slower-than-expected economic growth was not a crisis as portrayed by the government, nor would it be revived by its quick-hit stimulus measures.

The Bank of Thailand’s current policy rate is broadly neutral, Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput told Reuters on Tuesday ahead of the central bank’s next rate meeting on 7 Feb. adding that the country was not facing a deflationary situation.

His comments came after Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin – a real estate mogul and political newcomer – urged the central bank to cut the policy rate, which is at a decade-high of 2.50%, to help revive the economy.

“If you want to raise the long-term potential growth rate, you’ve got to do the structural stuff. You’ve got to get productivity up. But the way to get there is not just by engaging in short-term stimulus type measures,” Sethaput said.

Colombo, Feb 01 (Daily Mirror) -  Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SriLankan Airlines Richard Nuttall, who responded to concerns over flight delays, said though the delays were in line with the world averages, there are more delays than used to be because of technical issues.

He said it is common for every airline to have delays but whenever there is a delay here, people tend to report it as it is the end of the world.

“Every airline has flight delays. If Qatar Airways has a flight delay, it is not reported in the press in Qatar,” he said.

He said SriLankan’s on-time performance was better than the average of the Oneworld carriers.

“Every time I have an AOG (Aircraft on Ground), everything about the ability of that aircraft to fly again is governed by very strict manuals and checks and balances.

### Fund cuts for UNRWA point to a clash of civilisations

Palestinian civilians including children stage a demonstration in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, calling for continued international support to UNRWA. AFP

Peace-loving people worldwide are probably sick and tired of seeing and hearing the triumph of evil and injustice. Each time they hoped for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip so that the besieged people could breathe the air of melancholic freedom, they were dealt yet another blow by the war party.

The latest is what followed the International Court of Justice’s ruling on January 26. The world court ruled by a majority decision that Israel should “take all measures within its power” to prevent acts of genocide in the Gaza Strip. The court also ordered Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Although it stopped short of ordering a ceasefire, most jurists believe a ceasefire is implied.

It’s about history that fades away quite fast in our brains, because the subject matter is boring beyond description, or it contains nothing worthwhile to be noted even in the last page of a notebook.

State Minister, Sanath Nishantha died under tragic circumstances on January 25 (Thursday) and his funeral rites were performed on the 28th (Sunday). Massive crowds were there to mourn his death and most stages of his funeral received wide media attention.

Colombo, Feb 01 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of the government failing to provide a concrete solution to their grievances, the health sector trade unions have decided to continue the island-wide strike till Friday (02 Feb.).

This was confirmed by Ravi Kumudesh, the Convenor of the Health Service Trade Unions.

The decision to extend the strike, according to Kumudesh, stems from the government's failure to grant reasonable allowances as granted to the doctors in the form of the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT).

This announcement follows the launch of a comprehensive one-day strike across the nation this morning (01 Feb.) by a consortium of 72 health sector trade unions, urging immediate attention from the authorities.

Despite the widespread participation in the strike, notable exceptions include the doctors’ unions and the All Ceylon Nurses’ Union, which have chosen to distance themselves from the collective action.
