### World’s lowest fertility rate plunges again in 2023 in South Korea

*2024-02-28 14:17:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Worlds-lowest-fertility-rate-plunges-again-in-2023-in-South-Korea/108-277891) · `en`

SEOUL, Feb 28 (Reuters) - South Korea's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, continued its dramatic decline in 2023, as women concerned about their career advancement and the financial cost of raising children decided to delay childbirth or to not have babies.

The average number of expected babies for a South Korean woman during her reproductive life fell to a record low of 0.72 from 0.78 in 2022, data from Statistics Korea showed on Wednesday.

That is far below the rate of 2.1 per woman needed for a steady population and well behind the rate of 1.24 in 2015 when concerns about issues such as the cost of housing and education were lower.

Since 2018, South Korea has been the only Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) member with a rate below 1, defying the billions of dollars spent by the country to try to reverse the trend that led the population to decline for a fourth straight year in 2023.

### Why the Sri Lankan economy is in crisis, while the cause is not addressed

The idea in a Balance of Payments crisis, is to enhance exports to earn more foreign exchange, but the solutions put forward do not direct the economy in such a direction

Though it is now almost two years since the economic crisis blew over, Sri Lanka has not yet addressed the real cause of the crisis and is seeking solutions for the symptoms, while the cause lies elsewhere.

What is most frightening is that the solutions that are being acted on would cause greater damage to the economy to a point where it would totally be out of control, with no way out, even if we wanted to get back to a development path.

The past two years was valuable time that Sri Lanka had, to devise a way forward, which was lost in seeking solutions that were not related to the crisis. All the effort of the Government is to be able to go back to borrowing again and fall into a bigger mess.

### Marx, Ants and Hyde Park Rally - EDITORIAL

*2024-02-28 00:15:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Marx-Ants-and-Hyde-Park-Rally-EDITORIAL/172-277840) · `en`

Karl Marx was right, Socialism works, it is just that he had the wrong species– Edward Osborne Wilson

The argument put forwarded by Edward O. Wilson, the father was Socio-biology, was that altruism which is the very foundation of socialism, does not come naturally to human beings. Commenting on this subject in his book, “The Ants”, Wilson maintained that while altruism works for species like ants and bees, humans who are naturally selfish are unable to completely adjust to Socialism.

The above quote of Wilson was recited last Saturday to a packed audience at the Hyde Park in Colombo by Sugeeshwara Bandara who made his political debut that day.

Attributing the fall of the former USSR regime of Russia to the same theory, Bandara said forcing people to accept Socialist ways makes people frustrated and kills the spirit of innovation.
