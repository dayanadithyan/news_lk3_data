Sri Lankans as a whole haven’t read enough about politics or believe too much about its abilities that it’s the cure for all ills; otherwise, Sri Lankans would not have been cheated by their lawmakers for 76 long years! Now, we are trying to ‘read’ Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the National People’s Power. We have already read the Wickremesinghe chapter, and only the former hints that all the government’s stolen monies will be brought back and the culprits punished, when a new government assumes power.

We voters have an issue. We don’t demand that the lawmaker talks the truth. When the two Chapters of the highest Buddhist Order of this island nation started giving enough hints of late that politicians cannot be trusted, many thought that this call came very late.

### 2024-03-06 (Wednesday)

### Defense sharing should not split the country and make power sharing from the dark age -Foreign Minister insists on

*2024-03-06 23:59:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178124) · `ta`

Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabri emphasizes the importance of power devolution in Sri Lanka, arguing it's crucial for national unity and progress. He cites Sri Lanka's economic recovery post-crisis and India's stabilization under Manmohan Singh as examples. Sri Lanka's multi-ethnic community, including Tamils, Muslims, and Sinhalese, can progress together, with the Tamil National People's Front advocating for a political solution. The minister warns against the dangers of language-based division, referencing Colvin R.D. Silva's warning against a war that could have been avoided if Tamil-Sinhala languages were declared royal in 1956. He calls for all political parties to focus on the country's welfare over politics, highlighting the need for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address war-related issues without external interference.

🟩

Devolution of power does not split the country. Therefore, political parties should dedicate their position on the sharing of power and refer to the country for the country.. If ethnic harmony is confirmed only can the country progress. Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabri said devolution of power should be made possible to get out of the dark era.

He was speaking at a debate on the Taxes Bill on Wednesday (6) in Parliament.

Sri Lanka is an excellent example of what will happen if you make popular decisions in the economy and what will happen if timely economic policies change. The people of the country will take the benefit of taking strict resolutions to recover from the economic crisis.

India faced the worst economic crisis in 1991. The then Prime Minister of India Narasinghe Rao. Manmohan Singh appointed Finance Minister and stabilized India's economy. Since 1991, many political parties have ruled India but economic policy has not been changed for political purposes.

### Finding solutions to manage the talent drain

President (then Prime Minister) pointed out in 2016 that “given the future growth potential and envisaged development plans, Sri Lanka will have to overcome the scarcity of skilled human resources apart from managing power and water requirements”. Sri Lanka eight years later is still looking for sustainable Human Resource solutions

Official records suggest that over 1.1 million Sri Lankans have left the country in 2022 with a monthly average of about 94,000 while only 27.6% of total departures have left for foreign employment purposes, most of them low- and semi-skilled workers. In 2023, around 300,000. However there is evidence that middle-class professionals joined the exodus in 2022 and 2023 thinking that the country would take years to recover. Overall critical sectors like healthcare, banking sector and information technology increasingly struggle with talent shortages.

### How Anura and the NPP are winning the public imagination

*2024-03-06 23:00:25* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/How-Anura-and-the-NPP-are-winning-the-public-imagination/4-759230) · `en`

The secret of Anura Kumara Dissanayaka and the NPP’s success, the reason why the combination is drawing record crowds and is the only political entity in the field to do so, is really simple. It’s the public imagination, stupid!

Anura and the NPP have seized the public imagination in a way that nobody in this election year has. They have done so, not by resorting to base invocations of race and religion as Gotabaya Rajapaksa did. They have done so, because they are not boring while almost all others are; they have not lost credibility as all others have; they are interesting and have social energy while the others are tired and lack authentic passion; they have a positive message which motivates and mobilises while others are shrilly negative, imaginatively timid, stale and samey.

Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley will suspend her presidential campaign on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with her plans, ensuring that Donald Trump will win the Republican nomination and once again face Democratic President Joe Biden in November’s election.

Haley will give a speech at 10 a.m. local time (1500 GMT) to address her future in the race, the source said, but she will not make an endorsement at that time. She will urge Trump to try to win the backing of her supporters, which include a significant chunk of moderate Republicans and independent voters, the source added.

Haley’s decision to suspend her campaign comes a day after Super Tuesday, opens new tab, when Trump beat her soundly in 14 of the 15 Republican nominating contests.

Haley lasted longer than any other Republican challenger to Trump but never posed a serious threat to the former president, whose iron grip on the party’s base remains firm despite his multiple criminal indictments.

The Democratic Party leader C. Vendan demands the release of Murugan, Robateayas, and Jayakumar, who were convicted in Sriperumbudur cases. The Eelam Tamils feel their justifications and demands for a homeland are ignored. The relationship between the Eelam Tamils and India has been strained, with the Sri Lankan Indian Treaty and its staff in Sri Lanka being based on mutual welfare and security. The tragic event of the Siripur Buddha has widened the gap. The Eelam Tamils urge the Indian Central Manila Government to release the convicted individuals.

Democratic Party leader C. Vendan said that Murugan, Robateayas and Jayakumar should quickly release the special camps and return their homeland.

The Tamils feel that India should understand the justifications and chambers of the Eelam Tamils after decades.

The socio -political and economic security relations of the Eelam Tamils and India are worthy of history.

The Sri Lankan Indian Treaty and its Staff in Sri Lanka were based on the accumulation of its full strength, considering the welfare of its region and the security of the Eelam Tamil.

Some of the bitter extraordinary events after that have been abandoned by the Eelam Tamils in the aftermath of the tragic event of the Siripur Buddha, which has finally created a gap in the relationship of the Indian Eelam Tamils.

We and our people think that the relationship between us and India has been abandoned.
