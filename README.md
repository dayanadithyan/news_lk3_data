PARIS (AP) ‚Äî President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the lower house of France‚Äôs parliament in a surprise announcement sending voters back to the polls in the coming weeks to choose lawmakers, after his party was handed a humbling defeat by the far-right in the European elections Sunday.

The legislative elections will take place in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.

The announcement came after the first projected results from France put the far-right National Rally party well ahead in the European Union‚Äôs parliamentary elections, handing a chastening loss to Macron‚Äôs pro-European centrists, according to French opinion poll institutes.

Marine Le Pen‚Äôs anti-immigration, nationalist party was estimated to get around 31%-32% of the votes, a historic result more than double the share of Macron‚Äôs Renaissance party, which was projected to reach around 15%.

Macron himself wasn‚Äôt a candidate in the EU elections and his term as president still runs for three more years.

### Tourism trade remains robust despite seasonal softening in May

The tourism trade is going through an expected softening due to the seasonality tied to the arrivals, but it has managed to eke out an income of US$ 154.0 million in May, data showed.

This was down from US$ 225.7 million in April but up from US$ 100.0 million a year ago when the trade was recovering from repeated crises.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs economy weakened due to waning inflows from tourism and other foreign currency inflows due to the 2019 Easter attacks, two years of pandemic induced restrictions over travel and in-person events, and then by the ‚ÄòAragalaya‚Äô in 2022.

It added to the challenges faced by tourism in its efforts to revive while the global travel industry started picking up from two years of pursuing stay at home orders due to the worldwide pandemic.

This caused many countries to put up travel advisories against their people who were thinking of taking flights to Sri Lanka, delaying what looked like a continuous recovery in the trade.

Sri Lankan received US$ 543.8 million as remittances in April this year while in May last year the receipts were US$ 479.7 million.

For the five months through May, the country received US$ 2, 624.4 million from remittances, up 11.8 percent from the same period a year ago.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs remittances started normalising when the authorities began cracking down on the informal money exchanges that were offering substantial premiums to the official exchange rate.

The rupee depreciation also helped emigrants to re-route their earnings via banks which until then were repatriated via informal channels.

Further the record number of departures for foreign employment also helped Sri Lanka to receive strong amounts of foreign currency every month.

Lawyers‚Äô Collective, a civil society group comprising legal professionals, has voiced its opposition to the recent recommendation by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to extend the term of Attorney General Sanjaya Rajaratnam beyond the mandatory retirement age of 60. In a letter addressed to the members of the Constitutional Council, the Prime Minister, and other key figures, the letter outlined several serious concerns regarding the proposal.

The Collective recalled a similar situation in 2008 when an attempt to extend the term of an Attorney General resulted in a Fundamental Rights application before the Supreme Court. They noted that this legal challenge ultimately led to the Attorney General in question opting for retirement rather than accepting the extension. According to the Collective, the Constitution does not empower the Constitutional Council to approve extensions for officials who are subject to a mandatory retirement age, thereby rendering such a proposal legally questionable.

### Poverty and homelessness stare elders in the face - EDITORIAL

Not many decades ago, our country was held up worldwide for its welfare state policies. Today, unfortunately, such praises are but a distant dream. Poverty rules the day-to-day life for a large number of our citizens.

Yet none of the political parties who are now canvassing for our vote, have come out with a single concrete proposal of how they intend to get this country out of its present dilemma.

In these columns, we have highlighted times out of number, the huge difference between the average wage and the cost a family of four needs to bear if they are to have two square meals a day. That cost amounted to over rupees one hundred thousand a month!

On the tea and rubber plantations -until the president recently forced owners to pay workers Rs. 1,700 per day workers were paid less than Rs. 1,000 per day. Daily paid or casual workers elsewhere in the country who form a majority of the country‚Äôs workforce receive less than Rs. 55,000 per month.

Ukrainians fire at Russian forces in Donetsk province, a target of Russia‚Äôs current, narrowed offensive

Social media is agog with fears over a looming Third World War. According to the centre-right Daily Telegraph of the UK, it has already started.

According to this view, military action in Ukraine and Gaza is only a small part of a global war in which propaganda, influence buying, trade wars and misinformation are weapons as deadly as any conventional or nuclear arsenal.

But, before we examine this theory in more detail, it‚Äôs noteworthy that Third World War scares are hardly new. They have been there almost since the day the Second World War ended.

One could very well describe the Cold War between the West (the US and its NATO allies) and the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc satellites as war by other means ‚Äì both sides vying to outdo each other with misinformation, propaganda and influence buying and trying to bully the other side into submission.
