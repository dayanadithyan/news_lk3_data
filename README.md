### Paradise: A Drama Film That Reflects The Cruel Face Of The Global Social Crisis

Paradise, the latest movie of acclaimed Sri Lankan filmmaker Prasanna Vithanage, has now been screening theatres worldwide. Produced by Newton Cinema of India and presented by Mani RatnamтАЩs Madras Talkies, this multilingual film starring Malayali, Tamil, Muslim and Sinhala cast has already won several foreign accolades. Under the existing fascist persecuting laws on art in Sri Lanka, this work was not censored like one of the VithanageтАЩs earlier films Purahanda Kaluwara (Death on a Full Moon Day, 1997) only because of these international tributes. Indeed, this is a fascinating, absorbing and tendentious film that makes the connoisseur rethink about his own opinions. It marks a qualitative perfection in the directorтАЩs evolution as a filmmaker. It also stimulates fellow artists to become more conscious towards the global socio-political reality.
