ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Five years after Sri LankaтАЩs worst ever attack on churches, the island nationтАЩs ethnic minority Catholics are still struggling for justice and find the mastermind behind the Easter Sunday carnage that killed at least 269 people in 2019.

The attack was carried out by local Islamist militants, but the investigations have failed to find the reason for the attack and who was behind local Islamist suicide bombers.

Successive governments have promised independent probes into the attack, but nothing was done.

And still key political parties use the Easter attack probe as their election promise.

A parliament fact finding panel, a presidential commission of inquiry, and police investigations have found crucial facts related to the attack and those who are involved in the crime.

However, Catholic leaders say no justice have been served for the innocent followers who were killed brutally when they were on prayers.

### Voyager-1 sends readable data again from deep space

*2024-04-23 20:04:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Voyager-1-sends-readable-data-again-from-deep-space/108-281218) ┬╖ `en`

(BBC) - The US space agency says its Voyager-1 probe is once again sending usable information back to Earth after months of spouting gibberish.

A computer fault stopped it returning readable data in November but engineers have now fixed this.

For the moment, Voyager is sending back only health data about its onboard systems, but further work should get the scientific instruments back online.

Voyager-1 is more than 24 billion km (15 billion miles) away, so distant, its radio messages take fully 22.5 hours to reach us.

"Voyager-1 spacecraft is returning usable data about the health and status of its onboard engineering systems," Nasa said in a statement.

"The next step is to enable the spacecraft to begin returning science data again."

Voyager-1 was launched from Earth in 1977 on a tour of the outer planets, but then just kept going.

### Increase in drug use in the North: Who are the source?

*2024-04-23 14:54:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181767) ┬╖ `ta`

Four youths in the North died from drug use, with heavy drugs implicated. Cases of heroin and cannabis were reported. Sri Lanka's strategic location in global drug trade, facilitated by maritime boundaries, contributes to the issue. Despite legal action, drug use remains prevalent, especially among the youth. The government's focus on the war context in the North and East may exacerbate drug issues.

ЁЯЯй

Four youths died due to drug use in the first quarter of this year in the Northern Province. They are all between the ages of 20 to 30 years.

In particular, a youth from Chavakachcheri has died during a drug treaty for celebrating his release as a youth from Chavakachcheri was released from prison on bail.

Others are dead due to the use of heavy drugs. There are no reports of drug use even after these deaths.

There were 29 cases of drugs in Jaffna, especially in the period from 2024.03.26 to 2024.04.16.. Two cases of 23.075 grams of heroin have been filed for the holding of 0.08 grams of ice.

In addition, 21 cases have been filed in connection with the use and business of cannabis and 21.299 kilograms of cannabis have been seized.. The drug issue in the North continues to be socially cancer, while police say that legal action has been taken against the arrested persons.
