The proposal, which was submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, was defeated with 05 votes against it while 03 members voted in favour.

Rajaratnam‚Äôs current term is set to expire at the end of this month, and the President had proposed an extension for an additional six months.

However, the proposal requires the approval of the Constitutional Council, which twice defeated it.

Accordingly, Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe, who is the son of former Chief Justice K. A. Parinda Ranasinghe is tipped to be appointed as the Acting AG.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs budget deficit has collapsed to 361 billion rupees up to April 2024 from 824.2 helped by higher tax revenues and a falling interest bill, official data show.

Revenues surged 48 percent to 1,216 billion rupees to April 2024, ahead of the 35 percent annual growth projected in a budget, with higher value added and income tax rates as well as economic activity recovering close to previous levels.

Sri Lanka is emerging from the worst case of ‚Äòpolicy support‚Äô deployed by macroeconomists since the central bank was set up in 1950 where the usual inflationary rate cuts which trigger currency crises and IMF programs, was also backed up tax cuts.

Giving policy support and denying monetary stability has become mainstream in the age of inflation and ‚Äòage of external defaults without a war‚Äô due to so-called Saltwater-Cambridge doctrine, critics say.
