University students in the country have been severely inconvenienced due to administrative functions at state universities continuing to be crippled as a result of the month-long strike by university non-academic staff over their salary anomaly issue and several other demands.

Lectures at the state universities have been forced to be conducted online and many university examinations, international conferences and university convocations have also been indefinitely postponed. University administrations are not in a position to inform students when these can be rescheduled.

Examinations in the Open University have been indefinitely postponed. Those who aspire overseas post-graduate studies are in a fix due to delays in the verification process of degrees and academic transcripts. Those who have completed their degrees are awaiting the end of the strike to obtain their degree certificates and

The biggest festival of democracy, the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections is concluding today in our nation, the Mother of Democracy. After a three-day spiritual journey in Kanniyakumari, I have just boarded the plane for Delhi. Through the day, Kashi and numerous other seats have been in the midst of voting.

My mind is filled with so many experiences and emotions... I feel a boundless flow of energy within myself. The 2024 Lok Sabha elections are the first in the Amrit Kaal. I began my campaign a few months ago from Meerut, the land of the First War of Independence of 1857. Since then, I have traversed across the length and breadth of our great nation. The final rally of these elections took me to Hoshiarpur in Punjab, the land of the great Gurus and a land associated with Sant Ravidas Ji. After that, I came to Kanniyakumari, at the feet of Maa Bharti.

### Nortje takes 4-7 as South Africa beat Sri Lanka in T20 World Cup

*2024-06-03 23:47:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Nortje-takes-4-7-as-South-Africa-beat-Sri-Lanka-in-T20-World-Cup/108-284036) · `en`

(New York) - South Africa's Anrich Nortje took a remarkable four wickets for just seven runs as the Proteas dismissed Sri Lanka for a record low 77 on their way to a six-wicket win in the teams' T20 World Cup opener in New York on Monday.

Sri Lanka's total was their lowest in all T20 cricket, with fast bowler Nortje's figures the best by a South African at a T20 World Cup, surpassing his own 4-10 against Bangladesh in Sydney two years ago.

Kagiso Rabada (2-21) and left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who took two wickets in two balls on his way to 2-22, also damaged Sri Lanka's cause.

Opener Kusal Mendis (19) and veteran all-rounder Angelo Mathews (16) were the only Sri Lanka batsmen to pass 15 after their captain, Wanindu Hasaranga, seemingly misread conditions by opting to bat first after winning the toss in what was the first match at a Long Island ground built specially for this tournament.

### Just think about us

*2024-06-03 21:58:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/197353) · `si`

A powerful entity transforms into a vast, harsh body of water, capable of devastating human lives. Despite its cruelty, it embodies the essence of life: breath, birth, emotions, protection, and warmth. Amidst the rain, individuals reflect on their achievements while the innocent, sheltered within the water, remain oblivious to their fate. As time passes, memories of these innocents fade, yet reminders of their existence persist, urging for their release from this oppressive force.

🟩

He became a great body of water and cruel enough to turn human lives in the earliest.

Lives of breathing, emergence, feelings, protection, and warm.

In the middle of the rains, everyone looks at what they have earned and carefully carefully.

In the meantime, they are the innocent people who believe in the life of their master about their master.

They are hiding among the waters of the waters of the water and the increasing weight of the water.

There is plenty of information about the innocent innocent.

As the Maha Vanage is gradually, you can forget these dear pets.

Whenever you have all of their belongings, we also do not forget these innocent.

We ask you to be released as you can't take the least.

### Is the future Palestinian government possible?

*2024-06-03 21:21:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185247) · `ta`

The possibility of a future Palestinian government hinges on resolving longstanding conflicts, including border disputes, the status of Jerusalem, and the right of return for refugees. Recent international support, exemplified by European countries recognizing the Palestinian state, underscores the global desire for a peaceful resolution. However, challenges such as Israel's expansion beyond UN-defined borders, the presence of Jewish settlements, and the political implications of evacuating settlers complicate the path to a two-state solution.

🟩

The Hamas Movement on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the war on Israel's continuing war on Gaza has brought back the Palestinian issue in West Asia.. The world sees more countries to give a firm support for a future Palestinian state, with the destruction of a large part of the war Gaza and killed more than 36 thousand of its people.

Recently, three European countries, Spain, Norway and Ireland have recognized the Palestinian state. Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, say that if the Palestinian issue is not resolved, there will never be strict peace in the region. If the crisis is a solution with international recognition, it is a two -state solution.

The brief answer to this question is easy. The two state solution is to divide the land between the historical Balasatinam, the Jordan River to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the West of the Mediterranean.. But the long answer is complicated.

### Inflation on what horizon?

*2024-06-03 21:06:56* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Inflation-on-what-horizon/14-762544) · `en`

The Central Bank should be urged to unwind its large Treasury bill holdings, depreciate the currency aggressively, and cut the statutory reserve ratio to encourage risk-taking by banks

Many of us were puzzled by the recent monetary policy announcement where the monetary board chose not to lower interest rates, despite inflation being below 5%. When a journalist questioned the Governor about this, asking if they expected inflation to exceed 5% in the latter half of the year, it was like asking if the emperor had any clothes on. The governor’s response was unclear, referencing a dynamic model before deferring to Dr. S. Jegajeevan, head of the Economic Research Department. Dr. Jegajeevan clarified that they do not foresee inflation approaching 5% later this year.

### Postponing elections: Are there limits to popular sovereignty?

As long as a two-thirds majority in Parliament passes a constitutional amendment or a new constitution and a majority of the People approves the same, are there no limitations to what can be done?

United National Party Secretary Range Bandara’s statement at a media briefing at UNP Headquarters that the terms of the current President and current Parliament should be extended by two years ‘to save the Nation’ has drawn the ire of the people at large, with even the UNP’s ally (for the moment?), the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna distancing itself from the proposal. The essence of the people’s response is that the present Parliament has lost its legitimacy, and President Wickremesinghe has been elected not by the People directly but by that very Parliament for the remainder of the term of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was forced to resign.

In the realm of politics, leadership is not just about holding a title; it’s about inspiring, unifying, and driving a collective vision forward. Sajith Premadasa, the leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), has been a prominent figure in Sri Lankan politics. However, his leadership style raises significant concerns, particularly his consistent use of the pronoun “I.” This individual-centric approach starkly contrasts with the essential qualities of effective leadership, highlighting a critical shortfall in his ability to lead.

ECONOMYNEXT – The Sri Lankan government will not enact the necessary legislation to cancel already declared Local Government (LG) polls, a State Minister said, amid growing concerns over potential violations of election laws through various development projects and a poverty alleviation program.

The island’s Election Commission initially scheduled the LG polls for March 9, 2023, later postponing them to April 25, 2023. However, the elections were not held after President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s administration cited a lack of funds due to the country’s recovery from an unprecedented economic crisis.

Despite the postponement, the LG polls have not been officially canceled, meaning that standard election laws, including restrictions on political parties engaging in development projects or distributing funds, remain in effect.
