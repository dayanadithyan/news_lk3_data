BBC - A US luxury real estate billionaire and a deep-sea explorer are planning to travel in a submersible to explore the Titanic.

Ohio tycoon and adventurer Larry Connor and Patrick Lahey, co-founder of Triton Submarines, say they want to take a sub to a depth of around 3,800m (12,467ft) to see the shipwreck in the North Atlantic Ocean.

The private submersible industry was rocked after five people were killed when a vessel built by OceanGate imploded en route to the Titanic last year.

A spokesman for Mr ConnorтАЩs company said on Tuesday that the proposed voyage would only take place once a vessel was fully certified by a marine organisation.

The pair plan to use a sub dubbed the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer тАУ the тАЬ4000тАЭ refers to the depth in metres to which the craft can safely be deployed.

The Titan submarine built by OceanGate was constructed of carbon fibre and was only certified to 1,300m, far short of the depths of the ocean floor where the Titanic wreck lay.

Businesses are trying to de-leverage after a currency crisis, and also re-negotiate old loans with lower interest rates as complaints from the SME sector shows.

De-leveraging is part of a credit cycle that improves the balance sheets of business across the board and leaves them in a stronger position to expand in the future.

To expand however retail sales have to pick up. Capital investments then start as existing capacity or slack runs out and there is more confidence in the future.

тАЬWe have seen retail sales picking up in the recent past,тАЭ Governor Weerasinghe said. тАЬI think that will push up some of the SME borrowings in the coming months.тАЭ

Spain, Ireland and Norway have formally recognised a Palestinian state, in what they say is an attempt to refocus attention on efforts to find a political solution to the war in the Middle East.

They hope by acting together they will encourage other European countries to follow suit, in a diplomatic push that could help secure a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages held by Hamas.

The symbolic decision has provoked a furious row with IsraelтАЩs government which has accused all three countries of rewarding terrorism.

Israel has withdrawn its ambassadors from Ireland, Norway and Spain and formally reprimanded their envoys in Tel Aviv. All three were summoned to IsraelтАЩs foreign ministry last week to be shown footage of the 7 October attacks in front of the media.

Speaking at the Vavuniya District Women's Conference of the National People's Power, Mr. Dissanayake said this.

Range Bandara has said that the presidential election should be held as planned but that Ranil Wickremesinghe should be given five more years.It means that Ranil only asks for the presidential election without asking anyone else and that they cannot win.

The entire politics of Sri Lanka is a national people's power center.

This country is not the country to begging. This is not a country that people have to suffer. This is not a country that people want to starve, this is a gem with all natural resources, such as a gem and people die without food. There are homeless people.
