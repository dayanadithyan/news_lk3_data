Freedom People’s Congress (FPC) member Prof. Charitha Herath has called for Sri Lanka to appoint a leader capable of managing the country’s economy, not merely its debt. Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Herath addressed the current economic situation and the forthcoming political changes.

Herath highlighted that the broad economic crisis has now evolved into a debt crisis. He criticised the prevailing focus on debt management, which he believes has led to a misconception that the ideal Presidential candidate is one who excels in debt management.

“This is wrong. No matter who is appointed, he must manage debt, but the reason for choosing a new President should not be his ability to manage debt. It should be someone with a broad vision to manage the economy,” Herath asserted.

He warned that economic management has been overshadowed by an excessive focus on debt management.
