### Finance Ministry on Sri Lanka’s external debt service payments

*2024-09-16 23:38:05* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Finance-Ministry-on-Sri-Lanka-s-external-debt-service-payments/14-766768) · `en`

The objective of the debt standstill was to create some space for Sri Lanka to commence negotiations for restructuring debt in a manner that would enable debt service to resume in the future

The Finance Ministry in a statement said it has observed that there is a perception in society that the prevailing economic stabilisation in Sri Lanka is entirely due to external debt not being serviced, and that once debt service resumes, economic instability will return. It is also unfortunate to note that this same narrative is being used to trivialise and undermine the necessity for the critical macroeconomic reforms that are in fact the actual drivers of economic stabilisation. In this context the Finance Ministry via this statement addresses some of these misperceptions and explains the correct position in this regard to the public.

Is it correct that Sri Lanka does not service any of its foreign debt following the announcement of the debt standstill in April 2022?

### How will 1.65 million Muslims vote on Saturday?

*2024-09-16 22:37:42* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/How-will-1-65-million-Muslims-vote-on-Saturday/4-766764) · `en`

In terms of the real number who are likely to go to polls placed at 75%, the number of votes cast by the Muslims would be around 1.2 million and Tamil votes around 1.4 million. The difference in the number of voters would be only around point 2 million or 200,000! The Upcountry Tamils, the third largest minority, who vote invariably independent of the Sri Lankan Tamils constitute 4.1% of the national population.

Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies has issued a clarification on the country’s external debt service payments in the recent past.

Issuing a statement, the Finance Ministry said it is observed that there is a perception in society that the prevailing economic stabilization in Sri Lanka is entirely due to external debt not being serviced, and that once debt service resumes, economic instability will return.

Furthermore, the ministry mentioned that it is also unfortunate to note that this same narrative is being used to trivialize and undermine the necessity for the critical macroeconomic reforms that are in fact the actual drivers of economic stabilization.

Accordingly, the Finance Ministry clarified that it is incorrect to say that all foreign debt is not being repaid and that the temporary moratorium on selected external debt service that was announced in April 2022 applied to external commercial debt and official bilateral debt.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s wage board has mandated daily wages for tea and rubber workers effective from September 10, according to a gazette notice.

The minimum daily wage is 1,350 rupees for a ‘norm’ of each estate, and there will be a 50 rupee payment for each kilo plucked above the ‘norm’.

The norm is the usual leaf that can be plucked for a field. Some fields which are in shadow of mountains or in areas that get lower rainfall have lower ‘norms’.

Sri Lanka’s plantations workers and other wage earners found their salaries purchasing power destroyed after macroeconomists in the central bank and Treasury cut its policy rate by printing large volumes of money permanently depreciated the currency.
