### UNICEF welcomes start of amendments to Children and Young Persons Ordinance

*2024-02-08 02:03:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/UNICEF-welcomes-start-of-amendments-to-Children-and-Young-Persons-Ordinance/56-758225) · `en`

The UNICEF said yesterday it welcomes the long-awaited amendment to the Children and Young Persons Ordinance (CYPO) coming into force effective 1 January 2024, which marks a significant step towards protecting the rights and welfare of all children in Sri Lanka.

The CYPO, a legislation governing justice for children in Sri Lanka since 1939, previously only covered those up to the age of 16. The amendment now extends its protection to all children under the age of 18. Furthermore, the amendment also repeals the section of the CYPO which permitted the use of corporal punishment on children and adolescents by parents, teachers, or guardians.

These amendments contribute to the alignment of Sri Lanka’s laws that address children’s rights with international standards, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), but also addresses the evolving needs and challenges faced by children and adolescents in the country.

### New Delhi Focuses On Exploring Unknown NPP

Now the JVP has grown to form an alliance (the National People’s Power) with several other groups, and is even recognized as a force in the political scene by neighbouring India

Though India may not fear the JVP-led alliance it certainly is concerned about how this alliance would deal with countries which have an interest in Sri Lanka; especially like India, China and the United States of America. On the surface it could amount to be an invitation to test the psyche of a political party that has the potential to win an election but might not know what to do with extreme power that comes its way when it forms a government

There was a time when people in this island nation feared the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). That was a time known as the ‘insurgency’. We saw the worst of this insurgency in the late 1980s, and this was a time when there was an Indian Peace Keeping Force in this island; sent here to help the Sri Lankan security forces in the fight against terrorism.

He was speaking to the media after a speech of the President's Policy Declaration held in Parliament on Wednesday (7).

Since 2022, we have urged everyone to work together to solve the economic crisis. Former President Gotabhaya Rajapakse and the current President Ranil Wickremesinghe have taken action to form a Supreme Party government. The efforts have failed due to lack of cooperation.

The country's economic status has stabilized. But the social structure is the worst affected. Social structure cannot be achieved by crisis. We are sure that everyone should work together to build the country.

I invite everyone to unite with the Sri Lanka PA. We have plans to build the country.

While welcoming the commencement of the amendments to the Children and Young Persons Ordinance, UNICEF called upon stakeholders in the justice, probation and child-care sectors to prioritize the application of non-custodial measures such as family-based rehabilitation for juvenile offenders.

The long-awaited amendment to the Children and Young Persons Ordinance (CYPO) came into force effective January 1, 2024, which marks a significant step towards protecting the rights and welfare of all children in Sri Lanka, it said.

The CYPO, a legislation governing justice for children in Sri Lanka since 1939, previously only covered those up to the age of 16.
