A deal would likely allow aid to reach hundreds of thousands of desperate Palestinians in northern Gaza who aid officials worry are under threat of famine.

The Israelis “have more or less accepted” the proposal, which includes the six-week cease-fire as well as the release by Hamas of hostages considered vulnerable, which includes the sick, the wounded, the elderly and women, said the official.

### Sri Lanka seeks five-month hold on bondholder suit

(Bloomberg) -- Sri Lanka is seeking a five-month hold on a lawsuit filed by a bondholder over the country’s historic debt default, telling a New York federal judge that it wants more time to negotiate with private creditors.

The island nation was sued in July 2022 by Hamilton Reserve Bank Ltd., which sought full payment on more than $250 million of Sri Lanka’s dollar bond that was due that month. The bank says it holds more than 25% of the bonds, which would likely enable it to block any modification of the notes.

On Friday, Sri Lanka sought an extension of a delay of the lawsuit that was granted in November. Hamilton Reserve opposed the new request, saying that the country has kept the bank “in the dark” about the negotiations despite repeated requests for information.

The island nation is prioritizing restructuring obligations to its private creditors as it seeks to fast-track a debt overhaul and exit a sovereign default, the foreign minister told Bloomberg last month.

### Early days – Herbert Cooray’s childhood in Kosgama and schooling in Colombo

We begin today serializing the biography of Herbert Cooray, the founder of the Jetwing Group who earlier ran a successful business as a building contractor as had his father before him. The biography was written by Shiromal Cooray, his daughter, who with her brother, Hiran, now leads Jetwing.

The history of the Jetwing family of companies is essentially the story of its founder, Herbert Cooray. It is the story of an unusual man who rose from modest, relatively obscure beginnings to establish what is today the largest independent business group in the Sri Lankan tourism industry. Such an achievement, significant in itself, appears more remarkable when we consider that it was achieved in the face of entrenched competition from established and long-standing hotel and travel firms that had made their reputations in the years when most traveled by sea, and cruise ships such as P&O’s famous Canberra were regular visitors to the Colombo Harbour.

*2024-03-02 21:08:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/are-sri-lankas-anti-drug-crime-operations-working/) · `en`

The government has declared the operation to be a success, with over 58,000 raids resulting in 58,234 arrests and substantial drug seizures (worth about $25 million) so far. Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles has claimed a 17 percent reduction in overall crime

### Donald Lu’s Comeback Story

*2024-03-02 21:07:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/donald-lus-comeback-story/) · `en`

More than a year after he visited Sri Lanka, US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu went on record calling Sri Lanka the greatest comeback story in “the region I work on.” He contrasted the situation two years ago – rife with shortages and riots – with the relative stability and calm present today. Pointing at the support given by India in 2022, he highlighted USAID’s humanitarian efforts in the country and the debt restructuring assistance given by Japan, France, and India.

Not surprisingly, Lu does mention China, but only in the context of the pressure that US allies applied on it to grant Sri Lanka debt relief. Just as unsurprisingly, he credits Sri Lanka’s recovery to “a Little Help from friends” and “this better proposition” that the US Indo-Pacific strategy offers for the region. One can only assume he means that Sri Lanka is a comeback story partly – or largely – because of US intervention in the Indian Ocean.

### Globally, a rightward political shift is visible

*2024-03-02 20:09:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/globally-a-rightward-political-shift-is-visible/) · `en`

The global political scene was very left-inclined from about the mid-1960s to say 10 or 15 years ago. The sweeping trend to social democracy in post-war Europe, a surge to the left throughout Asia (Chinese Revolution, defeat of US Imperialism in Vietnam, post-war USSR, our own JVP) and a little later in Africa (Patrice Lumumba, revolution in Mozambique, Nelson Mandela etc), signposted what may be loosely called a period of global shift to the left. That ended about 10 years ago. The last spurt was perhaps Obama’s re-election. The reverse trend became prominent in the US with Trump and internationally a dynamic that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.
