Govindan Karunagaram, a Batticaloa district parliamentarian, expressed readiness to negotiate with the president for economic recovery, emphasizing consideration for minority issues. He spoke at the 25th Anniversary Celebration of the Vinayaka Sports Club, highlighting the need for addressing minority problems. The People's Alliance (PA) faces challenges in nominating a presidential candidate due to past political dynamics, but potential opportunities exist for candidates supporting the PA, especially with the possibility of multiple contestants in the upcoming presidential election. This could allow any candidate to secure over 50% of the Sinhalese vote, potentially uniting Tamil Muslims and hill country people as a formidable force.

Batticaloa district parliamentarian Govindan Karunagaram (Jana) said that if the country is to be economically recovered, we are ready to talk to them if the president will consider the minority people and examine their problems.

The 25th Anniversary Celebration of the Vinayaka Sports Club of Batticaloa was held on Sunday evening (26) evening. He was speaking to the media after attending the event.

The PA is not in a position to field a presidential candidate at present. The people of this country are not prepared to support the PA and make their candidate win. This is because former President Gotabhaya Rajapakse, who made 69 lakhs of votes, chased him away in the last two years of the last period of 2019.. That situation is still from the Sinhalese.

In light of the current political situation, the faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by former President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to carry out the future activities of the party from a new location instead of the party headquarters.

Reportedly, this new location in Colombo will replace the SLFP headquarters on Darley Road, Colombo 10, for future political activities.

The party‚Äôs internal sources said that ongoing internal conflicts and court orders have made it impractical to convene constituency and district organizers of the party at a permanent location.

Therefore, the faction led by former President Sirisena has deemed it more appropriate to operate from a different location. The new political center will serve as a venue to convene district and constituency organizers from across the island to discuss upcoming political matters, as per sources.
