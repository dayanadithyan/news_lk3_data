### High cost of mandatory currency conversions on Sri Lanka‚Äôs ability to earn foreign exchange

Politics and economics are concepts that are fundamentally intertwined. Yet the unprecedented economic crisis of 2022 highlighted the complex challenges of aligning short-term political goals with long-term economic strategies.

While the sharp appreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee in recent months has been roundly welcomed by most sectors of society as a positive signal, this optimism overlooks the nuanced factors influencing our currency‚Äôs strength and the medium-long-term challenges that could arise from volatile fluctuations in the price of the rupee.

While a stronger rupee certainly promises cheaper imports of essentials like petroleum, electricity, food medicine and other essentials in the short term, as a nation that is surviving on borrowed time and foreign currency, we cannot afford to ignore the other side of the equation ‚Äì exports.

Each year in April, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) marks its first armed insurrection against the government in 1971, as ‚ÄòApril Heroes‚Äô Commemoration Day. The second JVP insurrection is memorialised by way of the ‚ÄòNovember Heroes‚Äô commemoration marking the death of JVP founder and leader Rohana Wijeweera in 1989.

Wijeweera led two rebellions, one in 1971 and a second in 1989. Thousands of young Sinhalese men and women died in the two insurgencies led by the then-JVP leader. In those dark days, civilians were involuntarily disappeared by state forces, while the JVP too killed many civilians.

The ‚ÄòMothers of the Disappeared‚Äô was a coming together of female Sinhalese, who lost relatives during the JVP insurrections to government forces. They came together under a common umbrella to demand information as to what had happened to their sons, daughters, husbands and wives.

The death of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman in the custody of Iran‚Äôs moral¬† police over charges of not properly covering up hair, unleashed¬† nationwide protests in Iran, followed by a brutal crackdown by a regime¬† devoid of semblance of legitimacy, until Iranian proxies, Hamas¬† momentarily shifted the global spotlight from Iran‚Äôs suppression of its¬† people by carrying out an industrial scale massacre in Israel on October¬† 7 last year.

As the monsoonal rains are set to wreak havoc and a climate emergency is in the making, the government had other pressing priorities. It declared a day of national mourning over the death of Iranian President and Islamic hardliner Ebrahim Raisi, whose VIP chopper crashed during a trip from Azerbaijan.

### Top UN court orders Israel to stop Rafah offensive

May 24 (BBC) - The UN's top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), has issued a dramatic ruling, ordering Israel to "immediately halt its military offensive in Rafah".

It acted in support of a South African application last week which sought a number of measures against Israel, accusing it of stepping up what it says is a genocide.

Presiding judge Nawaf Salam said the situation in Gaza had deteriorated since the court last ordered Israel to take steps to improve it.

Israel has vehemently denied the allegation and signalled it would ignore any order to halt its operation.

Reading the court's ruling on Friday, Nawaf Salam said "Israel must immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate" which could bring about "the physical destruction" of the Palestinians - alluding to what constitutes genocide under international law.

Israel, he added, must also allow unimpeded access to Gaza to any UN body investigating allegations of genocide.

Criticism of Israel‚Äôs conduct in the war in Gaza has been growing, particularly on operations in Rafah ‚Äî and even from its closest ally, the United States. This week alone, three European countries announced they would recognize a Palestinian state, and the chief prosecutor for another U.N. court requested arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, along with Hamas officials.

Colombo, May 24 (Daily Mirror) - Over 300,000 power disruption incidents were reported during the past few days with more than 30,000 occurring within a single hour on some days, the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers' Union (CEBEU) said.

While issuing a media release they said they had experienced significant delays in restoring power outages caused by recent severe weather conditions.

The CEBEU has expressed regret over these delays, attributing them to the limited number of technical staff available to address the issues.

Additionally, the high volume of calls has overwhelmed CEB telephone operators, leading to many calls from consumers going unanswered.

The union has urged the public to exercise patience and caution, advising them not to touch any live wires during outages, while the technical teams work to restore power as quickly as possible.

Israel is intensifying the day of the war on the day of the war, with the use of all its ways on Palestine.

While human beings are occurring in Bastin in the twenty -first century, many countries of the world express their condemnation.

The younger community is carrying out international struggles to end the conflict.

The younger community and human rights activists are pressing for the end of the war, especially in support of Israel, especially in support of Israel.

Unfortunately, the Sri Lankan government is working on a dual position as the head of the snake and the tail of the fish in the Israeli-Palestine conflict.

Specificly, the government is constantly sending Sri Lankan citizens to work on Israeli farms.

The privatized firms then made annual lease payments and paid taxes when profits were made.

In 2024 the government decreed a wage hike announced a mandated wage after President Ranil Wickremesinghe made the announcement in the presence of several politicians representing plantations workers.

MITO -- Two Sri Lankan students in Japan were arrested over an illegal abortion, and an expert points out that international students' unstable resident status may be a factor behind the incident.

### Scientists find Earth-like planet that could be home to alien life

May 24 - Scientists have found a new Earth-like planet that could support alien life ‚Äì just 40 light-years away.

The planet is a remarkable discovery in the search for habitable worlds: it is slightly smaller than the Earth, and thought to be just a little hotter. Many planets outside our solar system, called exoplanets, tend to be much larger and hotter than our own world.

The newly discovered planet is called Gliese 12b and researchers say that even if we cannot find whether it is home to alien life then it will help in our search for other worlds that might be.

The planet planet orbits its host star every 12.8 days, and is comparable in size to Venus - so slightly smaller than Earth.

It has an estimated surface temperature of 42C, which is lower than most of the 5,000-odd exoplanets (planets outside of the solar system) confirmed so far.

In recent days, various Sri Lankan organizations joined the global demand against the aggressive policy of the United States against Cuba and demanded the removal of Cuba from the unjust list once and for all.
