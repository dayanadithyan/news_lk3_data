### Supreme Court interim ruling only a direction given to President

*2024-08-01 02:12:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Supreme-Court-interim-ruling-only-a-direction-given-to-President/4-764992) · `en`

The recent Supreme Court interim ruling has two components. On the first, that is restraining Deshabandu from “the powers, functions and responsibilities” of the office of IGP, the interim order is broad and straightforward.

The second pertains to the appointment of a suitable officer to act in the office of IGP. The SC ruling states: “...His Excellency the President may, should he wish to, consider making appointment, in terms of the law, of a suitable person to act in the post of IGP for the duration of the afore-stated interim order.”

Strictly speaking, this is only a direction given to the President, respecting the legal provisions under which he has the power to make acting appointment. In effect, it suggests to him that he may, if he wants to, consider making an acting appointment, in terms of the law.

It has been made clear that the President is in no mood to consider this direction of the Supreme Court, to go by the special statement made by the PM in Parliament today.

### SLPP defectors, Tamil options, ‘Democracy in Debt’ and Vickramabahu’s validation

*2024-08-01 01:58:17* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/SLPP-defectors-Tamil-options-Democracy-in-Debt-and-Vickramabahu-s-validation/4-764990) · `en`

“…In short, the global democratic trend this year is a resounding rejection of the status quo.”

– ‘A Global Movement Against The Status Quo’ By Ian Bremmer, TIME, 5 Aug. 2024 –

Given the global trend as summed-up by Ian Bremmer, one of the world’s best-known think-tank gurus, a win for incumbent Wickremesinghe is virtually unthinkable.

Given the decision by Mahinda Rajapaksa’s SLPP to fend-off Wickremesinghe’s political piracy and field a candidate under the party banner, a Ranil win is logically impossible.

As PM in 2001-3, Ranil overstepped the mark and encroached on President Kumaratunga’s terrain. She tossed him out. As PM in 2015-2019, he did the same with President Sirisena, was turfed out, made a comeback thanks to the Supreme Court he now derides, and was evicted by the electorate.

Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam’s legacy is one of profound intellectual and humanitarian impact, rooted in a steadfast commitment to nonviolence, human rights, and inclusive dialogue

The Sri Lankan civil war ended with a brutal and decisive Government victory in May 2009, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 40,000 Tamil civilians during the final stages of the conflict. If the LTTE and the Sri Lankan political parties had formed a consensus and worked to implement the constitutional reform proposals which Dr. Tiruchelvam helped formulate, the war likely could have ended much sooner, potentially saving countless lives

### A spotted affair: Has Sri Lanka over-promoted the iconic Sri Lankan leopard?

*2024-08-01 01:06:53* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-spotted-affair-Has-Sri-Lanka-over-promoted-the-iconic-Sri-Lankan-leopard/4-764988) · `en`

The Sri Lankan leopard – ‘panther pardus kotiya’ – Pic by Srilal Miththapala

Of all the charismatic animals seen in Sri Lanka, there is none that has created so much interest and popularity, than the Sri Lankan leopard. And today it has become arguably one of the most sought-after tourist attractions in the country. But is the leopard’s own popularity leading to its own destruction?

1 August is Sri Lanka Leopard Day, a day proposed by the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka in 2020 to celebrate our very own leopard sub species.

So this maybe an overtime moment to reflect on the problems that the Sri Lanka leopard is facing today.

The Sri Lankan leopard is a distinct subspecies – ‘panthera pardus kotiya’ (after Dr. Sriyanie Miththapala 1966). It is the only large carnivore found in Sri Lanka, and is therefore the apex predator in the wild, with no threats to it other than man.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has appointed three ministerial committees to address potential global and Iranian impacts on the island nation amid fears of an escalating middle east war after the assassination of a Hamas political leader in Iran.

“If a war breaks out, what will happen to fuel prices? If any issues arise, we might need to bring back everyone in the Middle East to Sri Lanka, similar to what we faced when Kuwait was invaded in 1991. This would result in a loss of revenue for the country, making it difficult for the emerging Sri Lanka to handle such a situation,” Wickremesinghe told a gathering of provincial councilors on Wednesday (31).
