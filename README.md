### Four lessons for bridging the urban-rural e-commerce divide in Sri Lanka

Some rural sellers continued to encounter delivery issues due to gaps in the availability of fast and reliable logistics services in remote areas

Across the globe, e-commerce has emerged as a powerful engine of economic growth, job creation, innovation and trade integration. Research by the World Bank suggests that ‘e-commerce can flourish in developing countries and in rural areas and be a powerful instrument to create employment for semi-skilled workers, women and other groups.’ Correspondingly, the usage of e-commerce in Sri Lanka also appears to be gaining traction, with a recent report published in 20231 revealing that e-commerce is already an ‘island wide phenomenon’ in Sri Lanka, with over 50% of the survey respondents in all provinces affirming their use of e-commerce to purchase goods and services.

### Curbing spam, scam and fraud in Sri Lanka

*2024-01-24 05:23:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Curbing-spam-scam-and-fraud-in-Sri-Lanka/4-757704) · `en`

The Sri Lankan Government is said to have approved the creation of an international A2P SMS centre to curtail fraud and spam. A private company, Infobip, has submitted a proposal to the Cabinet in this regard. The President has proposed appointing a committee with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Technology and the TRCSL to evaluate this proposal.

The need for such a centre to be set up at this time, approved at Cabinet-level, and run by an international private messaging aggregator raises multiple questions.

Spam, scam, and fraudulent communications are a valid cause for concern.

However, we have no publicly available information on how significant the issue of scams and frauds are in Sri Lanka. It would be good to start off with knowing how bad is the spam, scam, fraud situation in Sri Lanka? Do we have numbers and statistics, gathered by the Government or independent researchers, to go by?

On Thursday (January 18), a sub-inspector attached to the Narammala Police Station opened fire at a civilian. The civilian, identified as K. A Roshan Kumarasiri succumbed to injuries instantly. The reason for this brutal encounter was the fact that the police officer who was in civilian clothes had signaled Kumarasiri to stop his lorry, but since there was no sign to identify him as a police officer, Kumarasiri had ignored the signal.Eyewitness accounts claim that the cop had chased after the lorry from Rammuthugala to Dampelessa. He had then pulled it over for a spot inspection, but eyewitness accounts claim that the sub-inspector had loaded his gun while going towards the lorry driver and subsequently opened fire.

In December 2023, Public Security Minister, Tiran Alles announced with much fanfare, the launch of ‘Operation Yukthiya’. Within a 22-day spell, authorities apprehended a total of 29,475 suspects. They initially announced the seizure of millions of rupees in cash and the confiscation of assets belonging to drug peddlers/dealers.

Media reports of drug raids continue to regale the public with a plethora of statements issued by the Public Security Minister and the acting IGP on how well the operation is progressing. Daily we hear of hundreds of persons being taken into custody.

What is concerning however is that the Minister and the Acting IGP seem to be acting outside the law in their efforts to rid the country of the drug menace.

Hats off to the JVP lady who promised that when the JVP/NPP comes to power, it will legalize prostitution! If Sri Lanka is to undergo the next phase of social revolution, which the JVP promises, the archaic and discriminatory laws should be discarded to build a system where every citizen, irrespective of race, religion, income, gender or sexual orientation, could exercise the full scope of liberties. But there is a glitch that the JVP’s ideologues and their busloads of supporters fail to admit - or they simply don’t comprehend: social liberalism cannot be achieved, nor could it be sustained in the long run, without economic liberalism.

Sri Lanka is not making any attempts as yet to put its currency swap worth USD 1.4 billion with China to ‘usable’ form, even though the country has now met the pre-condition that qualifies it to do so, CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe revealed yesterday.

CBSL and People’s Bank of China entered into a currency swap agreement for Chinese Yuan 10 billion (USD 1.4 billion) in March 2021, valid for three years, with a view to promoting bilateral trade and direct investment for economic development.

However, as per conditions imposed by China to which Sri Lanka had agreed, the latter cannot use the funds, but was only allowed to use it when the CBSL officially declares its foreign reserve levels.

In August 2022, Ranil Wickremesinghe as the country’s new President, after the exit of former president Gotabaya Rajapakse, told parliament that Sri Lanka was required to have enough foreign reserves to cover three months of imports to be able to utilize this Chinese swap.

### Sri Lanka’s Proposed Internet Law Threatens Upcoming Elections

*2024-01-23 18:56:43* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/sri-lankas-proposed-internet-law-threatens-upcoming-elections/) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s Proposed Internet Law Threatens Upcoming Elections; Government Body Could Impose Sweeping Censorship, Prosecute Offenders

A repressive new internet law that Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe is trying to rush through parliament this week would create broad and vague new speech-related offenses punishable by lengthy prison terms. The law would seriously threaten the right to freedom of expression as Sri Lanka prepares for parliamentary and presidential elections later this year.

The proposed law, the Online Safety Bill, purportedly provides protections against online harassment, abuse, and fraud. Instead, it is mostly concerned with creating a new “Online Safety Commission,” appointed by the president, that can decide what online speech is “false” or “harmful,” remove content, restrict and prohibit internet access, and prosecute individuals and organizations.

### Universal Franchise, Written Constitutions, Party Politics & Abuse

It may sound heretical and ridiculous, but I boldly say, that it is only the last word in my title (“Abuse,”) is real, all else is piffle, confusion, and deceit and quite meaningless. Agreed? Of course not, – don’t be crazy!

Let me explain. More and more that I see happening around me, seems to validate this apparent heresy. I take a perverse delight in witnessing the demolition of myths and untenable yet popular, beliefs. It is astonishing to see the extent to which we allow ourselves to be so easily fooled. Often we seemed to be wired to accept more readily, thoughts couched in complicated verbiage. How often do we unknowingly accept concepts, merely because we feel ill-equipped to understand them? The lament at the end of a speech, “What he said must be mighty important, because I could not understand a word of it” is a telling truth. “Faith” they say is “acceptance of something you know to be false”.  So, on to this implicitly authorized heresy.
