More than 650 employees at the Sapugaskanda Refinery, the country‚Äôs sole oil refinery, face potential job losses due to its transformation into a separate public enterprise.

According to sources, the government plans to retain only approximately 200 of the current employees for the new enterprise.

The remaining workers will be placed in a pool from which the new enterprise will select the necessary personnel to maintain operations.
