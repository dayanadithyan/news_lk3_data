The Debt Justice group has sprung up to meet an unmet need of the day

Since debt is a complex subject not understood by ordinary citizens, people do not know what they gain when their governments borrow abroad and what sacrifice they should make if those governments default debt. They become voiceless being unable to say yes or no. Hence, Debt Justice seeks to represent those voiceless people in matters relating to debt issues. They seek to build a collective power of the people most affected by debt in what they call exploited countries. Those people are exploited by their own rulers who exercise authoritative powers and by global players who are there to flood them with debt under unfair conditions. In that sense, they produce a global public good and their cry should not be dismissed outrightly

### Presidential Elections & Ranil‚Äôs Crusade For Economic Revival

Sri Lankan electors are awaiting a change from the status quo of a sluggish and slow- moving economy towards a more seriously planned progress. With fresh memories of extreme hard time sufferings of the recent past, only palliatively handled with haphazard responses to meet emergency situations, the body politic is hopeful of a dawn of an economy progressing under a planned pursuit of a clear vision

The society is going through a period of many uncertainties with a serious inequality growing and the economy slogging before heavily indebted consumers failing to fuel its forward movement with very low spending capacities. A large segment of the people is still living either well below the poverty line or marginally there. The majority are in a state of heavy deprivation. The country is yearning for a change, the priority of which should be on boosting economic growth and social well- being focusing on the need to mean the worse affected.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs central bank has mopped up 546 billion rupees of domestic money, out of a total of 578.5 billion rupees created by the purchase of foreign exchange in the six months to June 2024, official data showed.

The central bank had generated 538.1 billion rupees from forex purchases from the market, a Market Operations Report showed.

The central bank had also generated 40.4 billion rupees net from buying official foreign loan proceeds after settling any loans.

Analysts had warned that one of the ways the rupee is pressured by the deeply flawed operational framework of an IMF-prone central bank is through the surrender by the Treasury of its dollar receipts, creating new money.

Government surrenders have a devastating effect on the currency, when the exchange rate is already under pressure, driving up credit and requiring an even greater contraction of the economy to end any external crisis triggered by mis-targeted short term rates, analysts have said.

*2024-08-04 15:45:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190248) ¬∑ `ta`
