### Mujibur Rahman tipped to fill Diana Gamage‚Äôs MP seat

*2024-05-08 13:44:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99079/mujibur-rahman-tipped-to-fill-diana-gamages-mp-seat-) ¬∑ `en`

Former Member of Parliament Mujibur Rahman of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is tipped to fill the vacant parliamentary seat after the Supreme Court disqualified State Minister Diana Gamage from holding an MP seat.

Speaking during today‚Äôs parliamentary session, Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa announced that this decision will be communicated to the Election Commission.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday (May 08) declared that State Minister Diana Gamage is not legally qualified to hold a parliamentary seat.

Accordingly, delivering its verdict today, the three-judge Supreme Court bench decided that Gamage is not eligible to hold the position of Member of Parliament as she holds dual citizenship.

In January 2023, then SJB MP Mujibur Rahman decided to step down as a member of parliament in order to vie for the post of Mayor of Colombo in the now-postponed 2023 local government election.

### No airline in the world making profits: Minister

*2024-05-08 13:18:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/No-airline-in-the-world-making-profits-Minister/108-282174) ¬∑ `en`

Parliament, May 08 (Daily Mirror)- No airline in the world is making any profits and it is a situation inherent to all airlines, Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said today.

He told Parliament that airlines even in rich countries such as Air India, BOAC and Swiss Airlines were not profit making and some were sold out.

Responding to a question by SJB MP Hesha Vithanage, the Minister said Air India was sold out to Tata due to losses and added that Emirates was provided some USD 2 to 3 billion by the government every year.

He said a small country like Sri Lanka is not in a position to maintain an airline in that manner.

"We have no funds to purchase aircraft. We cannot invest a large capital. We take flights on lease. We need to join with a group which can bring in a large capital so as to continue the airline to ensure the job security of 6,000 employees," he said.

### Australia raises minimum savings for student visa, warns on fake recruitment

SYDNEY, May 8 (Reuters) - Australia said on Wednesday it would raise the amount of savings international students will need to get a visa and warned several colleges of fraudulent student recruitment practices, as part of efforts to rein in record migration.

From Friday, international students must show proof of savings of at least A$29,710 ($19,576) to get their visa, the second increase in about seven months. It was raised to A$24,505 from A$21,041 in October.

The moves follow a raft of actions in recent months to tighten the student visa rules as the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 triggered a sudden influx of migrants, exacerbating pressure on an already tight rental market.

English language requirements for student visas were increased in March and the government has been taking steps to end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay.

We have stood valiantly in the face of adversity, sacrificing for the greater good of our nation. Yet, there are whispers of temptation, enticing some of our comrades to forsake their loyalty for the allure of easy money and transient glory.‚Äù

### Sri Lanka gross foreign reserves rise to 3.5 year high in April

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs gross official reserves rose by 478 million US dollars in April 2024 to 5,438 million US dollars, official data shows, as the central bank continued broadly deflationary policy.

Deflationary policy (net sell downs of central bank-held domestic securities) at a market-appropriate interest rate allows a balance of payments surplus to develop.

The rupee sharply appreciated in March and early April, leading to importer bill delays and heavy reserve collections.

Some pressure came in the latter half of the month largely due to oversold position and the central bank used moral suasion and some dollar sales to keep the exchange rate stable.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs private credit is still weak, allowing reserves to be collected and the external sector to be kept stable easily.
