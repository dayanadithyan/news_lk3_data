The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the Twenty-Second Amendment to the Constitution Bill, the legal effect of which would be that a Bill that seeks to extend the term of office of the President or the duration of Parliament to over five years would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the People at a Referendum. The Bill seeks to amend present Article 83(b), according to which the maximum period to which such term or duration can be extended without a Referendum is six years. Article 83 also states that any Bill that seeks to amend Article 83 itself would require a two-thirds majority and approval at a Referendum. Thus, it is clear beyond doubt that the proposed Bill will require a two-thirds majority and a Referendum.

### 70,000 soldiers killed or injured in Russia in 2 months!Ministry of Defense of British Defense

In the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Britain's Defense Ministry reports significant casualties among Russian forces, estimating 70,000 soldiers killed or injured in just two months. The report details heavy losses, particularly in attempts to seize Ukraine's Karkiv region, with daily fatalities exceeding 1,000 in May and June. Despite capturing territory in eastern Ukraine, Russia's inability to sustain tactical victories and the poor training of its troops are highlighted as key factors contributing to these losses.

“This is why we have introduced the institutional restructuring. We have 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month time frame for institutional restructuring. We have to go with that time frame,” he said.

“We cannot oust 21,000 out of the 26,000 cadres because we only need 5,000. Out of the 21,000, some should leave with VRS and some others should leave through retirement. Annually 1,200 employees retire.”
