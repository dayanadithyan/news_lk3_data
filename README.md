The first reason is that we are continuously from the standpoint that a common candidate is not fielded on behalf of Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãand is making efforts to find a solution within the United Sri Lanka.. The position that a common candidate does not die on behalf of Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãis that there is no written agreement. Any political technique will be determined in accordance with the time flow - political situation change -. This is the political legacy.
