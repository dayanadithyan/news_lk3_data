### Frog species endemic to Sri Lanka rediscovered in India after 200 years

*2024-05-19 11:28:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99310/frog-species-endemic-to-sri-lanka-rediscovered-in-india-after-200-years) ┬╖ `en`

Researchers from the Zoological Survey of India, in partnership with the Andhra Pradesh Biodiversity Board, rediscovered the Sri Lankan golden-backed frog (Hylarana gracilis) after two centuries in the Koundinya wildlife sanctuary in the Chittoor district, the southernmost point of the Eastern Ghats in Andhra Pradesh. With this finding, the number of freshwater frog species in India rises to 20.

Bharath Bhupathi from the Zoological Survey of India, Hyderabad, encountered frogs of this species near a pond in the forest and suspected that it could be a new species. However, after consulting taxonomic experts and utilising morphological and DNA barcoding tools, the species was confirmed to be the Sri Lankan golden-backed frog Hylarana gracilis.

Mr. Bhupathi emphasizes that rediscovery is more significant than the discovery of a new species, as it provides evidence for the historic land bridge between India and Sri Lanka.

Puttalam, May 19 (Daily Mirror) - Over 280 kgs of narcotics were destroyed using a new high-powered incinerator built at a cost of over Rs. 11 million at Vanathavilluwa in Puttalam yesterday.

Previously, the government had to spend a significant amount of money to destroy seized stocks of drugs due to the lack of a permanent facility for this purpose. As a permanent solution, the new high-powered incinerator has been installed on 20 perches of land in the Lactose Garden area of Vanathavilluwa, owned by the STF.

This was partly due to the decrease in dollar-denominated expenses such as Annual Maintenance Cost (AMC), international settlement, and internet backbone charges due to the rupee appreciation.

Many journalists develop what may be called the grasshopper mind. In their work it is necessary to hop from one subject to another. If at the end of their lives they have little to show for their pains, they may have bitter sweet memories stored up squirrel-wise of unusual people and events.

There is of course, a certain vanity in being able to say, тАЬOh yes, I knew Mahatma GandhiтАЭ or I saw Bradman making his first century at Lords.тАЭ Such a display of self-esteem may even provoke the reaction if unexpressed, тАЬSo what.тАЭ There is no reason why anyone else should be interested. But not always. If we have a hero or a favourite, we like to listen to someone who has met and talked with him.

So BrowningтАЩs тАУ Ah, did you once see Shelley plain, And did he stop and speak to you And did he speak to you again? How strange it seems and new. I recall a sentimental journey made with a friend in search of the house near La Spezia to which ShelleyтАЩs body was brought after the drowning.

*2024-05-18 18:11:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/judges-and-judgments-of-the-past/) ┬╖ `en`

(Excerpts from the speech mde by Ranjan Gooneratne at the launch of his book, Before Justice awakes: Birth of the jury in the Island of Ceylon)

To the Romans, Justice was a goddess whose symbols were тАШa throne that tempest could not shake, a pulse that passion could not stir, eyes that were blind to any feeling of favour or ill will and a sword that fell on the offender with equal certaintyтАЩ.

Judges and lawyers from the nineteenth century were votaries of that goddess. They were blessed with the gift of grace, nobility of mind and intellectual humility.

In the early nineteenth century, we had Alexander Johnstone as our Chief Justice. He emancipated the slaves, introduced trial by jury to our country. Lord Grey in the House of Lords said, тАЬHis contribution to the advancement of the social and cultural life of the people of Ceylon has immortalized his nameтАЭ.

In 1840, we had William Rough, a Sargent-at-Law, a classical scholar as our Chief Justice. He was the son-in-law of John Wilkes.
