Dutch voters have begun four days of voting across the European Union, with exit polls suggesting a tight race between a left-green alliance and the party of anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.

Right-wing and far-right parties are widely expected to make big gains in many of the EU’s 27 member states, and that appears to have been borne out in the Netherlands, to an extent.

Although the Green-Labour alliance is set to take more seats in the European Parliament according to the exit poll, Mr Wilders’ Freedom Party is on course for big gains.

But he has not repeated the runaway victory of last November’s general election.

Under European law final results are not released until every country has voted, late on Sunday evening. Some 373 million Europeans are eligible to vote in the world’s second biggest democratic election after India.

USA, June 7 (BBC) - The United States pulled off one of the biggest shocks in cricket history by beating Pakistan in a super over in Dallas.

Pakistan looked to be avoiding embarrassment at the T20 World Cup before Nitish Kumar hit the final ball of the US innings for four to tie the scores at 159.

Sloppy for large parts of the game, Pakistan fell apart in the tie-breaker. Mohammad Amir bowled three wides, one of which the co-hosts also pinched two extra runs from.

The US scrambled to 18-1, leaving Pakistan to chase 19 off left-arm seamer Saurabh Netravalkar. When 14 were needed off four balls, Kumar made another crucial intervention, this time holding a magnificent catch at long-off to dismiss Iftikhar Ahmed.

With seven required from the last ball, Shadab Khan could only take a single, sparking joyous celebrations among the American players and supporters.

All this at the end of a riveting contest, one which fluctuated in the burning Texas sunshine.

### Modi’s inauguration ‘postponed’ as cracks emerge among allies

Cracks may be starting to emerge already in Narendra Modi’s attempts to form a coalition Government, with reports that the BJP’s minor allies are making big demands regarding policy changes.

Modi is being forced to negotiate terms with alliance members after his BJP unexpectedly failed to win a majority in the country’s election.

Indian media are quoting sources as saying Modi plans to push back his inauguration for a third term as PM until Sunday while the talks continue.

The Janata Dal (United) has reportedly asked the BJP to modify its controversial Agniveer scheme – a flagship military recruitment reform passed in 2022 that created short-term, US-style “tours of duty” for new soldiers. JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar is also expected to negotiate for key portfolios in Modi’s cabinet.

### CFOs: Stay nimble and informed to steer your organisation forward

Knowledge is power, and staying informed of trends will help you make relevant decisions to steer your team and organisation forward

Technology-led disruptions over the last four years have brought the future directly to us. Whether we are working in the private or public sector, we are now navigating rapid changes — sometimes daily.

As finance leaders, we are managing diverse, hybrid teams that span time zones and continents, keeping a pulse on record-high inflation that affects business costs, and ensuring that our finance teams remain relevant in this complex and rapidly changing business environment.

Adaption and being nimble have become second nature to us, but we cannot be complacent. During ongoing transformations, our work is not done. Staying proactive and informed are two strategies to be successful in the face of change; but, more importantly, they prepare us for leading diverse teams in a competitive global market.

### Indian Lok Sabha election - a view

*2024-06-07 01:24:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185482) · `ta`

In the recently concluded Indian Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, did not secure the expected 400 seats but still achieved a significant majority. This result limits the BJP's ability to unilaterally implement reforms. Despite this, Modi was re-elected for a third term. The election saw several surprises, including independent candidates winning against major parties. For instance, Amrit Pal Singh, despite being imprisoned, won in the Katur Sahib constituency, and Mohammed Haneefa triumphed in Ladakh over both Congress and BJP candidates. These outcomes highlight the dynamic nature of Indian politics and the potential for independent voices to impact electoral results positively.

🟩

The completed Indian Lok Sabha election has many interesting features. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been ruling in India for the past ten years, and the Prime Minister of the party, Narendra Modi, have not received 400 seats in the NDA's campaign.. Instead, only a large -scale majority to rule is to the people.

This has created an environment where the BJP is no longer able to decide for reforms in the country.. Although Indian voters have been given the opportunity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the third time.This time the BJP and the party's Prime Minister Narendra Modi have made the position that Telugu Desam Party leader Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, the leader of the United Janata Party, can be operated only after consultation.. Political observers have said that this is healthy for democracy.

### Why people shouldn’t fear  ‘Mr. Talent’ - EDITORIAL

These are days when people are working hard to make ends meet; even when the spouse is employed too. With regard to those frequenting the corridors of power, they too are working immensely hard to be in power when the next government is formed.

There was a recent meme (an image, video or piece of text) on Facebook which portrayed two candidates who are likely to bid for the presidency at the next big election. The one with a love for nature photography was saying ‘It would be my way only and there is no asking questions’. The other was saying the total opposite. He states in the meme, “Ask any question and I’ll give the answer again and again till you understand”. Great talent is needed to remain as a politician who wields power in the future because this is an era of discourse; not one of orders.

### Elephants are coming like tigers

Wild elephants in Sri Lanka are causing significant issues, behaving aggressively and leading to loss of human life. They target homes, disrupting daily life and education. The situation is likened to the actions of the LTTE, forcing residents from their villages. Despite being protective of habitats beneficial to them, they attack homes, highlighting the need for effective solutions to manage this crisis, especially to boost agriculture.

🟩

Former Wildlife Defense Minister and State MP Wimalaweera Dissanayake said that wild elephants were acting like the LTTE and could not sleep at night.

Wildlife Minister Pavithra Wanniyarachchi interrupted a question raised in the query in Parliament on Thursday (06) in Parliament.

Wild elephants have problems in all parts of the country.. Many of the human lives are lost when they take steps to address elephant problems.

Elephants do not attack the houses of the sides who are in favor of the elephants. Elephants do not attack the houses. Elephants are attacking the homes of the people.

Wild elephants behave like the Liberation Tigers, so that the residents leave their villages.. Students could not even go to school. Elephants kill the public

Elephant problems should be solved if they want to improve agriculture. Those who refer to as environmental experts have no better plan.
