With 30 presidential candidates, the Election Commission aims to conduct the election within 10 billion rupees, unsure if funds will suffice. The Commission is concerned about the rising number of candidates, especially commoners, affecting costs. The Ministry of Finance promises to allocate funds based on the Election Commission's estimates, acknowledging potential cost increases due to more candidates.

ЁЯЯй

Although the number of presidential candidates has now reached 30, the Election Commission is trying to hold the upcoming presidential election within 10 billion rupees, said Elections Commission Chairman RMAL Ratnayake.

In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Ratnayake said, тАЬIt is difficult to predict if allocated funds are sufficient. However, if the fund is inadequate, we are forced to demand additional funds.

In the meantime, the Election Commission has expressed concern over the increasing number of candidates as most commoners are contesting the election despite their election results.

According to the current rules, the Commission has not been able to control the number of candidates, but he said that the issue would not be considered during future elections.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance has promised to allocate funds based on the estimates that the Election Commission has put forward in view of the increasing number of candidates.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka is expecting a rice harvest of at least 1.771 million metric tonnes in the Yala minor agricultural season that is coming to an end, a projection by the Department of Agriculture shows.

The projection is made based on 477,299 hectares of rice cultivated up the end of June 2024, which was 1 percent lower than last year.

About 88 percent of the Yala season target of 540,627 hactare completed by June with some areas in Kurunegala, Puttalam, Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle and Matara remaining to cultivated.

In the 2023, Yala season, which was also a good year, 1.817 million metric tonnes of rice was harvested with 505,076 hectares cultivated and 491,672 harvested.

The Maha cropping season, which brings most of the rice crop, depends on inter-monsoon rains over which there are some concerns.   (Colombo/Aug12/2024)
