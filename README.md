### Sri Lanka budget deficit implodes 56-pct to April 2024, interest bill eases

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs budget deficit has collapsed to 361 billion rupees up to April 2024 from 824.2 helped by higher tax revenues and a falling interest bill, official data show.

Revenues surged 48 percent to 1,216 billion rupees to April 2024, ahead of the 35 percent annual growth projected in a budget, with higher value added and income tax rates as well as economic activity recovering close to previous levels.

Sri Lanka is emerging from the worst case of ‚Äòpolicy support‚Äô deployed by macroeconomists since the central bank was set up in 1950 where the usual inflationary rate cuts which trigger currency crises and IMF programs, was also backed up tax cuts.

Giving policy support and denying monetary stability has become mainstream in the age of inflation and ‚Äòage of external defaults without a war‚Äô due to so-called Saltwater-Cambridge doctrine, critics say.

Kohli was man of the match for his 76 and Rohit became the first India captain to lift a World Cup since 2011 following the captivating seven-run defeat of South Africa.

Rohit, 37, and 35-year-old Kohli are number one and two respectively on the all-time list of T20 international run-scorers.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve loved every moment of this,‚Äù said Rohit. ‚ÄúI started my India career playing this format. This is what I wanted. I wanted to win the cup and say thank you.‚Äù

On former captain Kohli, Rohit said: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been a champion player without a doubt. We all know what he has done for us.

‚ÄúAt some point everyone has to say goodbye to the game and Virat was very clear that this is what he wanted to do.‚Äù

Both men will continue to be available for India in Tests and one-day internationals.

### India wins Twenty20 World Cup in thrilling final against South Africa

*2024-06-29 23:44:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100187/india-wins-twenty20-world-cup-in-thrilling-final-against-south-africa) ¬∑ `en`

BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) ‚Äî India pulled off a sensational seven-run win against South Africa in a gripping final of the Twenty20 World Cup on Saturday.

South Africa, playing its first ever final of an ICC tournament, needed a run-a-ball 30 to win on the back of Heinrich Klaasen‚Äôs belligerent 52 off 27 balls.

But India‚Äôs pace bowlers roared back in the death overs to restrict them at 169-8.

Kohli‚Äôs first half-century at this tournament anchored India to 176-7 after captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and elected to bat.

India won its second T20 World Cup but its first world title in 12 years.

### Indian military tank sinks and kills 5 soldiers

*2024-06-29 22:51:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100186/indian-military-tank-sinks-and-kills-5-soldiers) ¬∑ `en`

Five Indian soldiers were killed when a military tank they were travelling in sank while crossing a river in the remote region of Ladakh that borders China, officials said Saturday.

The tank sank early Saturday due to sudden increase in the water levels of Shyok River during a military training activity, according to an Indian army command center statement. It said the accident took place in Saser Brangsa near the Line of Actual Control that divides India and China in the Ladakh region.

‚ÄúWe will never forget exemplary service of our gallant soldiers to the nation. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. The nation stands firm with them during this hour of grief,‚Äù Singh wrote on the social platform X.

The Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a standoff in Ladakh since May 2020, when they clashed along their land border in the region, with 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers killed.

### Range Bandara‚Äôs son granted bail

*2024-06-29 21:00:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100185/range-bandaras-son-granted-bail) ¬∑ `en`

UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara‚Äôs son Yasodha Range Bandara, who was arrested in connection with a car accident in Karuwalagaswewa area in Puttalam, has been granted bail by the Puttalam Magistrate‚Äôs Court.

After being presented to the court, the Acting Puttalam Magistrate has ordered the suspect to be released on a personal bail of Rs. 500,000.

He was arrested by officers following a vehicular accident that occurred early this morning (29).

The incident had occurred at around 4.30 a.m. in the Elephant Pass area near the 7th Mile Post, Mee-Oya, Karuwalagaswewa.

The car driven by Yasodha Range Bandara had reportedly veered off the road and collided with a three-wheeler.

The driver of the three-wheeler had sustained serious injuries in the crash and has been admitted to the Puttalam Base Hospital for treatment.

Yasodha Range Bandara had previously been arrested and remanded over a car accident in 2018.

ECONOMYNEXT  ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs budget foreign financing was negative in the first quarter of 2024, as the government repaid debt on a net basis, official data show.

Sri Lanka has a debt moratorium and unless new budget support loans come from agencies like the World Bank or Asian Development Bank, or some earlier projects disburse funds, the government has to keep servicing multilateral debt.

Foreign financing was a net repayment of 14.9 billion rupees in the first three months of the year, the central bank said which was lower than the negative 41.4 billion in 2024.

While interest payments will have to be serviced with the restructuring agreements of the bilaterals, new principle disbursements will take place as soon as projects are resumed.

Domestic financing was also lower at 296.1 billion rupees, down from 666.1 billion last year. (Colombo/June29/2024)

Sri Lanka expects to gain around $17 billion from its successful debt restructuring efforts with bilateral creditors, including India, Japan, and France, and negotiations with China. This achievement not only facilitates loan repayments but also strengthens its position for future international financial assistance. The country is also working towards reducing its total debt to 95% of GDP and lowering foreign loan interest to 4.5% of GDP, as part of its debt restructuring plan under IMF guidance.

Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabri said Sri Lanka would benefit from $ 17 billion benefit from the success of the debt reproductive process with bilateral credit providers.

Minister Ali Sabri said this at a media briefing held at the Presidential Media Center yesterday. As he further stated,

On April 12, 2022, Sri Lanka decided to suspend a certain amount of foreign loans. Some accused the rupee of Rs 600, 700, 1000 against the US dollar. But we controlled that situation.

For that, Lazart was appointed as our representative and Clipart Hans for legal matters. In the meantime, we first took steps to rebuild the domestic debt.

It is noteworthy that despite such activities, we have been working as a country to pay off the debt of many companies.
