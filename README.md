Colombo, March 28 (Daily Mirror)- The special commodity levy on rice was reduced not to allow import of rice but to clear a stock of rice currently stuck with the Customs, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said today.

He told reporters that a stock of Keeri Samba rice was imported in January to control the escalating prices and shortage in the market and that a part of that imported stock of rice was stuck with the Customs due to a delay in receiving the stock.

He said the special commodity levy on rice was reduced from Rs. 65 to Rs. 1 for a period of one week to facilitate the importers to get that rice stock cleared from the Customs.

"This move will not lead to import of new rice stocks as the reduction will be effective only for a week. The importers must clear the rice stock stuck with the Customs within a week," he said.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will import onions from China after an export ban by India and Pakistan pushed up domestic prices, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando said.

“Big onions, there is a shortage in India and Pakistan,” Fernando said. “Now we are importing from China.”

Fernando had previously said that a variety called Rose Onion will be imported instead of big onions due to rising onion prices.

Sri Lanka grows onions under import tax protection and domestic production is seasonal and imports supplement demand.

3,500 hectares of onions were planted in the 2023 yala season, but crops were destroyed by unusually heavy rains before harvesting, the Department of Agriculture said.

Demand remains high ahead of several religious and cultural festivals.

However, the Department of Agriculture said that 75,000 kilos of big onion bulbs were vernalized for planting in the 2024 yala season.
