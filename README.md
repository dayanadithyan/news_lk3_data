### Supreme Court ruling that President Ranil Wickremesinghe‚Äôs defiant action in postponing Local Government polls in 2023  had violated the fundamental right to equality and the right to vote of citizens,should come as no surprise

*2024-08-25 00:54:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84595) ¬∑ `en`

Sri Lanka‚Äôs Supreme Court ruling this week that President Ranil Wickremesinghe‚Äôs defiant action in postponing Local Government polls in 2023, citing a purported lack of funds in the wake of the country‚Äôs bankruptcy, had violated the fundamental right to equality and the right to vote of citizens, raises several interesting issues.

In fact, this decision should come as no surprise.  There was little choice but to hold as the Bench did, relying on several precedents which have firmly established the predominant principle that, exercising the right of franchise is an inviolable right of citizens, it is a collective as well as an individual right. The Court found the President (also as Minister of Finance) responsible along with the luckless Elections Commission.

In 1974, I wandered in the Veyangoda area with Georg (adviser) and Piyasiri (research assistant) to find a suitable village to study what socioeconomic and political factors influenced people to get together for public benefit. On the third day, at a tea kiosk, we met Guneratne (Gune), a farmer, who invited us to his house at Naiwela.

Gune lived in an old house with a tiled roof and a cemented floor. I told him we were looking for a village to study the cooperative behaviour of people and a place to stay for a few months. He proposed we study Naiwela and stay at his house. He worried about Georg, saying, ‚ÄúSuddas (white people) can‚Äôt live in a village because they need creature comforts.‚Äù

### What the majority want from a new government

*2024-08-25 00:45:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/what-the-majority-want-from-a-new-government/) ¬∑ `en`

Now that the presidential election is round the corner and would be followed by a general election, the majority of law-abiding, patriotic, selfless and non-partisan people would want many changes in the system to bring this country back to where it was in the early nineteen fifties.

The first thing many are clamoring for is to abolish the executive presidency. This office has been a bane rather than a boon to this country and its people. It has only helped to enrich some who achieved this position. As we can remember, there were many previous occupants of this office who promised abolish it if they were elected, but reneged on their promise.

The powers attached to the executive presidency have been misused even by those with a good educational background and we have seen how the prerogative of the presidential pardon had been utilized to pardon murderers, drug dealers, child rapists, etc.

### Sajith and Anura Promise to Abolish the Executive Pesidency if they come to Powe; Reality is that people are not going to trust politicians who make such promises again.

*2024-08-25 00:27:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84590) ¬∑ `en`

There was a period when the abolition of the executive presidential system was a key issue at Presidential Elections. However, such a situation cannot be expected to arise again.

The politicians who promised to abolish the executive presidency have not only failed to do so after winning the election and assuming office as president, but have also taken action to increase their powers. Therefore, the reality is that people are not going to trust politicians who make such promises again.

However, now that the Presidential Election campaigns are heating up, talks of the abolition of the executive presidency have resumed. Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader Sajith Premadasa and National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake have promised on election platforms last week that if they win the Presidential Election and come to power, they will abolish the presidential system and bring back the parliamentary system.
