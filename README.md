### The appointment of the Inspector General of Police is legally and constitutional: Speaker

Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena defended the appointment of the Inspector General of Police as constitutional and correct, despite criticism. He denied allegations of wrongdoing, stating decisions were made in accordance with the constitution. The process involved the approval of both the Constituent Assembly and Parliament, marking an unprecedented move. He suggested that in cases of vacancy, there should be established procedures or judicial intervention, emphasizing that even the President cannot make such appointments unilaterally.

ЁЯЯй

The police chief affair is very complicated. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said that allegations are being made against me that this situation was due to the wrong decision taken by me.

The Speaker said this while commenting on the appointment of the Inspector General of Police in Parliament today (26).

We have not taken any wrong decision. We have taken a reasonable, right resolution of the constitution deeply. That resolution may seem incorrectly for you (awakening the opposition). But we made that decision in the right way.

I have taken this decision from the house and is completely false. 41 (d) - I used the word for me in Article 5. The appointment of the Inspector General of Police with the approval of the Constituent Assembly and the approval of the Parliament was unprecedented.

So there are steps to solve this post in case of vacuum. Or the court must provide a solution for this. He said that even the president could not decide on this.

### Sri Lanka election announcement triggers unexpected constitutional conundrum

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ The formal announcement of the presidential elections on Friday has triggered limitations on the executive that will complicate its uneasy relations with the judiciary and plunge the country into a constitutional conundrum, as an acting police chief was not immediately appointed following a court order.

Incumbent Inspector General, Deshabandu Tennakoon, was barred from exercising the powers of his position by the Supreme Court, which decided to hear nine petitions against his controversial appointment in February.

Election officials said the executive loses its power to make any appointments or even transfer public servants when an election has been called. This restriction could hinder the appointment of an acting police chief.

Although the court has said President Ranil Wickremesinghe can appoint a suitable officer as the Acting Inspector General, no immediate action was taken, and the operation of election law from Friday bars him from doing so.

Given the upcoming Presidential Election, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been advised by his legal team that appointing an Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) every two weeks could lead to election petitions against him.

Consequently, the President has informed the Speaker of Parliament that he will refrain from getting involved in this matter, sources told Ada Derana.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena is scheduled to officially inform Parliament of the governmentтАЩs official position on the Supreme Court decision regarding the post of the IGP, in a special statement today (26).

An agenda for restoring democratic government calls for major changes in the Constitution as well as the system of government

2024 is a year of elections to choose a new President and possibly a new Parliament. In that context, the theme of political and constitutional reforms has once again begun to draw the attention of the citizens, civil society movements and political parties. It is necessary to recognise that any constitutional reform effort should have two main goals. They are (a) restoring the countryтАЩs parliamentary democracy and (b) replacing, not just reforming, the existing 1978 Constitution with a new and democratic constitution. A new constitution should also give effect to the democratising hopes of the people of Sri Lanka.

Therefore, an agenda for restoring democratic government calls for major changes in the Constitution as well as the system of government.

### Fitch says lower generation costs support CEBтАЩs tariff cut; no risk to IPP payments

Fitch Ratings said yesterday Ceylon Electricity BoardтАЩs (CEB, BB+(lka)/Stable) cash flow will stay adequate to service debt despite a 22.5% tariff cut from 16 July 2024.

Fitch does not expect the latest cut to affect the Sri Lankan electricity distributorтАЩs payments to independent power producers (IPPs). Lower tariffs are supported by falling generation costs from CEBтАЩs higher mix of hydropower and lower coal prices YoY. Financing costs will also fall amid lower market interest rates, Fitch said.

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri LankaтАЩs instruction on the 22.5% average tariff cut, made during the regulatorтАЩs quarterly tariff review, was larger than the 10% proposed by CEB. However, generation costs have fallen in tandem with the rise in hydropower to 31% of the generation mix in 1H24 (1H23: 23%), while prices of coal, which fuels over 36% of the countryтАЩs generation mix, have dropped 32% YoY. Fitch expects thermal coal prices to fall 20% and 10% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.
