### Issues facing Inland Revenue Department in tax collection

*2024-03-25 22:49:10* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Issues-facing-Inland-Revenue-Department-in-tax-collection/4-759916) · `en`

The IRD has encountered significant challenges in meeting its tax collection targets. As of October 2023, the IRD collected 82% of the projected revenue, amounting to Rs. 740 billion out of an expected Rs. 908 billion.

The slowdown in collection was particularly noticeable in the second half of the year, attributed to the Central Bank’s interest rate policy directive in August, which impacted corporate tax inflow. Financial institutions, which are major contributors to corporate taxes, have been affected by the monetary policy, leading to a shortfall in Government revenue.

The IRD set ambitious targets for corporate taxes at Rs. 603 billion and non-corporate taxes at Rs. 305 billion for 2023. By October, 77% of the corporate taxes and 91% of the non-corporate taxes were collected.

The 2024 Budget aims to increase tax revenue to Rs. 4 trillion, up from Rs. 3 trillion in 2023, with a significant portion expected from taxes on income and profit.

The Colombo High Court has decided to deliver the order over the revision application filed by former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella seeking to be released on bail, on April 03 2024.

This order was issued by Colombo High Court judge Sujeewa Nissanka, when the relevant petition was taken up for consideration today (25).

The attorneys representing Rambukwella, who is in remand custody in connection with the substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) procurement, submitted the revision bail application to the Colombo High Court on March 15 after the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court had rejected bail for the former Health Minister, the former health secretary and 4 other accused in the case.
