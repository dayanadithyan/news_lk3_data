This resulted in extra expenses being incurred on chartered flights, hotel bookings, venue hiring fees and travel, among others.

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) made it clear during the ACC council meeting in Bali last week that it was not willing to take the financial burden as it did not earn extra and was also not the official host of the tournament.

The expenses also reportedly soared because the former PCB chairman, Zaka Ashraf, changed the venue of the first match from Lahore to Multan.

“The annual number of reported cases has doubled, escalating from 450 to a staggering 900, raising concerns within the healthcare community,” he pointed out.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Dr. Perera attributed this concerning surge to the growing prevalence of sedentary lifestyles among children, notably pointing out the increasing addiction to mobile phones as a contributing factor.

He underscored the link between this lifestyle trend and the rise in non-communicable diseases, with leukaemia and brain cancer notably on the rise among the younger population.

### Sri Lanka private credit surge Rs97bn in Dec 2023

*2024-02-05 07:55:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-private-credit-surge-rs97bn-in-dec-2023-149846/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka’s private credit to businesses and individuals surged in December 2023 97.5 billion rupees from 62.5 billion rupees a month earlier, official data shows as bank loans continue a positive trend.

Sri Lanka’s private credit became negative around June 2022 after rates were hiked in April and intervention using Indian ACU balances also ended a little later, allowing the economy to adjust to market linked inflows.

Countries usually go through a period of de-leveraging or a recession when stabilization policies are applied after a central bank mis-target rates with inflationary open market operations, and fires credit beyond deposits available in the banking system.

In countries with floating exchange rates with positive inflation targets, where balance of payments problems in the form of forex shortages do not take place, long periods of mis-targeted rates with reverse repo operations end up in housing or asset price bubbles.
