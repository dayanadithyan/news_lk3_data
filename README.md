### The right to self -determination has the right to the Tamil people living in the North and East;The United Socialist Party does not stumble like other parties on this issue -

*2024-08-15 11:51:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191132) ┬╖ `ta`

The United Socialist Party supports the Tamil community's right to self-determination in Sri Lanka's North and East, differing from other parties' stances. They argue against using the 13th Amendment as a vote-grabbing tactic among minorities. Despite potential national disagreement, they believe in fairness and oppose the notion that granting self-determination would lead to division, citing past political shifts as evidence.

ЁЯЯй

The United Socialist Party's presidential candidate Sinhangjayasuriya has said that the party has never stumbled on the issue of the Tamil community in the North and East.

The 13th Amendment is used as a tool to get votes from minorities during elections.

However, we belong to the United Socialist Party.

We firmly believe that the Tamil community in the North East has the right to self -determination.

Our position may not be supported in some parts of the country, but we think this is fair.

We do not think that the people of the North East are more interested in implementing the current 13 -year -old.

We do not think that giving the Tamils тАЛтАЛthe right to self -determination will divide the country.

For example, the JVP once strongly opposed the 13th Amendment and used violence against it.

But they have changed their position.
