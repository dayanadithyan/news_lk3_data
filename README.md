Meanwhile, the water levels of Gin, Kalu and Nilwala rivers have also increased significantly today (30).

It is also warned that there is a risk of flooding if heavy rainfall continues.

The Department of Irrigation further stated that people living in low-lying areas should pay high attention in this regard as the water levels of these rivers may rise unexpectedly.

### UK Parliament dissolves ahead of July 4 general election

*2024-05-30 08:51:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99526/uk-parliament-dissolves-ahead-of-july-4-general-election) · `en`

The British parliament dissolved on Thursday ahead of a July 4 general election, which looks set to bring Labour to power after 14 years of Conservative rule.

Five weeks of campaigning officially began as 650 seats of members of parliament (MPs) became vacant at one minute past midnight (2301 GMT) in line with the electoral schedule.

The first week of campaigning has seen a shaky start following Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s rain-drenched election announcement, with many observers taking the downpour as a bad omen.

Sunak set the election for July 4, instead of later in the year as had been widely expected, in what observers said was an attempt to regain momentum as his party slides in opinion polls.

After 14 years in opposition, the Labour party now has the chance to win back power with its leader Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, at the helm.
