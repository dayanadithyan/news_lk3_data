### Politics and the Plantation Wage

*2024-07-01 11:00:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/politics-and-the-plantation-wage/) · `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe chose the Ceylon Workers’ Congress May Day platform, in Kotagala, to announce the increase of the plantation workers’ daily wage to Rs 1,700.00. An unexpected presidential fiat, delivered just a few months before a possible election by a potential presidential candidate, was made public from the political platform of a major plantation trade union, generally seen as pro-government. The self-evident political implications do not merit either debate or elaboration.

In a rational world, in any industry, the employer and the employee should arrive at a fair wage through a consultative process. The unsolicited intervention of a third force with an agenda unrelated to the interests of either party, is undesirable from all points of view. Still, there are precedents, when sitting presidents have mandated wage increases in the plantation sector, for patently political reasons, ignoring the possible toxic economic consequences.

The proposal, which was submitted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, was defeated with 05 votes against it while 03 members voted in favour.

Rajaratnam’s current term is set to expire at the end of this month, and the President had proposed an extension for an additional six months.

However, the proposal requires the approval of the Constitutional Council, which twice defeated it.

Accordingly, Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe, who is the son of former Chief Justice K. A. Parinda Ranasinghe has been appointed as the Acting AG.

Iran’s elections are not ‘free and fair,’ the US State Department told Iran International on Sunday, in its first comments on the results of Friday’s votes that led to a runoff between a moderate and a hardline candidate.

The June 28 presidential election marked the lowest voter turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic, with only 39.92 percent participation. This breaks the previous record set during the last election, in which the late President Ebrahim Raisi won with a turnout of 48 percent.

“The elections in Iran are not free and fair,” a State Department spokesperson said.

“Unfortunately, we have no expectation that these elections, whatever the outcome, will lead to fundamental change in Iran’s direction or more respect by the Iranian regime for the human rights of Iran’s citizens,” the spokesperson added, as the Iranian government prepares for a runoff presidential election slated for July 5.

Sri Lanka should advocate for genuine and impactful change from the next UK government while also striving for systemic change within its own country

The anticipated victory of the Labour Party in the forthcoming general election in the United Kingdom presents a pivotal opportunity for political activists campaigning for a fairer and more sustainable Sri Lanka. This potential shift in power offers a chance to press for significant changes in the global economic order. For Sri Lanka to overcome its external debt crisis and economic difficulties, Labour’s commitment to strengthening and reforming multilateral institutions, tackling corruption and illicit money flows, and supporting the recovery of stolen assets is crucial.

The table illustrates the accumulated foreign currency inflow gap for Sri Lanka over the past five years compared to 2018, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Easter Sunday attacks. To emerge from the current crisis, it is crucial to strengthen and expand these verticals. According to the table, Sri Lanka has experienced a loss of about $ 26 billion over the past five years, compared to if it had maintained the same inflow numbers as in 2018 each year.

The impact from tourism over the past five years amounts to approximately $ 13.9 billion. During this period, the industry was severely affected due to a global tourism slowdown. Consequently, we failed to maintain hotel standards even at their previous levels. This has resulted in poor conditions of the facilities, pressing room rates down compared to regional competitors.

### Taking the dread, apprehension and suspicion out of Performance Reviews

Employees must believe that PRs are fora where they can openly discuss their needs and concerns

A pulse check of corporate Sri Lanka reveals that there are mixed feelings about the appropriateness and effectiveness of Performance Reviews (PRs). While there are some who swear on the positive role which PRs play through their focus on goal setting, performance monitoring and employee development under an overarching umbrella of performance management, there are others who believe that PRs do more harm than good because they are not conducted methodically, transparently and/or democratically and because they are too focused on the past, time-wasting, one-sided, inaccurate, unfair, pre-meditated and biased.

### Rock, paper, scissors: Sri Lanka’s mineral merry-go-round

We can achieve little in isolation in this modern milieu, and this rings true even in the muddy business of minerals and mining

Sri Lanka’s mineral resources were once again in the spotlight recently, when news broke that India had shown interest in acquiring mines in Sri Lanka. As detailed in a study by the Institute of Policy Studies earlier this year, the local graphite industry must reposition itself with adequate international partnerships to take maximum advantage of the resource. Sri Lanka has about 1.5 million tonnes of graphite, which is inadequate to meet serious international demand, but the quality of the deposit promises a high price.

German investment via Bogala Graphite Ltd. over the past two decades have seen significant value addition and enhanced operating standards, and despite a 70% decline in operating profits last year due to global exigencies the sector has grown well with foreign participation.

### Imputed Rental Income Tax is an additional burden

*2024-07-01 05:30:31* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Imputed-Rental-Income-Tax-is-an-additional-burden/14-763699) · `en`

Many owners of houses (that are somewhat small) located in Colombo have given these on rent and have moved to more spacious houses in the suburbs.

This they are compelled to do when family members increase when their children get married. The rent received from these houses is not enough to pay the rent for the relatively bigger house. Inevitably they have to pocket out an extra sum of money to bridge the difference.

With the proposed imputed rental income to be implemented in mid-next year, this will become an additional burden for the home owners who have given their houses for a smaller rent and paying a bigger amount for the occupation of a larger house. Hope the President will rescind the move to impose the “Imputed Rental Income” for the above reason.

### Complaint filed against SIS over COVID-19 forced cremations

Activist Chirantha Amerasinghe filed a complaint against the State Intelligence Service (SIS) over the controversial forced cremations of COVID-19 dead. Amerasinghe and several others filed the complaint at the Sri Lanka Police Headquarters on Saturday.

Speaking to the media, Amerasinghe said the mandatory cremation policy was imposed to target the Muslim community in an attempt to oppress them.

He noted that while the Easter Sunday attack mastermind Zahran Hashim at one point could not find followers for his cause, the various attacks against the Muslim community helped him recruit over 35 members at the time.

Amerasinghe claimed that the SIS had informed the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) that COVID-19 could spread through water contamination. Based on this SIS information, he said he was detained by the police in 2020 after he posted on social media that there was no evidence of negative impacts from burying COVID-19 victims.

### ADIC urges halt to cannabis cultivation initiative in SL

Marking the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, the Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) has issued a pressing call to halt recent efforts to legalise the cultivation of cannabis in Sri Lanka.

Despite the Ministry of Investment Promotion and the Indigenous Medicine Section of the Ministry of Health actively seeking project proposals for the cultivation of cannabis for export and medicinal purposes, ADIC raised significant concerns about the initiative’s true impact on the country.

In a press release, ADIC noted that while the ministries assert that their primary aim is to achieve economic benefits through cannabis exports, thereby enhancing Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange reserves, a comprehensive review by ADIC of financial records from leading cannabis firms worldwide suggests otherwise.
