Colombo, May 08 (Daily Mirror)- Following the deaths of two inmates at the Magazine Prison allegedly after consuming a parcel of rice containing pork curry, the Department of Prisons has announced an internal investigation into the incident.

According to sources, the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) has issued an open verdict regarding their autopsies.

However, the bodies are slated to undergo further examination at the Medical Research Institute of Sri Lanka (MRI).

The deceased individuals, who were detained on charges of trafficking 'Ice' narcotics, were part of a group of approximately 15 inmates who had consumed the parcel of rice brought by relatives.

This led to three inmates being hospitalized at the National Hospital, Colombo for suspected food poisoning.

Subsequently, two of them succumbed to the illness, while another remains in a critical condition.

Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said today that no airline in the world has profit, which is a natural situation for all airlines.

He told parliament that airlines in rich countries such as Air India, POAC and Swiss Airlines have not made profits and some have been sold.

Responding to a query by SJB MP Hesha Vidhanage, the minister said that due to a loss, Air India had sold it to Tata and the government had paid $ 2 to 3 billion each year to Emirates.

He said a small country like Sri Lanka was not in the process of maintaining airlines.

‚ÄúWe don't have funds to buy a flight. Large capital cannot be invested. We take flights for leasing. We must join the group that can bring a big capital to pursue airlines to ensure the safety of 6,000 employees, ‚Äùhe said.

In 2023, 791 employees were recruited to SriLankan Airlines, which was the largest recruitment in the last 10 years, while it caused a loss of Rs 609 billion by the end of 2023.

SYDNEY, May 8 (Reuters) - Australia said on Wednesday it would raise the amount of savings international students will need to get a visa and warned several colleges of fraudulent student recruitment practices, as part of efforts to rein in record migration.

From Friday, international students must show proof of savings of at least A$29,710 ($19,576) to get their visa, the second increase in about seven months. It was raised to A$24,505 from A$21,041 in October.

The moves follow a raft of actions in recent months to tighten the student visa rules as the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 triggered a sudden influx of migrants, exacerbating pressure on an already tight rental market.

English language requirements for student visas were increased in March and the government has been taking steps to end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay.
