ஹமாஸ் இஸ்ரேல் யுத்தம் ஆரம்பித்த பின்னர் இடம்பெற்ற சம்பவங்களில் மிக மோசமான சம்பவம் என குறிப்பிடத்தக்க சம்பவம் வியாழக்கிழமை இடம்பெற்றுள்ளது.

காசாவில் உணவை பெறுவதற்காக பெருமளவில் திரண்டிருந்த மக்கள் மீது இஸ்ரேல் தாக்குதலை மேற்கொண்டதில் நூற்றுக்கும் மேற்பட்டவர்கள் கொல்லப்பட்டுள்ளனர்.

உணவுவாகனங்களை நோக்கி பெருமளவில் திரண்ட பசியின் பிடியில் சிக்கியுள்ள பாலஸ்தீனியர்கள் மீது இஸ்ரேல் மேற்கொண்ட தாக்குதலில் 117 பாலஸ்தீனியர்கள் கொல்லப்பட்டுள்ளனர் என பாலஸ்தீன சுகாதார அமைச்சு தெரிவித்துள்ளது.

முற்றுகைக்குள்ளாகியுள்ள காசா பள்ளத்தாக்கில்  பசியும் பட்டினியும் பெருமளவில் காணப்படும் ஒரு சூழ்நிலையிலேயே இந்த சம்பவம் இடம்பெற்றுள்ளது.

இங்கு உணவுப்பொருட்களுடன் வாகனங்கள் வருவது குறைவு என்பதால் அவ்வாறான வாகனங்களை பார்த்தவுடன் பட்டினியில் சிக்குண்டுள்ள மக்கள் பதற்றம் ஏற்படுவது வழமை.

எனினும் என்ன நடந்தது என்பது குறித்து இஸ்ரேலும் சம்பவத்தை நேரில் பார்த்தவர்களும் தெரிவித்த விடயங்களில் முரண்பாடுகள் உள்ளன.

India’s economy grew at its fastest pace in one-and-half years in the final three months of 2023, led by strong manufacturing and construction activity and bolstering Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic record just months before a national election.

“The ongoing growth momentum is indicative of the Indian economy’s resilience, notwithstanding global headwinds,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, economist at India Ratings, noting that industrial growth continued its good run in the quarter.

India has consistently beat market expectations and is ranked as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with China struggling to recover after the pandemic and the euro zone narrowly escaping a recession.

India revised its growth estimate for the current fiscal year to March 31 to 7.6% from 7.3%.

### Sri Lanka’s quest for economic independence: Navigating the maze of agricultural exports

There are a number of reasons to still be optimistic about the future

Sri Lanka, despite being a nation with a rich history once known to be self-sufficient as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean and a strategically located trading hub on the maritime Silk Route fostering a vibrant culture, has long grappled with achieving consistent and sustainable economic independence, especially since after the worst economic crisis the country ever faced recently in 2022. One of the key areas where this struggle is most evident is in agriculture which has been the backbone of the island nation’s economy for centuries, still employing nearly a third of the population, especially made up by daily wage-earning rural communities, particularly women, and contributes substantially to Sri Lanka’s GDP as well as food security.

There was a recent report in the Daily Mirror stating the inconveniences caused to locals due to businesses conducted by Israeli, Russian and Ukrainian nationals in the southern part of Sri Lanka. This report demands deep pondering investigation.

As much as such businesses are eating into the earning opportunities of locals, we also must think that there are hidden opportunities for business here when some people think that all is lost in this sun-kissed paradise island. These foreign nationals are operating bars, restaurants, giving surfing lessons, buying or leasing lands and renting out tuk-tuks; the latter to cut down on travel expenses. Wow! The message that foreign nationals are giving to all of Sri Lanka is that ‘if you cannot do business here in this country we’ll show you how’.

Displaced Palestinian children gather for food in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. AFP

The October 7, 2023, attacks the Palestinian resistance group Hama launched on Israel did not happen in a vacuum. In October last year, weeks after the Hamas attack, the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, told the UN Security Council that “it is important to recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum.”

Intellectuals avoid jumping to conclusions. They investigate all sides of an issue, including its history, context, and surrounding narratives, to form an opinion grounded in justice. The Secretary-General was not taking sides in the Israel-Palestinian question. His speech conformed to what was expected of an intellectual and a UN official committed to standing up for justice.

### Retelling the story of China and why it’s important

China appears to continue doing what it does best – move forward. And this perspective, whether for China, or any other country of the Global South, remains vital

A debt trap. A dispute at sea. A trade threat. An anomaly. A friend of Russia. The many names China has been called in recent years doesn’t require much reiteration, because they are already so engrained in our minds; either by label-repetition, international media-unison and perhaps also because of China’s Achilles’ heels – limitations with the English language and Western expression.

Meeting with Chinese counterparts over the last month, I only had one question. Why don’t they fight the provocation much harder? And moreover fight it in public spaces rather than behind closed diplomatic doors where the risk for facts to be eluded and stereotypes resorted to being much higher. A case in point is perhaps the blatant press leaks to a closed door diplomatic meeting at the G20; a clear unapologetic breach of pacta sunt servanda.

While inflation may have decreased in real terms, stagnant wages and rising taxes have eroded the purchasing power of citizens, exacerbating poverty and inequality

The economic landscape of Sri Lanka has been a subject of fervent debate in recent times, with conflicting narratives surrounding the notion of stability. On the surface, there are indicators suggesting positive growth and progress, yet beneath the veneer lies a stark reality of pervasive instability, particularly for a significant portion of the population.

The above verse from the Holy Quran is a reminder to the entire mankind contextually adapted for the current political climate. Broadly, the condition of any people revolves around two major generic areas. The good and bad. It is only when bad has taken root, there will be a need for mankind to change towards goodness. And, until and unless man himself has decided to change the badness in him, nothing is going to change.

### Go to court if the Speaker's decision is error - Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa

*2024-02-29 23:54:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177633) · `ta`

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakse said that the Speaker's decision to head the Constituent Assembly on the appointment of the new Inspector General of Police could go to court.

He was speaking to the media at a function held on Thursday (29) in the Pannipitiya area of Maharagama.

Many people are criticizing the Speaker's decision during the appointment of the new Inspector General of Police. But the main reason for this problem is that even though the constitutional amendment has taken steps to appoint 10 members to the Constituent Assembly, the representative of the small parties will not be named.

Due to this problem, the Speaker is facing practical problems. So if you think that there is any legal problem in the Speaker's decision, the best place for the constitution is the best place for legal issues in the Constitution.

At least 104 people were killed and more than 280 wounded in the incident near Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said, and the death toll in nearly five months of war passed 30,000.

Medical teams said they were unable to cope with the volume and severity of the injuries, with dozens of wounded taken to the al-Shifa hospital, which is only partially operational after Israeli raids on the facility.

The incident caused the largest loss of civilian lives in weeks. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said it was an “ugly massacre conducted by the Israeli occupation army on people who waited for aid trucks at the Nabulsi roundabout”.

As the first step towards reducing the weight of school bags, the Ministry has decided to print textbooks in batches.

Letting schoolchildren bring only their workbooks except textbooks under the direct supervision of the respective school principals would be an alternative decision, she said.

### Charity; soon drastic water cuts; overseas idiosyncrasies

*2024-02-29 22:17:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/charity-soon-drastic-water-cuts-overseas-idiosyncrasies/) · `en`

Our President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who goes his own way following Sinatra’s I did it my way; mostly flying across oceans to attend this meeting and that, has again done it his way. He has initiated a million-dollar fund to help children of the Gaza strip. They are in a horrifyingly pitiable state and need all the help they can get, but can a bankrupt country, still far from becoming solvent, extend big charity to the outside world? Also, what about our children of this country driven to poverty by greedy, heartless political bosses who amassed wealth and let the country go to pot as we used to say.
