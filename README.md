Opting to bowl first after winning the toss, Afghanistan's decision seemed justified as they struck early, dismissing opener Pathum Nissanka cheaply.

Sri Lanka were four wickets down for just 55 runs when Hasaranga walked in.

Hasaranga's aggressive approach, featuring three sixes and seven boundaries, propelled Sri Lanka's total to a competitive score.

For Afghanistan, Fazalhaq Farooqi was the pick of the bowlers, picking up three wickets for 25 runs. Naveen-ul-Haq and Azmatullah Omarzai also chipped in with two wickets each.

### Britain’s oldest warship named HMS Trincomalee

The HMS Trincomalee which was constructed in 1817 in Mumbai stands as the Royal Navy's last ship built in India, boasting over two centuries of history.

According to the National Museum of the Royal Navy, prior to its current mooring in Hartlepool, this illustrious ship sailed more than 100,000 miles worldwide. Remarkably, HMS Trincomalee never engaged in battle but holds a rich narrative of service, ranging from patrol and protection to exploration.

Now anchored in Hartlepool, HMS Trincomalee represents one of the two Leda-Class Frigates commissioned by the Royal Navy in 1812. Its name commemorates the 1782 Battle of Trincomalee off the coast of the Indian subcontinent, the historic clash between British and French fleets during the Anglo-French War (1778-1783).

The choice to build in India was influenced by a scarcity of oak in England, exacerbated by the ongoing Napoleonic Wars, and the strategic location of Bombay.
