It led to opportunities for workers from countries like India and Sri Lanka.

### When the School Life you Cherish is Threatened! - EDITORIAL

*2024-02-23 01:13:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/When-the-School-Life-you-Cherish-is-Threatened-EDITORIAL/172-277595) · `en`

The Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) must consider the plight of mothers and fathers who are struggling to send their children to school and complete the basic education of their offspring. General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU), Joseph Stalin has been quoted in the media stating that the dropout and the absenteeism rate in schools is high and alarming at present; despite such figures not having reached their peak as yet.

The once in a lifetime opportunity children get to spend a 13-year-period in school is now threatened. Parents are finding it extremely difficult to send their children to school because academic institutes are now expecting parents to bear certain education expenses which were once borne by the state.

### Palestine question: US blamed for veto; Brazil, Guyana hailed, Lanka nowhere

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield casting the veto vote against the UN Security Council resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. AFP

Burying the values the United States presidents often speak highly of during their policy speeches, Washington once again inhumanely used its veto power at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday to kill Algeria’s resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

It is revolting to see Washington’s UN envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a political science lecturer, diplomat, and private sector executive not known for human rights or humanitarian activism, raise her hand at the UNSC to veto the resolution. This was the third time her hand went up in support of genocide, ethnic cleansing, and Israel’s war crimes in the Gaza Strip. As a paid servant of the US administration, she does whatever she is commanded to do by President Joe Biden, who is being flayed on social media as Genocide Joe.

### Banks alarmed over parate execution suspension move

Move seen as caving to pressure from debt evaders’ intense lobbying

Stress any move to amend parate rights of banks must be initiated with the financial sector regulator

Sri Lanka’s banking sector is on the edge of following the government’s decision to suspend parate execution rights. This move, seen as caving to pressure from debt evaders’ intense lobbying, is raising concerns about the sector’s ability to support economic recovery.

“The banks believe that this is an unnecessary intervention that  will weaken the strength of banks to perform their role in supporting the economic sectors that will revive the country,” the Sri Lanka Banks Association (SLBA) told Mirror Business, while pointing out they are “alarmed” by the statement made by the State Minister of Finance, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, in parliament this week.

The SLBA urged the government not to play into the delaying tactics of these borrowers.

### Let Dudley speak

*2024-02-22 23:52:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Let-Dudley-speak/4-758798) · `en`

By chasing away Dudley Sirisena in that manner, the students violated a basic tenet of higher learning

“Everything is abnormal in our society; that is how these things happen, and, when they do, nobody knows how to act – not only in the most difficult situations, but even in the simplest”

“Happy families are all alike, every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way” – Anna Karenina-Leo Tolstoy

Sirisena should have been heard by the students. From every dialog there is something to be learnt. When a person talks about his career, he is invariably the hero of the story, his success is presented in heroic terms. It is for the listener to give an intelligent ear. Openness to the ‘other’ is fundamental to the intellectual process

### COPF questions Fin. Min.’s reluctance to adopt VAT amendment recommendations

The Finance Ministry officials have told the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) that the revenue loss incurred from the initial ‘sugar scam’ should be classified as tax foregone, instead of a tax loss.

This was mentioned when the Finance Ministry officials were summoned before the COPF on Tuesday (22).

When asked about the progress of recovering the lost revenue resulting from the initial ‘sugar scam’, as highlighted in the report by the Auditor General, the ministerial officials contended that it should not be classified as a tax loss, but rather as tax foregone due to the reduction of the special commodity levy from Rs. 50 to 25 cents.

Despite this explanation, the COPF members pressed the officials for data on certain companies that had disproportionately profited from this tax adjustment, amounting to Rs. 1.4 billion from six companies, with an additional six companies yet to be investigated.

While every conflict is different, there were – and are – features of the Gazan conflagration that resonate strongly with the final stages of Sri Lanka’s 26-year-long civil war

“This seems familiar” was the response of many Sri Lankans to the Israeli military action in Gaza initiated in the wake of the appalling 7 October Hamas attack. While every conflict is different, there were – and are – features of the Gazan conflagration that resonate strongly with the final stages of Sri Lanka’s 26-year-long civil war, played out in and around the beaches of the country’s northeast during spring 2009.

Those who possess drugs are in custody, while those who enabled these persons to possess the drugs are walking free and continuing to bring more drugs into the country

In recent times, there is a massive campaign launched in Sri Lanka to eliminate drugs in the country. It is an excellent objective. But who are those being caught and disciplined? Those who are in possession of drugs. But has it ever occurred to these knights in shining armour, who go after those who possess drugs, that there is another group on whom no drugs are found or will ever be found, who are nevertheless, the masterminds of the drug trade?

Forty countries from the Asia and Pacific region have agreed that transforming agrifood systems was imperative to providing food security for their children’s generation and beyond, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reported today.

Those elections would see a direct clash between a generation of geriatric leaders who grew in and groomed by a society stratified by castes, ethnicity, religions, and so on, and a younger, talented and globally connected generation to which the society of their elders has become alien. This intergenerational dichotomy may sound political rhetoric and difficult to fathom by many. But it is well recognised global phenomenon that continues to trouble many a regime. This is why when the country is at the cusp of breaking away from the old order the three ethno-religious minority parties are appearing to be trio of saboteurs

### Buddha: The scientist of suffering and existence

Buddha may not be credited with inventing groundbreaking scientific discoveries like the law of gravity, the steam engine, or penicillin. Still, he stands as a scientist par excellence who unravelled the causes and remedies for human suffering. His teachings, imparted to spiritual seekers, encompassed both mundane and supra-mundane aspects.

The mundane teachings outlined a path to a life devoid of conflict, as evidenced in discourses such as Singalowada, Parabhawa, Mangala, Ratana, and Karaneeyametta, among thousands of others. Yet, Buddha’s true innovation lay in his profound exploration of the nature of existence, a revelation that is currently gaining widespread recognition though among smaller segments of seekers across the globe.

The life and work of Marie Colvin is multi-faceted and a manifestation of exemplary bravery and commitment

It is said of war correspondents that they have to “Get in, Get it and Get out”. Marie did just that in many conflict zones from Chechnya to Bosnia, from Sri Lanka to Syria. In Sri Lanka she lost an eye but in Syria she lost her life. She got in, got it but couldn’t get out. To her credit it must be said that she had the option of leaving like many other scribes but opted to stay on and report the travails of ordinary civilians in war situations. One of her final reports was a first person account of seeing a baby die

The independence that Sri Lankans won from the British empire, which pervaded nearly two centuries on the island was unique in many ways. From an optimistic point of view, the independence that the British granted us was a triumph of the liberal democratic tradition implanted by the British themselves. Contrary to the aggressive nature of the Indian freedom struggle, which often shuddered the White Hall of London, our own path to independence epitomised the British liberal values absorbed by the native leaders. Although it contains a sense mortifying feeling regarding the absence of a rigorous freedom struggle, Sri Lanka can boast of the pacific nature of the power transition from the British to the natives.

### UK parliament descends into chaos over Gaza ceasefire vote

*2024-02-22 22:00:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97465/uk-parliament-descends-into-chaos-over-gaza-ceasefire-vote) · `en`

Dozens of lawmakers stormed out of Britain’s parliament on Wednesday with tempers flaring as the three biggest political parties sought to outmanoeuvre each other over a vote on a ceasefire in Gaza.

The uproar followed a decision by the speaker to ignore precedent and allow a vote which helped the opposition Labour Party avoid a large-scale rebellion among its own lawmakers over its position on the Israel-Hamas war.

Lawmakers from the governing Conservatives and the opposition Scottish National Party (SNP) left the debating chamber in protest and some tried to take the rare step of holding proceedings in private.

The speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, eventually apologised and said he had made his decision to allow lawmakers to vote on a range of views because he was concerned about their security after some had faced threats of violence over their stance on the war.

“It is regrettable and I apologise for the decision,” he told parliament. “I did not want it to end like this.”

Colombo, Feb 22 (Daily Mirror) - The problems relating to drugs are not the only issue in the health sector, and both the former and incumbent health ministers have been prone to viewing health matters narrowly, focusing primarily on drug-related issues, Deputy Director of the National Hospital Colombo (NHC) Dr. Rukshan Bellana said.

Addressing the media, he said that when considering health issues, the incumbent and former Health Minister walk on a single track.

"Drugs are not the sole issue in the country's health sector. The health administration of the hospitals has gone from bad to worse. We cannot treat patients without implementing rules in hospitals. If the Health Ministry cannot understand the issues faced by the patients and cannot understand what they mean, it is better for everyone to go home," he said.

"We should prioritize on a patient-centred hospital management system while shifting away from an employee-centred approach," he added.

The ever-present topic since Ranasinghe Premadasa was assassinated has cropped up again: the abolition of the executive presidency.  JRJ and Premadasa Snr, sat comfortably and all powerful on the Seat of the President, created by the former and charmed with smoky incense by the latter. Sat they did, all powerfully and comfortingly, at least JRJ did.

Prez Premadasa was uncomfortable at times when likely contenders who seemed to be popular with the voting masses appeared within eyesight. Some were even not likely candidates in a presidential election and eyeing his seat. But he knew how to deal with them.  Then came CBK who promised to do away with the post and return power to the Prime Minister and Parliament. That was while campaigning. Once she was voted to occupy the seat, she enjoyed its comfort too much and savoured the power it gave her and she forgot her election promise.

### Relevance of Buddhism in contemporary world

*2024-02-22 19:43:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/relevance-of-buddhism-in-contemporary-world/) · `en`

Buddhism is a teaching expounded by the Buddha, who lived in northern India between the mid-6th century and mid-4th century BCE. However, there is a disagreement among some scholars as to the exact dates of his birth and death. It is believed that Buddhism has an estimated 500 million followers worldwide today. Many civilisations and countless lives have been shaped by the Buddha’s thinking enunciated in his discourses. What the Buddha expounded for nearly half a century is known as dhamma which is just as pertinent in the contemporary world as it was several centuries ago. In brief, dhamma means reality.

Buddhism has played a central role in spiritual, and cultural social life from its very inception. It has brought immense psychological, and spiritual solace and relief to people who are overwhelmed by immense suffering and challenges in their lives. Moreover, the advent of Buddhism has paved the way for social equality and democratic values.

(Reuters) - A Chinese research ship arrived in the Maldives on Thursday, global ship-tracking data showed, just three months after a similar vessel visited the Indian Ocean and sparked New Delhi’s security concerns.

The visit follows January comments by a U.S. think tank, that China’s navy could “leverage the insights gained from these missions” for deployment of naval forces, a claim Beijing calls part of a concocted image-smearing “China threat” narrative.

Xiang Yang Hong 03, owned by a research institute that reports to China’s natural resources ministry, made a port call in the Maldives capital of Male, data from MarineTraffic showed, more than a month after leaving its home port of Xiamen in southeastern China.

That led the country into an unprecedented economic crisis in 2022 with a sovereign debt default. Sri Lanka is still struggling to come out of the crisis.

The IMF has strictly placed some reforms including in state sector enterprises, fiscal and monetary sectors.
