### Gambia‚Äôs parliament upholds ban on female genital mutilation

*2024-07-15 19:13:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100537/gambias-parliament-upholds-ban-on-female-genital-mutilation) ¬∑ `en`

Lawmakers in the West African nation of Gambia on Monday rejected a bill that would have overturned a ban on female genital cutting. The attempt to become the first country in the world to reverse such a ban had been closely followed by activists abroad.

The vote followed months of heated debate in the largely Muslim nation of less than 3 million people. Lawmakers effectively killed the bill by rejecting all its clauses and preventing a final vote.

The procedure, also called female genital mutilation, includes the partial or full removal of girls‚Äô external genitalia, often by traditional community practitioners with tools such as razor blades or at times by health workers. It can cause serious bleeding, death and childbirth complications but remains a widespread practice in parts of Africa.

Agricultural exports saw significant growth in 2024, attributed to strategic measures to boost earnings despite challenging climatic conditions. Key crops like rice, cloves, and coriander experienced increased export revenues, while efforts were made to address issues like reduced tea production due to fertilizer shortages. Initiatives included a special fertilizer program and subsidies for tea cultivation, alongside projects aimed at boosting coconut and rubber exports. These efforts led to notable increases in export earnings, highlighting the sector's resilience and potential for growth.
