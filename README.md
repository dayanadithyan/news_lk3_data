In Ratnapura, a shocking incident occurred at Thumbara Estate, where plantation workers were assaulted by management. Despite efforts from trade unions and political parties, solutions remain elusive. The victim, Suresh, and his wife, Kalachelvi, faced further intimidation after reporting the attack. Political leaders and civil groups condemned the incident, but the perpetrators were released on bail. This case highlights ongoing issues of worker exploitation and the lack of effective protection in Sri Lanka's plantation sector.

üü©

Trade unions and upcountry political parties are unable to provide permanent solutions to the worst attacks by plantation workers by plantation management.. Upcountry politicians feel that their duties are over and their duties are over.

The incident took place on the 6th of this month at the Thumbara Estate belonging to the Ratnapura Kiriyalla Police Division. The garden's worker and his assistants were shocked by the fact that the plantation manager and his assistants attacked the garden. Even in the twentieth century, there is no need for an example of the fact that plantation workers are being treated as clusters.

North Polar nations' failure to fund climate disaster prevention was highlighted by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the World Water Summit in Bali. He urged taxing global tax evasion profits to fund climate efforts, emphasizing the interconnectedness of climate change and water crises.

üü©

President Ranil Wickremesinghe pointed out that the Global North Polar Nations, which are ready to finance the life -threatening of Ukraine, will withdraw funds to prevent the destruction of the climate.

The President stressed this on Monday (20) at the top session of the 10th World Water Summit at the Bali International Conference Hall in Indonesia.

The president also stressed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtaxing a 10% tax on the climate change fund, as the annual profit of global tax evasion assets is estimated at US $ 1.4 trillion.

The World Water Summit began on May 18 under the theme of "Water for Public Prostacy" in Bali, Indonesia. The conference was held to unite the leaders, experts, academics, entrepreneurs and policymakers.

The World Water Summit, which has been held every three years since 1997, gives all countries the opportunity to share experiences and knowledge of water management. Also will be consulted on water, health challenges and standard development goals.

### Growing disconnect of political elite and the President‚Äôs shrinking political options

*2024-05-21 02:44:37* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Growing-disconnect-of-political-elite-and-the-President-s-shrinking-political-options/4-762049) ¬∑ `en`

The present moment in Sri Lankan politics is one where the campaign strategies of the major political parties appear to be shifting to a new phase. As the possibility of elections gets higher, encounters among different political factions are entering a more intensified phase of confrontation. With the gears shifting, there appears to be little political movement and considerable ambiguity, which translates into voter confusion.

However, a deeper scrutiny of recent political events are indicative of three main tectonic shifts in the political landscape: excessive exercise of power by the establishment elite, the President‚Äôs increasingly shrinking political options with the Rajapaksas signalling possible departure, and the National People‚Äôs Power‚Äôs (NPP) mobilising a series of trade union strikes.

### SL proposes 10% levy on annual profits of global tax evasion assets

In an effort to support blended finance projects focused on climate change adaptation and mitigation, Sri Lanka proposed a 10 percent levy on the annual profits of global tax evasion assets deposited in tax havens.

The annual profits are estimated at US $ 1.4 trillion per annum.

The proposal was made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the 10th World Water Forum, held in Bali, Indonesia, yesterday.

He noted that the levy can be enforced by imposing sanctions, similar to those imposed on the Russian banks and financial institutes, which fail to implement the levy. The monies raised by these levies are to be made available to be utilised by the blended finance projects on climate change adaptation and mitigation.

The Global Blended Finance initiative is a supplement to the loss and damage funds ‚Äì not an alternative. Wickremesinghe stressed these two measures must work in tandem.

This may be one more in the long line of rejections since the days of Gotabaya Presidency.

Interestingly, questions have been raised about the authority or mandate of the High Commissioner to issue such a report. But in their heady rush to reject the report, they may not have consulted important resolutions including the UNGA resolution establishing the post of High Commissioner.

These resolutions particularly stress the importance of the role of the High Commissioner as the voice of humanity on gross or grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Nevertheless, how the High Commissioner should express that voice and what format or method should be followed is left open.

### Social media comes to the fore in Indian elections

*2024-05-21 01:50:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Social-media-comes-to-the-fore-in-Indian-elections/172-282992) ¬∑ `en`

Chiefly YouTube, has emerged as the main mode of political communication overshadowing the traditional or ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù electronic media

The 2024 Indian parliamentary elections will be remembered for many reasons. They are the longest to date, stretching from April 19 to June 1.

They are taking place in the midst of acute unemployment, skyrocketing prices and lack of demand in the market.

An unprecedented amount of money is being spent amidst corruption charges.¬† Divisive issues of caste, religion and region are being racked up. Sex scandals are sullying the reputations of some of the high and mighty.

But in the midst of the darkness, there is a silver lining. Social media platforms, chiefly YouTube, have emerged as the main mode of political communication, overshadowing the traditional or ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù electronic media.

### Elections must be decided only by law - EDITORIAL

The elections in Sri Lanka are said to be conducted in a free and fair manner and according to the law. However, some laws have been promulgated in a manner that ruling parties can manipulate the law in their favour.

The Sri Lankan Constitution states ‚ÄúThe President of the Republic shall be elected by the people and shall hold office for a term of five years.‚Äù It again says ‚ÄúThe poll for the election of the President shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office.‚Äù

Accordingly, the Election Commission (EC) on May 9 announced that the Presidential polls will be held between September 17 and October 16, this year. The Commission‚Äôs announcement was based on the country‚Äôs law and hence election could not be held before that period or postponed for a date after it.

### President‚Äôs Commitment To Economic Reform Is Model For Reconciliation

On numerous occasions President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said he was elected president to get Sri Lanka out of its economic morass and will do his utmost to fulfill that obligation. This has led to much speculation regarding the president‚Äôs intentions with regard to conducting presidential elections prior to achieving economic success. The truth of the president‚Äôs utterances with regard to his commitment to resolving the economic crisis is to be plainly seen in his determination to push ahead with unpopular economic policies. He has been unrelenting in sticking to higher tax rates than the masses of people can afford and to the privatization of state owned enterprises. Both of these policies are unpopular to the point of jeopardising his bid to be re-elected at the forthcoming presidential election, but the president has stuck by his convictions.
