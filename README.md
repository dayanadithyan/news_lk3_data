"In foreign countries, healthcare workers are assisted by private companies in carrying out these activities. Turning these tasks into government services was a significant mistake on the part of the government. Those who engaged in election campaigns and poster campaigns were elected for their satisfaction in these roles," he said.

The Piduruthalagala mountain area has high educational and tourism value, and it is inappropriate to continue to maintain it as a prohibited area for the people, he added.

"Local and foreign tourists also like to observe the sunrise from the Nuwara Eliya tourist zones, so an opportunity should be given for that too, and there is an urgent need to open the places with high tourist attraction to the public under suitable methods and to establish appropriate tourism industries related to it," the Governor added.

The Senate vote was 70 to 29 with 22 Republicans voting in favor, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Health sector workers have decided to continue its strike launched over disparities in allowances, says the convenor of Health Trade Union Alliance, Chanaka Dharmawickrama.

A collective of 72 health trade unions resorted to a strike this morning (Feb.13) to urge the government to provide them with an allowance similar to that of the DAT (Disturbance, Availability and Transport) allowance given to doctors.

The trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals – including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers – have engaged in strikes time and time again over the past few months demanding an allowance hike for them.

The trade union actions stemmed from the Cabinet Ministers’ approval of a proposal tabled by President Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000.

ECONOMYNEXT – The prices of land in Sri Lanka will come down significantly due to government programmes such as gifting deeds and long-term leasing of lands to investors, Minister Bandula Gunawardena has said.

“The gifting of deeds and the long-term lease of State lands will lead to the price of real estate dropping in the future,” Gunawardena said in response to a question by a journalist at a Cabinet decisions press briefing on Tuesday (10).

“When State lands are released to investors they don’t have to buy land from the real estate market, so the artificial pricing will decrease, and competitive prices will come in.

“Land in Sri Lanka has an artificial price, if you take land in Colombo its more expensive than land prices in developed countries. Our real estate market is a closed market. The gifting of deeds and the release of land for investment purposes opens the market.”

More than 500,000 homes or businesses had lost power, state energy minister Lily D’Ambrosio said in a social media post.

As the plant shut down, electricity prices spiked across the state to their maximum of A$16,600 per megawatt hour, up from around A$200, according to data from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).

In response, AEMO ordered electricity usage cut across the network, according to a statement on Tuesday afternoon.

D’Ambrosio said in her post that one of Loy Yang’s four units had been brought back online and the mandatory power cuts had ended.
