Plans were underway to commercialise two blocks, adding to over 5,000 square kilometres with potential oil and gas resources in the Mannar Basin.

According to the latest developments in CA (Writ) Application No: 392/2023, the court found that a prima facie case has been established by the petitioner Serendive Energy.

Accordingly, the court issued orders restraining the first to 36th respondents and/or its servants or agents from granting to any third party, other than the petitioner, the rights to offshore exploration of blocks M1 and C1, until a final determination is reached in the case, Serendive Energy said in a statement.

### Modi's security adviser Ajith Doaal - Wimal Weerawansa

*2024-04-27 01:12:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/182060) ¬∑ `ta`

Ajith Dowal's security adviser, Modi's MRM Vasim and Rajadurai Hashan, face controversy over the Sunday bombings. Wimal Weerawansa, a National Freedom Front leader, suggests the bombings could alter Sri Lanka's elections. The truth behind the bombings remains unknown, with no debate on the incident. Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe express concern. Modi's statement in Goa on the day of the bombings suggests a conflict between Sri Lankan Catholics and Indians. The bombings did not affect the 2019 presidential election, with Sajith Premadasa winning. The bombings targeted traditional Muslim beliefs, with 117 Muslims killed in 2016.

In life, he was a controversial character who was mostly in the news for the wrong reasons.. He was a Parliamentarian who brandished a knife against a fellow MP  during a brawl in the House. He had a notorious reputation for getting things done in the way he wanted by engaging in pressure tactics often resorting to fisticuffs. He  even attempted suicide once by hanging himself on a ceiling fan. Generally  people outside his home district perceived him as a thug and bully who tried to browbeat others.

Minister Harin Fernando suggests Catholic lawyers form a commission to investigate the Sunday attack, emphasizing legal action over continued discussion.

üü©

Minister Harin Fernando said that Catholic lawyers should call the community and set up a power commission and investigate the life of the Sunday.

He was speaking at the third day debate in Parliament on Friday (26).

Steps must be taken to provide a solution rather than continue to discuss the lifeblood Sunday attack. As a solution to this, Catholic lawyers should call the community and set up a power commission to investigate the life of the Sunday attack on the Sunday attack.. The Commission should also be held responsible for taking legal action.

The government nor the nan does not have to report this issue. The proposal may have been presented to Sajith Premadasa and Anuragumara Dissanayake. There are great lawyers from the Kattaelika community in Sri Lanka.. There is a charge against 93 people in connection with the attack. All 93 persons should be summoned to the Commission.

He was speaking at the third day debate in Parliament on Friday (26).

This is the election year and the opposition and some others are still focusing on those living.. Here I noticed that some people extend their hands on me for politics. I can only worry about them. No matter how many inquiries, I am ready to face.

Since 2012, this religious affair has slowly come out.. As a result, some things have begun to happen in the villages where Muslims are concentrated. It was only when ISIS terrorism has reached its peak in the world.

### Tea auction offerings decline to 4.6 MnKgs this week

At the Colombo Tea Auction, the offerings declined to 4.6 million kilogrammes this week that was met with fair demand.

The Ex-Estate offerings too declined and totalled 0.60 million kilogrammes, from 0.70 million kilogrammes the previous week. The overall quality of the teas was not as useful and perhaps against the backdrop of the limited availability, the prices were reasonably maintained, Forbes and Walker Tea Brokers said.

The Best Western BOP/BOPFs, where quality was maintained, were mostly firm, whilst the others declined by Rs.50 per kilogramme and more following quality. In the Below Best category, a few select coloury BOPs appreciated, following special inquiry, whilst the others were firm and up to Rs.50 per kilogramme easier. The corresponding BOPFs sold around last.

At the lower end, the BOPs were barely steady, whilst the corresponding BOPFs were Rs.20-30 per easier, except for select clean leaf coloury sorts, which sold around last week‚Äôs levels.

### The Ranil Wickremesinghe Caravan  Moves  Forward   Despite Barking Dogs.

*2024-04-27 00:18:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83924) ¬∑ `en`

‚Äú The  Dogs bark but the Caravan moves on‚Äùis a proverbial  saying of supposedly Turkish origin. Caravan  in this instance refers to a group of people, animals or vehicles on the move. As is natural members of the canine species  respond to the  strange sight of a caravan  in their midst by barking. This is especially so if there are animals in the caravan. Despite the dogs barking, the carava proceeds on its journey. The moral is that an individual or group must continue on the journey towards their destination even if  there is vocal opposition.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leaders who had been imprisoned for their involvement in the 1971 Insurrection followed an untraditional strategy subsequent to their release from prison in 1977, in their pursuit of political power.

They, instead of mainly encountering the United National Party (UNP), the then ruling party, chose first to attack the leftist parties which were the third force then, to capture that position and then take on the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to become the second powerful party in the country.

### Ranil‚Äôs evolving  strategy to win 2024 presidential poll

Ranil Wickremesinghe perceives himself as a unique selling proposition in the presidential election.

Ranil Wickremesinghe,¬† a 75-year-old¬† lawyer, has been immersed in politics for over 50 years. He has been an MP for almost 44 years. Ranil has served as¬† leader of the Opposition for about 18 years. He has been a deputy minister and Cabinet minister. Above all Wickremesinghe has been sworn in as Prime Minister six times. Impressive as it is, this record of service will not be Wickremesinghe‚Äôs lasting political legacy

The first advantage is that Wickremesinghe has a proven track record in this so far. He took over when the country was facing an unprecedented economic crisis. Shortages were rampant amid an acute lack of foreign exchange. There were queues everywhere but supplies were unavailable or inadequate. Power and fuel shortages had virtually paralysed the country
