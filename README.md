### The final minutes of Sheikh Hasina as a hateful authority ..........

*2024-08-10 21:52:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190755) ┬╖ `ta`

In the face of escalating protests and violence, Sheikh Hasina, the Bangladeshi prime minister, faced a tumultuous end to her tenure. Despite calls for peace and attempts to negotiate with security forces and military officials, the situation spiraled out of control. Faced with overwhelming public opposition and internal conflicts within the government, Hasina eventually decided to flee her official residence. This decision came after a series of events including violent clashes, rising death tolls, and a failed attempt to secure her safety. Ultimately, the pressure from both the public and the military proved too great, leading to Hasina's departure from Bangladesh.

ЁЯЯй

Sheikh Hasina called on the security forces to end the violence in Bangladesh on Sunday, and she was not in the process of accepting that his time was over as prime minister.

But in the next few hours he was beaten by the power of the people.

His son told the BBC that his family's consultation had left him out of Bangladesh rather than the security forces in the end.

Hasina made the decision to leave at the right moment-he fled and entered his official residence in a few hours.

Sheikh Sina was invited to a meeting of the National Security Council on Sunday morning.

The meeting took place in a situation where protests against the prime minister have been on the rise as protests have taken place over the country for several weeks.

On Sunday alone, more than 90 people lost their lives. Many people were shot dead by security forces.

The BBC's Bengal service has received information that Hasina presented two solutions during a meeting with security officials.

### The Tiger Moth Story

*2024-08-10 19:00:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-tiger-moth-story/) ┬╖ `en`

In my fifty-plus years of association with aviation, the best aeroplane I ever flew was undoubtedly the De Haviland Tiger Moth. As a young student pilot, I used to regularly fly the тАШTigerтАЩ, operating off the old grass strip which was the runway we used to take-off and land. The reason for using the grass for the operation was simply a matter of safety. The тАШTigerтАЩ had two wheels like in a handcart and instead of a rear wheel to complete a triangular undercarriage, it had only a tail-skid with tough leather covering. The тАШTigerтАЩ had no brakes, the dragging tail-skid was what stopped it after landing. As for the take-off, we opened the Gypsy Major engine and it powered a long beautiful wooden propeller and with the gathering of speed, the tail lifted, and the Tiger Moth rolled majestically to reach its lift-off speed of 55 knots.

### Snippets from Leonard WoolfтАЩs Growing, with comments

*2024-08-10 13:49:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/snippets-from-leonard-woolfs-growing-with-comments/) ┬╖ `en`

I have been immersed and absorbed in the second volume of Leonard Sydney WoolfтАЩs six volume autobiography from the first sentence onwards. Second time of reading but now with more discernment. Discussing this matter with Leelananda de Silva from whom I borrowed the book, I said I wonder whether it is because I admire this man and am a believer that British colonialism conferred more benefits to Ceylon than what we materially lost, unlike in India, or whether it is purely the writing skill of Woolf. Leelananda, who is of like opinion regards Brit governance of us, opined it was both.

### Kamala Harris picks Minnesota Governor, Tim Walz, as running mate

Marquette University Likely VotersтАЩ Poll, August 8 тАУ KAMALA 53%; TRUMP 47%

When Kamala Harris was asked just after she became the presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee for the presidency about two weeks ago, whom she would pick as her running mate, she responded with twinkling eyes, flashing that charming smile, тАЬMuhammad Ali!тАЭ

Obviously in jest. While Ali may have possessed the unique characteristics in his boxing style of butterflies and bees that Kamala seeks in her political style: of movement of grace, facing challenges head-on and making devastating impact when it counts, Ali lacked the essential qualification for the running mate of a Black/South Asian/Baptist/Hindu woman, married to a Jew: a WASP тАУ a White, Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Besides, he was dead.

The choice she made last Tuesday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, met this vital qualification, in spades. He is white, with a German/Swedish heritage and a Lutheran, the largest sect of Protestant denominations.
