Dorset resident Sangakkara guested at the fundraiser, set up by Shillingstone Cricket Club, in aid of the Dorset & Somerset Air Ambulance.

The cause is a dear one to Shillingstone, who required the help of the air ambulance last season when a player fell ill during a match against Bere Regis.

Some ¬£3,000 was raised on the night through ticket sales and an auction, items sold including wines, beer, a signed Bournemouth shirt, a four-ball at the Dorset Golf & Country Club, pads and gloves donated by Sangakkara himself, an Apple watch plus more.

There are also three special items currently on offer at an online auction.

Bidders can choose between a round of golf for two with Sangakkara, two hospitality tickets for day three of the England v Sri Lanka Test match this September or two hospitality tickets for Rajasthan Royals in the IPL.

At that time, I and my husband escaped and sought refuge in a nearby naval camp. The Marines chased us from there.

We pleaded with the Navy, "Save us, save us,". But, they chased us out of the camp

If the Marines walked with humanity and gave us refuge, my husband's life is separated. He said that the Navy was somewhat responsible for my husband's death.

Colombo, March 13 (Daily Mirror) -¬† On the heels of the cabinet nod to establish a medical faculty at the National School of Business Management (NSBM), the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has expressed reservations, questioning the necessity of the move as it appears unrealistic.

As such, Dr. Wijesinghe stressed that health authorities must ensure that standards are not compromised with the establishment of the new faculty.

### APAC economies and commodity exporters most exposed to China stress scenario: Fitch

Fitch Ratings believes that economies in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) and commodity exporters would be particularly affected under a severe downside stress scenario in China. There would also be a dampening effect on international price pressures.

Fitch‚Äôs analysis released last week, based on internal modelling using the Oxford Economics Global Economic Model, sees vulnerabilities in Vietnam, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, through their strong economic linkages with China.

It also suggests Middle Eastern energy exporters, such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar and Oman, would see slower real GDP growth. However, this does not capture factors such as Qatar‚Äôs long-term LNG supply contracts, which we think should make its exports less sensitive to short-term shifts in Chinese demand, limiting the hit to its GDP.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe can contest as the presidential candidate of the United National Party, not our presidential candidate.

He was speaking at a media briefing held at the Sri Lanka PA's Chief Office on Tuesday (12).

According to the constitution, the president has the power to dissolve the parliament and hold the general election. The party is strong as the party.

A party of the ruling party refers to their personal position as Ranil Wickremesinghe, the presidential candidate of Sri Lanka PA. The problem is how fair it is to refer to a personal position within the party.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe is not the presidential candidate of the Sri Lanka Peoples Alliance, and no talks have been held at the top level of the party as presidential candidate. He is the leader of the United National Party.

The president's carrying out the United National Party (UNP) at the United National Party (UNP) at Kurunegala last Sunday.
