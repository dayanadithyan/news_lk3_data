The Colombo High Court rejected the bail application filed by the counsels representing the recently imprisoned Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera yesterday.

Colombo High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige rejected the bail application, stating that the counsels had failed to present any special circumstances before the Court that would warrant the release of Gnanasara Thera on bail.

The defence counsels urged the court to grant bail to Gnanasara Thera pending appeal, considering the extended delays in concluding appeal hearings at the Court of Appeal and his health condition as grounds for release.

On 28 March, the Colombo High Court sentenced Gnanasara Thera to four years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 100 000 over a contentious statement made by him about Islam and Muslims in 2016.

### New Director General for Bribery Commission

*2024-04-03 05:42:46* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/New-Director-General-for-Bribery-Commission/56-760239) ¬∑ `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed W. K. D. Wijerathne as the Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), the President‚Äôs Media Division (PMD) said.

The appointment was made in accordance with the provisions of the new Anti-Corruption Act.

Wijerathne has held the same position before, but this new appointment is under the new Anti Corruption Act, which was passed in the Parliament in September last year with wide powers.

The new Act gives CIABOC broader ability to investigate and prosecute incidents of bribery and corruption. The commission has previously examined claims of bribery and corruption but has failed to meet expectations because most complaints have not resulted in prosecution.

The creations of Mary Shelley and Lord Balfour; the former being fiction and the latter being played out in 4K ultra-HD resolution today, are separated by time and space, but offer lessons for the enquiring mind.

The vote taken on 29th November 1947 to create the state of Israel, was rejected by all Arab States. On 30th November, the very next day, the first phase of the Arab-Israeli war began and ended with thousands dead and the forcible expulsion of more than 700,000 Palestinians from their homeland.

World leaders refused to accept the ominous beginning as a harbinger of darker, more dangerous times ahead.

### When ‚ÄúAiyo‚Äù Sirisena accused India‚Äôs RAW of plotting to assassinate him

‚ÄúPutting your foot in your mouth‚Äù is a figurative expression about a person saying or doing something that should not be done or not have been said, especially if it embarrasses the person concerned or someone else. Among those who frequently put their feet into their mouths are politicians of all kinds and hues and from all parts of the world.

Sri Lanka the miracle of Asia is second to none in this sphere. From ‚ÄúApey George‚Äù George E de Silva of Kandy in the past to CV Wigneswaran of Jaffna in the present, there have been several politicians in this resplendent Island who are famous for this. However the greatest of all politicians in this respect arguably is Pallewatte Gamaralage Maithripala Yapa Sirisena who served as the sixth executive president of Sri Lanka from 2015 to 2019. Such is his reputation for doing or uttering inappropriate things that Sirisena has acquired the prefix ‚ÄúAiyo‚Äù. Many refer to him as ‚ÄúAiyo‚Äù Sirisena nowadays.

### Countering NPP‚Äôs rise: Emerging political alliances and election strategies

*2024-04-03 05:22:09* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Countering-NPP-s-rise-Emerging-political-alliances-and-election-strategies/4-760229) ¬∑ `en`

The National People‚Äôs Power‚Äôs (NPP) current election campaign aiming for the presidential election has a strong momentum. The confident body language of its leadership is one indicator of this. Their rallies are well-attended and there appears to be a strong bottom-up support. The NPP‚Äôs seemingly growing electoral prospects have propelled it to being in the centre of political discourse, and this has led other political parties/factions to be on the defensive.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP, the main party within the NPP) is known for launching its election campaigns prematurely. This is why, despite their rallies being well-attended and their anti-establishment discourse being attractive to people in general, their popularity has not translated to votes, never having gone more than 5% at a general election so far. However, this trope may not hold as firmly this time.

Namal Rajapaksa had his crowning as crown prince last week. The SLPP titled the Tangalle meeting, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs begin the Battle from Hambantota‚Äù. Battle to return the Rajapaksas to power under a President Namal, if not in 2024, then in 2029; or someday.

This Online Safety Act will have a huge impact on the freedom of expression of Sri Lankan citizens

In 2018, ‚ÄúEUROPOL‚Äù headquartered in Hague, Netherlands, a key organisation established to prevent and combat serious internationally organised crimes, cybercrime and terrorism, had clearly defined the difference between cyber-dependent crimes and cyber-enabled crimes. As defined by them, any crime that can only be committed using computers, computer networks or other forms of information communication technology was named as cyber-dependent crimes and traditional crimes facilitated by the Internet and digital technology were categorised as cyber-enabled crimes. So, there are two categories of cybercrimes and these definitions are internally accepted.

### Sri Lanka‚Äôs sovereignty of Kachchativu was never in doubt

Sri Lanka‚Äôs sovereignty over Kachchativu, according to the narrative, was never in doubt and it was in fact the Kachchativu issue that decided the demarcation of the maritime boundary between Sri Lanka and India

The book relates how laws were brought to confine fishing to areas within the boundary of each country

There were also reports of illicit immigrants from South India using the Kachchativu Festival to enter Sri Lanka

The sovereignty of Kachchativu Island which Sri Lanka had exercised throughout history is once again disputed by India. This is despite India having withdrawn the claim- that it owned this island- with the presentation of facts to the Government of New Delhi some years ago.¬† However, the island, barren and uninhabited most of the year, had remained a contentious issue for over a hundred years.

With the government on Monday withdrawing the Bill that was gazetted on February 9 this year to amend the Penal Code to lower the age for girls for sexual consent from 16 to 14, a question is naturally being raised as to what prompted the government to introduce the Bill without consulting all stakeholders.

Chair of the Women Parliamentarians‚Äô Caucus, MP Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle, while writing to Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had last month expressed the deep concern of the Caucus about the Bill and requested him to withdraw it. It was against that backdrop the minister had agreed to abandon the Bill. Accordingly, the government has informed the Supreme Court that it would not go ahead with the Bill.

The government has decided to import a total of 1,000 buses and vans to improve the transportation facilities provided to tourists.

Accordingly, in a bid to boost the tourism sector, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to a proposal presented by the Minister of Tourism and Lands to import 750 vans and 250 buses.

As per the proposal,¬†6-15 seater vans, as well as 16-30 seater (small) buses¬†and 30-45 seater (large) buses¬†are planned to be imported, without any special tax relief.

The government says that, although it is considered a custom in the tourist industry that vehicles engaged in the industry for tourist transportation should not be used for more than 6 years, it is apparent that the condition of the vehicles used in the industry is not satisfactory and sufficient.

In a statement, it added that the fame earned by Sri Lanka as a prominent tourist destination is tarnished due to the usage of age-old vehicles as a result of the limitation of vehicles and essential spare parts.

Colombo, April 02 (Daily Mirror) - Cabinet spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardana said today that completing the expressway structure of the country has become a myth till the debt restructuring process is finalized.

"Even I hope of completing the expressway system in the country as soon as possible. But we are unable to get loans until the debt restructuring process is finalized," he said.

"We can only think of completing expressways after the debt restructuring process of the Road Development Authority (RDA) is completed," he further said.

Moreover, he said there is no truth in handing over the daily operations and management of highways to a private company.

The Ministry had approved the transfer of daily operations and management of expressways from the Road Development Authority (RDA) to a state-owned company called Sahasya Investments (SIL).

SIL is a 100 percent state-owned company under the Treasury and the RDA.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äî With elections coming up in Sri Lanka, the World Bank is concerned that reform fatigue could set in, leading to potential policy reversal, particularly with regard to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), a World Bank official said.

Senior Country Economist for the Maldives and Sri Lanka Richard Walker told EconomyNext that the World Bank is specifically concerned about SOE reforms as progress in that area has not been as rapid as hoped despite considerable macroeconomic gains made since the country‚Äôs worst financial crisis in decades.

‚ÄúMaybe we haven‚Äôt seen it progress as far as we‚Äôd hoped. In terms of trying to put in place a much better framework to ensure better governance and options for private participation, that hasn‚Äôt moved as fast we‚Äôd hoped,‚Äù Walker said on the sidelines of an event held in Colombo on Tuesday April 02 to launch the World Bank‚Äôs Development Updates for Sri Lanka and South Asia.

‚ÄúA mother should stay with the child till the child is two years,‚Äù Kumarasinghe said. ‚ÄúTo whom are they going to give the responsibility? To the grandparents? To the husband? No, it is the mother who does that. You have to look after the child.‚Äù

At an event for International Women‚Äôs Day last month, Kumarasinghe said she was in favor of requesting mothers with children under two to refrain from foreign employment.

However, Minister of Labor and Foreign Employment, Manusha Nanayakkara has rejected this recommendation.

‚ÄúParental responsibility belongs to both the mother and father,‚Äù Nanayakkara told EconomyNext. ‚ÄúWhy should restrictions apply to mothers and not to fathers?‚Äù

However, Kumarasinghe was adamant that Sri Lankan ‚Äòculture‚Äô dictated that women were the sole provider of childcare, or unpaid care work.
