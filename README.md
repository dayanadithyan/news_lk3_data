### The presidential election is good for the Tamil people - CV Vigneswaran

*2024-07-20 16:09:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/188949) · `ta`

CV Vigneswaran argues that postponing the presidential election benefits the Tamil community and the nation as a whole. He highlights potential instability due to no candidate securing over 50% votes, which could exacerbate existing economic crises and lead to significant election-related spending affecting the economy. He calls for unity among parties to advocate for a one-year delay in the election to ensure political stability and economic recovery.

🟩

Parliamentarian CV Wigneswaran says that the postponement of the presidential election is beneficial to the Tamil people.

He said this during a media briefing held in Jaffna today (20).

The postponement of the presidential election is beneficial to the whole country. Especially for the Tamils.

As far as the presidential election is concerned, no one can get more than 50 percent votes. So they will try to get the votes of the minority people.

At the same time, when no one gets more than 50 percent votes in the presidential election, the country will be without political stability.

There are already economic crises in the country. If there is no political stability, the country will face the worst economic setbacks.

In addition, there will be a situation where large funds will be spent on the election. That too will affect the country's economy.

Therefore, all parties should come together and make a demand for a one -year presidential election.

MA Sumanthiran questions the urgency of the 22nd Constitutional Amendment, arguing it confuses voters and disrupts the constitutional process, especially concerning presidential elections and universal suffrage. He suggests it might be seen as granting excessive powers to the President and unnecessary during the current term.

🟩

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian MA Sumanthiran has questioned why the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution is now needed.

He questioned the need to bring the bill to the present, and in his view, it is confusing the voters.

He added that it would be troubled by holding the presidential election at the end of the five years, according to the constitution.

Sumanthiran said that if the 22nd Amendment was passed with two -thirds of the parliament, it would be confused as the election of the Constitution would be given to the President.

He said that it is not necessary to conduct a universal payment as this has not been made in the current president's tenure.
