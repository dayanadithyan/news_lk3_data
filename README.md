தேசிய மக்கள் சக்தியின் வெற்றியைத் தடுக்க ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்ரமசிங்க கடைசி நேரத்தில் ஏதேனும் தந்திரத்தை மேற்கொள்வார் என்ற சந்தேகம் சிலருக்கு இருப்பதாகக் கூறி, இம்முறை NPP வெற்றியை யாராலும் தடுக்க முடியாது என தேசிய மக்கள் முன்னணியின் தலைவர் அனுரகுமார திஸாநாயக்க தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

மினுவாங்கொடையில் நடைபெற்ற பேரணியில் கலந்து கொண்டு உரையாற்றிய அவர், பெரும்பான்மையான அரச ஊழியர்கள், பொலிஸார் மற்றும் இராணுவத்தினர் இம்முறை தேசிய மக்கள் கட்சிக்கு ஆதரவளிப்பதாகவும், ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்க எந்த தந்திரத்திலும் ஈடுபட முடியாது எனவும் தெரிவித்தார்.

ரணில் விக்ரமசிங்க கடைசி நேரத்தில் ஏதாவது தந்திரத்தை கையாளுவார் என்று மக்கள் சந்தேகிக்கின்றனர். அவரால் எந்த தந்திரமும் செய்ய முடியாது. பெரும்பான்மையான அரச ஊழியர்கள் NPP யை ஆதரிக்கின்றனர். பெரும்பான்மையான பொலிஸ் மற்றும் இராணுவ அதிகாரிகளும் எமக்கு ஆதரவளிக்கின்றனர். ஓய்வுபெற்ற பொலிஸார் மற்றும் ராணுவ அதிகாரிகள் எங்களுடன் இருக்கிறார்கள் எனவே, நாம் ஆட்சிக்கு வருவதை யாராலும் தடுக்க முடியாது.

It is we, the voting citizens of our country, who despite experiencing the vicissitudes of such duplicitous behaviour,

brainlessly and in a zombie-like fashion vote for these chameleons who take us for idiots – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Even as “Mondo” Duplantis, the Swedish pole vaulter, was thrilling global viewers with a world record breaking jump of 6.25 metres at the Paris Olympics, 8,500 kilometres away in Colombo, we, in beautiful Sri Lanka, were witnessing incredible performances by several ‘political’ athletes in the jump events of long jump, triple jump, high jump and pole vault. A good number of them were ‘seasoned’ participants and previous medallists notorious for their dexterity in this field.

### Whom should I vote for this Presidential election?

This Presidential election 2024 is wholly absent of candidates with a clear program of national development of the most essential services and sectors now in tatters like education, health and public commuting that leaves out the most important reason to vote. The “vote” at a presidential election is meant to elect a person with a clear “world vision” for the country, that requires candidates to spell their own vision in detail.

The UN report has warned of renewed threats to fundamental freedoms in Sri Lanka, noting that authorities have introduced repressive laws and engaged in intimidation and violence against victims of past abuses, civil society activists, journalists, and Government critics. It noted that this continues despite the Government’s denial of responsibility for severe human rights violations committed during the 1983-2006 civil war.

A diagram of the number of presidential candidates who contested the elections since 1982 in Sri Lanka would look like a tick mark. Six candidates contested the first election in 1982, and the number went down to three in 1988. Since then, the numbers have been in ascendency. In 2019, 35 candidates were in the field. This time around, a total of 39 candidates are in the fray. Most of them are proxies strategically fielded to divide the votes of one of the leading candidates. Some proxy candidates are in the contest to mobilize resources for their favorite leaders. Although hardly noticed, some of the candidates have contested several elections. For example, Battaramulle Seelaratne Thera, who contested the 2010 election, endorsing Mahinda Rajapaksa, withdrew at the eleventh hour. Sri Lanka Labor Party’s A. S. P. Liyanage and the United Socialist Party’s Siritunga Jayasuriya are among the usual suspects.

### Knowing When To Step Aside: Mark Of True Leadership

Presidential aspirant Wickremesinghe’s recent appeal to Sri Lankans to vote for the Gas Cylinder symbol, with the ominous warning that failure to do so will result in long queues for essentials, reflects a troubling mindset.

This statement, which seems to equate the temporary resolution of gas shortages with his qualification to lead the nation, is out of touch and a poor Marcom strategy. It suggests that Wickremesinghe and his advisors believe that merely avoiding crises is enough to secure the presidency, ignoring the deeper, more pressing needs of the country.

Wickremesinghe’s approach is similar to his previous attempts to appeal to the masses with shallow gestures, such as his infamous offer of chewing gum to farmers, a tone-deaf proposal that highlighted his disconnection from the realities of rural life.
