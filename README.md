### Gender -based pain gap: The highest registration in Sri Lanka than the global average

*2024-04-03 09:18:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180293) ┬╖ `ta`

Sri Lanka's gender-based pain gap is the highest globally, with a significant disparity in labor contributions between men and women. The International Labor Organization's study reveals a massive, unaddressed gender-based pain gap in Sri Lanka, affecting women's entry into trade and economic prosperity. Despite efforts to reduce this gap, women's contributions remain low, with a 40% contribution compared to men's 80% in 2019. This gap has persisted for decades, with a notable increase in the pain gap among adult workers as age increases.

ЁЯЯй

Global -based agony interval is estimated at an average of 20 percent. However, in the new study of the International Labor Organization, the International Labor Organization has indicated that the pain gap in Sri Lanka is higher than that of this global average and is higher than the pain in low and middle -income countries.

тАЬIn most countries of the world, the gender -based pains space clearly reveal the gender inequality found in the union. It is necessary to address both social justice and economic prosperity. In its study on Sri Lanka, the International Labor Organization has pointed out that the gender -based agony space that is massive and unreasonable is unclear, and that it will create an inequality in the union and prevent the entry of women and women into the trade.

The defence counsels urged the court to grant bail to Gnanasara Thera pending appeal, considering the extended delays in concluding appeal hearings at the Court of Appeal and his health condition as grounds for release.

On 28 March, the Colombo High Court sentenced Gnanasara Thera to four years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 100 000 over a contentious statement made by him about Islam and Muslims in 2016.

The new Act gives CIABOC broader ability to investigate and prosecute incidents of bribery and corruption. The commission has previously examined claims of bribery and corruption but has failed to meet expectations because most complaints have not resulted in prosecution.

World leaders refused to accept the ominous beginning as a harbinger of darker, more dangerous times ahead.

### When тАЬAiyoтАЭ Sirisena accused IndiaтАЩs RAW of plotting to assassinate him

However the greatest of all politicians in this respect arguably is Pallewatte Gamaralage Maithripala Yapa Sirisena who served as the sixth executive president of Sri Lanka from 2015 to 2019.

### Countering NPPтАЩs rise: Emerging political alliances and election strategies

The National PeopleтАЩs PowerтАЩs (NPP) current election campaign aiming for the presidential election has a strong momentum. The confident body language of its leadership is one indicator of this. Their rallies are well-attended and there appears to be a strong bottom-up support. The NPPтАЩs seemingly growing electoral prospects have propelled it to being in the centre of political discourse, and this has led other political parties/factions to be on the defensive.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP, the main party within the NPP) is known for launching its election campaigns prematurely. This is why, despite their rallies being well-attended and their anti-establishment discourse being attractive to people in general, their popularity has not translated to votes, never having gone more than 5% at a general election so far. However, this trope may not hold as firmly this time.

Sri LankaтАЩs sovereignty over Kachchativu, according to the narrative, was never in doubt and it was in fact the Kachchativu issue that decided the demarcation of the maritime boundary between Sri Lanka and India

The book relates how laws were brought to confine fishing to areas within the boundary of each country

There were also reports of illicit immigrants from South India using the Kachchativu Festival to enter Sri Lanka

The sovereignty of Kachchativu Island which Sri Lanka had exercised throughout history is once again disputed by India. This is despite India having withdrawn the claim- that it owned this island- with the presentation of facts to the Government of New Delhi some years ago.┬а However, the island, barren and uninhabited most of the year, had remained a contentious issue for over a hundred years.

Colombo, April 02 (Daily Mirror) - Cabinet spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardana said today that completing the expressway structure of the country has become a myth till the debt restructuring process is finalized.

"Even I hope of completing the expressway system in the country as soon as possible. But we are unable to get loans until the debt restructuring process is finalized," he said.

"We can only think of completing expressways after the debt restructuring process of the Road Development Authority (RDA) is completed," he further said.

Moreover, he said there is no truth in handing over the daily operations and management of highways to a private company.

The Ministry had approved the transfer of daily operations and management of expressways from the Road Development Authority (RDA) to a state-owned company called Sahasya Investments (SIL).

SIL is a 100 percent state-owned company under the Treasury and the RDA.
