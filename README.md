(BBC) -¬†The Princess of Wales says she is in the early stages of treatment after cancer was found in tests.

In a video statement, Catherine says it was a "huge shock" after an "incredibly tough couple of months".

But she sent a positive message, saying: "I am well and getting stronger every day."

Details of the cancer have not been disclosed, but Kensington Palace says it is confident the princess will make a full recovery.

The princess's statement explains that when she had abdominal surgery in January, it was not known that there was any cancer.

"However tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment," said the princess.

The chemotherapy treatment began in late February. The palace says it will not be sharing any further private medical information, including the type of cancer.

It‚Äôs growing hotter by the day. Last Saturday the temperature in Colombo rose to around 89 degrees Fahrenheit.

Forecasters have predicted that there will be no let-up in the spell of hot weather. Rather they are warning that temperatures will rise further by April when the sun will be directly over Lanka.

Doctors also warn the public to avoid strenuous labour, to wear white clothing that absorbs solar energy and drink more water. A difficulty here is that our reservoirs are running low on water supplies. The Department of Irrigation is requesting the public to reduce the consumption of water!

The irony of it all is that the Department of Meteorology warned us of the impending dry spell around mid-last year. In this column we have constantly drawn attention to the need to dredge our ancient tanks and the need for clearing waterways which feed the tanks, thereby enhancing the collection of greater quantities of water.
