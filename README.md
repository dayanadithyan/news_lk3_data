UPDATE: The Customs employees have decided to continue their work-to-rule campaign as the discussion with the authorities ended on negative note.

At least 4,000 containers are reportedly held up at the Colombo Port as a result of the trade union action launched by the employees of Sri Lanka Customs on Friday (March 15).

Initially, the Customs officials including superintendents and staff officers boycotted working extra hours, however, they resorted to a strict work-to-rule campaign at 9 a.m. today (March 19) it is expected to go on until 4.45 p.m.

Calling a media briefing, the chairman of the Customs Officers’ Union Amila Sanjeewa attributed the reason behind the trade union action to the Treasury’s decision to bring the Customs Officers Reward Fund under the purview of the Finance Ministry.

Against this backdrop, the president of the Container Transport Owners’ Association, Sanath Manjula warned that the importers are likely to be afflicted if the situation prevails.

ECONOMYNEXT – A speaker’s endorsement is required for bills passed by parliament to ensure that it is ‘duly passed’ opposition legislator M A Sumanthiran said in a debate on a no confidence motion against Speaker Mahinda Abeywardana.

The opposition said several clauses in a so-called online safety bill (now Act) to police social media were against the constitution, as the bill did not incorporate the changes required by the Supreme Court.

“This is the first time that a Supreme Court determination on a bill has  been blatantly violated by parliament,” Sumanthiran said.

There is no post-enactment judicial review of passed laws in Sri Lanka. There has been growing concerns that ruling governments are slipping through unconstitutional clauses in to laws in the so-called ‘committee stage’.

Sumanthiran said he went to court against the online safety bill and court did not give leave to proceed as the speaker had already endorsed it.

### No confidence motion against Sri Lanka Speaker taken up in parliament

Kiriella’s party, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), took up its no-confidence motion against the speaker on Tuesday.

Clauses that required a two thirds majority if they were not amended as per the Supreme Court ruling, were passed by a simple majority without the amends, Kiriella claimed. “He ignored calls for a division and approved the third reading without a vote.”

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the opposition had not studied the approved Bill carefully, as it would become evident that the changes found to be in violation of clause 12.1 of the Constitution had been amended or removed altogether.

“4 of the 9 charges you make have one shortcoming, pertaining to repeat offenders, which has been amended by the Attorney General and sent to be gazetted,” Rajapaksa said.

Earlier, when the railway station was built, the college road was provided with facilities to build a cross -border, but the area was under military control and was not set up due to lack of use.

However, instead of this usual cross, the 515th Brigade was set up in front of the road they used by the army.. However, the route used by the military is a public land. As the army has recently handed over the land of the people, the railway department officials must rush to work on the railway door and fit the signal lamp in the college road.
