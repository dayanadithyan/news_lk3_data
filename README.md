The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) fully supports the strike that the plantation workers are scheduled to launch from Monday (22), Nuwara Eliya District Member of Parliament Palani Digambaram said during a media conference held in Hatton today.

Even though President Ranil Wickremesinghe has advised the tea plantation companies to increase the daily salary of plantation workers to Rs 1,700, they have refused to increase the salaries.

"The plantation companies have expressed their agreement to increase the amount of Rs. 400 in addition to the daily salary of Rs.1,000 currently paid to a plantation worker. It has been agreed to give the remaining Rs. 300 with conditions," the MP said.

MP Digambaram further said that under the Samagi Jana Balawega government led by Sajith Premadasa, they will distribute tea lands to the plantation workers and make them small tea plantation owners and increase the daily income of the plantation workers.

(Telegraph India) - Sri Lanka’s Vedda people, long believed to be the island’s earliest human inhabitants, share close genetic bonds with five Indian tribal populations, a new study has found, bolstering evidence for their roots in the Indian subcontinent’s earliest modern human populations.

A team of Indian and Sri Lankan scientists has found that the Vedda share a strong genetic similarity with the Austroasiatic Munda-speaking Santhal and Juang tribes in Odisha and the Dravidian-speaking Irula, Paniya and Pallar found in Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

Their study, published this week in the scientific journal Mitochondrion, has revealed that the Vedda have a greater genetic similarity with these five tribes than with either Sri Lanka’s Sinhalese or Tamil populations with whom they have shared the island for centuries.

### China writes off interest-free loans given to Zimbabwe

China has written off an unspecified amount of Zimbabwe’s interest-free loans and pledged to help the Southern African country find a way out of its debt crisis, even as activists warned of a permanent debt trap.

As of September 2023, Zimbabwe’s publicly guaranteed debt stood at $17.7 billion, of which $12.7 billion was external and $5 billion domestic.

Most of the foreign debt was purchased from China, as the country is ineligible for loans from multilateral creditors such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after defaulting on repayments since the turn of the millennium.

Since the fall of long-time ruler Robert Mugabe six years ago, Zimbabwe has been struggling to reach an agreement with creditors to restructure its unsustainable debt.

### Sri Lankan Tamil becomes first naturalised Indian citizen to vote in general election

Nalini Kirubakaran, a 38-year-old at the rehabilitation camp for Sri Lankan Tamils in Tiruchi, became the first naturalised Indian citizen from the Kottapattu camp to vote in a general election on Friday.

It was a dream come true moment for Nalini on polling day as she would have never expected cameras following her from the refugee camp to the polling booth at MM Middle School, near the airport, where she cast her vote.

“I don’t have words to express my feelings. Voting for the first time, I feel I have come out of my past now,” said Nalini.

The journey from being a refugee in a land where she was born to becoming first member of her community to get voting rights took two years of legal battle as her application for an Indian passport was rejected by a regional passport office in 2021. In September 2022, Nalini had established before the Madras High Court that she was an Indian citizen.
