Nakba is indisputably a living testimony to the brutality of the beast among humans.

### Restructure SriLankan Airlines тАУ but no mandate for sale

Former President Mahinda RajapaksaтАЩs official statement on the issue of the restructuring of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) has driven the usual suspects into a fit of rage. Instead of addressing the content of the statement through facts and rational argument, one Ranga Jayasuriya has gone on a hate-spewing tirade on Daily Mirror. Let us keep aside all the ad hominem fallacies in his article, including childish name-calling, fear-mongering and false accusations. Such immature personal attacks only support MahindaтАЩs stance.

Although Mahinda Rajapaksa speaks about all SOEs in general, Jayasuriya seems to have read it as impacting only SriLankan Airlines. Perhaps it is not because he has any money to be made in the proposed sale of the national carrier but because of his undying passion for turning loss-making SOEs into profit-making Privately-Owned Enterprises (POWs) in Sri LankaтАж But let us look at his claims logically.

### For Sri Lanka the road to recovery is long and must stay the course

President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently emphasised the necessity of a new economic reform program for the countryтАЩs economic recovery

As Sri Lanka continues to recover from the recent crisis, this time last year, a mere 12 months ago, we saw the peak of Sri LankaтАЩs worst economic crisis since independence. The economic recovery partially remains hindered by slow growth in exports and low foreign direct investment (FDI), with export growth projected at a modest 5.27% from 2024 to 2028 and FDI below 3% of GDP. The country faces a significant challenge with a decade-long period of low productivity growth, averaging 1.4% annually, underlying major structural weakness in the economy, principally almost endemic policy inconsistency.

### Is Sri LankaтАЩs population truly declining amid economic crisis and COVID-19?

While short-term trends may indicate population decline, historical┬аprecedents suggest resilience and the potential for rebound

Despite concerns about declining population in Sri Lanka due to factors like reduced fertility, increased emigration, and rising mortality rates, short-term fluctuations do not necessarily signify long-term decline. Population dynamics are intricate, influenced by various factors. Even during slower growth periods, populations tend to increase due to past trends in fertility and mortality, known as population growth momentum. This article aims to provide a scientific understanding of how Sri LankaтАЩs population might evolve, going beyond short-term fluctuations and addressing misconceptions about population decline.
