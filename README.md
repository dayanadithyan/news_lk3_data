Kachchativu island when I visited it in 1974 was an uninhabited and desolate place occasionally visited by fishermen to dry their nets. A small Catholic shrine stood there for protection of fishers from storms and the sea.

The Lankan newspaper in late 1960s published a photograph of what was described as a group of pilgrims from India visiting the island. Serious fishing started when Indian fishermen depleted stocks on their side of the boundary and switched to more lucrative poaching of prawns, trawling on the Sri Lankan side on the muddy bottom of the basin South of Kachchativu.

When arrested by the SLN, Indian authorities exerted undue diplomatic and political pressure for the release of poachers and boats which are owned by influential people on Indian side. The Sri Lanka Navy effectively reduced poaching to zero but Indian political counter pressure even saw the overnight removal of the SLN commander then responsible for countering illegal fishing.

A rare and massive comet, known for its ‚Äúhorned‚Äù shape and has a 71-year orbit, was observed for the first time in 1300 Anno Domini by a group of Chinese astronomers.

However, it was officially recognized after it was observed by the French astronomer Jean-Louis Pons in the 19th century and rediscovered by British American astronomer William Brooks in 1883.

The massive comet is also known as the ‚Äúdevil comet‚Äù due to its formation of two ‚Äúhorns‚Äù made up of ice and gas and periodic explosions.

According to NASA, the 18.6-mile-wide ‚ÄòDevil‚Äôs Comet‚Äô is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun and shine the brightest on the 21st of April.

Though conscientious about records, accounts and compliance with regulations, Herbert Cooray was never a number- cruncher. His decision-making did not involve the detailed scrutiny of feasibility studies, balance sheets and financial analyses. Like most entrepreneurs of his generation, he navigated by intuition. He would consider a proposition, talk the matter over with those who could inform or advise him, and then make his decision. He never rushed into things ‚Äì nor, on the other hand, did he waste time when it was of the essence. His instincts rarely let him down.

### Karuna‚Äùs Rebel Tigers   May Have Lost the Eastern Battle but Ultimately the Prabhakaran-led LTTE Lost the Eelam War.

*2024-04-06 18:18:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83881) ¬∑ `en`

The once powerful Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) waged war against the Sri Lankan state for over thirty years. The LTTE known popularly as the tigers was the determining force in Sri Lankan politics for nearly two decades. The  decline of the LTTE began in 2004 when its Batticaloa and Amparai district  special commander Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan  alias ‚ÄúCol‚ÄùKaruna led an eastern tiger revolt against the LTTE supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran. Although ‚ÄúCol‚Äù Karuna ‚Äì  also  known as ‚ÄúKaruna  Ammaan‚Äù  ‚Äì was defeated militarily by the LTTE, subsequent events demonstrated that the Eastern split weakened the LTTE considerably and ultimately led to its downfall in 2009.

### What Is NPP Presidential Candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake‚Äôs Position on Thorny Issues like ‚Äú!3 Plus‚Äù, ‚ÄúFederal Solution‚Äù and Militarisation of the State?

*2024-04-06 18:09:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83888) ¬∑ `en`

National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake‚Äôs pronouncement in Jaffna earlier this week that he did not come to bargain for votes by assuring that he would give ‚Äô13 plus‚Äô or a ‚Äòfederal solution‚Äô begs the crucial question as to what exactly is the NPP‚Äôs public position in regard to these and other thorny issues including the militarisation of the Sri Lankan State?

To be clear, these core dysfunctions have monstrously perverted constitutional democracy in this country, reducing the Sinhala majority as well as Tamil and Muslim minorities to pathetic ‚Äònothing-beings‚Äô in their own land. As we may recall, an ‚Äòethnic war‚Äô and the emergence of a ‚ÄòSinhala Buddhist saviour‚Äô became weapons of choice for majoritarian demagogues, most particularly the Rajapaksas, to inflict cruel injustices on Sri Lankans, including their slavishly supplicating loyalists from the South.

In the bicentennial year of Uduvil Girls‚Äô College, especially during the month of April, our thoughts dwell closely on the founder principal of the school, Harriet Wadsworth Winslow (n√©e Lathrop), whose birthday falls on April 9. Born in 1796, in Norwich, Connecticut, in the USA, Harriet from a young age, was filled with a yearning to serve in distant lands as a missionary.

She was fortunate in meeting and marrying a young pastor, Rev. Miron Winslow, who also had similar interests. The newly married young couple along with missionaries Mary and Levi Spaulding and others, set sail from Boston on the 8th of June, 1819, heading to Ceylon ‚Äì their future mission home. The Winslows and the Spauldings had their first glimpse of their mission station in Uduvil on an April morning in 1820. Harriet was just 24 years old.
