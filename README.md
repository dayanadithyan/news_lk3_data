Former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez was sentenced by a U.S. judge on Wednesday to 45 years in prison for his conviction on drug and firearm offenses.

The sentence means Hernandez, 55, will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, unless his expected appeal succeeds.

A Manhattan jury found him guilty in March of accepting millions of dollars in bribes to protect U.S.-bound cocaine shipments belonging to traffickers he once publicly proclaimed to combat.

Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, while defense lawyers said a 40-year term, the mandatory minimum under federal law, was enough.

U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel said the 45-year sentence should send a message to well-educated, seemingly personable defendants who may believe they are insulated from prosecution.

He also said jurors saw through Hernandez’s “polished demeanor” during the two-week trial, where he took the stand in his own defense.

### Can the presidential election without 'flowers, temples'' can't win?

*2024-06-27 04:02:10* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/cd11r2vdkydo) · `si`

Buddhism's influence on Sri Lanka's politics is profound, from its introduction by King Devanampiya Tissa to modern politicians leveraging Buddhist symbols and practices for electoral gains. Historical figures like King Dutugemunu and SWRD. Bandaranaike utilized Buddhist support effectively. However, critics argue that this reliance on religious symbolism for political advantage risks undermining the true principles of Buddhism and could lead to societal decay.

🟩

History testifies that the Devanampiya introduced Buddhism in Tissa since the king of Tissa.

Accordingly, the kings ruled by the kings of Lakdiva have seen that the civilians acted accordingly.

Archaeologists have also pointed out that Buddhism has directly affected the building of a civilized society without a specific religious discipline.

The Constitution of Sri Lanka shall be Buddhist?

The dental relics brought to Sri Lanka about the 4th century BCE later became a symbol of state.

The king controlling the Lakdani relics early in the early days was assigned to a symbol of protecting noonomity.

Meanwhile, the facts of the history sources appear that the monk's direct blessing has been given to King Dutugemunu to unite the country.

King Dutugemunu had a good relationship with the Maha Vihara.

However, many historical analysts think that the Mahavamsa, who is a small space for the Maha Viharaya, who have not been a close role in the Maha Vihara.

The proposal to this effect submitted by the Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Indian analysts and commentators are not “shy” about discussing caste openly when dissecting poll results. It is an acknowledged fact in India that caste plays a very influential role in determining the outcome of elections in many electorates, regions or states. Many Indians delve into the “caste in elections” topic without any inhibitions.

### Let’s do it with Potatoes…

*2024-06-26 23:23:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/lets-do-it-with-potatoes/) · `en`

Hi! Since I haven’t given my readers any beauty tips, with the potato as the main base, I thought of bringing the potato into the scene this week.

What’s more, potatoes are freely available, so you won’t have any hassle going searching for this vegetable which is a favourite at most homes.

You will need 02 teaspoons potato juice, 02 teaspoons lemon juice and ½ teaspoon honey (optional)

Mix the potato and lemon juice and add honey to the mixture and blend well.

Apply it all over your face and neck and leave it on for 15 minutes and then wash it off with water.

(Do this very alternate day. By the way, dilute the lemon juice if you experience irritation)

You will need 01 tablespoon potato juice or pulp, 01 tablespoon tomato juice or pulp and 01 tablespoon honey.

Mix the potato and tomato juice/pulp and add the honey to the mixture and mix until you obtain a smooth paste.

Apply it evenly on your face, focusing on the affected area.

‘Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has voiced his strong criticism against the proposed Indo-Lanka land bridge project. Speaking to the media in Ruwanwella on Friday Cardinal Ranjith warned the project will endanger Sri Lanka’s sovereignty and independence. He cited historical instances of South Indian invasions where Sinhalese kings had to defend and reclaim parts of the island. He warned that such a project would lead to Sri Lanka becoming a part of Tamil Nadu…

“Who needs this bridge? It’s evident that the idea originated from foreign requests, not from the people here,” the Cardinal stated. “This Government is determined to follow all external directives without considering whether they are beneficial or harmful to us. We must be cautious and avoid actions that are not in our best interest. Otherwise, we will find ourselves in an even worse crisis than we already face. We must not do anything that jeopardises our sovereignty and independence.” Cardinal Ranjith said…’
