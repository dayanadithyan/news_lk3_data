*2024-08-16 03:22:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191183) · `ta`

He highlights the need for a clear stance without party conflicts, advocating for all Tamils to support P. Ariyaderan, seen as a symbol of the Tamil people. Despite majority support within the Sri Lanka Tamil National Party, a decision remains pending due to objections from minority parties.

🟩

All Tamils ​​have to vote for the Tamil people who are the symbol of the Tamil people.

"I am humbled by the Tamil People's Alliance (TNA) leader and Member of Parliament CV Vigneswaran," he said.

He was speaking to the media after the nomination papers held on Thursday (15) at the Elections Commission.

Tamil general candidate P. Ariyaderan is contesting in the Sangu symbol. The presidential election should be thought of on behalf of the Tamil people without thinking. This is a must.

To make a decision about the future of the Tamil people without being conflicted with the party. 89 party parties have chosen PA Ariendran as a symbol of the Tamil people. It is no longer necessary to talk about him or his party.

All the Tamil people should vote for Ariyaderan, who is a symbol of the Tamil people. It is sad that the Sri Lankan TNA does not make a firm decision on the Tamil candidate issue.

### Harry Jayawardena: Hardnosed businessman with the softest heartbeat

*2024-08-16 02:49:48* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Harry-Jayawardena-Hardnosed-businessman-with-the-softest-heartbeat/4-765609) · `en`

Almost 20 years ago, I received a call from Don Harold Stassen Jayawardena. Of course, at the time I knew him as ‘Harry Jayawardena’ as did many SriLankans, especially in business circles. I was in England, veritably forced into exile by political circumstances which included the abduction and torture of the deputy editor of ‘The Nation,’ a newspaper published by Rivira Media Corporation, of which I was at the time the Managing Director, and a brutal attack on Upali Tennakoon, the editor of our sister newspaper in Sinhala. These attacks came just after my friend Lasantha Wickrematunge implored me to leave the countryand not too long before he himself was killed.

It was a time not just of exile but abandonment; for reasons of convenience or fear almost all those I considered friends avoided me. There were a handful who didn’t give a damn about possible consequences or cared enough to be supportive. I didn’t count Harry among them.

### Elections, regime shift, and transformation of the State

The resulting battles will thus to a large degree continue to determine the ultimate significance of any regime that emerges in the immediate aftermath of the election – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Elections offer an opportunity to measure the re-composition of social forces. New coalitions are tested, new alliances become possible, and ultimately there is a period of policy convergence. Under ideal circumstances, this process results in the consolidation of a new regime capable of governing over the long run. In a parliamentary democratic system, such a hegemonic bloc can accommodate the rotation of parties in and out of power. The clearest examples in Sri Lanka’s post-independence history, of course, are the ‘intermediate regime’ from 1956 to 1977 and the neoliberal ‘open economy’ that has characterised policy making from 1977 up to the present.
