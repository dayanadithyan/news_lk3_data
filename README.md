### Labour predicted to rout Sunak’s Conservatives as Britain goes to polls

Britain looks set to elect Labour Party leader Keir Starmer as its next prime minister when voters go to the polls on Thursday, sweeping Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives out of office after 14 often turbulent years.

Opinion polls put Starmer’s centre-left party on course for a landslide victory as voters turn their backs on the Conservatives following a period of infighting and turmoil that led to five prime ministers in eight years.

However, surveys show many voters simply want change, rather than fervently backing Labour, meaning Starmer could enter office with one of the biggest to-do lists in British history but without a groundswell of support or the financial resources to tackle it.

“Today, Britain can begin a new chapter,” Starmer told voters in a statement on Thursday. “We cannot afford five more years under the Conservatives. But change will only happen if you vote Labour.”

The Commission also recommends that the Principal of Royal College investigates a complaint filed by one of the complainants, M. Pathberiya alleging mistreatment by members of the Prefects Council.

Furthermore, the HRCSL suggests that the Royal College Principal discusses with the tutorial staff on the appointment of two prefects who do not meet the relevant criteria.

The Commission is also awaiting the outcome of an investigation by the Education Ministry into the submission of false documents by Royal College to the Commission inquiry regarding the appointment of two prefects.

### Five reasons why Ranil must be superseded in 100 days

*2024-07-04 02:50:07* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Five-reasons-why-Ranil-must-be-superseded-in-100-days/4-763821) · `en`

Whatever option you pick as your choice for President, the process of deliberation leading to that choice must entail the initial methodological step of ruling out.

I argue that the candidate we should rule out as a preliminary step is the unelected incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe. As a political scientist I shall give five fundamental reasons why. But before that, here’s a personal note.

I’m in my 60s. We are governed by someone in his 70s. Most of our leaders have been in their 60s or 70s. For the first time, those who seek to govern us are in their 50s. My gut-instinct is to help take leadership from the clutches of those a decade older than me and transfer it to the generation a decade younger than me. That’s political evolution, social progress.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe claims that it is his economic diligence that has prevented the scenes from Nairobi, Kenya— dead bodies in the streets and parts of the Parliament ablaze-- from being re-enacted in Colombo.

### Sri Lanka strikes restructuring agreement with bondholders

(Reuters) - Sri Lanka has secured a deal to move forward on restructuring about $12.5 billion of international bonds, the government said on Wednesday, a major step in the island nation’s fragile recovery from a severe financial crisis.

The South Asian country defaulted for the first time on its foreign debt in May 2022 after its economy was driven to the brink by a slump in foreign exchange reserves.

Restructuring international bonds was one of the key conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a $2.9 billion bailout programme that helped Sri Lanka tame inflation, stabilise its currency, and improve public finances.

The deal with selected bondholders, who cover about 50% of Sri Lanka’s bonds, is contingent on confirmation by the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) made up of bilateral creditors and the IMF to ensure it is in line with the global lender’s debt sustainability analysis for the country.

(Bloomberg) -- Sri Lanka and creditors reached agreement on the terms for a $12 billion bond restructuring, bringing the South Asian nation closer to completing its debt overhaul two years after it defaulted.

Bondholders and the nation agreed to a framework for a deal that includes notes linked to economic performance and a governance-linked structure as part of plain vanilla instruments, according to a statement released Wednesday at the conclusion of the second round of restricted talks.

The deal marks the culmination of more than a year of difficult negotiations between Sri Lanka and its bondholders as officials took steps to rehabilitate the nation’s fiscal health. It will help restore access to international capital markets after the island nation fell into a default in 2022, and help Sri Lanka tap further funding from the International Monetary Fund.
