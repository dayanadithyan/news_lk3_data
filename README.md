### India extends ban on onion exports indefinitely ahead of general election

MUMBAI, March 24 (Reuters) - India has extended its ban on onion exports indefinitely - a surprise move that comes ahead of a general election and is set to exacerbate high prices in some overseas markets.

Imposed by India - the world's biggest exporter of the vegetable - in December, the ban was due to expire on March 31. Traders had anticipated it would be lifted as local prices have more than halved since the export restrictions were implemented and this season's crop is yielding fresh supplies.

However, the government issued an order late on Friday that the ban will remain in place until further notice.

"The extension is surprising and completely unnecessary, considering the falling prices with rising supplies from the new season crop," said an executive at a Mumbai-based export firm, who declined to be identified.

### IMF sees no problem in Sri Lanka central bank building reserves with fx swaps

*2024-03-24 07:47:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/imf-sees-no-problem-in-sri-lanka-central-bank-building-reserves-with-fx-swaps-155842/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Entering into foreign exchange swaps, was one of the ways endorsed by the International Monetary Fund for Lanka’s central bank to build reserves, an official said.

Sri Lanka busted all its reserves and also ‘reserves’ borrowed through swaps to suppress interest rates and enforce its bureaucratically decided policy rate during the last currency crisis.

“Rebuilding reserves is a very important component of the IMF supported programs,” Deputy Mission Chief for Sri Lanka Katsiaryna Svirydzenka.

“One, is what we call organic purchases by the central bank in the foreign exchange market.

“The other one is rebuilding reserves for engaging with swaps.

“This can either be swaps with domestic banks, but also swaps with other central banks.  The latter is a very important part of both global and regional financial safety nets.”

### Sri Lanka central bank says senior management decided to review salary hike

*2024-03-24 06:42:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-says-senior-management-decided-to-review-salary-hike-155837/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – The senior management of the central bank decided to review a steep salary hike made after a currency crisis, a statement said amid legislative and public anger against the move.

The salary hike was initially defended on the basis of central bank independence.

Giving salary hike to offset the inflation created by the agency in the process of enforcing rate cuts by printing money has been a longstanding practice.

However legislators said the independence was only given to the agency to print money (and trigger inflation or currency depreciation) and it did not apply to salaries.

Under a new law the agency has got powers to trigger up to 7 percent inflation a year with no questions asked. Since September 2022, the agency has created lower levels of inflation and has appreciated the currency with deflationary policy.

### Is Trump Likely To Be The Next American President?

Trump is not liked by most Americans, including most Republicans who support him because, though they agree that his behaviour is grotesque, he seems to be an election winner. Depending on the outcome of legal wrangles before the courts it is even conceivable that he may be the first person to contest the presidency from behind bars! (Who knows; it may increase his sympathy vote!). On Tuesday 5 March (Super Tuesday) when 15 to 16 states choose their party delegates to back a candidate for nomination both Trump and Biden scored resounding victories as Republican and Democratic nominees, respectively. Trump’s case is more important than Biden’s for reasons I will explain anon.

Trump can be notoriously and dangerously inconsistent. (Someone quipped that the apps for the “Make America Great Again” logo are made in China!). Russia is pulling all stops in supporting him as evident from RT (Russian TV), Kremlin spokesmen and Putin himself. They are going to burn their fingers.

### Beating cancer helps Lankan Buddhist woman find faith

*2024-03-24 05:01:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/beating-cancer-helps-lankan-buddhist-woman-find-faith/) · `en`

(UCAN)At 58, Ruwani Mudalige chose to be baptized a Catholic in Sri Lanka after years of keeping away from Catholicism, her mother’s religion.

“I grew up in a house of Buddhists. But my mother was a strong Catholic. I used to attend Sunday Mass with her during my childhood, but I never felt a connection to the Church,” Mudalige said.

She moved further away from Christianity with her marriage to “a devout Buddhist” at the age of 22 in 1988.The family of her husband Aloka Weerathunga was one of the traditional dancers, who attended Buddhist religious festivals and ceremonies across the country.

Mudalige accompanied them as they — her husband, his father and other relatives — performed before temple processions with a decorated elephant in vibrant colors.

During these festivals, her family’s youngsters formed a fire-dancing team, performing outside Buddhist temples as part of the festivities.

Some of the outstanding contributions to the Sri Lanka heritage are its Buddhist temple art and architecture, statuary, dagabas, dance forms and water and soil conservation ecosystems. Of Buddha statues, the one at Avukana is certainly a masterpiece; hewn out of solid granite it stands 11.3 meters high and 12.8 meters inclusive of the lotus flower pedestal. There are only four other comparable standing Buddha statues in Sri Lanka; Rasvehera in Anuradhapura, Maligawila and Buduruwagala in Moneragala and Dova in Badulla. Of these the ones at Rasvehera and Avukana are in the open and to the layman’s eye, there are hardly any signs of damage due to exposure to the elements.

### Sir Andrew Caldecott (1884-1951) Governor of Ceylon with special experience

Sir Andrew Caldecott arrived in Ceylon as Governor of the Island seven years ago yesterday. He will be 60 years of age on the 26h of this month. No excuse is therefore necessary for making some attempt to review his career.

The roll of Ceylon’s past Governors includes many remarkable men who made their mark as pioneers, administrators, scholars or writers. Sir Andrew Caldecott will take his place among them on his merits, but also on the suffrage of those peoples among whom he has served. He may not be so brilliant a writer as Clifford, so profound a scholar as Chalmers, so eloquent as West-Ridgeway or so experienced a parliamentarian as Gregory but he combines in his character qualities which made him one of the most successful and popular proconsuls ever to leave England to carry the white man’s burden.

It has been a cold and wet winter in London. As I snuggle-up in my rocking chair to write my thoughts I can hear the wind howling outside. The raindrops are carried horizontally by the strong south-westerly wind battering the window panes and dripping down in torrents.

I still have grateful memories of a happy 12 years at Wesley College. The school on Karlsruhe Hill was established with missionary zeal and some colonial vigour but it catered for all Ceylonese. The school became the cradle of multiculturalism. Protected from the polarised world outside, it remained secular and was driven by merit. Since the very beginning Wesley has strived hard to become a modern, forward-thinking school. The school has a strong record of academic achievements and a full programme of wider life activities, including the arts and sports.
