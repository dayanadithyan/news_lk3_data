### Gunman attacks U.S. Embassy in  Lebanon

*2024-06-05 16:28:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Gunman-attacks-U-S-Embassy-in-Lebanon/108-284178) ¬∑ `en`

June 05 - A gunman was captured after opening fire at the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, on Wednesday ‚Äî an attack that took place as U.S. ally Israel signaled it could soon launch an offensive in the country against Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned early Wednesday that Israel was "prepared for very intense action in the north," as he visited a border city hit by wildfires sparked by Hezbollah rockets.

The escalation has piled pressure on Netanyahu from right-wing members of his government, who have also threatened to quit if he agrees to the U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal. President Joe Biden criticized Netanyahu in an interview published Tuesday, but also dispatched top aides to the region for new talks with mediators as Washington pushes for a deal that would end eight months of fighting in Gaza and secure the release of hostages held by Hamas.

### Indian PM Modi to be sworn in for third time on June 8

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to be sworn-in for a record-equalling third term on June 8, after key allies pledged their continued support a day after a humbling election result that saw his party lose its majority in parliament.

Modi, a populist who has dominated Indian politics since coming to power in 2014, will for the first time need the support of regional allies whose loyalties have wavered over the years, which could complicate the government‚Äôs reform agenda.

On Wednesday, two allies in his National Democratic Alliance coalition, the Telugu Desam Party, a key regional player in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and the Janata Dal (United) which rules the northern state of Bihar, pledged their support.

The federal cabinet met on Wednesday morning and recommended the dissolution of parliament, a constitutional formality before Modi can form a new government.

Modi and his new cabinet were scheduled to be sworn-in on Saturday, local media reported.

### Sri Lanka has been allowed to boycott international law for more than 15 years - who have been atrocited international crimes against Eelam Tamils

*2024-06-05 12:00:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185354) ¬∑ `ta`

Sri Lanka has evaded international law for over 15 years, committing atrocities against the Eelam Tamils. The Tamil Eelam government calls for recognition to ensure accountability. ICC lawyer Karim Khan is commended for seeking the arrest of Israeli and Hamas leaders for war crimes. International legal experts affirm that no conflict can evade legal repercussions. Despite evidence of mass killings, no military personnel have faced charges. The UN highlights the failure of domestic efforts for justice, suggesting international mechanisms are necessary. The Eelam Tamils urge the ICC to indict Israeli and Hamas leaders, citing the court's recognition of Palestine's right to justice. They reject Sri Lanka's constitution based on sovereignty principles and assert their right to self-governance and prosecution of war crimes under the Rome Statute.

üü©

The recognition of legal Tamil Eelam will lead to accountability on the island of Sri Lanka, the Tamil Eelam government said.

The Transnational Tamil Eelam government praises the International Criminal Court (ICC) lawyer Karim Khan for a bold action for the arrest of Hamas and Israeli leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister, for crimes and war crimes against humanity.

We again underlined that international law and armed struggle laws apply to all, as the prosecutor Karim Khan said.. No army nor any commander can act without any punishment for crimes.

International legal experts, including former International International Criminal Court Judge Theodore Meron and Amal Clooney, have said in their statement, "No war can escape the hands of the law."

It is a painful fact that Sri Lanka has been allowed to boycott international law for more than 15 years, which has committed atrocities against the Eelam Tamils.

The Netherlands have kicked off their ICC Men's T20 World Cup campaign with a 4-wicket win against Nepal amid a full house at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas on Tuesday, June 4. It got a bit close than the Dutch would have hoped for, as skipper Scott Edwards admitted, but they would take those two points after a splendid show from the bowlers in the first innings. Edwards opted to bowl first on a wicket that was doing just enough and the likes of Tim Pringle and Logan van Beek feasted on a bit tentative Nepal line-up, bowling them out for 106.

India, June 5 (Indian Express) - The people have spoken and the NDA which claimed 294 Lok Sabha seats is set to return for a third term but the mandate is not exactly what Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spearheaded the BJP campaign, may have hoped for.

Contrary to exit polls that predicted a landslide for the ruling alliance, the BJP Tuesday fell short of a majority on its own ‚Äì with 272 as the halfway in the House of 543, it won 240 seats ‚Äì and appeared heavily dependent on alliance partners especially the TDP and JD(U), ending a decade of single-party dominance and heralding the return of a coalition government at the Centre.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing party workers at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi in the evening, hailed the mandate for the NDA and a successive third term: ‚ÄúFor the first time since 1962, a government has returned for the third time after completing its two terms.‚Äù
