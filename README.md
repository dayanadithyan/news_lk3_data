A Sri Lankan Tamil refugee living in London, known for running a chicken shop, has been arrested and faces deportation to France due to involvement in abductions. He was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by a French court for his role in abductions. Despite claiming his wife suffers from mental illness, his appeal for stay was denied, leading to his imminent deportation.

üü©

Sun has reported that Britain will be deported to France, who has planned to smuggle illegal immigrants into the UK.

The French court last year ruled that he was involved in the abduction and sentenced him to five years in prison.

The refugee who fled to Britain in 2003 from Sri Lanka gave him all the permission to live there.

He lived in a southwestern part of London and worked in a shop selling poultry meat in Brickton.

At the same time, he has also acted as the head of the gang who abducted Sri Lankan people in the last two years.

British officials first arrested him in 2022 on behalf of French officials. On November 2022, a judge ordered him to be deported based on the grip of France.

However, Sivagangan had filed a petition in court, saying that his wife was physically mentally ill.¬†However, the judge rejected his petition on Friday.

He was the main person of the European widespread gang operating in many countries of the world, the court document said.

Presidential candidate Donald Trump was booed and heckled by many in a raucous audience at the Libertarian National Convention on Saturday night, a marked change from the adulation he receives at rallies from his fervently loyal supporters.

Libertarians, who believe in limited government and individual freedom, blame Trump, a Republican, for rushing through the creation of a COVID-19 vaccine when he was president and for not doing more to stop public health restrictions on the unvaccinated during the pandemic.

When Trump took to the stage in Washington, there were loud boos and jeers. A smaller section of the crowd, Trump supporters, cheered him.

Shortly before he appeared, one Libertarian Party member shouted: ‚ÄúDonald Trump should have taken a bullet!‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the hostile reception.
