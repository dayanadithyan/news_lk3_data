Announcing the cancellation on Instagram, the organizers cited escalating concerns about racism as the primary reason behind their decision. In a post, they expressed regret for the hurt feelings caused by the event's concept and apologized to those offended by the idea.

### ISIS bride Shamima Begum loses bid to regain UK citizenship

Feb 23 - Shamima Begum, the London-born Bangladeshi-origin woman, who fled the UK as a 15-year-old schoolgirl to join the Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist network, on Friday lost yet another legal bid to regain her British citizenship and return to the UK.

The ruling means the 24-year-old must remain in Syria. The government stripped her citizenship on national security grounds in 2019.

Ms Begum left London nine years ago aged 15 to travel to Syria and join Islamic State group, or IS.

The ruling by three appeal judges was unanimous. It could still be challenged in the Supreme Court by Ms Begum.

Her solicitor, Daniel Furner said that her legal team was "not going to stop fighting until she does get justice and until she is safely back home".

However the judges wholly dismissed all of Ms Begum's arguments - a highly significant rejection that could affect her ability to gain a full appeal at the Supreme Court.

Scientists in Scotland have revealed a remarkable discovery of a ‘very strange’ 240-million-year-old ‘Chinese dragon’ fossil.

The international team from National Museums Scotland revealed their discovery -- found in Guizhou Province in southern China -- of the Dinocephalosaurus orientalis, a 5-meter-long aquatic reptile from the Triassic period dating back an estimated 240 million years.

‘With 32 separate neck vertebrae Dinocephalosaurus orientalis had an extraordinarily long neck that draws comparison with that of Tanystropheus hydroides, another strange marine reptile from the Middle Triassic of both Europe and China,’ scientists said announcing the discovery.

‘Both reptiles were of similar size and have several features of the skull in common, including a fish-trap type of dentition,’ officials continued. ‘However, Dinocephalosaurus is unique in possessing many more vertebrae both in the neck and in the torso, giving the animal a much more snake-like appearance.’
