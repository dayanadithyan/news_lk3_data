“If a child can’t learn the way we teach, maybe we should teach the way they learn.” Ignacio Estrada. This is a quote that is lost on the Sri Lankan education system but bamboo rods and beatings still remain as the number one tool to teach. Contrary to our cultural beliefs, this method is the least effective way to teach and it’s particularly detrimental when it comes to children with learning disorders.

Take Dyslexia, for example, a disorder identified 130 years ago by ophthalmologist Rudolf Berlin. People with Dyslexia have difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and their relation to words and letters (University of Oxford , n.d.). Simply put, these are the children who struggle to read and write and saying “Idiot, open your eyes and read what’s on the page. For every spelling mistake, I will give you a beating with a ruler,” will not cure their dyslexia.

### Debate Or No Debate, Addressing Critical Issues Is Important For Voters

In recent weeks, we have observed a disheartening spectacle unfold between the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the Jathika Jana Balawegaya, (NPP) as they engage in a futile tussle, each blaming the other for the failure to arrange a debate between their respective leaders and economic policy teams. This debate, crucial for enlightening the voting populace ahead of both the Presidential and General elections, remains elusive due to the entrenched animosity between the parties.

Consequently, the electorate grapples with disillusionment and disenchantment, triggered by the pervasive negative posturing exhibited by these factions, all while professing to champion System Change and advocate for a governance model marked by inclusivity and transparency.
