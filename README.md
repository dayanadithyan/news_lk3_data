### Astronomers finally detect a rocky planet with an atmosphere

WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Astronomers have searched for years for rocky planets beyond our solar system with an atmosphere - a trait considered essential for any possibility of harboring life. Well, they finally seem to have located one. But this hellish planet - apparently with a surface of molten rock - offers no hope for habitability.

Researchers said on Wednesday the planet is a "super-Earth" - a rocky world significantly larger than our planet but smaller than Neptune - and it orbits perilously close to a star dimmer and slightly less massive than our sun, rapidly completing an orbit every 18 hours or so.

Infrared observations using two instruments aboard the James Webb Space Telescope indicated the presence of a substantial - if inhospitable - atmosphere, perhaps continuously replenished by gases released from a vast ocean of magma.

"Digitizing customs services is crucial for reducing export costs and living expenses. Despite Sri Lanka Customs' digital progress during the pandemic, reverting to manual processes post-pandemic led to corruption, delays, and increased costs. The Global Shippers Forum President urges complete digitalization to prevent market share loss to countries offering full digital services, citing India and Bangladesh as examples."

üü©

The government must completely digitize services offered by border agents, including Sri Lanka Customs, to ensure that the cost of exports and the cost of living is to be reduced.

Although Sri Lanka's customs are steadily operating and fully digitalized services during the epidemic, the agency returned to the manual process in the post -infection period, causing corruption with delays and additional expenses.

‚ÄúContinuing governments do not have the motivation and vision of going to digitalization. Each rupee that is formed at port's transportation cost will come back to you. It is sent to the customer, so the cost of living is increasing.

With this media briefing, we urge the government to implement a complete digitalization, as this is not a neglecting issue in today's global economy, ‚Äùsaid Global Shippers Forum President Sean Wan Dard.

He warned that Sri Lankan exporters would lose their market share in exports as other countries in the region would come up with full digital services.

May 9 (BBC) - The former head of the Spanish football federation, Luis Rubiales, will stand trial for sexual assault over his unsolicited kissing of Women's World Cup player Jenni Hermoso.

The kiss, which Ms Hermoso said was "unwanted", happened at last year's 1-0 World Cup against England and made global headlines.

Mr Rubiales was forced to resign but has denied any wrongdoing.

A Spanish High Court judge said on Wednesday Mr Rubiales was also facing one charge of coercion.

The scandal overshadowed a historic moment for Spain's women's team, which at the time was celebrating its first ever World Cup win on 20 August 2023.

During the trophy presentation ceremony, Mr Rubiales clasped Ms Hermoso's head between his hands and planted a kiss on her lips.

It was broadcast to billions worldwide, producing a fierce backlash and national debate over sexism in Spain.

Mr Rubiales, 46, has strenuously denied wrongdoing, saying the kiss was consensual and he was the victim of a "social assassination".

Former Chairman of the Election Commission Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday that there is no legal ban on non -nationals to register a political party.

"Sri Lanka's law only prevents a non -citizen election, while the law prohibits voting in non -citizens in the election," he told the Daily Mirror.

He also said that former Minister of State Diana Kamage had not signed the United People's Power and he had never been the general secretary of our National Front.

‚ÄúOur National Front was formed by the late MPs Mangala Samaraweera and the late Sripati Suriyarachchi who broke the political alliance with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

It is noteworthy that Diana Kamage's husband took over the post, while Ruwan Ferdinandas was the general secretary of Jathika Peramuna.
