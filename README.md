Hunter Biden, 54, stared straight ahead and showed little emotion as the verdict was read after jury deliberations that lasted only three hours over two days in Wilmington, Delaware. He hugged his attorneys, smiled wanly and kissed his wife, Melissa, before leaving the courtroom with her.

President Joe Biden said in a statement issued shortly after the verdict that he would accept the outcome and ‚Äúcontinue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.‚Äù

Now Hunter Biden and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the president‚Äôs chief political rival, have both been convicted by American jurors in an election year that has been as much about the courtroom as about campaign events and rallies.

### AKD‚Äôs Speech On Police & Rule Of Law: Merits & Demerits?

Anura Kumara Dissanayake‚Äôs (AKD) speech as the Leader of the National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) at the National Convention organized by the Retired Police Officers Collective on 9 June 2024 is quite promising in terms of establishing or reestablishing rule of law in the country, if they get the opportunity to govern the nation. They have been talking about a ‚Äòsystem change‚Äô now for some time, and various independent critics and observers were asking the details of this promise, without merely depending on the slogan.

I was fortunate to listen to this speech online and live, through ‚ÄòHorawa News,‚Äô and one weakness or wrong that I immediately observed was its leading phrase ‚ÄòMalimawa shows its police power.‚Äô I have no idea about who runs the ‚ÄòHorawa,‚Äô but that was not what AKD was quite obviously advocating. ‚ÄúPower‚Äô is not a good word to use in democracy, worst still is the ‚Äòpolice power.‚Äô

### Navigating troubled waters: Indo-Lanka fishing dispute and quest for sustainable solution

*2024-06-12 01:21:52* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Navigating-troubled-waters-Indo-Lanka-fishing-dispute-and-quest-for-sustainable-solution/4-762952) ¬∑ `en`

The maritime dispute between India and Sri Lanka over illegal fishing by Tamil Nadu fishermen in Sri Lankan waters in the Palk Bay, the Gulf of Mannar, and the Palk Strait has reached a critical juncture. Recent incidents of Sri Lankan authorities detaining Indian fishermen for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) have reignited longstanding tensions. This article will attempt to delve into the heart of the conflict simmering for many decades, explore the environmental and socio-economic impacts, and highlight the need for an urgent resolution that respects the livelihoods and traditions of Sri Lankan fishing communities in the northern, north-western, and north-eastern parts of the island while ensuring marine conservation.

### Could you believe crabs killing giant guitarfish?

*2024-06-12 01:16:58* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Could-you-believe-crabs-killing-giant-guitarfish/14-762951) ¬∑ `en`

Guitarfish, also known as shovelnose rays, are a species of ray that are named because of their guitar-shaped bodies. They belong to the order Rhinopristiformes, along with the wedgefish and sawfish. This group are also called shark-like rays due to their flattened body with pectoral fins fused to the sides of the head and a hind body that resembles a shark, with two dorsal fins and a caudal fin.

The Rhinopristiformes exhibit slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity, like many other rays and sharks. Such characteristics, alone or in combination, make fishes in this group vulnerable to extinction. The global IUCN Red List of threatened species reveals that species in the order Rhinopristiformes are amongst the most threatened marine fishes and over 70% of guitarfish are either threatened or data deficient.

### The many faces of impunity

*2024-06-12 00:32:18* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-many-faces-of-impunity/4-762932) ¬∑ `en`

Such impunity is possible because an absolute majority of victims are the most discriminated against people in Sri Lanka: Upcountry Tamils

Hopefully, President Wickremesinghe‚Äôs decision to use the State to correct the gross imbalance in the bargaining power between plantation workers and the management would set a new trend. Unfortunately, the chances of such a positive outcome is unlikely. Both the SJB and the JVP are silent on the issue (Sajith Premadasa‚Äôs promise to fully implement the 13th Amendment is commendable. The JVP is yet to make such a full throated endorsement). Production economy (nishpadana arthikaya) is not a plan but a slogan. Reducing PAYE tax is not a road to the future but a return to the past. If one cannot tell Elon Musk, James Packer, and George Soros apart (as Sunil Handunnetti obviously failed to) a new Gota, armed with the impunity of new-mint popularity, awaits us at the next bend

### On system change

*2024-06-12 00:20:40* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/On-system-change/4-762931) ¬∑ `en`

‚ÄúNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it‚Äôs the only thing that ever has‚Äù

It was only after the 2022 Aragalaya that the need for system change was felt among different quarters of Sri Lanka‚Äôs intelligentsia and opinion makers. In his Independence Day address to the nation even President RW casually referred to system change without any elaboration. One or two outspoken members from the opposition parties also, without much details, described the shortcomings of current administration as systemic. But it was NPP that adopted system change as its central pillar of reforms if it were to come to power.
