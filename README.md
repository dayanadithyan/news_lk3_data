*2024-06-07 10:08:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99720/railway-strike-expected-to-disrupt-train-services-) ┬╖ `en`

The Locomotive Operating EngineersтАЩ Union of Sri Lanka Railways says they have┬а launched a strike from midnight yesterday (06).

The trade union action is being carried out over delays in second-class promotions of locomotive drivers and several other issues, according to the Locomotive Operating EngineersтАЩ Union.

Secretary of the union┬а S.R.C.M. Senanayake said that only locomotive drivers of two of the five running sheds have joined the strike and due to this there will be no power set trains operating.

He further stated that even though the morning office trains would experience minimal impact from the strike, there is a possibility that all the trains scheduled for this evening might be cancelled.

However, Ada Derana learns that only 84 locomotive drivers are engaged in this trade union action based on their own promotion issues.

The Court held that the petitioner, Women & Media Collective organization should hold such money in trust and spend it for the purposes that are in the best interests of female victims of crime and this sum of money should be paid within one month of this judgement.

In another landmark judgement pertaining to the scope of the pardon granted by the executive President, the Supreme Court yesterday ruled that former President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to grant a Presidential pardon to Royal Park murder convict Don Shamantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha is arbitrary and not valid in law.

Colombo, June 7 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of the announcement of the judgement, the family of victim Yvonne Jonsson, said this ruling is not only a victory for our family but also for all who believe in the rule of law.

Her sister Caroline Jonsson who issued the statement on behalf of the family said it is also a significant step for all female victims in Sri Lanka, affirming that their lives and dignity cannot be compromised by arbitrary decisions.

тАЬThe Supreme Court ruling that former President Maithripala SirisenaтАЩs pardon of Yvonne's murderer is arbitrary and not valid in law brings us a profound sense of relief and justice.

The tragic and brutal loss of Yvonne has left an unfillable void in our hearts, causing us immense and ongoing pain. The pardon felt like a deep betrayal, compounding our grief and anguish.

### Authorities to pursue extradition of Jayamaha

*2024-06-07 08:43:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Authorities-to-pursue-extradition-of-Jayamaha/108-284320) ┬╖ `en`

Colombo, June 7 (Daily Mirror) Following the Supreme Court's ruling declaring former President Maithripala Sirisena's pardon of Don Shamantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha as arbitrary and invalid, Sri Lankan authorities have intensified efforts to bring the convicted murderer back to the country, suspected to be in Singapore.

However, Sri LankaтАЩs efforts are likely to hit a snag in this regard because no extradition treaty has been signed yet with Singapore.

Such an agreement can be signed only with the concurrence of the two countries. Sri Lanka has signed such agreements with numerous other countries.

According to police sources, Jayamaha, who had been serving a prison sentence for the Royal Park murder case, left Sri Lanka on November 15, 2019, just days before an interim order was issued prohibiting him from leaving the country.

It was revealed that Jayamaha had obtained a passport on November 13, 2019 immediately after receiving the presidential pardon.

### USA stun Pakistan in T20 World Cup super over

*2024-06-07 08:38:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/USA-stun-Pakistan-in-T20-World-Cup-super-over/108-284319) ┬╖ `en`

USA, June 7 (BBC) - The United States pulled off one of the biggest shocks in cricket history by beating Pakistan in a super over in Dallas.

Pakistan looked to be avoiding embarrassment at the T20 World Cup before Nitish Kumar hit the final ball of the US innings for four to tie the scores at 159.

Sloppy for large parts of the game, Pakistan fell apart in the tie-breaker. Mohammad Amir bowled three wides, one of which the co-hosts also pinched two extra runs from.

The US scrambled to 18-1, leaving Pakistan to chase 19 off left-arm seamer Saurabh Netravalkar. When 14 were needed off four balls, Kumar made another crucial intervention, this time holding a magnificent catch at long-off to dismiss Iftikhar Ahmed.

With seven required from the last ball, Shadab Khan could only take a single, sparking joyous celebrations among the American players and supporters.

All this at the end of a riveting contest, one which fluctuated in the burning Texas sunshine.

### Indian Lok Sabha election - a view

*2024-06-07 01:24:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185482) ┬╖ `ta`

In the recently concluded Indian Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, did not secure the expected 400 seats but still achieved a significant majority. This result limits the BJP's ability to unilaterally implement reforms. Despite this, Modi was re-elected for a third term. The election saw several surprises, including independent candidates winning against major parties. For instance, Amrit Pal Singh, despite being imprisoned, won in the Katur Sahib constituency, and Mohammed Haneefa triumphed in Ladakh over both Congress and BJP candidates. These outcomes highlight the dynamic nature of Indian politics and the potential for independent voices to impact electoral results positively.

ЁЯЯй

The completed Indian Lok Sabha election has many interesting features. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been ruling in India for the past ten years, and the Prime Minister of the party, Narendra Modi, have not received 400 seats in the NDA's campaign.. Instead, only a large -scale majority to rule is to the people.

This has created an environment where the BJP is no longer able to decide for reforms in the country.. Although Indian voters have been given the opportunity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the third time.This time the BJP and the party's Prime Minister Narendra Modi have made the position that Telugu Desam Party leader Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, the leader of the United Janata Party, can be operated only after consultation.. Political observers have said that this is healthy for democracy.

These are days when people are working hard to make ends meet; even when the spouse is employed too. With regard to those frequenting the corridors of power, they too are working immensely hard to be in power when the next government is formed.

There was a recent meme (an image, video or piece of text) on Facebook which portrayed two candidates who are likely to bid for the presidency at the next big election. The one with a love for nature photography was saying тАШIt would be my way only and there is no asking questionsтАЩ. The other was saying the total opposite. He states in the meme, тАЬAsk any question and IтАЩll give the answer again and again till you understandтАЭ. Great talent is needed to remain as a politician who wields power in the future because this is an era of discourse; not one of orders.

Wild elephants in Sri Lanka are causing significant issues, behaving aggressively and leading to loss of human life. They target homes, disrupting daily life and education. The situation is likened to the actions of the LTTE, forcing residents from their villages. Despite being protective of habitats beneficial to them, they attack homes, highlighting the need for effective solutions to manage this crisis, especially to boost agriculture.

Former Wildlife Defense Minister and State MP Wimalaweera Dissanayake said that wild elephants were acting like the LTTE and could not sleep at night.

Wildlife Minister Pavithra Wanniyarachchi interrupted a question raised in the query in Parliament on Thursday (06) in Parliament.

Wild elephants have problems in all parts of the country.. Many of the human lives are lost when they take steps to address elephant problems.

Elephants do not attack the houses of the sides who are in favor of the elephants. Elephants do not attack the houses. Elephants are attacking the homes of the people.

Wild elephants behave like the Liberation Tigers, so that the residents leave their villages.. Students could not even go to school. Elephants kill the public

Elephant problems should be solved if they want to improve agriculture. Those who refer to as environmental experts have no better plan.

### Slaughter of the Gaza lamb: Israeli PharaohтАЩs crimes against children

Palestinian children carry water containers in the Jabalia refugee camp, in the northern Gaza Strip.

On Tuesday, June 4, the day the world was supposed to mark the International Day of Innocent Children Victims of Aggression, the silence of the pro-Israeli world powers was deafening. In Gaza, the day had little meaning as there was no let-up in the slaughter of Palestinian children.

The day is marked as a poignant reminder to all nations that they should not cause physical, mental, or emotional harm to children. The day calls on UN member states to recommit themselves to ending all forms of violence against children.

There was little or no attempt by most Israeli-friendly nations to make use of the day to issue a powerful statement calling the Zionist aggressor to stop its slaughter of the lambs in Gaza. They probably feared that if they did so, they would only expose Israel as the post-World War II worldтАЩs most gruesome child killer.

A proposed 1,700 rupee salary hike for plantation workers, announced via a May 21st gazette notification, faces opposition from employers who claim financial strain. Despite a court appeal hearing on June 3rd, no interim injunction was issued against the wage increase. Workers await confirmation of the new rate, but plantation administrators insist the old salaries will apply due to the completion of this month's payroll before the announcement.

ЁЯЯй

The 1,700 rupee salary hike for plantation workers is suspected of getting workers on the 10th of this month.

The Secretary of the Ministry of Labor issued a gazette notification on May 21 to pay a daily salary of Rs 1,700 for plantation workers.

The Plantation Employers Federation was opposed to the fact that it could not afford the workers. The 21 plantation companies have filed a case in the Court of Appeal, challenging the salary increase gazette.

The Court of Appeal, which was heard by the case on the 03rd, ruled that an interim injunction was not issued against the Gazette.

In the meantime, workers are hoping that the monthly salary will be made at Rs 1,700.

However, the final account of this month's salary was completed by the plantation administrations on Wednesday 05th. Therefore, plantation union leaders say the old salary will be available.

Plantation administrations have told union leaders and union leaders that they have not been able to get any round of salary increases.

It is that paranoia and panic which has provoked the General Secretary of UNP to call for the postponement of elections for two years. Although that call has drawn criticisms from several corners it did not come out of a vacuum.
