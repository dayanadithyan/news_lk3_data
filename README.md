### Sri Lankan workers in Israel face dilemma, seek job shifts

Colombo, Feb 23 (Daily Mirror) - A contingent of Sri Lankan workers dispatched to Israel to work in the agriculture sector has encountered challenges, with some seeking alternative employment due to reported difficulties on the job, Daily Mirror learns.

Israel's recruitment drive for foreign labourers was prompted by the deportation of thousands of Palestinian workers after the Hamas’ attack on October 7, last year. It led to opportunities for workers from countries like India and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka which seized the opportunity sent workers to Israel to work both in the construction and agriculture industries.

However, there are reports about some Sri Lankan workers expressing dissatisfaction with the working conditions in the agriculture sector. Complaints range from inadequate facilities to the strenuous nature of farm work. Several workers have reportedly approached the Sri Lankan mission in Tel Aviv, exploring the possibility of switching to different job sectors.

ECONOMYNEXT – They lie buried in numerous mass graves, all evidence of Sri Lanka’s murderous recent past which has been punctuated by multiple civil conflicts.

Whatever remains is evidence of Sri Lanka’s grisly history of the extrajudicial executions of rebels in both Northern and Southern insurrections.

Most of the bodies remain in mass graves that stretch from Chemmani and Duraiappah Stadium in  Jaffna to burial sites in the Colombo and Matale Districts and the Southern and Central Provinces.

The dead could be anyone; captured rebels, those caught in crossfires and others who were deemed to be “inconvenient,” according to a report titled ‘Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s War Time Role’ released by the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) on 17 January 2024.

Sri Lanka’s recent blood-soaked history is replete with mass killings and many “disappearances” from the various incidents during the insurgencies of the JVP as well as the Tamil separatist war.

A spacecraft built and flown by Texas-based company Intuitive Machines landed near the south pole of the moon on Thursday, the first U.S. touchdown on the lunar surface in more than half a century and the first ever achieved by the private sector.

The uncrewed six-legged robot lander, dubbed Odysseus, touched down at about 6:23 p.m. EST (2323 GMT), the company and NASA commentators said in a joint webcast of the landing from Intuitive Machines’ mission operations center in Houston.

The landing capped a nail-biting final approach and descent in which a problem surfaced with the spacecraft’s autonomous navigation system that required engineers on the ground to employ an untested work-around at the 11th hour.

It also took some time after an anticipated radio blackout to re-establish communications with the spacecraft and determine its fate some 239,000 miles (384,000 km) from Earth.

*2024-02-23 02:54:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177088) · `ta`

There have been contradictions between the Fishermen's Association and the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka regarding the license of the fishing landing in Negombo, which has been in use for more than six decades.

A demonstration was held early this week (February 19) in front of the Archbishop's House in Colombo demanding that the administration of the Negombo - Pittipana landing department be given to them.

The demonstration was carried out as the Negombo District Court issued an interim injunction in the 2008 case of the administrative rights of the landing department.

The Negombo District Court has issued an interim order after a long hearing as the case is still pending in court.

Representatives of the Holy Pope in Colombo handed over a Major with their problems and protested in front of the Archbishop's house.

In 2008, the then Archbishop of Colombo, Osult Comes, filed a case against the United Fishermen's Association for violating the conditions for managing the landing.

The Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) must consider the plight of mothers and fathers who are struggling to send their children to school and complete the basic education of their offspring. General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU), Joseph Stalin has been quoted in the media stating that the dropout and the absenteeism rate in schools is high and alarming at present; despite such figures not having reached their peak as yet.

The once in a lifetime opportunity children get to spend a 13-year-period in school is now threatened. Parents are finding it extremely difficult to send their children to school because academic institutes are now expecting parents to bear certain education expenses which were once borne by the state.

### Palestine question: US blamed for veto; Brazil, Guyana hailed, Lanka nowhere

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield casting the veto vote against the UN Security Council resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. AFP

Burying the values the United States presidents often speak highly of during their policy speeches, Washington once again inhumanely used its veto power at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday to kill Algeria’s resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

It is revolting to see Washington’s UN envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a political science lecturer, diplomat, and private sector executive not known for human rights or humanitarian activism, raise her hand at the UNSC to veto the resolution. This was the third time her hand went up in support of genocide, ethnic cleansing, and Israel’s war crimes in the Gaza Strip. As a paid servant of the US administration, she does whatever she is commanded to do by President Joe Biden, who is being flayed on social media as Genocide Joe.

Move seen as caving to pressure from debt evaders’ intense lobbying

Stress any move to amend parate rights of banks must be initiated with the financial sector regulator

Sri Lanka’s banking sector is on the edge of following the government’s decision to suspend parate execution rights. This move, seen as caving to pressure from debt evaders’ intense lobbying, is raising concerns about the sector’s ability to support economic recovery.

“The banks believe that this is an unnecessary intervention that  will weaken the strength of banks to perform their role in supporting the economic sectors that will revive the country,” the Sri Lanka Banks Association (SLBA) told Mirror Business, while pointing out they are “alarmed” by the statement made by the State Minister of Finance, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, in parliament this week.

The SLBA urged the government not to play into the delaying tactics of these borrowers.

By chasing away Dudley Sirisena in that manner, the students violated a basic tenet of higher learning

“Everything is abnormal in our society; that is how these things happen, and, when they do, nobody knows how to act – not only in the most difficult situations, but even in the simplest”

“Happy families are all alike, every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way” – Anna Karenina-Leo Tolstoy

Sirisena should have been heard by the students. From every dialog there is something to be learnt. When a person talks about his career, he is invariably the hero of the story, his success is presented in heroic terms. It is for the listener to give an intelligent ear. Openness to the ‘other’ is fundamental to the intellectual process

### COPF questions Fin. Min.’s reluctance to adopt VAT amendment recommendations

The Finance Ministry officials have told the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) that the revenue loss incurred from the initial ‘sugar scam’ should be classified as tax foregone, instead of a tax loss.

This was mentioned when the Finance Ministry officials were summoned before the COPF on Tuesday (22).

When asked about the progress of recovering the lost revenue resulting from the initial ‘sugar scam’, as highlighted in the report by the Auditor General, the ministerial officials contended that it should not be classified as a tax loss, but rather as tax foregone due to the reduction of the special commodity levy from Rs. 50 to 25 cents.

Despite this explanation, the COPF members pressed the officials for data on certain companies that had disproportionately profited from this tax adjustment, amounting to Rs. 1.4 billion from six companies, with an additional six companies yet to be investigated.

Those who are in possession of drugs. But has it ever occurred to these knights in shining armour, who go after those who possess drugs, that there is another group on whom no drugs are found or will ever be found, who are nevertheless, the masterminds of the drug trade?

Stock market activities were sluggish throughout yesterday but two major blue- chip companies, JKH and Expolanka Holdings, drove the market considerably.However, banking stocks which were the most sought after over the last few weeks, noted some selling pressure, and that trend shifted to a few blue- chips during the day, market analysts said.

Amid those developments both indices moved slightly upwards. All Share Price Index went up by 6 points while the S and P SL-20 rose by 0.22 points.

Turnover stood at Rs 1.47 billion with three crossings.

### Saboteurs of system change

*2024-02-22 23:32:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Saboteurs-of-system-change/4-758786) · `en`

Those elections would see a direct clash between a generation of geriatric leaders who grew in and groomed by a society stratified by castes, ethnicity, religions, and so on, and a younger, talented and globally connected generation to which the society of their elders has become alien. This intergenerational dichotomy may sound political rhetoric and difficult to fathom by many. But it is well recognised global phenomenon that continues to trouble many a regime. This is why when the country is at the cusp of breaking away from the old order the three ethno-religious minority parties are appearing to be trio of saboteurs

### Buddha: The scientist of suffering and existence

*2024-02-22 23:29:56* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Buddha-The-scientist-of-suffering-and-existence/4-758785) · `en`

Buddha may not be credited with inventing groundbreaking scientific discoveries like the law of gravity, the steam engine, or penicillin. Still, he stands as a scientist par excellence who unravelled the causes and remedies for human suffering. His teachings, imparted to spiritual seekers, encompassed both mundane and supra-mundane aspects.

The mundane teachings outlined a path to a life devoid of conflict, as evidenced in discourses such as Singalowada, Parabhawa, Mangala, Ratana, and Karaneeyametta, among thousands of others. Yet, Buddha’s true innovation lay in his profound exploration of the nature of existence, a revelation that is currently gaining widespread recognition though among smaller segments of seekers across the globe.

### Marie Colvin: Intrepid journalist who lost an eye in northern Sri Lanka

*2024-02-22 23:14:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Marie-Colvin-Intrepid-journalist-who-lost-an-eye-in-northern-Sri-Lanka/4-758784) · `en`

The life and work of Marie Colvin is multi-faceted and a manifestation of exemplary bravery and commitment

It is said of war correspondents that they have to “Get in, Get it and Get out”. Marie did just that in many conflict zones from Chechnya to Bosnia, from Sri Lanka to Syria. In Sri Lanka she lost an eye but in Syria she lost her life. She got in, got it but couldn’t get out. To her credit it must be said that she had the option of leaving like many other scribes but opted to stay on and report the travails of ordinary civilians in war situations. One of her final reports was a first person account of seeing a baby die

### Sir Oliver Goonetilleke: The negotiator behind independence

*2024-02-22 23:10:19* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sir-Oliver-Goonetilleke-The-negotiator-behind-independence/4-758783) · `en`

The independence that Sri Lankans won from the British empire, which pervaded nearly two centuries on the island was unique in many ways. From an optimistic point of view, the independence that the British granted us was a triumph of the liberal democratic tradition implanted by the British themselves. Contrary to the aggressive nature of the Indian freedom struggle, which often shuddered the White Hall of London, our own path to independence epitomised the British liberal values absorbed by the native leaders. Although it contains a sense mortifying feeling regarding the absence of a rigorous freedom struggle, Sri Lanka can boast of the pacific nature of the power transition from the British to the natives.
