Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of starting a fire on the grounds of Europe’s largest and now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Sunday, with both sides reporting no sign of elevated radiation.

State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday reassured the public that the Finance Ministry can support Presidential polls with any number of candidates.

Siyambalapitiya noted that the expenditure estimate for the Presidential polls has not yet surpassed the Rs. 10 billion limit set for the event.

Despite challenges, including the unfeasibility of building a united front, she advocates for Ranil's victory as crucial for the country's recovery.

No one can build the Sri Lanka PA. President Ranil Wickremesinghe should win the upcoming election.

While the country was opposed to the worst economic crisis, none of the heroes who are currently speaking of the government have been responsible for the government. The country was on fire. President Ranil Wickremesinghe took the country without considering his political future.

The ruling and opposition parties must remember that no one can do election campaigns if the Age of 20122 is present in the year 20122.

I will be happy if the PA wins, but it is impossible to practice. No one can build public Peramuna. President Ranil Wickremesinghe should win the election. If he wins, the country will win.

In innovation outputs, there are two categories, namely, knowledge and technology and creativity. In all these categories, Sri Lanka’s performance as an innovative economy has been far from the desired.

There is a long list of Presidential hopefuls, but the voters will focus on five or six of them. From among them, one will be elected as the leader to steer the country to progress and prosperity. However, if they are to deliver prosperity to people, they should adopt policy strategies to accelerate economic growth at an unparalleled level of 8-9% annually over the next 25 years. This requires Sri Lanka to generate new inventions which should be commercially produced for the local as well as for global markets through innovations.

Hence, inventions and innovations should receive the highest priority of those aspiring to win the forthcoming Presidential election in their policy strategies. This article series will provide the needed guidance to those Presidential hopefuls. It is an updated and a modified version of a previous paper written by the author for the Association of Professional Bankers.

Modern economies should be aptly termed innovation or creative economies

### The Reality Of The Economic Crisis

*2024-08-11 21:52:19* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-reality-of-the-economic-crisis/) · `en`

There is still a significant misunderstanding among many people regarding the true cause of the economic crisis. While many attribute the economic downturn primarily to corruption, the underlying cause is far more complex: we have been spending more than we earn. The lack of savings, combined with many state institutions operating at a loss, has led us to spend beyond our means. To cover these expenses, we have had to borrow money, and as this pattern continued, our debt accumulated to unmanageable levels. When income suddenly drops, the ability to pay off these debts becomes severely compromised, leading to the kind of crisis Sri Lanka experienced in 2021.
