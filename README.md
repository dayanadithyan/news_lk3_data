May 13 (Daily Mirror) - National selectors announced the Sri Lankan squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup in USA & West Indies with uncapped Dunith Wellalage grabbing the headlines.

Wellalage who has already played ODI and Test cricket for Sri Lanka, was named in the 15-man squad with Jaffna sensation Vijayakanth Viyaskanth only making it to the reserves.

Viyaskanth who has made a rapid rise in the last couple of years through his LPL performances for Jaffna based franchises, is now taking part in number of top competition such as the Indian Premier League and International League T20 in UAE.

In fact the leg spinner replaced his T20 captain Wanindu Hasaranga at Sunrises Hyderabad in the ongoing IPL season making debut under the captaincy of Pat Cummins.

On Monday (13) National Selectors were questioned by the media during a press conference as to why Wellalage was named in the fifteen ahead of Viyaaskanth.

### Hospice Sri Lanka Alliance makes a milestone in palliative care: Health Secy.

Colombo, May 13 (Daily Mirror) - Forming an alliance in the hospice treatment sector in the country will make a milestone in the palliative care and will help to standardize an industry, which had rendered a significant service to the public, said Secretary of Health Dr. Palitha Mahipala.

Dr. Mahipala made these remarks addressing the inaugural ceremony to launch Hospice Sri Lanka Alliance, which was organised by the College of Palliative Medicine of Sri Lanka (CPMSL) at the BMICH over the weekend.

Hospice treatment is a programme to ensure the quality of life of a patient of a chronic disease like cancer who is nearing his end and to treat the personтАЩs symptoms rather than the disease itself. Palliative is a form of medical care that relieves symptoms without dealing with the cause of the condition.
