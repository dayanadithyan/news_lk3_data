Is it bearable, this oppression by reactionary elites who have captured the state, for the sake of ostensible stability in the short term... even if exploring the alternatives – and there is a raft of these – means facing and overcoming the ‘fear psychosis’ (or false propaganda) of the much-dreaded return to vistas of austerity? Or do we owe those who were arguably the worst off – some of my readers may be in the same boat or at the bottom of the same pool – under a cabal that brought a country to its knees and a nation to bankruptcy?

Over the ‘long weekend’ a few days ago, an immersive editorialist – like a few other ordinary folks in Sri Lanka lucky enough to be able to savour it – was pleased to be tasked to enjoy some down time on an out-of-town getaway.

### Measuring, preventing, and responding to non-economic loss caused by climate change

*2024-08-23 23:25:29* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Measuring-preventing-and-responding-to-non-economic-loss-caused-by-climate-change/4-765917) · `en`

There is a broad range of climate-induced losses that are difficult to restore, reverse, or quantify

Climate-induced loss and damage refers to the impacts of climate change that exceed the practical or theoretical limits of adaptation. It is increasingly recognised as an important challenge for countries across the world and seen by many as the third pillar of the Paris Agreement in addition to mitigation (the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation.

While economic losses and damages—such as destruction of property, assets, infrastructure, or the loss of agricultural production—can potentially be repaired and compensation payments might enable affected communities to rebuild and recover, there is a broad range of losses that are difficult to restore, cannot be reversed, or not easily quantifiable in financial terms. These “non-economic” losses can affect individuals, communities, or the natural environment, and result from a variety of climatic events and processes.

🟩

The government, which has so far claimed that state officials are burden to the country. This is a completely opportunism. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said that we too will increase the salary of state officials by 24 percent.

He was speaking at a campaign meeting held on Friday (23) in the Varakapola constituency in Kegalle district.

Government officials have seen state officials as a burden to the country. But now the state officials are important to this government. This is opportunism. The current government is working to deceive state officials to retain their positions.

A few months ago, the state service was ineffective and the number of state officials would be reduced and they were burden to the country. But today the same people are making fake promises. We will not make fake promises to do so. Let us do everything that says.

Modi embraced Zelensky – who looked visibly emotional – at the Mariinsky palace in Kyiv, in the first ever visit by an Indian premier to Ukraine.

The Indian leader is casting himself as a possible peacemaker between Moscow and Kyiv.

But his visit comes at a dramatic moment in the two-and-a-half year war, with a diplomatic settlement appearing more elusive than ever.

Kyiv’s forces are mounting a major incursion into Russia’s Kursk region while Moscow’s army is advancing in eastern Ukraine, claiming to have seized a swathe of towns and villages in recent weeks.

“No problem can be resolved on a battlefield,” Modi said in Poland on Wednesday before heading to Ukraine.

India, he said, supports “dialogue and diplomacy for restoration of peace and stability as soon as possible”.
