New president prioritizes racial reconciliation, National Peace Council urges focus on inter-government unity. Economic stability and corruption require long-term political solutions based on devolution. True political acceptance of all communities' aspirations essential for national healing and confidence rebuilding. New leader must address Tamil community concerns and promote power sharing in provincial councils. Political commitment and ethnic peace crucial for attracting foreign investment and international support. Building a new social contract respecting all communities' rights and aspirations key to Sri Lanka's future: justice, equality, and sustainable peace.

The National Peace Council has urged the new presidential election to be given priority to inter -government reconciliation.

In this regard, the report issued by the Peace Council on Tuesday (17).

As the presidential election campaigns end, the focus from the election contest must return to the country's emergency challenges. While the election results are uncertain, the new president is going to take responsibility for a country that is wrestling with the economic stability and the deepest rooted corruption and punishment culture.

A challenge to note in the presence of the new government that requires a long -term racism through a political solution based on devolution. The new president must give priority to this issue to bring about sustainable peace and unity to the country.

### Sri Lanka‚Äôs next leader: can make or break the nation

As Sri Lanka prepares for its upcoming Presidential election, the stakes have never been higher. In 2022, the country faced an unprecedented economic crisis that brought the nation to a standstill, marked by fuel shortages, soaring inflation, and widespread protests. Since then, the country has taken steps toward stabilising the economy, but much remains to be done. This election is not just about choosing a leader but about securing the nation‚Äôs future and ensuring continued recovery from the devastating economic collapse.

The road to recovery has been difficult, but significant progress has been made since 2022, largely supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. However, Sri Lanka remains vulnerable, and the next president must navigate the country through this challenging period with a steady hand. Voters, therefore, must consider candidates who possess the qualities necessary to complete the recovery process and set the nation on a path to sustainable growth.

I first met Anthony A. Page, fondly known as Baba, in early 1992 while conducting an audit of the Ceylon Theatres Group. At the time, I was working as an article clerk at KPMG Ford Rhodes Thornton & Company. During our initial meeting, where he interviewed me for a position within his Group, I was struck by his gentle and humble demeanour. Our conversation revolved around the importance of family, and he shared the story of his father, late Albert Page, who came from Manipay, Jaffna to Colombo, eventually succeeding in business. Little did I realise that this conversation will lay the foundation for a lasting professional and personal relationship.

### Conscience At The Polls: A Forgotten Tool To Guide Our Future

Why explore the concept of conscience now, on the verge of a presidential election? Though volumes have been written, and it has been the subject of deep discussions by psychologists, researchers, and religions, there‚Äôs an urgency to revisit it. The idea of ‚Äúconscience‚Äù often carries moral implications and is typically viewed as an inner sense of integrity. Properly harnessed, conscience‚Äîthis inner integrity itself‚Äîcan help anyone attain the highest state of mind, alongside its other functions like providing the ability to discern right from wrong. It equips any healthy individual to monitor, evaluate, and control their actions.

### Why the doom and gloom?

*2024-09-17 22:56:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/why-the-doom-and-gloom/) ¬∑ `en`

It is true that in the distant past Sri Lankan elections were emotionally charged affairs resulting in violence. However, as a battle-hardened nation with an increasingly well-informed citizenry, that trend has changed for the better. For example, Sri Lanka 2022 Human Right report stated, ‚ÄúDomestic observers described the election as peaceful, technically well managed, and safe considering the COVID-19 pandemic but noted that unregulated campaign spending, abuse of state resources, and media bias affected the level playing field,‚Äù referring to the 2020 election. As of this writing, the Election Commission has reported a 43% drop in violations in the current cycle with eleven instances of violence. Even though no violations can be accepted, this is a promising trend, people are beginning to see through the heinous intentions of the perpetrators. One would expect that trend to continue and, judging by the low-key election fervor, which appears to be the case.
