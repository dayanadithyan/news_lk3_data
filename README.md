Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardhane clarified the matter saying that two questions had been submitted to the Secretary General's Office by the Opposition Leader's Office, one question was handed over at 11.40 am to be raised by the Opposition Leader and another question was handed over at 12.10 pm to be raised by NPP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

### Imran Khan acquitted in state secrets case

*2024-06-04 14:21:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99655/imran-khan-acquitted-in-state-secrets-case) ¬∑ `en`

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been acquitted of leaking state secrets but will remain in jail because of a conviction in another case.

In the run-up to elections in February, the 71-year-old - who was ousted as prime minister in 2022 - was hit with three prison sentences for cases he insists were politically motivated.

Khan was sentenced to 10 years in prison in January on charges of making public a diplomatic cable in 2022.

The Islamabad High Court upheld his appeal and cleared him in that case on Monday, but he is not expected to leave prison for now.

The former cricket star and his third wife Bushra are both serving prison sentences after a court ruled that their 2018 marriage had been un-Islamic and illegal as it came too soon after her divorce.

The couple were also found guilty of corruption over gifts received during his term as prime minister.

Even behind bars, the former cricket star remains a powerful force in Pakistani politics.

11.58 AM -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alliance raced to a majority in early vote counting trends in the general election, but the numbers were well short of the landslide predicted in exit polls. Opposition gains are higher than expected.

11.48 AM - When Narendra Modi launched his campaign with the slogan ‚ÄúAb ki baar, 400 paar,‚Äù he aimed for more than 400 seats for his BJP-led NDA alliance. The most optimistic exit polls even predicted a clear 400 seats for them.

However, early trends indicate a much tighter contest with the Congress-led INDIA alliance, a centre-left coalition. Speculation is already rife about whether the BJP alone will reach the 272 seats needed for a majority in the 543-seat parliament.

The lead between the two coalitions appears narrower than expected, with early trends showing a difference of only 60 to 70 seats.

India, June 4 ( Al Jazeera) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led alliance is leading as India counts votes after a mammoth seven-phase election ‚Äì the world‚Äôs largest democratic exercise ‚Äì that began on April 19 and ended on Saturday.

A party or coalition needs 272 seats to cross the majority mark in the 543-member Lok Sabha, the lower house of India‚Äôs parliament.

Exit polls show Modi is well on track to return to power for a third consecutive term, while the Indian National Congress party-led opposition bloc hopes to upstage him.

The Election Commission says a record-breaking 642 million voters cast their ballots in the staggered election as it dismissed opposition concerns over how the votes would be counted.

However, the voter turnout this year was 66.3 percent, about one percentage point lower than 2019.

India began counting more than 640 million votes Tuesday in the world‚Äôs largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power.

Exit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi‚Äôs Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.

Indian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results.

Nearly 970 million people, more than 10% of the world‚Äôs population, were eligible to vote. Turnout was around 66% on average across the seven phases, according to official data.
