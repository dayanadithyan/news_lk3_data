### A debate on a debate between Presidential candidates

*2024-04-20 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/A-debate-on-a-debate-between-Presidential-candidates/172-281012) · `en`

On the other hand, the NPP leaders are very keen on a debate between  their leader and the SJB leader rather than a debate between the  Economic Committees of the two parties, obviously with an air of  self-assurance over the outcome of such a debate.

Although their  contention to justify a showdown between the Presidential candidates of  the two parties seems to be logical, a veiled hesitancy on their part in  meeting the SJB Economic Committee could also be sensed.

Despite the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the Jathika Jana Balawegaya (National People’s Power –NPP) having been throwing challenges at each other for a debate over the economic recovery of the country, they seem to have their apprehensions as well in meeting the challenge.

### Female workers who keep economy running

In April 2022 our country was declared bankrupt. We were unable to import basic needs such as food, fuel, cooking gas, medicines and other necessities. A sudden ban on the import of petroleum-based fertiliser nearly killed some of our main export crops such as tea, rubber and coconut. Soon shop shelves ran empty. Long queues formed around fuel depots. Amid the turmoil, the executive president fled the country.

A situation of anarchy was eased with the election of President Wickremesinghe to the presidency by Parliament. Wickremesinghe was able to steady the ship and prevent the country from sliding into anarchy.

Today, for the first time in three years gross official reserves crossed the US$4 billion mark at end of December 2023.

### Energy is people’s property; time to claim our share

If I made this statement even a few short years ago, I would have been labelled insane.  The ground reality at that time would have clearly supported that view, at least to the extent of our claiming our share.  But much has changed in those years, particularly for Sri Lanka, when no one would now dare claim that any fossil fuel-based energy generation, the playing field of a chosen few, is cheaper than renewable energy. This most encouraging change has much more far-reaching implications, in that the basic resources available are natural renewable resources such as sunshine, wind, water on one hand and no one can claim ownership of these resources and the technologies of converting these to electricity are now economically feasible at much smaller scale. Of particular interest are the solar energy technologies, which has now made it possible for electricity consumers to become “Prosumers”.

### The 2019 Easter Tragedy: The 5th year of callousness

The People in Sri Lanka continue to be deeply unhappy and distraught in terms of investigations into the worst act of terrorism in contemporary times in Sri Lanka. The Easter Bombings 2019.

Five years is upon us this Easter and the nation sadly is none the wiser.

Meanwhile the suffering of those who were maimed and injured in varying degrees, has continued unabated.

A book by the former President also alludes to disagreements and disillusionment amongst senior military officials in other matters, begging the question if this disillusionment is a manufactured version to create space between these officials and their one time colleague and Boss.

The President at the time of the Easter Tragedy has awoken from a presumably manufactured slumber and has claimed to have knowledge of the Mastermind/s behind this attack which is beyond sinister. His shameful attempt to make light of this very tragic tragedy is not only shameful but reaches to new depths of depravity.

### Go East(er)! – A look back to 21/4 and hearkening at what lies ahead

*2024-04-19 23:05:01* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Go-East-er-A-look-back-to-21-4-and-hearkening-at-what-lies-ahead/4-760810) · `en`

As April showed this year, Easter – together with Eid and Aluth Avurudu – can be entertained in ecumenical hearts,

without breaching the undivided peace that prevailed in the hearts of most people of an island race keen to live in harmony

Sri Lanka is no stranger to hostiles with big black backpacks brimming with explosives, literally and metaphorically.

A protracted conflict between insular tribes, stoked by ethno-nationalism and egged on by war profiteers, taught us to expect sudden or strategic violence in public places and contested spaces.

The tsunami of 2004 took a sleeping island by surprise in their homes. But being used to ‘nature red in tooth and claw’, the wound was more readily assimilated than death blows delivered by neighbours in 1983.

That, and humanity’s inhumanity to humankind, combined to make the Easter Sunday bombings of April 2019 arguably the single explosive event with the farthest-reaching ramifications of our times.

### Paris – A Moveable Feast

*2024-04-19 23:02:38* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Paris-A-Moveable-Feast/4-760809) · `en`

One of the most enchanting books I have read in recent times has to be “A Moveable Feast” by the celebrated American writer Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961). The book eludes easy categorisation, although it could be broadly considered a memoire of a period of his early life, when he lived in Paris (from 1921 to 1926). Hemingway had kept notes of his Paris days, getting down to writing A Movable Feast only in the last years of his life, in 1957 to be exact.

Colombo, April 19 - The United National Party (UNP) which is led by incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe today urged the Sri Lankan people not to get deceived by National Peoples Power (NPP) and Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith.

UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara made these remarks while making a special statement in reference to to the meeting which a group of NPP members had with Cardinal Ranjith on Thursday. Range Bandara questioned as to whether Cardinal is out to vouch support for NPP the same way he did for former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019.

Some 272 people were killed in the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019. This should be remembered with condemnation. Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith had confessed after a few years that he had stood for former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa during the 2019 presidential election.

### Ottawa mass killing suspect not seeking bail, says lawyer

OTTAWA - The 19-year-old Sri Lankan national charged in the mass killing of a newcomer family in Ottawa has no plan to seek bail, his lawyer says.

Febrio De-Zoysa was arrested and charged in early March with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder, after police found the family dead in a townhouse in the suburb of Barrhaven.

He remains in custody, and his lawyer Ewan Lyttle told The Canadian Press “there is presently no plan to apply for bail.”

De-Zoysa, who was studying in Canada as an international student, is set to return to court next week where lawyers expect to set dates for a preliminary inquiry in his case.

Investigators allege the young man is responsible for the deaths of 35-year-old Darshani Ekanayake and her four children, who were between the ages of two months and seven years old, as well as a family friend.

They believe the family was attacked with a knife or “other edged weapon.”

### Oil steadies after surge following reported Israeli attack on Iran

Oil slipped on Friday after prices spiked earlier on reports that Israel had attacked Iran as market fears of a major escalation to hostilities in the Mideast appeared to ease.

After the benchmark contracts jumped more than $3 in the session, Brent futures were down 46 cents, or 0.5%, at $86.65 a barrel by 1015 GMT. The most active U.S. West Texas Intermediate contract was down 34 cents, or 0.4%, to $82.39.

Israel launched an attack on Iranian soil on Friday, sources told Reuters. Iranian media reported explosions, but an Iranian official told Reuters those were caused by air defence systems. State media said three drones over the central city of Isfahan had been shot down.

Tehran played down the incident and indicated it had no plans for retaliation - a response that appeared gauged towards averting region-wide war.

### Sri Lanka opposition leader questions visa fee hike

*2024-04-19 14:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-opposition-leader-questions-visa-fee-hike-159352/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has questioned a decision to increase tourist visa fees, claiming that the nearly 50-percent fee hike could jeopardise the island nation’s booming tourism industry.

“The tourism industry is moving forward gradually. A large number of tourists have started to visit our country. At such a time, visa fees on tourists have suddenly been increased,” Premadasa said speaking at an event.

The increase in the visa fee could bring the improving tourism sector to a standstill, he warned.

Premadasa also claimed that Russia’s Red Wings airline, which had been sending charter flights carrying up to 800 tourists a week, have stopped flying to Sri Lanka citing the visa fee hike as one reason.

“When this decision was made, did the government not do a scientific analysis?” he said.

### IMF urges Asian Central Banks to not follow Fed too closely

*2024-04-19 13:38:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/IMF-urges-Asian-Central-Banks-to-not-follow-Fed-too-closely/108-280993) · `en`

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged Asian Central Banks to not follow the Fed too closely.

IMF Director of the Asia and Pacific Department Krishna Srinivasan this week recommended Asian Central Banks to focus on domestic inflation and avoid making their positive decisions overly dependent on anticipated moves by the Federal Reserve.

“ If central banks follow the Fed too closely, they could undermine price stability in their own countries,” Srinivasan said, addressing a press briefing on Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and Pacific.

IMF staff analysis shows that U.S. interest rates have a strong and immediate impact on Asian financial conditions and exchange rates. The Fund noted that expectations about Fed easing have fluctuated in recent months, driven by factors that are unrelated to Asian price stability needs.

### India heads to the polls in world’s biggest election

Polls opened Friday for the first and largest phase of India’s marathon general election, kicking off a vote in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to win a rare third consecutive term.

About 969 million people are eligible to vote in the biggest election in human history, with polling taking place in seven phases over the next six weeks in the world’s most populous country.

The nationwide vote is considered among the most consequential in decades as Modi’s powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) aims for an outright majority and a mandate to widen its development and Hindu-nationalist policies established during its 10-year rule.

Those policies have transformed India economically and culturally, and BJP rule has been defined by a pull away from India’s secular foundation, toward Hindu majoritarianism.
