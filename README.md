Addressing a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (31), State Minister Raghavan emphasized that the government, including President Ranil Wickremesinghe, is committed to finding the best possible resolution.

He stressed that the ongoing strike is causing a direct financial loss of around Rs. 150 million and wasting 1.8 million man-hours. ‚ÄúTherefore, our government must not waste any more time.‚Äù

The state minister also explained that in order to meet the demands of the trade unions, including a salary increase, around Rs. 1.1 billion will be needed for the next six months.

Colombo, June 1 (Daily Mirror) - Those who dislike seeing progress achieved by the underprivileged have labelled entrepreneurs like Elon Musk as "economic hitmen", Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said at a meeting held in Badulla.

"Elon Musk is the number one billionaire in the world. Tesla, SpaceX, eBay, Bitcoin and Starlink Satellite are all under his leadership. He has informed the President that he will start a Tesla branch in Sri Lanka.

"Elon Musk is a powerful entrepreneur who brought technology to the world and is someone from whom we can learn about life. Despite not having a university education, his actions have made a significant impact globally," he said.

Yesterday, I saw NPP Economic Council member Sunil Hadunnetti call Elon Musk an 'economic hitman.' This is not true. Elon Musk is a man who changed the world economy and propelled it forward.

### Shortage of 5,000 buses hampers private passenger transport services

Colombo, June 1 (Daily Mirror) - A shortage of 5,000 private buses is making it difficult to provide adequate passenger transport services, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) chairman Gemunu Wijerathne claimed.

He told the Daily Mirror that 70% of buses with valid route permits are running in the country, while the remaining buses are not operating properly.

He noted that buses with valid route permits cannot provide proper services because some are undergoing major repairs or are engaged in other services.

As a result, the existing private bus fleet has been reduced to 13,000, and even these buses sometimes do not operate properly, Wijerathne said.

"As a result, people have to pay Rs. 100 for three-wheeler fares to travel a minimum distance of one kilometre. The shortage of private buses has severely impacted the transport sector, with people suffering the most when relying on public transport," he said.

### Earliest and most distant galaxy ever observed

(BBC) - The James Webb Space Telescope has smashed its own record for detecting the most distant known galaxy. Called JADES-GS-z14-0, the collection of stars was spied as it was a mere 290 million years after the Big Bang.

Put another way - if the Universe is 13.8 billion years old, it means we're observing the galaxy when the cosmos was only 2% of its current age.

Webb used its huge 6.5m-wide primary mirror and sensitive infrared instruments to make the discovery.

The telescope's previous record holder was a galaxy seen at 325 million years after the Big Bang.

Astronomers say the most interesting aspect of the latest observation is not so much the great distance involved - as amazing as that is - but rather the size and brightness of JADES-GS-z14-0.

They lost half of their side for 82 runs in 11 overs before managing to post a respectable 163/8.

All-rounders Wanindu Hasaranga (26), Angelo Mathews (32), and Shanaka (23) fired up the proceedings down the order to take them to a competitive total.

In reply, quick-fire knocks from Paul Stirling (21) and George Dockrell (17) were the bright spots in the initial stages of the Irish chase, but former skipper Shanaka swung the momentum with his medium pace bowling as Ireland were bowled out for 122 in 18.2 overs.

### Factum Perspective: Sri Lanka's existence in India's foreign policy

*2024-06-01 12:44:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185037) ¬∑ `ta`

India's engagement with Sri Lanka's National People's Power (NPP), a significant third party challenging the traditional two-party system, indicates India's strategic interest in expanding its influence in the region, particularly as a counter to China. This move comes amid concerns about Sri Lanka's domestic issues, including the treatment of the Tamil community, which has historically impacted bilateral relations. Despite geopolitical complexities, India's foreign policy has consistently prioritized maintaining a strong presence in Sri Lanka, leveraging economic cooperation and political alliances to safeguard its interests and counterbalance Chinese influence.

üü©

The latest Indian visit to Sri Lanka's Sri Lankan parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the National People's Power (NPP) party, was founded in the media in the media. There was suspicion that India would invite the leaders of other parties contesting the Sri Lankan presidential election by the end of this year.

However, on its initial call for NPP, we can speculate that foreign parties are now properly measuring the status of Sri Lankan politics.

With its success and strong third party on populism, the NPP broke the NPP system of Sri Lanka's traditional two -party system. With a glimpse of the future, India is at the forefront to mark its relations with NPP ahead of its prominent contestant, China.

Sri Lanka has a strategic position in the Indian Ocean. India is the largest business partner in Sri Lanka. Even during the latest visit to the NPP group, there were constructive discussions on economic cooperation to expand India's hegemony in the region.

The Colombo district inflation eased further to 0.9 percent in May, from 1.5 percent in April, as both food and non-food prices continued their months-long streak of declines, although the prices could firm up slightly in the coming months, due to somewhat higher prices for staples, as a result of the current weather and revving up of economic activities with the lower interest rates.

Measured on a monthly basis, the prices fell 0.6 percent in the month, adding to the 1.9 percent and 0.8 percent falls in the prices in both March and April, respectively.

After a sharp rise in prices in the nearly last two years, the prices came back to better balance from 2023 onwards, due to the easing of global energy prices and other commodities prices.

Meanwhile, the availability of foreign currency in the country, due to the normalising tourism and remittances, also helped the prices to come back to the acceptable level, as the imported goods could be made in sufficient supply.

It is immensely suspicious that the results have been suspended even after all sides have made it clear to all sides.

It is very clear that this is the manifestation of the ethnic discrimination of those who cannot tolerate the development of Zahira College.

This can be understood by the mood of the exam supervisor who brought this issue to be resolved in the exam hall.

It is not healthy that we speak the same language. Those who are concerned about the sad state of today's sad state of children and children must understand.
