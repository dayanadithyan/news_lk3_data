### Getting back to that peaceful Easter Sunday - EDITORIAL

*2024-03-29 00:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Getting-back-to-that-peaceful-Easter-Sunday-EDITORIAL/172-279813) · `en`

Easter Sunday is an important day in the Sri Lankan calendar as this day has become the talking point as never before due to the  2019 ‘Easter Sunday bombings’.

Christians would never compare man’s sufferings with the agony Jesus went through on the cross. According to Rev. Frs. Sanjeewa Mendis and Sriyananda Fernando-who spoke on the meaning and message of Easter on ITN’s Pini Viyana programme on March 28-the message conveyed by the Son of God is to spread ‘love’ even during the toughest of times.

Sri Lankan Christians also conveyed a similar and strong message when their kith and kin were brutally blown to pieces inside three churches chose to stay calm and collected as a community. They had forgiven the assailants, but demanded justice for the affected families. This calmness was preserved largely due to the instructions issued by the head of the Catholic Church, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith.

### Gaza genocide, ISIS and the tailpiece of Moscow terror

*2024-03-29 00:01:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Gaza-genocide-ISIS-and-the-tailpiece-of-Moscow-terror/172-279812) · `en`

An injured man is helped outside Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City: The United Nations says the Gaza Strip’s health system is collapsing. AFP

The Moscow terror attack, conveniently claimed by the so-called Islamic State, a.k.a. ISIS, and the diplomatic circus at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday in passing a Gaza ceasefire resolution may appear disconnected at first glance. But there is enough interconnection between the two tragedies.

First, let’s discuss the ISIS connection. The Friday evening terror attack at the Crocus City Hall on the outskirts of Moscow has revealed the mercenary character of ISIS. Questions have always lingered about the Islamic credentials of ISIS since its birth from the ashes of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in 2011.

### Sri Lanka calls for debt-restructuring proposals from dealer managers

*2024-03-28 22:23:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98273/sri-lanka-calls-for-debt-restructuring-proposals-from-dealer-managers) · `en`

(Reuters) - Sri Lanka has called for proposals from dealer managers to support its restructuring of some $12 billion of international bonds, the Finance Ministry said on Thursday, in a fresh sign that the island nation is closing in on finalizing its debt rework.

Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt in May 2022 as the economy sank into its deepest financial crisis in decades due to a severe shortfall of dollars. The government was expected to start formal restructuring talks with bondholders this week.

“In the context of the restructuring of its International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), the Government of Sri Lanka is working towards launching an invitation to exchange its existing ISBs denominated in United States Dollars for new ISBs in the same currency,” the notice posted on the Finance Ministry’s website said.

### Fallen ’Crypto King’ Sam Bankman-Fried gets for 25 years for fraud

*2024-03-28 22:13:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Fallen-Crypto-King-Sam-Bankman-Fried-gets-for-25-years-for-fraud/108-279790) · `en`

Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and investors of his now-bankrupt firm.

The ruling cements the downfall of the former billionaire, who emerged as a high profile champion of crypto before his firm's dramatic collapse in 2022.

The 32-year-old was later found to have stolen billions from customers of the exchange ahead of its implosion.

But he was convicted by a New York jury in November on charges including multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

During the sentencing hearing on Thursday, Judge Lewis Kaplan provided a harsh assessment, saying it was clear Bankman-Fried was motivated by a drive to be politically influential.

Despite "protestations of sorrow" about customer losses, Judge Kaplan said, Bankman-Friend had expressed "never a word of remorse for the commission of terrible crimes".

Colombo, March 28 (Daily Mirror)- The special commodity levy on rice was reduced not to allow import of rice but to clear a stock of rice currently stuck with the Customs, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said today.

He told reporters that a stock of Keeri Samba rice was imported in January to control the escalating prices and shortage in the market and that a part of that imported stock of rice was stuck with the Customs due to a delay in receiving the stock.

He said the special commodity levy on rice was reduced from Rs. 65 to Rs. 1 for a period of one week to facilitate the importers to get that rice stock cleared from the Customs.

"This move will not lead to import of new rice stocks as the reduction will be effective only for a week. The importers must clear the rice stock stuck with the Customs within a week," he said.

Fernando had previously said that a variety called Rose Onion will be imported instead of big onions due to rising onion prices.

Sri Lanka grows onions under import tax protection and domestic production is seasonal and imports supplement demand.
