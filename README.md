### அன்பான இலங்கையின் அனைத்து மரியாதைக்குரிய குடிமக்களுக்கும்...

*2024-03-05 09:13:35* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/அன்பான-இலங்கையின்-அனைத்து-மரியாதைக்குரிய-குடிமக்களுக்கும்/175-334213) · `ta`

கலாநிதி நந்தலால் வீரசிங்கவிற்கும் திரு.ஜெயந்த கோவில்கொடகேவிற்கும் இடையில் இடம்பெற்ற உரையாடலில் பேசப்படாத சில விடயங்களை உரிய மரியாதையுடன் எழுப்ப விரும்புகின்றோம்.

மத்திய வங்கி அதிகாரிகள் பொருளாதாரத்தை விட பரந்த புரிதலைக் கொண்டிருக்க வேண்டும். அவர்களின் கல்வியானது சமூகவியல், அமைதி மற்றும் மோதல் ஆய்வுகள் மற்றும் அவர்களின் முடிவுகளின் சமூக தாக்கங்களை நன்கு புரிந்துகொள்ள மனித நடத்தை போன்ற சமூக அறிவியலை உள்ளடக்கியதாக இருக்க வேண்டும்.

தற்போதைய முடிவெடுக்கும் செயல்முறை, இந்த பரந்த புரிதல் இல்லாததால், சமூக அமைதியின்மையை நிலைநிறுத்தும் அபாயம் உள்ளது. சமூக ஊடகங்கள் மூலம் வெளிச்சத்திற்குக் கொண்டுவரப்பட்ட இந்த சமீபத்திய சம்பவம் இதனை எடுத்துக்காட்டுகிறது.

கொள்கை வகுப்பாளர்களை ஆதரிக்கும் ஒரு தொழில்முறை அமைப்பாக கருதப்படும் இலங்கை மத்திய வங்கி, துரதிஷ்டவசமாக ஏனைய சமூக அபிவிருத்தி குறிகாட்டிகளை பாதிக்கும் வகையில் தற்போதைய பொருளாதார நிலைமைக்கு பங்களித்துள்ளது.

### France becomes only country to explicitly guarantee abortion as constitutional right

*2024-03-05 09:04:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97734/france-becomes-only-country-to-explicitly-guarantee-abortion-as-constitutional-right) · `en`

French lawmakers on Monday overwhelmingly approved a bill to enshrine abortion rights in France’s constitution, making it the only country to explicitly guarantee a woman’s right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy.

The historic move was proposed by President Emmanuel Macron as a way to prevent the kind of rollback of abortion rights seen in the United States in recent years, and the vote during a special joint session of France’s parliament drew a long-standing ovation among lawmakers.

The measure was approved in a 780-72 vote in the Palace of Versailles. Abortion enjoys wide support in France across most of the political spectrum, and has been legal since 1975.

Many female legislators in the hall smiled broadly as they cheered. While a small group of protesters stood outside the joint session, there were jubilant scenes of celebrations all over France as women’s rights activists hailed the measure promised by Macron within hours of the Dobbs ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressing a conference of over 300 members from inter-religious committees from across the country summed up his plan for national reconciliation in less than 20 minutes. The president was clear in his articulation. He spoke with no notes. There were no superfluities in his speech. He noted how racism and bigotry have become convenient tools for politicians to wield power and for religious leaders to maintain their authority. He pointed to lessons learned from prolonged use of these divisive tactics, which ultimately led the country into a devastating conflict. He took two questions from the audience and before the organisers of the conference could even thank him on stage he left the podium for his next meeting.

### Gaza war, Red Sea crisis and sea of issues for merchants

Since the Houthis insist that they will not cease attacking ships in the Red Sea unless a ceasefire is enforced in Gaza, the Red Sea crisis will end only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza.

The Red Sea crisis, which is having a great impact on international trade, is unlikely to end anytime soon despite the US-led naval and air forces’ hitting Houthi targets in Yemen.

Since the Houthis insist that they will not cease attacking ships in the Red Sea unless a ceasefire is enforced in Gaza, the Red Sea crisis will end only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza. And that appears to be a far cry.

Neither the Israelis nor Hamas is willing to give in. Israel will not stop its brutal offensive until Hamas releases the 100 hostages it still holds, and Hamas will not release them so long as there is no ceasefire in Gaza.

In January 2016, in a rare show of accountability, the General Secretary of the Government and Provincial Council Public Service Trade Union Federation, Ajith. K. Thilakarathne had taken up an issue of time squandered by public sector employees with the then President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. No trade union leader had dared before to complain against his own members.

In a letter addressed to both the leaders, Thilakarathne had pointed out that 60 percent of the 1.5 million public servants (both under the central government and provincial councils) were engaged in browsing the Internet, Face Book and other entertainment sites using the office computers and their own smart phones for over two hours of their daily eight-hour duty.

Exemplary, and effective leadership is grounded, amongst others, in an insatiable desire to do things differently

Whilst acknowledging the importance of policies, procedures, and processes in maintaining discipline and order in an organisation, I also believe that it must have, parallelly, a deliberately structured platform, vehicle, or mechanism to arouse the curiosity, harness new ideas and ignite the innovation DNA of its leaders and employees. A haven for those individuals who, routinely, question existing norms and push for incremental improvement and innovative solutions. History shows that organisations have benefitted from these challengers

We have all had the experience of a dreary boss who, with his/her stifling, and controlling behaviour, routinely shot down our, and our team’s, progressive ideas in an environment where all that mattered to the boss was to get the job done by the stipulated timeline and in line with the prevailing rules and procedure.

During the event, a number of experts from Pharmaceris shared their knowledge, expertise and treatment methodologies available in Sri Lanka for the treatment of Alopecia. Alopecia, commonly known as loss of hair, is a growing issue among middle-aged and older Sri Lankans. Research has shown that loss of hair has a negative impact on a person’s mental and emotional health as they may struggle with feelings of unattractiveness and be self conscious in social situations or avoid them altogether. It could cause issues of self esteem and may even lead to depression at times, thereby greatly disrupting the individual’s way of life.

### Policymakers and academics have long rejected the quantity theory of money

*2024-03-04 23:04:42* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Policymakers-and-academics-have-long-rejected-the-quantity-theory-of-money/4-759152) · `en`

Many modern quantity theorists accept that central banks do not target and control the cash base, but rather set interest rates leaving the market to determine the quantity of cash put into the system. They argue, however, that in setting interest rates central banks can, and do, target the money stock with a view to controlling inflation. Critics of the modern quantity theory of money have long argued that the money stock depends on loans, i.e., when a commercial bank makes a loan they debit the account of the entity they are lending to, and when commercial banks need cash to meet reserve requirements the central bank has to accommodate this demand

The modern quantity theory of money is basically an explanation of inflation (and the external balance) by an increase in the quantity of money held by the public, the ‘money stock’ that is due to an increase in the cash injected into the system by the central bank of a country (an increase in the ‘cash base’ of the system).

### Tax reform roadblocks: Leakages and systematic issues

Reforms lack the necessary legitimacy to garner widespread support and effectively address the challenges at hand

When unveiling the tax reform leakages and systematic issues, it is evident that the journey towards meaningful tax reform is far from over. When leakages and systematic issues persist within a taxation system, the legitimacy of any proposed reforms becomes questionable. Such deficiencies undermine the fundamental principles of fairness, transparency, and equity that should underscore any tax system. When taxpayers witness leakages and systematic flaws, they lose faith in the system’s ability to uphold their interests fairly

### Trump wins Colorado ballot disqualification case at US Supreme Court

The U.S. Supreme Court handed Donald Trump a major victory on Monday, barring states from disqualifying candidates for federal office under a constitutional provision involving insurrection and reversing Colorado’s exclusion of him from its ballot.

The justices unanimously overturned a Dec. 19 decision by Colorado’s top court to kick the former president off the state’s Tuesday Republican primary ballot after finding that the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment disqualified him from again holding public office. The Colorado court had found that Trump took part in an insurrection for inciting and supporting the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.

But four of the nine justices, including the court’s three liberal members, faulted the rest of the court for announcing rules limiting how the constitutional provision may be enforced in the future.

### Abolishing The Executive Presidency – Is Time Running Out?

Earlier this week, the President’s Media Division issued a statement to the effect that the next presidential election will be held on schedule. What was the need for that statement? In terms of the Constitution, the President’s term of office ends not later than 18th November 2024. As far as I am aware, no member of Parliament has given any indication that he or she intends to introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution to extend the term of office of the President, as required by article 83 of the Constitution. Such a Bill, if passed with a two-third majority, will also need to be approved by the people at a referendum. In the absence of any such move, what was the need for the President’s Media Division to assert the obvious. Was it to stifle the movement for restoring the parliamentary executive that now appears to be gathering wide public support?

A Thai court on Monday acquitted former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, now living in exile, on charges of mishandling funds for a government project in 2013, the latest legal victory for the powerful family of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra.

The action comes shortly after Thaksin, Yingluck’s brother, was released on parole for corruption-related offenses. Last year, he returned home after more than a decade of self-imposed exile, and was detained in a hospital for six months before being granted clemency because of his age and ill health.

Thaksin’s release, after almost two decades of antipathy between his populist political machine and Thailand’s conservative royalist ruling class, raised speculation that Yingluck also might be returning soon.

Colombo High Court Judge Navaratne Marasinghe delivered the verdict today (04) following a trial that lasted over 18 years.
