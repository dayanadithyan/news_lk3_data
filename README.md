Colombo, Feb 06 -  Amidst questions raised over NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake's visit to India for discussions, SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa has welcomed Dissanayake's Indian visit, signaling a potential shift in the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna's (JVP) stance on Indian investments which the JVP had for years criticized and neglected.

Rajapaksa emphasized the importance of fostering unity and collective efforts in welcoming foreign investments to bolster Sri Lanka's development agenda.

Rajapaksa's remarks highlighted historical contexts, drawing attention to past JVP conflicts surrounding development projects like the Sampur power plant.

He further said that the Sampur Power Project was an example of the loss faced by the country as a result of the JVP’s anti-India policies.

“However, the JVP has now reached a different view and has engaged in a tour to India, which is a good thing,” he said.

The Sri Lankan Speaker’s Office has deemed recent reports surrounding the much-disputed Online Safety Bill as ‘ill-informed and baseless’, while rejecting claims that the Bill was passed in violation of the Supreme Court’s determination.

Issuing a clarification to the public in response to allegations regarding the passing of the Bill, the Speaker’s Office highlighted that due to the legislative process of the Parliament involving both, the Attorney General’s Department and the Legal Draftsman’s Department, it is unlikely that a Bill would be passed in violation of the determination of the Supreme Court.

“There is no opportunity to act in a manner that is not in accordance with a Supreme Court determination regarding a Bill or in violation of the Constitution”, the statement read in this regard.

One person died and two assailants were shot dead in an attack on a courthouse in Istanbul on Tuesday, Turkish officials said.

The alleged attackers, a man and woman, were killed during an “attempt to attack” a security checkpoint at the Caglayan courthouse at 11:46 a.m. (0846 GMT), Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya posted on social media.

He said six people were wounded, including three police officers. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later said one of the civilians died.

Caglayan, which is also known as the Istanbul Justice Palace, is a huge court complex in the Kagithane district on the city’s European side. Heavily guarded and with multiple entrances, it was Europe’s largest courthouse at the time of its opening in 2011.

Camera footage published by Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency showed the assailants being gunned down on the building’s forecourt. They appeared to shoot back at police before they were killed.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s digital marketing industry professionals say they fear a decline in social media marketing channels after the online safety law was passed.

“Content developers, planners, the entire ecosystem will be impacted. Social media channels need to be active, but now people will restrict their activities – efficiency will be limited,” Managing Director of Ogilvy, Lalith Sumanasiri said.

The online safety law may cause social media users to self-censor and curb their social media usage, he said speaking at a panel discussion on the law and its impact on the digital marketing industry, on Thursday (1).

According to Sumanasiri, 14.5 million Sri Lankans have internet access and 50 percent of them use social media. Therefore, 20 percent of their promotional budget is on digital marketing.

He added that if the revenue social media giants gain from Sri Lanka is insignificant, they may consider leaving the country instead of complying with the provisions of the online safety act.
