*2024-05-27 16:00:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/197073) · `si`

ඉන්දීය ජනතාව අතර ක්‍රිකට් මෙන්ම සුපිරි නළු ෂාරුක් ඛාන් ද අතිශය ජනප්‍රිය චරිතයකි.

වසර 10කට පසුව ෂාරුක් හිමිකාරීත්වය දරන කොල්කටා කණ්ඩායම IPL තරගාවලිය ජයගැනීමත් සමග එරට සමාජ මාධ්‍ය තුළ යළිත් කොල්කටා කණ්ඩායම මෙන්ම සුපිරි නළු ෂාරුක් ඛාන් ගැනත් දැඩි කතාබහක් ඇතිවී තිබේ.

ඒ සුපිරි නළු ෂාරුක් ද ක්‍රිකට්වලට දක්වන සුවිශේෂී ඇල්ම හේතුවෙනි.

පසුගියදිනවල විජලන තත්ත්වයක් හේතුවෙන් ඇතිවූ අසනීප තත්ත්වයක් සඳහා රෝහල්ගතකර සිටියද ක්‍රිකට්වලට ඇති ඔහුගේ ඇල්ම හේතුවෙන්ම ෂාරුක් IPL තරගාවලියේ තරග නැරඹීමට අමතක කර නොතිබුණි.

මේ සුවිශේෂී ජයග්‍රහණය ලබන මොහොතේ ෂාරුක් ඛාන් ද පිටියේ නරඹන්නෙක් ලෙස එක්ව සිටීම ක්‍රීඩාලෝලීන්ට වෙනස් වූ ආශ්වාදයක් ගෙනදීමට සමත්විය.

එසේම ජයග්‍රහණයෙන් අනතුරුව ඔහුට මෙන්ම කොල්කටා කණ්ඩායමට ආදරය කරන රසික රසිකාවියන්ට ගෞරවය පිරිනැමීමට ෂාරුක් ද අමතක නොකිරීම විශේෂත්වයකි.

ඔහු සිය පවුලේ සාමාජිකයින් සමග ක්‍රීඩාංගණය වටා යමින් ප්‍රේක්ෂකයින්ට ආචාර කළ අයුරු මෙන්ම ජය සැමරීමට ක්‍රීඩකයින් හා එක්වූ අයුරු කැමරා කාචයේ සටහන්ව තිබූ අයුරු පහතින්.

### If the president comes to an end to solve the problems of the minority people - Parliamentarian Govindan Karunagaram is ready to negotiate with him

*2024-05-27 14:02:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184599) · `ta`

Govindan Karunagaram, a Batticaloa district parliamentarian, expressed readiness to negotiate with the president for economic recovery, emphasizing consideration for minority issues. He spoke at the 25th Anniversary Celebration of the Vinayaka Sports Club, highlighting the need for addressing minority problems. The People's Alliance (PA) faces challenges in nominating a presidential candidate due to past political dynamics, but potential opportunities exist for candidates supporting the PA, especially with the possibility of multiple contestants in the upcoming presidential election. This could allow any candidate to secure over 50% of the Sinhalese vote, potentially uniting Tamil Muslims and hill country people as a formidable force.

🟩

Batticaloa district parliamentarian Govindan Karunagaram (Jana) said that if the country is to be economically recovered, we are ready to talk to them if the president will consider the minority people and examine their problems.

The 25th Anniversary Celebration of the Vinayaka Sports Club of Batticaloa was held on Sunday evening (26) evening. He was speaking to the media after attending the event.

The PA is not in a position to field a presidential candidate at present. The people of this country are not prepared to support the PA and make their candidate win. This is because former President Gotabhaya Rajapakse, who made 69 lakhs of votes, chased him away in the last two years of the last period of 2019.. That situation is still from the Sinhalese.

ECONOMYNEXT — The ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuan (SLPP) wants parliamentary elections first to prevent a wipe-out, main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Mujibur Rahuman said.

The MP claimed that the SLPP has strategically considered the possibility that President Ranil Wickremesinghe will not win the presidential election scheduled for this year, which is why they are in a hurry to hold the parliamentary polls before.

“But if it’s held after the presidential election, they will be wiped out. They have understood this politically. That’s why they want the parliamentary elections first, so they can get at least 25 seats,” Rahuman said speaking to reporters.

However, government spokesmen continue to be emphatic that a presidential election will be held first. Wickremesinghe himself had said on several occasions, as recently as this week, that parliamentary elections will be held after.

### Gotabaya inherited a collapsed govt, not the strong one built by Mahinda, claims Namal

*2024-05-27 11:51:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99461/gotabaya-inherited-a-collapsed-govt-not-the-strong-one-built-by-mahinda-claims-namal) · `en`

SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa has claimed that a serious conspiracy was underway to overthrow the government established by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

He stated that this conspiracy involved several forces even within the government itself.

“The conspiracy was internal, with international forces and terror groups also attempting to destabilize the government. As a result, the ‘Yahapalana’ (good governance) government was formed. Gotabaya Rajapaksa inherited a collapsed government, not the strong one built by Mahinda Rajapaksa,” he added.

He made these comments while addressing the inaugural constituency conference of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) held in Thalawa on Sunday (26), under the patronage of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Despite attending the event, Mahinda Rajapaksa did not address the gathering during the conference.

### SLFP faction led by ex-President Maithripala relocates operations

In light of the current political situation, the faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by former President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to carry out the future activities of the party from a new location instead of the party headquarters.

Reportedly, this new location in Colombo will replace the SLFP headquarters on Darley Road, Colombo 10, for future political activities.

The party’s internal sources said that ongoing internal conflicts and court orders have made it impractical to convene constituency and district organizers of the party at a permanent location.

Therefore, the faction led by former President Sirisena has deemed it more appropriate to operate from a different location. The new political center will serve as a venue to convene district and constituency organizers from across the island to discuss upcoming political matters, as per sources.
