### Elon Musk sues ChatGPT-maker OpenAI over Microsoft links

*2024-03-02 03:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/elon-musk-sues-chatgpt-maker-openai-over-microsoft-links/) · `en`

Elon Musk is suing OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, arguing it has breached the principles he agreed to when he helped found it in 2015.

The lawsuit – which has also been filed against OpenAI boss Sam Altman – says the firm has departed from its original non-profit, open source mission.

It says instead of trying to “benefit humanity” – as it was set up to do – it is focusing on “maximising profits” for major investor Microsoft.

The firm was created with the intention of building what’s known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) – AI that can perform any task a human being is capable of.

It was also set up as a not-for-profit company, meaning it would not aim to make money.

The lawsuit, which has been filed in San Francisco, states it was under these conditions, that Mr Musk agreed to found OpenAI, along with Mr Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman. He left three years later.

Ronnie’s  first attempt in electoral politics was in the historic Wellassa region of the Uva province.

History was made when Ronnie de Mel presented the new United National Party (UNP) Government’s budget in November 1977

Ronnie sat for the Ceylon Civil Service (CCS) exam and joined the CCS in 1948. He served in different capacities at the Puttalam, Vavuniya and Matara Kachcheris

The new Devinuwara MP with his leftist ideology and classical oratory was an instant hit. His parliamentary speeches were very popular

The ascension of Junius Richard Jayewardene to the premier seat of political power in 1977 paved the way for a drastic transformation of Sri Lanka’s politico-economic landscape and environment.

J.R. Jayewardene known popularly as “JR” ushered in political, economic, and electoral changes that utterly changed Sri Lanka.  In the words of William Butler Yeats “All changed, changed utterly.”

### Water for Peace and Harmony

*2024-03-02 02:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Water-for-Peace-and-Harmony/172-278085) · `en`

Most of us take water for granted. However, clean drinking water is essential for human life, and in these days of high temperature reaching 94°F, many people experience dehydration, and we need to drink about six litres of water a day.

Next month, the United Nations marks World Water Day, and the theme is ‘water for peace’. In a statement, the UN says, water can create peace or spark conflict. When water is scarce or polluted, or when people have unequal or no access, tensions can rise among communities and countries. More than 3 billion people worldwide depend on water that crosses national borders. Yet, only 24 countries have cooperation agreements for all their shared water.

As impacts of climate change increase and populations grow, there is an urgent need, within and among countries, to unite around protecting and conserving our most precious resource.

Siyambalapitiya said to avail this tax reduction, the importers must obtain prior permission from the Religious Affairs Ministry Secretary. “The requirement will ensure the tax relief is targeted specifically towards goods intended for Ramadan observances,” he stressed.

### Minister Douglas Devananda notes

Minister Douglas Devananda pointed out that the activities of the private transport servants that are inconvenienced by the people are unpleasant and that he has never wanted the political positions of selfish politics with the struggles.

The Minister stressed the meeting on Thursday (29) at the Governor's Office to resolve the struggle carried out by the private transport service in the Northern Province.

There will be no mistakes in democratically carrying out the struggles that the private transport service will express their demands. That's their basic rights even. But the actions of the people can not be accepted for their actions that disrupt the public transport service and cause people to disrupt people.

This is a completely disgusting act. At the same time, he emphasized that it is necessary to express their demands so that such people are uncomfortable.

Never in the history of independent Sri Lanka (SL) had its economic ties with neighbouring India grown so strategic and deep as during Prime Minister Modi’s decade from 2014 to the present. During that decade, SL had seen seven prime ministers and four presidents of whom a couple had been re-elected or appointed to those positions more than once. But what made Indo-Lanka economic connections so strategic and deep is the island’s rapid descent into financial bankruptcy and economic chaos in 2021 because of systemic mismanagement over several decades.

Even then and historically, although India’s economy is a giant in comparison to that of tiny SL, in terms of GDP per capita and measures of economic development and welfare the island had an enviable record in comparison to her neighbour. In other words, SL did not have the necessity to beg for economic assistance from India as long as the doors of trade and commerce were kept open.

Israeli missile strikes have caused widespread destruction in Gaza – Pic credit: World Health Organization (WHO)

UNITED NATIONS (IPS): The two devastating military conflicts—Russia vs. Ukraine and Israel vs. Hamas—have exposed once again the stark reality that the United Nations, created 79 years ago to maintain international peace and security, has failed in its political mission – while its credibility is at stake.

Russia is accused of violating the UN charter by invading a sovereign nation state and causing hundreds and thousands of deaths over two years — with no signs of a peaceful settlement.

The accusations against Israel include war crimes, genocide, ethnic cleansing and the disproportionate killings of over 30,000 civilians, mostly women and children in Gaza—in retaliation for 1,200 killings by Hamas last October.

Colombo, March 01 (Daily Mirror) - The best option to determine whether the course of action followed by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana in appointing Deshabandu Tennakoon as the IGP is to seek an interpretation from the Supreme Court, Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today.

Minister Rajapaksa came out with this remark, speaking to journalists after the inauguration of a road development project in Pannipitiya, Colombo. “It is best that Supreme Court gives an interpretation of the action taken by the Speaker,” he said.

### CDASL raises concerns over proposed protectionist measures in Sri Lanka’s tile industry

The Condominium Developers Association of Sri Lanka (CDASL) is deeply concerned about recent proposals advocating for protectionist measures within the tile industry. Furthermore, such proposals, if implemented without careful consideration, could have far-reaching consequences for both industry stakeholders and the general public.

At the heart of the issue lies the lack of substantiated evidence supporting claims of “dumping”. Without concrete proof, such allegations raise suspicions regarding the motives behind them and the potential for unintended consequences. Moreover, the proposed measures overlook the detrimental effects of monopolistic practices, which have long plagued the housing, construction, and condominium industries in Sri Lanka.

### Sri Lanka to cut Rs200 import tax on dates for Ramazan

*2024-03-01 16:44:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-cut-rs200-import-tax-on-dates-for-ramazan-152720/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will cut a 200 rupees a kilogram tax on imported dates to one rupee in the next one or two days, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

The so-called special commodity levy will be for the Ramazan period, he said in a statement.

Sri Lanka usually cuts or raise import duties without prior warning through mid-night gazette leading to corruption, and also undermining parliamentary control of public finances, critics have said.

The government announced an action plan to reduce corruption and undertook to ‘eliminate or restrict’ tax cuts by minister’s as part of efforts to improve governance.

Dates are an important part of the food of Sri Lanka’s Muslim community who break fast during the Ramazan period.

Dried dates are imported to Sri Lanka from the Middle East to make cake and other sweets also during the rest of the year.

Standard quality dried dates now retail for a little under 1000 rupees a kilogram.

ECONOMYNEXT — Sri Lanka’s revolutionaries, whose children study at international schools, oppose education reforms and scuttle any attempt at reforms by taking to the streets, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said.

“There is one group that is opposed to education reforms. These are revolutionaries who recently became ‘modern’. They say free education need not be modernised. They say Sri Lanka’s stagnating education must continue the way it is,” Premadasa said speaking at an event.

“Every time something new is being attempted, what do they do? They take to the streets. They go on paada yatras and hold protests.

“But did you know? The children of these big revolutionaries study at international schools,” the leader of the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) said.

Acknowledging that disparity in education is a real problem in Sri Lanka, Premadasa said that measures must be taken to address it.

“An SJB government will be dedicated to achieving that change,” he said.
