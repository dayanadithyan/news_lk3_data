тАЬAs per the powers granted by the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the Election Commission is required to hold the Presidential election in 2024. An official announcement for the election must be issued as soon as the ECSL is empowered to call for elections to ensure a fair process,тАЭ Jayasuriya said yesterday.

Jayasuriya said the request is being made as Sri Lanka approaches the time to elect a President, noting that contradictory statements and unethical proposals are being disseminated in society.

тАЬDue to such conflicting opinions and unnecessary debates, the countryтАЩs economy may face challenges. Different attitudes arising between international commercial and financial institutions could create conditions harmful to the countryтАЩs well-being,тАЭ he said.

The payments arrears for fuel imports were accumulated over several years due to various economic challenges including the COVID-19 pandemicтАЩs severe impact on the economy, European sanctions imposed since 2011, the collapse of the tourism industry following the Easter attacks, and the overall economic downturn, which led to a shortage of dollars hindering the payment process, the statement added.
