*2024-03-27 02:07:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179786) · `ta`

மக்கள் மத்தியில் ஐக்கிய மக்கள் சக்தியும்,மக்கள் விடுதலை முன்னணியும் முன்னிலையில் உள்ளன.ஆகவே பொதுஜன பெரமுனவில் இருந்து விலகிச் சென்றவர்களை மீண்டும் இணைத்துக் கொள்வது அத்தியாவசியமானது என்பதை மஹிந்த ராஜபக்ஷவிடம் பலமுறை வலியுறுத்தியுள்ளேன் என ஆளும் தரப்பின் பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் எஸ்.பி திஸாநாயக்க தெரிவித்தார்.

முன்னாள் ஜனாதிபதி கோட்டபய ராஜபக்ஷ அரசியல் ரீதியில் தோல்வி அடைந்து முழு நாட்டையும் பழிகொடுத்தார் என்பதை ஏற்றுக்கொள்ள வேண்டும்.அப்போதைய அரசாங்கத்தை பலவீனப்படுத்த தேசிய மற்றும் சர்வதேச மட்டத்தில் சூழ்ச்சிகள் முன்னெடுக்கப்பட்ட போது அரச தலைவர் என்ற அடிப்படையில் அதனை கோட்டபய ராஜபக்ஷ வெற்றிக் கொள்ளவில்லை.

தற்போதைய அரசியல் நிலையில் ஐக்கிய மக்கள் சக்தியும்,மக்கள் விடுதலை முன்னணியும் முன்னிலையில் உள்ளன.மக்கள் விடுதலை முன்னணிக்கு மக்கள் மத்தியில் செல்வாக்கு அதிகரித்துள்ளது என்பதை ஏற்றுக்கொள்ள வேண்டும்.இருப்பினும் இந்த செல்வாக்கு ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலில் வெற்றிப் பெறும் அளவுக்கு உயர்வடையாது.

When one respects the other person’s dream, both the employee and the employer align to one chord and that harmony creates passion and motivation in the working environment

No company could ever drive to its full capacity unless the corporate dream and the personal dream of the employee partners together. One of the main reasons for employee turnover, known as churn rate, is because the employees realise that they cannot achieve their dreams with the company they are working for

This series of articles on “Transformational Leadership Mindset” is penned by me, Dr. Philip Nehri based on the combined analytical thinking of both me and Gina Vangelli, my Australian business partner.

Gina is an Australian entrepreneur who is also the author of the book “The Belief Factor”. She won a world championship in Karate for Australia, and she also became the Australian Apprentice of the Year.

In 1989 Kumar Gunaratnam operating under the nom de guerre “Gemunu” led the JVP/DJV against the Indian army in the Trincomalee District. Under his command, the DJV-JVP in Trinco accomplished a few military strikes against the Indian Army but these incidents did not gain much publicity due to the concerted efforts of the Sri Lankan and Indian authorities to deliberately suppress information. They did not want the JVP to gain publicity and political credit through these operations. Besides most incidents of that nature in Trincomalee were believed to have been committed by the Tigers then. Although the mass media of the day have not publicised this phase, there is some important material available in books, monographs and research papers

The Commissioner of Elections made it clear to all Lankans that the presidential elections would be held in a timely manner in keeping with Constitutional requirements.

To him we owe a vote of thanks. Many a citizen had begun to doubt whether elections -presidential or general elections- would be held at any time in the near future, given the number of elections postponed via sleight of hand over the years.

Even as we pen these lines, our country is going through one of the hottest periods weather-wise. As though this were not bad enough, political party leaders and their followers are also breathing fire at their opponents, adding to the heat.

We continue witnessing intra-party squabbles in the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and dirty linen being washed in public. The ‘National People’s Power is gaining in popularity. But in the past it has not been able to turn this into actual votes.

Speaking to Bloomberg Markets Asia on Monday (March 25), Managing Director of MCM Partners Jahnavi Bhagwati explained as to why she sees a turnaround for private equity deals in 2024 as opposed to a sluggish 2023.

According to her, countries like India and Sri Lanka, which is a turnaround story, are going to present opportunities in the private space this year after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates in March, ending the country’s historic era of negative interest rates in a move that marked a historic shift in monetary policy.

Bhagwati mentioned that the stock markets in the region are already seeing a pickup as inflation has been curbed, adding that investment activity will spur when rate cuts kick in.
