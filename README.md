Colombo, May 07 (Daily Mirror) -¬† The decision to annul the Surgery Long and Short Cases components of the ERPM Part B Examination, conducted at the Examinations Centre of the Eastern University in Batticaloa, has ignited a storm of controversy as the members of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) have not been informed of the incident.

Colombo, May 7 (Daily Mirror) - Venerable Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera cautioned parliamentarians against returning to their villages to seek votes if they support the same-sex marriage bill in parliament.

He urged them to refrain from political engagement if they vote for the bill and emphasized that Sinhala Buddhist national organizations, including the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress, will oppose its legalization.

Addressing the media, the Thera told the MPs not to visit them to receive blessings for their election campaigns.

"This bill must not be pass in parliament. If, by any chance it does, it will severely impact Sri Lankan culture and the family structure of the country. Once enacted, legalizing same-sex marriages will lead to acceptance, and legal repercussions will be taken against those who oppose them and their actions," the Thera said.

### Do not tell the companies to leave the gardens because of the salary - Mano Ganesan

*2024-05-07 16:43:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/182906) ¬∑ `ta`

Mano Ganesan advises against companies taking over gardens due to unpaid salaries, emphasizing alternative actions by the government and the Minister of Labor. He warns against dividing supporters by handing over gardens to companies, advocating for land rights and making people small plantation entrepreneurs. He references Sajith Premadasa's 2019 election manifesto, which aimed to turn plantation workers into small estate owners, ensuring their livelihoods and protecting gardens until a government solution is found.

üü©

If President Ranil Wickremesinghe has not been able to pay the salary announced on the May Day platform, he must take an alternative action as the head of state.. The Minister of Labor, who declared the Gazette, should take action. The government in the state should stop the sports of friends in the state, the fireworks exploding and the pongal rice.. If we ask for our cooperation in this regard, we will consider it positively.

But I warmly tell the mountain friends in the state not to present the slogan, "Gardens should be handed over to the government and go to the companies". If the company goes to the company and the government takes responsibility for the land, they will be divided to their supporters. This is how the people of the government and the government of the government today have been issued without listening and our people who lived there are in the middle of the country.

MOSCOW, May 7 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin was sworn in for a new six-year term on Tuesday at a Kremlin ceremony that was boycotted by the United States and a number of other Western countries due to Russia's war in Ukraine.

Putin, in power as president or prime minister since 1999, begins his new mandate more than two years after he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, where Russian forces have regained the initiative after a series of reversals and are seeking to advance further in the east.

At 71, Putin dominates the domestic political landscape. On the international stage, he is locked in a confrontation with Western countries he accuses of using Ukraine as a vehicle to try to defeat and dismember Russia.

"For Russia, this is the continuation of our path, this is stability ‚Äì you can ask any citizen on the street," Sergei Chemezov, a close Putin ally, told Reuters before the ceremony.
