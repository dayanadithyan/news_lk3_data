COLOMBO (News 1st); The Alliance of Health Trade Unions has issued a stark ultimatum to the Sri Lankan health authorities, warning of a nationwide strike set to begin tomorrow morning unless their demands are addressed.

The strike, involving members of 72 healthcare professions, is a culmination of months of frustration over unresolved issues, including the controversial allowance disparity between doctors and other healthcare workers.

Speaking on behalf of the AHTU, its joint-convener Ravi Kumudesh stressed the urgency of the situation.

"The health authorities still have a chance to find solutions to the professional problems we face, particularly the allowance issue," he said. "But if proper intervention is not taken today, our members will be forced to walk out at 6.30 am tomorrow."

The strike stems from a long-standing grievance regarding a recent policy granting a 35,000 rupee stipend to doctors.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port said it has seen a steep increase in oil and gas vessels in 2023 helped by Sinopec’s bunker operations, and is expecting to double throughput in 2024.

A key reason for this is the port’s bunkering partner Sinopec actively operating in the market, bringing significant value addition to the HIP’s commercial operations.

The overall oil and gas throughput handled by the port in 2023 was 918,000 metric tonnes with 700,000 MT of bunker and 218,000 MT LPG cargoes.

### Malaysia welcomes new king in unique rotating monarchy

*2024-01-31 10:19:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96873/malaysia-welcomes-new-king-in-unique-rotating-monarchy) · `en`

Sultan Ibrahim, the wealthy and outspoken ruler of Malaysia’s southern Johor state, was sworn in as the country’s new king in a ceremony on Wednesday.

Malaysia practices a unique rotational form of monarchy, in which the heads of the country’s nine royal families take turns to be king for a five-year reign.

The monarchy plays a largely ceremonial role, but has become more influential in recent years due to prolonged political instability during which the king has wielded rarely used discretionary powers.

Nine of Malaysia’s 13 states are headed by a traditional ethnic Malay ruler, mostly known as the sultan, in one of the world’s largest monarchy systems.

The constitutional monarchy was established after Malaysia’s independence from Britain. Every five years, the nine rulers elect one among themselves to be Malaysia’s king through a secret ballot.

The order of rotation among the sultans was originally determined by seniority, based on how long they had been ruling.

Your operations need to be sustainable by design, not as an afterthought, nor as projects with which to score points on award schemes. Indeed, today sustainable value alone is sufficient justification for innovation due to climate scare, and to young people who grew up wanting to change the world now being wage-earners with spending and policy-making power

In entrepreneurial contexts, innovation is generally seen as a development team producing a prototype product that offers enhanced value, that manufacturing and marketing teams will take to a market of customers who can perceive and pay for the changed or enhanced proposition, ideally before the competition does. Admitting that there are situations where such simple strategies work, a holistic outlook and the application of novel concepts could help businesses generate winning products within a structured process, with more stakeholders in mind than only the consumer.

Traditional marketing practices have given way to digital strategies, with SMIs taking centre stage in delivering brand messages and cultivating customer loyalty.

*2024-01-31 02:31:05* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Social-Media-Influencers-Transforming-the-fashion-industry/14-757950) · `en`

In the ever-evolving world of fashion, a seismic shift is taking place. The rise of social media influencers (SMIs) is rewriting the rules of the branded fashion retail business, reshaping the way consumers engage with iconic brands such as, Giorgio Armani, Victoria’s Secret, Gucci, and Ralph Lauren.

The vast scale of this transformation can be highlighted as follows:

Fashion, as one of the world’s most enduring industries, has undergone a remarkable transformation, largely fuelled by the fourth industrial revolution. Its contribution to the global gross domestic product remains substantial.

Yet, in the fiercely competitive realm of branded fashion, the key to success lies in how consumers perceive a product. Traditional marketing practices have given way to digital strategies, with SMIs taking centre stage in delivering brand messages and cultivating customer loyalty. This is further underscored by world trends on social media usage.

Sri Lankan authorities continue to silence and repress families of victims and their communities 15 years after the armed conflict ended – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Says UN Human Rights Council engagement remains vital to ensure justice for atrocity crimes

The Human Rights Watch said on Monday that the Sri Lankan Government’s proposed law to create another body to investigate war-time abuses replicates previous failed efforts, ignores the needs of victims, and falls far short of meeting Sri Lanka’s international legal obligations.

Sri Lankan authorities continue to silence and repress families of victims and their communities 15 years after the armed conflict ended.

Despite the anger spat with hatred in most uncivilised language in social media platforms, how the voter selects candidates for preference voting does not change at elections – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

On last poya holiday, the first full moon this new year 2024, I was woken up pretty early in the morning by the tinkle of a WhatsApp message on my mobile phone. One from an expatriate Sinhala-Buddhist patriot, an old-time pal of mine. It was a hurried short message. His excitement and joy no less ingrained. “Macho, Good news for all…did you hear it? That mad thug from Puttalam had died in an accident on Katunayake Expressway… Just past midnight” read his message.

In fact, AKD is providing a theoretical framework and practical direction to realise the aspirations of a new generation of voters that rose in revolt with an aragalaya demanding “system change” and “No 225”. RW, who stood to benefit from that revolt, betrayed that generation by ending the aragalaya with brute force, and is now taking all precautions to protect himself and the old order he represents through repressive legislations such as, the PTA and OSB

### 76 Years of Independence - Looking Back in Retrospect - EDITORIAL

*2024-01-31 01:19:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/76-Years-of-Independence-Looking-Back-in-Retrospect-EDITORIAL/172-276017) · `en`

Sunday, 4th February will mark 76 years since our country gained independence from the British. Unlike India and Pakistan, we Lankans did not suffer a bloody struggle to free ourselves from direct colonial rule. Whether this was good is debatable.

For one, we Lankans’ did not unite as men and women of one country to overthrow the yoke of imperialism. To this day we remain Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and Burgher first. Being Sri Lankan often takes second place to our individual race, creed and religion.

Most times we lose sight of the fact that the Veddah community (Lankan aborigines) are in fact the original citizens of our motherland.

But there are many things we as citizens of Lanka can be proud of.

We gave the world its first female Prime Minister. But, according to the World Economic Forum, Sri Lanka ranks 55th in the world when it comes to the gender equality gap and 30th in political participation. Today in a Parliament of 225 members, only 23 are female!

### Sanath Nishantha and the Cheapness of Politics in Our Times

*2024-01-31 01:15:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Sanath-Nishantha-and-the-Cheapness-of-Politics-in-Our-Times/172-276016) · `en`

State Minister Sanath Nishantha Perera, at his death, upsurged another bout of deep political polarization in the country - a trait he personified in his political life. Some quarters in social media celebrated his death. “What a great day to wake up to…” said one poster in the Sri Lankan X (formerly Twitter). Fake news and doctored imagery amplified that rancour: A photo widely shared on social media platforms was revealed as an old imagery of the public in Borella celebrating the resignation of Nishantha’s political patron, Mahinda Rajapaksa, in 2022.

Public anger at the system can obscure a bigger picture of an assortment of defects that led to the economic and political decay of the country. Subpar individuals in politics are only part of the problem; the bigger malady is the destructive economic and social policies their governments followed to keep their constituencies satiated for the time being.

### IMF backed high tax regime could give further rise to informal economy: Dr. Palmer

Notes that lower tax rate must be accompanied with digitisation and cutting down of excess bureaucracy

A top free market capitalist this week cautioned that the current International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed high tax regime could give further rise to informal economy​ in Sri Lanka,  thereby slowing down the economic recovery and ultimately narrowing the tax base.

Atlas Network Executive Vice President (International Programmes) Dr. Tom G. Palmer pointed out that nations plunged into debt crisis have come out of crisis by embracing a simplified low tax rate, and rejecting IMF-prescribed high tax rate.

Dr. Palmer shared his comments at a panel discussion held at the Economic Freedom Summit organised by the Advocata Institute in Colombo.

He noted that Greek government’s bold stance against IMF-prescribed high taxation to pay off debt has ultimately resulted in a booming economy led by the tourism sector and an increase tax collection due to expansion of the tax base.

“A man who has been through bitter experiences and traveled far enjoys even his sufferings after a time.” ~Homer – Odyssey

No US President, former or incumbent, has suffered the humiliation that Donald Trump, the 47th President of the United States of America, is going through now. As per Associated Press report dated May 9, 2023, ‘A jury, consisting of six men and three women, found Donald Trump liable on Tuesday (May 9) for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5 million in a judgment that could haunt the former president as he campaigns to regain the White House’. It was further reported thus: The verdict was split: ‘Jurors rejected Carroll’s claim that she was raped, finding Trump responsible for a lesser degree of sexual abuse. The judgment adds to Trump’s legal woes and offers vindication to Carroll, whose allegations had been mocked and dismissed by Trump for years’.
