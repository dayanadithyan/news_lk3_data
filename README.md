Dr. Manoharan said that Amnesty International had been pursuing his son‚Äôs case and now another foreign individual was assisting to ensure justice.

### The Iran-Israel conflict leaves Lanka at crossroads - EDITORIAL

Israel‚Äôs misguided (as the US President chooses to call it) attack on the Iranian Consulate in Syria, the retaliatory strikes by Iran on Israel and counter-strikes by Israel on Iran have set West Asia (referred to as the Middle East by the US and the West) in flames. By these actions, the taboo against direct attacks on each other has now disappeared.

If there is another round-a conflict over Iran‚Äôs nuclear advances or another strike by Israel on Iranian military officers- both sides will feel free to launch direct attacks on the other.

Relations reached a point of no return on April 1, 2024 when an Israeli air strike destroyed the Iranian Consulate annex building in Syria killing 16 people, including a senior Quds Force Commander.

### United Nations pushes justice for Sri Lanka‚Äôs Easter victims

The United Nations on Sunday urged Sri Lanka to bridge its ‚Äúaccountability deficit‚Äù and ensure justice as the country commemorated the 279 victims of its worst-ever attack against civilians five years ago.

The UN‚Äôs top envoy to the country, Marc-Andre Franche, told a remembrance service in Colombo that there should be a ‚Äúthorough and transparent investigation‚Äù to uncover those behind the Easter carnage in 2019.

Islamist bombers hit three churches and three hotels in the island‚Äôs deadliest suicide attack aimed at civilians, but grieving families say they are still waiting for justice.

Among the dead were 45 foreigners, including tourists visiting the island a decade after the end of a brutal ethnic conflict that had claimed more than 100,000 lives since 1972.

‚ÄúSri Lanka suffers from a continuing accountability deficit, be it for alleged war crimes, more recent human rights violations, corruption or abuse of power, which must be addressed if the country is to move forward,‚Äù Franche said.

Five years on, Sri Lanka‚Äôs Easter Sunday bombings has left us with more questions than answers.

Both the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government and now the Ranil Wickremesinghe tenure has been shown up poorly in terms of ensuring the masterminds and those who failed to prevent the bombings are bought to book.

As one sifts through various reports and discussions on the Easter Sunday bombings which took the lives of 315 and injured at least 600, one must, as Sunanda Deshapriya, activist and investigative journalist told a webinar recently, ask whether that tragedy was preventable.

The webinar was organised by the Solidarity Movement for Justice and Truth (SMJT).

One interesting fact that investigators discovered, Deshapriya said, was that a phone number used by one of the bombers, was amongst a series used by the infamous ‚ÄòTripoli Brigade‚Äô that is alleged to be behind the Lasantha Wickrematunga murder.

### Mangala  Samaraweera was a leader who saw things that others didn‚Äôt see. He was bold and had the courage of his convictions, never afraid to stand up for what he believed, whether or not the world appreciated it,  and indeed whether or not it was a marginal or minority position that he was espousing.

*2024-04-21 20:15:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83929) ¬∑ `en`

Mangala Samaraweera would have turned 68 today, and had he not succumbed to Covid-19, I am certain we would have met and raised a cheer for all that is worthy of celebration even in the worst of times.

He left us at a critical moment in our political history. Indeed, critical or not, his presence would have made a difference, for he was endowed not only with rare charisma but tirelessly used his bully pulpit to unite Lankans across ethnic, religious or age barriers, even sacrificing his parliamentary seat without a second thought.

Especially today, five years after the Easter Sunday attacks, with Catholics island-wide still feeling vulnerable from the absence of justice, Mangala would have reached out to honour the lives of those souls who perished in that barbaric assault. He would have had zero patience for any of the political gamesmanship that is denying closure to the 279 mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, husbands and wives who were slain that tragic Easter Sunday morning.
