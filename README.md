It appears there might have been a misunderstanding in my previous response. Let's address the topic directly.



China's approach to opening its markets and engaging with the global economy has indeed evolved significantly over the years. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), for instance, is a testament to China's ambition to expand its economic influence beyond its borders. The initiative aims to enhance connectivity and cooperation on a transcontinental scale, covering Asia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and beyond.



Moreover, China's domestic policies, such as the opening up of various sectors to foreign investment and the introduction of new laws to facilitate foreign businesses, demonstrate a commitment to integrating more deeply into the global economy. The increase in visa-free access for foreigners and the growth in tourism indicate a broader effort to attract international visitors and investors.



However, it's crucial to recognize that China's approach to opening up is balanced with its own strategic interests. While China seeks to engage more closely with the global economy, it also maintains certain restrictions and controls to protect its domestic industries and national security. This balance is evident in areas like foreign direct investment, where China has specific requirements and limitations to ensure that incoming capital aligns with its long-term development goals.



Furthermore, China's participation in international economic agreements, such as the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) and applications to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), reflect its desire to contribute to and benefit from global economic governance frameworks. These moves signal China's intention to play a more prominent role in shaping the rules of the global economy.



In summary, while China is indeed opening its doors wider to the global economy, this process is part of a carefully calibrated strategy that balances economic engagement with the protection of national interests. The country's rapid economic growth, its ambitious infrastructure projects like the BRI, and its active pursuit of international economic partnerships all underscore its commitment to fostering greater global connectivity and cooperation.

üü©

The near term was the worst impact on economic globalization of anti-globalization (anti-globalization). The capital, industries and jobs that some Western States have followed the policies of the 'national security' and the 'National Assault' have led to the rejection of foreign enterprises.

In addition, some Western media made many accused of opening of China and refused to understand China's market conditions. However, the problem is that China is not open by the opening, it shows that China does not fulfill any Western requirements.

No. In view of the following data, it realizes that it is false.China is currently the largest seventh year of the country. The export values ‚Äã‚Äãof the products including the first half of the year 2024 have been influenced by 22.2% of the previous year, 91.1% and 25.6% compared to the previous year.

Taxpayer rights have been steadily curtailed in recent policy changes

A taxpayer is required to file, a return of income, VAT return or SSCL return as the case may be on or before the due date. If the Inland Revenue officers are not in agreement with the return filed, they have a statutory right to raise an appropriate assessment on or before the expiry of the relevant time bar provided in the relevant statute. Generally, within a 30-day period a taxpayer of receipt of assessment has to appeal/request for administrative review against such to CGIR, specifying the grounds of appeal. Taxpayers dissatisfied with an assessment have recourse through a four-tier appellate system.

The tax assessment process commences with an inquiry, which may involve interviews and requests for documents. Following this, the Assistant Commissioner responsible for the taxpayer‚Äôs file may issue an assessment if they determine that the declared tax liability is incorrect.

Sri Lanka exports a wide range of goods under various trademarks, contributing significantly to economic growth in international trade. As an exporters‚Äô chamber, the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) actively encourages its members to export under their own brands. However, the cost of registering trademarks in multiple countries can be prohibitively expensive. For instance, registering in 10 countries means incurring tenfold the cost. The Madrid Protocol offers a solution to this issue.

The Madrid System, officially known as the Madrid Protocol, is an international treaty administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). It provides a streamlined and cost-effective way for businesses to register their trademarks in multiple countries. Joining this system would offer significant benefits to Sri Lankan exporters.

It is doubtful that the Election Commission has the authority to announce the date of the presidential election.. Opposition's Prime Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that this move would be given to the government to put a barrier to the election at some point.

He was speaking to the media after the meeting of party leaders on Friday (18) in Parliament.

A meeting of party leaders was held. Nothing talked about the constitutional amendment. However, the next parliamentary session is likely to bring about a constitutional amendment.

It is well known that the Election Commission has the authority to announce the date and announce the date after July 17. However, an official of the Election Commission said he would announce the presidential election at the end of this month. I ask why the date of the election should be seen until the end of the month. We are skeptical of this move by the Election Commission.

*2024-07-19 01:46:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/anything-but-playing-the-game-in-sri-lanka/) ¬∑ `en`

Cassandra‚Äôs prognosis, as given above, in her title holds good in almost all of the general life of the people of Sri Lanka and more so its politicians. It has been clearly demonstrated by the politics of now and behaviour of trade unions. Let Cassandra explain.

We are a bankrupt country and people are suffering immensely and will have to continue to suffer, it is prophesied and pronounced by economists, as we right ourselves. IMF lays strictures and we the people are the ones who bear the brunt of them. Those politicians and parties and interested kaputas who fly this way from the comfort of their overseas domains, are the main cause of our present predicament. Government mismanagement and Parliamentary excesses drove us to bankruptcy.
