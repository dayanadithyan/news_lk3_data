Attributing these financial woes to years of mismanagement exacerbated by political interference, the NUA underscored the pivotal role played by the tenure of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Specifically, the NUA recalled the appointment of Rajapaksa's brother-in-law to the chairmanship of SriLankan Airlines, despite lacking any pertinent experience or expertise in aviation management. The result, according to the NUA, was nothing short of a disastrous mishandling of the national airline's affairs.
