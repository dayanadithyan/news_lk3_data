President Joe Biden said Sunday that the U.S. “shall respond” after three American troops were killed and dozens more were injured in an overnight drone strike in northeast Jordan near the Syrian border. Biden blamed Iran-backed militias for the first U.S. fatalities after months of strikes by such groups against American forces across the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.

Biden, who was traveling in South Carolina, asked for a moment of silence during an appearance at a Baptist church’s banquet hall.

“We had a tough day last night in the Middle East. We lost three brave souls in an attack on one of our bases,” he said. After the moment of silence, Biden added, “and we shall respond.”

With an increasing risk of military escalation in the region, U.S. officials were working to conclusively identify the precise group responsible for the attack, but they have assessed that one of several Iranian-backed groups was behind it.

### A strong decision about the coming elections

*2024-01-29 07:59:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/192682) · `si`

Political critics point out that there will be a powerful factor to produce a government or to select a government in Tamil political parties and the support of the country's minorities in the coming elections.

The minority baliary has increased to 31 percent in Sri Lanka.

Political commentators also stated that the general election and the presidential election will depend on the way Tamil political parties will be supported.

These conditions may be very different with the political leadership that is known to the North and East as well as the plantation.

The support of the Ilangaitamil Auru Kachchi party and support of the Muslim parties will be the same.

Sri Lanka's Sinhala political party leaders have also paid close attention to the victory of the Ilangai Thamil Arascaki.

The reason is that the TNA leader appears to be the leader of the TNA and the leader of the Tamil National Alliance.
