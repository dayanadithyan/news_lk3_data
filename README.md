A woman protested against discrimination by a Grama Niladhari's assistant in Sri Lanka, alleging unfair distribution of aid and lack of transparency in public meetings. The assistant reportedly favored certain individuals and failed to notify all about these meetings. The woman claimed her complaints were ignored, leading to further protests. She threatened legal action against terrorism prevention units, highlighting systemic issues within the government's support systems.

In the Nawali North J/134 Grama Niladhari Division, a Grama Niladhari Division was involved in a protest in front of the Grama Sevaka office on Monday (29), who was discriminating against a woman as a Grama Niladhari's assistant.

He accused the coming aid schemes to those who wanted to, and that the public meetings were not notified of socially public organizations, and that the invitation would not be pasted in general places, and that the telephone would be known to those who wanted.

He alleged that the complaint was already transferred to the government agency, and that a previous Grama Niladhari had been transferred and the newly arrived village servant was acting according to the woman's opinion.

He also said that the government's livelihoods are discriminated against. While he repeatedly stated that he should not do so, he claims that he would refuse terrorism by a letter to the Terrorism Prevention Unit and called for a revenge.

Sri Lanka is on the path of economic recovery followed by shifting from brain drain to brain gain, as emphasised by Former Finance Minister and Presidential National Organiser Ravi Karunanayake.

With nearly 3 million Sri Lankans living abroad, there‚Äôs significant untapped potential in the expatriate community, many of whom excel in various fields.

To leverage this, strategies should be developed to attract expatriates back to Sri Lanka and encourage their investment and expertise, he said. .

This includes facilitating brain gain through attractive incentives, encouraging periodic returns, and enabling financial investments.

Expatriates can significantly contribute by leading multinational corporations‚Äô Sri Lankan branches, driving technological innovation, and enhancing global competitiveness.

Their international experience and networks can help attract investment, raise global awareness, and bridge skill gaps.

Despite the ruling by the highest court in the land, the Government insists that the Police IGP will continue to hold office.

Delivering a special statement in Parliament, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena stated that the Supreme Court cannot change the approval granted by the Constitutional Council to appoint the current IGP and therefore the IGP will continue in his position. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has declared his candidacy in the upcoming Presidential election, has stated that he will not appoint an acting IGP as this may lead to election petitions being filed against him.

Basil Rajapakse criticizes President Ranil Wickremesinghe's decision to run as an independent candidate, calling it a mistake. The PA's executive committee, led by former President Mahinda Rajapakse, was set to decide the presidential candidate. There's disagreement within the party over whether Wickremesinghe or another member should be the candidate. The PA feels neglected by Wickremesinghe, who they claim prioritized strengthening the UNP over the PA, leading to internal dissatisfaction.

üü©

Basil Rajapakse, the founder of the PA, said that the announcement of President Ranil Wickremesinghe's contesting as an independent candidate was completely wrong.

The executive committee of the PA was chaired by former President Mahinda Rajapakse to take a final decision on the presidential candidate.

It has been paid attention to a member of the PA in the presidential election and the candidature of President Ranil Wickremesinghe as the candidate.

One party has stated that Ranil Wickremesinghe should be fielded as presidential candidate and another party should field a member of the party as the presidential candidate.

It is absolutely wrong to announce that he is contesting as an independent candidate as he is in talks with President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the issue of the presidential candidate.

We supported President Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2022 without any conditions. But for the past 2 years, he has not given priority to the PA's party.
