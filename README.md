### In Mayilathamaduwu

*2024-05-29 15:16:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184786) ¬∑ `ta`

In Mayilathamadu, Batticaloa, ongoing injustices against immigrants involve police complicity, livestock theft, and violence. This issue, rooted in a long history of livestock farming, escalated during planned settlements from 2013 to 2016. The Tamil National Alliance opposed these actions, leading to legal challenges. The situation worsened under Gotabhaya Rajapaksa's governance, with farmers resorting to hiding their livestock due to threats and inadequate food supply. Over 1400 cattle have died, and four departments allegedly deceive farmers. The government's economic crisis exacerbates the problem, risking the destruction of native breeds and potential importation of foreign cattle. This scenario is seen as a form of political manipulation aimed at fostering communal conflict for political gain. Efforts to address these issues, including international outreach and legal actions, have yielded limited results, with continued atrocities against the immigrants.

üü©

The President of the Batticaloa District Civil Social Operators Union said that the iniquities of the immigrants in the Mayilathamadu Madhavan area continue to be carried out to this day, with the help of the police, they carry out their injustice.

He made this statement during a conversation on the crisis faced by the Milky Ways at Batticaloa at the Colombo National Christian Society

He said that cattle are missing, killing them, putting ammunition into the food, killing them with sharp weapons and shooting fire.

Madhavan, Batticaloa, has been involved in livestock farming for more than five generations of long history.

From 2013 to 2016, similar planned settlements took place - these were carried out under the State Event.

After the change of 2015, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) was the Opposition of the Opposition of the Maithripala Sirisena -a case was filed by Durairajasinghe, Minister of Agricultural Livestock Development of the Eastern Provincial Council.

Once a law passed in the England parliament, no one can interrogate. That was the foundation of the supremacy of Parliament. The Parliament is the Parliament.

American method is different. By the American methodology, when they drafted some law, they gave the executive powers to the executive powers and the Congress Congress and the Court of Justice.

We maintain the English method because our country does not follow a federal way.. But we are not a federal country. Parliament is the final powers of the country's legislation.

### In Pakistan, AI lists the new curriculum for South Asian politics

*2024-05-29 14:45:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184783) ¬∑ `ta`

In a historic move, Pakistan's opposition leader Imran Khan, despite facing disqualification and persecution, emerged victorious in the elections, marking a significant shift in South Asian politics. Utilizing AI to create a speech for his victory address, Khan's party, PTI, innovatively navigated government-imposed internet restrictions, showcasing the power of digital technology in electoral strategies. This victory highlights the changing landscape of politics in South Asia, where traditional media's grip is loosening, and AI becomes a pivotal tool for political engagement.

Author - Nevindi Jayawardena and Dilshan

At the time of the Pakistani election on February 8, Imran Khan suffered 14 years in prison for other mistakes and charges. A week ago, Khan, the country's most popular opposition leader, was disqualified from being in office for 10 years. His party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was subjected to mass persecution and repression and its central offices were sealed by the police.

The contradictions against the party and its leader were fiercely. Yet Khanal was able to oppose them. Although allegations such as voting and military intervention and all races were supported by the government, PTI won 93 seats. The ruling party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN), won 75 seats and Pakistan People's Party (PPP), led by Benazir Bhutto's son Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, won 54 seats.

I have no invitation to this meeting on the Tamil general candidate. But such concept meetings are aimed at distracting us.

The civil society has come to the conclusion that one of the Tamil people is to be a common candidate. They are continuing to talk to the people and many political parties about the next steps.

Thus, when the general position is taken and strengthened, it is a distraction to bring this issue out of the public and call it an exchange of opinion.

If someone wants to say something against this position, let us say anything. We will give the answers.

This means that if the general candidate comes up, the Tamil people will not vote, or we are ready to give the answers to any reason.

*2024-05-29 12:18:04* ¬∑ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c6ppxwjl75po) ¬∑ `si`

The text discusses the controversy surrounding the potential postponement of Sri Lanka's presidential election, citing concerns about its constitutionality and impact on democracy. Experts argue that the current constitution does not allow for election delays, emphasizing the importance of timely elections for democratic governance. They highlight the distinction between a president elected by popular vote and one appointed successively, suggesting that only the latter lacks the power to extend their term. The discussion also touches on historical instances where attempts to delay elections were met with resistance and legal challenges.

Elections will be elected to Sri Lankan citizens, which are a year-long year of elections. Since the constitutional term of the Presidency is the current republic of the Republican Constitution in accordance with the Second Republican Constitution of the Second Republic of China, the Constitution should be appointed to hold a presidential election this year.
