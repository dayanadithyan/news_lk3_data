“These are the people who say tighten your belts, reduce staff, taxes have to be raised,” Kiriella pointed out.

“It would be good if people are willing to work for less, but the fact is salary scales for these roles remain high around the world,” State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

In the last three years “99 Central Bank employees, 10 percent of that grade, left the island,” Siyambalapitiya said, adding that “We have to try to retain economists of a high caliber.”

“What economic knowledge? These are the people who bankrupted the country’s economy!” Kiriella rebutted. (Colombo/Feb20/2024)

### US pushes for UN to support temporary Gaza ceasefire, oppose Rafah assault

The United States has proposed a rival draft United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a temporary ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and opposing a major ground offensive by its ally Israel in Rafah, according to the text seen by Reuters.

The move comes after the U.S. signalled it would veto on Tuesday an Algerian-drafted resolution — demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire — over concerns it could jeopardize talks between the U.S., Egypt, Israel and Qatar that seek to broker a pause in the war and the release of hostages held by Hamas.

Until now, Washington has been averse to the word ceasefire in any U.N. action on the Israel-Hamas war, but the U.S. text echoes language that President Joe Biden said he used last week in conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
