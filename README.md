It costs 25 million rupees to get a candidate's name on the ballot. There are 27 candidates so far. If so, let's find out how much money it costs. This is a waste of people's money.

While the country was opposed to the worst economic crisis, none of the heroes who are currently speaking of the government have been responsible for the government. The country was on fire. President Ranil Wickremesinghe took the country without considering his political future.

The ruling and opposition parties must remember that no one can do election campaigns if the Age of 20122 is present in the year 20122.

I will be happy if the PA wins, but it is impossible to practice. No one can build public Peramuna. President Ranil Wickremesinghe should win the election. If he wins, the country will win.

There is a long list of Presidential hopefuls, but the voters will focus on five or six of them. From among them, one will be elected as the leader to steer the country to progress and prosperity. However, if they are to deliver prosperity to people, they should adopt policy strategies to accelerate economic growth at an unparalleled level of 8-9% annually over the next 25 years. This requires Sri Lanka to generate new inventions which should be commercially produced for the local as well as for global markets through innovations.

Hence, inventions and innovations should receive the highest priority of those aspiring to win the forthcoming Presidential election in their policy strategies. This article series will provide the needed guidance to those Presidential hopefuls. It is an updated and a modified version of a previous paper written by the author for the Association of Professional Bankers.

### The Reality Of The Economic Crisis

There is still a significant misunderstanding among many people regarding the true cause of the economic crisis. While many attribute the economic downturn primarily to corruption, the underlying cause is far more complex: we have been spending more than we earn. The lack of savings, combined with many state institutions operating at a loss, has led us to spend beyond our means. To cover these expenses, we have had to borrow money, and as this pattern continued, our debt accumulated to unmanageable levels. When income suddenly drops, the ability to pay off these debts becomes severely compromised, leading to the kind of crisis Sri Lanka experienced in 2021.

Others come to the foreign ambassador services or the winning candidate from the winning candidate, in order to obtain the positions of the Head of State Department, to get the free media opportunity, or to appoint their representatives in the polls, to win the election for other reasons for other reasons.
