Sri Lanka has a rich history of investment in education, reflected in its impressive literacy rate over 93%. However, since gaining independence in 1948, the island nation has struggled with political corruption and mismanagement, leading to increased economic instability and social unrest. According to Transparency International, while the average global Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is 43/100, Sri Lanka scores 36/100, placing it 101st out of 180 countries and territories. The recent report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights elaborates on the incumbent situation in the island nation, highlighting ongoing challenges in governance and human rights:

### HUSBANDLY QUIRKS

*2024-07-28 00:23:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/husbandly-quirks/) ¬∑ `en`

In my maidenly era, and even earlier, most of us entered marriage with stars in our eyes. If not always stars, at least happy expectations of a cozily comfortable home life where everything fell into place and nothing other than an occasional husbandly tantrum disturbed the peace of the day. No one told us that men had quirks or that they had strange, indeed offbeat foibles.

After all, how could a mother anticipate what peculiarities her daughter‚Äôs charming fiance was going to exhibit once he had exchanged this role for that of a husband who required mollycoddling in the same manner his doting mother had provided all his life.

### IGP Controversy & President RW‚Äôs Failure To Break Up NPP

After the Election Commission revealed the details of the presidential election, the public expected a calm and fair election. However, two recent events are profoundly significant because they do not accommodate people‚Äôs expectations. The first is the controversial issue surrounding the Supreme Court‚Äôs (SC) interim order, which has prevented incumbent IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon from functioning as the police chief. This is indeed the latest of the recent events because it came days before the announcement of the date for the holding of presidential polls.

### US Politics: Kamala Harris Takes On Donald Trump

In one master stroke last Sunday afternoon, the beleaguered American President Joe Biden turned the tables on Donald Trump and the Republican Party. From his home in Delaware, Biden tersely announced that he was withdrawing from the race and endorsing his Vice President Kamala Harris to be the nominee of the Democratic Party for the November presidential election. If that was stunning, the even greater shock and awe is the speed and manner in which Kamala Harris has rolled out her campaign; secured her nomination within hours; energized the Party at every level; enthused the youth in their own network worlds; raised millions of dollars by the minute; and served notice to Trump that she is the prosecutor, he is the felon, and she knows his type.

### Old Dogs, New Tricks: The Ongoing Battle Against Age-Related Mental Decline

Growing up in Sri Lanka in the 60s and 70s, our ambition was to secure a government job, retire by age 55, and enjoy a good pension. I often saw my male relatives doing just that, reclining in easy chairs with their legs propped up‚Äîa common and comfortable sight. However, the 80s brought dramatic changes. We scattered across the globe, embracing diverse cultures and values. In the USA, particularly, we‚Äôve been conditioned to believe that age is just a number and that life is endless, with us as the Energizer Bunnies, going on forever.

This optimistic view was suddenly upended last week with President Joe Biden‚Äòs announcement of his campaign termination following his disastrous debate performance. Suddenly, age-related mental decline and dementia were thrust into the spotlight, challenging the notion that we can defy the effects of aging indefinitely.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs Supreme Court issued an interim order suspending Tennakoon from his office and suggesting that an acting appointment be made. The Court gave this verdict after granting leave to proceed for nine fundamental rights petitions filed against Tennakoon‚Äôs appointment as IGP.

However, Tennakoon remains in office, as there are no legal provisions for President Ranil Wickremesinghe to make an acting appointment now that polls have been declared, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardana has said.

It is equally clear that following the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the exercise of powers by the President, except his power to declare war and peace, are subject to the Fundamental Rights Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (as per Article 35 of the Constitution).‚Äù
