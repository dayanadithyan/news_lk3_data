International Labor Day is one of the most loud voice of the working people who are martyred by the working rights of the working class for the rights of the ruling class when the ruling class suppresses the struggle for 8 hours of work.

The general public, including working people around the world, celebrates International Labor Day amidst the greatest crises and pressure of history.

The imperialist regime, the bankruptcy, and the unjust neo -liberal regime and the people of the working people, have been a tradition and a state of distress and disaster.

Although the world is traveling in the 21st century, the majority of the world's population has been transformed into poor people.

The number of people who die all over the world is hungry and the number of people who die. Children are expelled from education around the world.

Rarely any other time,¬† save the campaign rallies, would the politicians speak so passionately about labour rights as they would today, the International Workers‚Äô Day. But, in this quirky interest reeking of opportunism, there is a sense of irrelevance of what May Day was supposed to be.

Consider today, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa and a horde of Ministers who would ride their Pajeros to the podium while the party members who are bused from four corners of the country march under the scorching sun to mark the historic gains of the labour movement born out of a campaign for eight- hour work day.

### Are doctors‚Äô unions making threats again? - EDITORIAL

The doctors in our country seem to be girding up their loin cloths for a possible fight with the government in the aftermath of a government decision to set up a medical faculty at the ‚ÄòNational School of Business Management (NSBM) and at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU).

A study by ‚ÄòThe National Library of Medicine‚Äô shows currently around 1,450 doctors enter the health system annually and the national doctor-to-patient ratio is 1:671 to 1,000 patients. Not surprisingly there is a shortage of doctors in the country.

According to the 2019 GCE (A/L) Examinations Analysis Book 20,287 students sat for the biology science (medical stream). In 2023, 40,329 students took the Bio Science stream. Of this number only 23,178 were able to gain entry to the available facilities in the country.

In other words we have a huge gap between the number of candidates attempting to enter the medical faculties of the university in the country and the numbers they are able to absorb.

Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe reports a significant turnaround for state-owned structures, transitioning from a 743 billion rupee loss in 2022 to a 456 billion rupee profit in 2023.

The sale of state-owned assets to the private sector is seen as a means to enhance private sector contribution, allowing the government to focus on public service investments. This strategy is expected to foster a more efficient, competitive, and sustainable economy in Sri Lanka.
