### Trinity towards the Interesting decision - Antonian Samar

*2024-03-16 05:07:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178830) · `ta`

Trinity's Antonian 105th (Mountaineer) sapphire at Asgiriya Ground, Kandy, is heading towards an uninteresting decision. St. Anthony's team, after a strong start, faces challenges. Despite a promising opening, they struggle to maintain their lead, losing the match with 13 runs.

🟩

The first day of the Trinity - Antonian 105th (Mountaineer) sapphire at the Asgiriya Ground in Kandy is moving towards the uninteresting decision.

Perhaps, if St. Anthony loses the Trinity team twice, it is possible to make the match.

St. Anthony's team, who played the entire day in the match, started the match on Friday (15) and scored 232 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in the first innings when the game was stopped due to inadequate lighting.

Often the St. Anthony's team is expected to hold their first innings and give the Trinity team a chance to bat on the second day (16).

St. Anthony's team faced a stumbling block as the opening player Dinura Kanegoda (0) was playing in the first over of Trinity team man Manula Gularatne.

However, team captain Dissanayake Kaushika Kumarasinghe, both of them, shared 66 runs in the 2nd wicket.

Subsequently, Ekanayake shared 36 runs each in the 3rd wicket with Januka Ratnayake and Janith Ratnasiri 4.

### Gota’s book and conspiracy theories

*2024-03-16 00:38:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Gotas-book-and-conspiracy-theories/172-278977) · `en`

Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s book ‘The Conspiracy to oust me from Presidency” which was launched recently did not evoke much interest or create any stir among the people as its name suggests to do.

Nor did it reveal any hidden facts or details about any incident that would have contributed to his ouster. However, the book is said to have been sold like hot cake due to the curiosity about what it could have contained.

Hence, unlike the commotion that was created in September last year by the Channel 4 documentary which suggested a purported link between the State Intelligence Service (SIS) and the National Thowheed Jama’ath (NTJ), the terrorist organization that was behind the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks in 2019, the book seems to have now almost been forgotten even by Rajapaksa’s friends.

### Easter Sunday, nightmares of past and fears for the future

*2024-03-16 00:37:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Easter-Sunday-nightmares-of-past-and-fears-for-the-future/172-278976) · `en`

On the 31th of this month Catholics and Christians of all denomination will celebrate Easter Sunday. The festival without a doubt brings to mind the Easter Sunday bombing of 2019.

On Easter of 2019, terrorists exploded their deadly caches of explosives in three churches where Christians were celebrating what to the community was the most sacred of Christian festivals. Separately on the same day, in three five star hotels members of the same terrorist group carried out similar attacks on guests having their Easter breakfast.

To-date no one knows why these misguided souls chose that date to perform their ‘mischief’. The intelligence services of the US, UK, India, China, Israel Pakistan et al arrived in the country within hours of the bombing.

However, it was thanks to the immediate action taken by Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, -the head of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka- any further bloodshed was averted.

Karuna projected himself as the “Eastern national leader”, second only to Prabhakaran in the Tiger hierarchy

Karuna kept LTTE resistance alive during the days of the IPKF. He and his former deputy Reagan led the counter offensive against the ill-fated Tamil National Army after the withdrawal of the IPKF

Twenty years have passed and much water has flown under the bridge since the eastern tiger revolt. Nevertheless the episode that fragmented the LTTE, remains an important chapter in the history of the ethnic conflict

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) organization fought the armed forces of Sri Lanka for 33 years in pursuance of its political goal of establishing a separate state  called Tamil Eelam in the Northern and Eastern provinces of the Island.

In his bail application filed through his legal counsels, Rambukwella claimed that the Maligakanda Magistrate’s decision to reject bail for him is unlawful. He also sought the High Court to release him on bail subjected to any condition.

On Thursday, Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama overruled the accused’ bail pleas and detained them indefinitely under the provisions of the Public Property Act and fixed the case to be recalled on 28 March.

2024 is a pivotal year for finance under the global climate negotiation process and presents an opportunity to further highlight the climate-debt nexus

Around the world, countries are facing mounting debt, debt distress, and debt default. As governments are working towards green growth, sustainable development, poverty reduction, adaptation, and mechanisms to address climate-induced loss and damage, they are in danger of accumulating unsustainable debt or becoming unable to service existing debt. As stated in the IMF’s 2023 Annual Report, “debt vulnerabilities and risks remain elevated, with 15% of low-income countries currently in debt distress and 45% of low-income countries and 25% of emerging market economies at high risk of debt distress.”

Even these scanty histories were rarely contemporaneous, the recorder writing about events happening few generations back, based on what has been passed from mouth to mouth.

Ceylon Electricity Board has a cadre of around 1,000 engineers but they have been usually managing with lower levels of around 900, they said.

Since 2022, about 150 have left the CEB for foreign countries, leading to serious gaps in some branches with engineering staff down to about 750, Dhanushka Parakramasinghe, President of the CEB Engineers Union told reporters in Colombo.

About 105 engineers have resigned and about 54 have taken leave, Parakramasinghe said.
