### Anderson to retire after Lord's Test against West Indies

London, (AFP) - James Anderson will bow out as one of cricket's all-time greats when England face West Indies in July after becoming the first pace bowler to take 700 Test wickets.

The 41-year-old will bring down the curtain on a glorious Test career at Lord's, 21 years after his debut, as England head coach Brendon McCullum looks to build for the future with one eye on the 2025-26 Ashes.

"I'm going to miss walking out for England so much," Anderson said on Saturday.

"But I know the time is right to step aside and let others realise their dreams just like I got to, because there is no greater feeling."

Only two spinners, Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan (800 Test wickets) and the late Australia great Shane Warne (708), are ahead of Anderson on the all-time list of the five-day game's most successful bowlers.

Anderson joined the exclusive '700 club' in his 187th Test during England's tour of India earlier this year.

The Constitution states that a President who is elected by the people shall hold office for a term of five years. In the event of his death, resignation or removal, his successor shall be elected by Parliament to serve the unexpired period of his term of office. Any Bill that seeks to amend the Constitution to extend the prescribed term of office of the President is required to be passed by Parliament by a two-thirds majority and then approved by the people at a referendum. The Constitution also provides that the poll for the election of the President ‚Äúshall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months‚Äù before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office. A popular television channel appears to be unaware of these constitutional requirements when it keeps chanting in the middle of its news programmes: ‚ÄúWhen is the Election ?‚Äù

### Culture Shock in Iraq

*2024-05-12 02:29:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/culture-shock-in-iraq/) ¬∑ `en`

My first impressions of Iraq were positive. Upon arrival at Saddam International Airport, the opulence and modernity juxtaposed against the backdrop of a country rebuilding itself after a war. The warm reception and luxurious accommodations at Hotel Babylon Oberoi spoke volumes about the resilience and hospitality of the Iraqi people. The five-star standards of Hotel Babylon Oberoi, and facilities provided to my family at a corner suite facing Tigris River, were all positive. I was pleasantly surprised as these observations exceeded my expectations.

Serving a primarily Tamil population, the center presented a unique challenge ‚Äì a new language and a vibrant culture vastly different from my Colombo upbringing. Yet, it was an opportunity to broaden my horizons and become a well-rounded physician.

Under the guidance of the Consultant Family Physician and Senior Registrar of Family Medicine, the Kondavil FHC became a testament to Family Medicine in action. The center boasted a comprehensive array of facilities, from consultation rooms to a dedicated counseling space. Witnessing this well-equipped unit function as a whole solidified the meaning of Family Medicine translating into tangible patient care.

Until about 50 years ago, a rice-and-curry lunch in Sri Lanka was incomplete without the side relish of jaadi theldala (sauteed cured fish). Some ate white rice with a piece of jaadi before serving other curries onto their plates. Amma (my mother) prepared a special Jaadi dish with tomatoes and large onion rings for Sunday lunch. She got jaadi  from Aachcho (my grandmother), who boasted that her jaadi was the best in the Kalutara district. Aachcho produced jaadi at home twice a year. I remember her making Jaadi in 1963. I was then 12 years old and was on holiday at her place.

Senthil Thondaman, President of the Ceylon Workers Congress and Governor of the Eastern Province, said there was no compromise with the companies.

He said this while questioning the refusal of plantation companies after the state gazette was published on the 1,700 rupee salary increase of plantation workers.

Senthil Thondaman told the media that the Employers Federation's media spokesman Roshan Rajadurai said that the plantation workers would be paid a salary of Rs 1,200.

Initially, companies said that the salary hike could not be paid when the plantation workers were negotiated on the salary hike.. They said they were ready to pay only the promotion after heavy pressure.

In this case, the state gazette notification has been issued, and now the companies have come forward to pay a base salary of 1,200 rupees.. The company said the company could not even offer a one -rupee salary hike for a year and is now the reason why the government has come up with an increase of 200 rupees.

### The fig leaf of humanitarianism

*2024-05-11 21:23:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-fig-leaf-of-humanitarianism/) ¬∑ `en`

As each day passes and the death toll rises in Gaza, the West‚Äôs complicity in Israeli atrocities becomes clearer and sharper. South Africa‚Äôs case against Israel is a clear indictment of the Global North‚Äôs inaction regarding those atrocities. Israel‚Äôs defence team has attempted to rationalise what Israeli forces are doing in Gaza, but this has effectively been undermined by the Israeli government itself: each day, its official social media channels tweet or post one ridiculous claim against not just South Africa, but also the ICJ.

Against this backdrop, it makes very little sense to continue defending a country against which half the world has rallied in solidarity. Even Sri Lanka‚Äôs decision to send vessels to the Red Sea and local youths to Israel does not diminish its continuing support for Palestine at the United Nations, and the Foreign Ministry‚Äôs support for a two-state solution, an end to all hostilities, and a humanitarian ceasefire.
