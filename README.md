### We supported the President on the advice of Mahinda - Prasanna Ranatunga

*2024-08-06 04:16:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190381) ¬∑ `ta`

Prasanna Ranatunga, Minister of Housing and Urban Development, announced support for the President, citing advice from Mahinda Rajapakse. He criticized those involved in a violent incident on May 9, 2022, for now discussing violence. Despite concerns over a poorly organized political meeting that led to assaults and ridicule of supporters, including the murder of Athukorala by MP Amarakirthi, the group decided to back the President based on Rajapakse's guidance. This move aims to strengthen the party amidst internal conflicts and external challenges.

üü©

It is funny that those who are responsible for the violence incident, 2022 May 09, are currently referring to violence. Mahinda Rajapakse told us that if he is to declare the party member as a candidate, take resolutions independently.

The Minister of Housing and Urban Development Prasanna Ranatunga said that we supported the President.

He was speaking at a meeting of the organizer of the PA, which was held on Monday (5) in the Gampaha - Udugampola area.

2022 May 09 is currently talking about the violent incident. I urged the then Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on 08.05.2012 not to hold a political meeting at the Allaimalai.. I mentioned that he was not going to attend the meeting of improperly organizing.

The meeting was held against our suggestions. Thus our supporters were ridiculed and assaulted by MP Amarakirthi assassinated Athukorala. It is funny to note that those who are responsible for violence are now correct and that the homes of politicians have been set on fire.

United National Party (UNP) MP Vajira Abeywardena said that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has fielded the election as an independent candidate in order to give all political parties an opportunity to work together.

The youth community has fallen completely due to the economic crisis in our country over the past years. Some young people left the country. This condition cannot be continuously so. We need to take this country in a new direction.

Ranil Wickremesinghe's 42 -year political experience was due to the country's bankruptcy to normalize the country within two years.. The task has not yet been completed though. Sri Lanka has been in the intensive care unit for the past two years. For the past two years, a specialist, Ranil Wickremesinghe, a specialist, has been treated.

‚ÄúFair is foul and foul is fair‚Äù ~ William Shakespeare, Macbeth

Why are there no Booker Prize-winning novels about mundane multicultural families that inter-married for generations, shared religion/s, language/s, histories, and co-existed for centuries, while living in relative harmony in Ceylon/ Sri Lanka?

Is the trope of ‚Äòdark natives‚Äô engaged in endless, chaotic violence an international literature prize-winning bestseller that masks white mischief, including sanitized, techno-scientific AI guided hybrid warfare in a post-Truth world awash in distracting Culture Wars?

Susan William‚Äôs brilliant and brave book ‚ÄúWhite Malice‚Äù is subtitled ‚ÄúThe CIA and the Covert Recolonization of Africa‚Äô. Her analysis may well apply to Eurobond debt trapped Sri Lanka, Pakistan and other Afro-Asian post/colonies, where National Endowment for Democracy (NED), funded protests and regime change operations have unfolded recently. NED is known as the second Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

### India & The Military: Two Factors That May Affect JVP‚Äôs Rise To Power

The indomitable spirit shown by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna commonly known as JVP since its inception, even after the total eclipse of its initial political leadership is remarkable. Unlike many of the leftist political parties swayed and assimilated into the mainstream spectrum of party politics in Sri Lanka, JVP survived and flourished. After a half-century of its survival before two insurrections, JVP stands as a catalyst factor in the coming presidential election of Sri Lanka. Embittered by the cascade of failures attributed to the major political parties, essentially the nepotism of the Rajapaksa regime until the ousting of Gotabaya in 2022, the people seem to have developed a trust towards JVP‚Äôs charismatic leader Mr. Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
