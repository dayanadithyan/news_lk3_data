### Under Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka is going fast – in reverse

*2024-02-19 13:16:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/under-ranil-wickremesinghe-sri-lanka-is-going-fast-in-reverse/) · `en`

Administration has moved to stifle criticism with a draft of new, repressive laws

Sri Lanka is still reeling from an economic crisis largely caused by misgovernance and lack of accountability. Public protests in 2022 forced the president and the prime minister, brothers Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, to step down.

But instead of focusing on social justice and rights, the new government, led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, is focused on suppressing dissent and limiting international attention on human rights.

Although it is the Rajapaksas that nominated – and are propping up – their successor, many foreign observers, including in India and the United States, had hoped that things would change.
