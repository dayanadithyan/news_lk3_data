A Sri Lankan Buddhist cleric has accused China of preventing visit to Sri Lanka

This was stated by Dr. Waskaduwe Mahinda Thera, a group of Sri Lanka Buddhist Buddhists who gave the Buddha's sacred significance to the Dalai Lama.

Responding to a question that China would have been furious about what China was on the Dalai Lama, he said that Buddhist leaders from Sri Lanka had called for a visit to Sri Lanka a few years ago.

But he does not know why the problem is coming from China.

As a Buddhist leader, we respect the Dalai Lama. He said that he was not a trader, Dr. Waskaduwe Mahindawansa Thera, who respected him and invited him to visit Sri Lanka. China did not want it to our government.

We do not like this. He has a Buddhist leader. He has the freedom to invite him to Sri Lanka, ‚ÄùBuddhism said.

If the Dalai Lama visits Sri Lanka in the future, we will be great. Sri Lankans went to the Himalayas.

KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian officials claimed Friday they used a barrage of drones to destroy at least six military aircraft and badly damage eight others at an airfield in Russia‚Äôs Rostov region, while Russian defense officials claimed they intercepted 44 Ukrainian drones and that only a power substation was damaged in the attack.

The assault appeared to be one of Kyiv's biggest air attacks in the war, coming as its forces step up their assaults on Russian soil. The Associated Press could not independently verify either side's claims.

Russia has escalated attacks on civilian infrastructure, including Ukraine‚Äôs power plants, in recent weeks, signaling a new and potentially dangerous phase in the conflict as both sides struggle to achieve significant advances on the ground.

The overnight attack targeted a military airfield near Morozovsk in Russia and was conducted by Ukraine‚Äôs Security Service in cooperation with the army, Ukrainian intelligence officials told the AP.

The statements coming out of India on ‚Äúreclaiming‚Äù Kachchatheevu island from Sri Lanka have ‚Äúno ground‚Äù, the Sri Lankan Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda has said.

The senior Sri Lankan Tamil politician‚Äôs comments came days after the Narendra Modi government targeted the Congress and its ally the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu accusing them of overlooking national interests in the ceding of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka in 1974.

The BJP has also been targeting the two parties for not ensuring the rights of the fishermen wanting to fish in waters around the Katchatheevu island.

‚ÄúIt is the election time in India, it is not unusual to hear such noises of claims and counterclaims about Kachchatheevu,‚Äù Devananda told reporters in Jaffna on Thursday, 4 April.

‚ÄúI think India is acting on its interests to secure this place to ensure Sri Lankan fishermen would not have any access to that area and that Sri Lanka should not claim any rights in that resourceful area‚Äù, Devananda said.

### Biden warns Netanyahu US policy depends on Gaza civilian protection

President Joe Biden warned Israel of a sharp shift in his policy over the Gaza war Thursday amid growing frustration with Benjamin Netanyahu and mounting domestic pressure in a US election year.

A tense phone call between the two leaders appeared to yield at least some results, as Netanyahu‚Äôs office announced within hours it would temporarily allow more aid to flow into Gaza.

Biden has stood solidly behind Israel and its prime minister since Hamas‚Äôs October 7 attacks, and his criticism of civilian deaths in Gaza has not stopped Washington from supplying military hardware to its key ally.

But the Democrat faces spiraling anger from Muslim and younger voters over his support for Israel, and political allies have been pressing him to make the aid conditional on changed Israeli behavior.

In a 30-minute call with Netanyahu after Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers from US-based charity World Central Kitchen, Biden hinted at doing just that.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka is looking to establish a public private partnership at the National Ayurveda Teaching Hospital located at Cotta Road, Borella due to a lack of funds, State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody, has said.

‚ÄúWe have 180 rooms in Borella and we wish to go for a private-public partnership. However, there is a political party ‚Äì trade union that does not let us sign such an agreement,‚Äù Jayakody said on Thursday.

In the past, staff have protested saying the understaffing made it almost impossible to function. They also said the hospital lacked funds to provide medicines, and meals for patients who were admitted there.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of shortages. This is why we want to have paying wards,‚Äù Jayakody said. ‚ÄúSick people are willing to pay.‚Äù

Jayakody said that Western medical services receive the majority of government funding with Ayurveda medicine receiving only 2 percent of funding. (Colombo/Apr5/2024)
