ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe, emulating the island nation‚Äôs opposition leader, handed over smart classrooms to Southern Provincial state schools as he is eyeing to contest in a grand independent coalition.

Analysts see the move as a strategy to face a rising support for a similar project implemented by main opposition leader Sajith Premadasa who has been distributing smart classes and relevant equipment for schools across the country with funding he has not disclosed.

President Wickremesinghe distributed the digital equipment under an Indian grant project worth 300 million Sri Lanka rupees ($1 million) for establishing 200 smart classrooms with 2200 smart tablets being provided to school students in Southern Province.

The project aims at equipping 200 schools in the Province with necessary digital tools that would enable them to benefit from digital resources and materials across the globe, the Indian High Commission said in a statement.

### Surprise defeat for far-right in France in Macron‚Äôs snap election gambit

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äî President Emanuel Macron‚Äôs gamble in calling a snap poll somewhat paid off after a left-wing alliance secured the highest number of seats in the French parliament, effectively defeating an alliance led by the far-right National Rally.

The Economist reported that Marine Le Pen‚Äôs National Rally (RN)-led bloc, which was widely anticipated to top the voting, will now end up in third place, securing 134 to 152 seats. However, this is still a major win for the once-fringe party which only held 88 seats in the outgoing parliament, indicating the mainstreaming of its hard-right ideology.

A left-wing alliance led by Jean-Luc Melenchon is projected to have secured 171-187 seats after what CNN has called tactical voting in Sunday‚Äôs second round election. CNN noted that France will be left in political limbo after no party came close to winning an absolute majority.

### Presidential pardons: an unchecked executive power

*2024-07-08 11:07:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/presidential-pardons-an-unchecked-executive-power/) ¬∑ `en`

A pardon is defined in Black‚Äôs Law Dictionary ‚Äòas an act of grace‚Äô. In the Oxford Dictionary it is defined as an ‚Äúaction of forgiving or remission of the legal consequences of an offence or conviction‚Äù. Some argue that the power to grant a pardon is a check on the powers of the judiciary rectifying any miscarriage of justice. But this executive power unchecked could result in the abuse of power.

In recent times, President Sirisena granted two pardons ‚Äì one within six months and the other within nine days of relinquishing office while President Gotabay Rajapaksa granted two pardons ‚Äì one within four months of becoming president and the other seven months after he received a two thirds majority in Parliament.

China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that shut most Western markets off to Russian exports.
