Vote counting is underway in South Korea as the country awaits the results of its parliamentary elections.

Mr Yoon is under pressure to address a number of issues including rising food prices, a rapidly aging population and an ongoing doctor‚Äôs strike.

### Tamils in the presidential election must prove democratic strength - Sabah Kukadas

Sabah Kukadas emphasizes the need for Tamils to demonstrate democratic strength in the presidential election, highlighting the importance of unity and strategic decision-making to avoid chauvinism leading to racism.

üü©

Relo's leadership committee member Saba Kukadas said that after the war silence, the people's basic aspirations were not revealed for 15 years after the war.

It is not easy to make a conclusion in other elections.

In the past, the presidential elections have not been racially advantageous but they must unite in the aftermath of the war, but it is imperative that all political parties and civil organizations in the Tamil homeland must unite in the same site to implement this.

The decisions of Tamils must be tactically beyond criticism that chauvinism can turn communalism into racism.

Whatever the decisions of the Tamils in the past, the South has turned it into communalism, for example, the separatism is the reality of separatism.

It is therefore stated that the aspirations of the ethnicity will be made in the international arena and the political liberation of the Tamil people in the international arena and the global regional conversation of the global regional countries.
