Such losses in the past have led the government to borrow more before an unprecedented economic crisis in 022.

“The Minister stated that the reason for recording this profit was the setting of cost-based prices at institutions such as the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC),” the Finance Ministry said in a statement.

### Sri Lanka bans corporal punishment for children

*2024-04-30 12:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-bans-corporal-punishment-for-children-160605/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will ban corporal punishment in all spheres, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.

“The Cabinet approved amendments to the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code to prohibit corporal punishment in all spheres,” Wickremesinghe said on X.

This “Paves the way for legal protections to ensure that no child in Sri Lanka suffers physical or mental violence, aligning with our commitment to safeguard the rights and well-being of every child.”

Sri Lanka allows corporal punishment under section 341 of the Penal Code which makes exceptions for a schoolmaster while section 82 of the Penal Code makes exceptions for an ‘act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or person of unsound mind, by or by consent of guardian.’

However, this has long been considered as a violation of human rights with article 19 of the United Nations Conventions of the Rights of the Child, prohibiting all forms of violence towards children. (Colombo/Apr30/2024)

### AstraZeneca admits for first time its Covid vaccine CAN cause rare side effect

April 30 (Daily Mail) - AstraZeneca has admitted in court for the first time that its Covid jab can cause a deadly blood clotting side effect.

The exceedingly rare reaction is at the heart of a multi million-pound class action by dozens of families who allege they, or their loved ones, were maimed or killed by the pharmaceutical titan's 'defective' vaccine.

Lawyers representing the claimants believe some of the cases could be worth up to £20m in compensation.

Cambridge-based AstraZeneca, which is contesting the claims, acknowledged in a legal document submitted to the High Court in February that its vaccine 'can, in very rare cases, cause TTS'.

TTS is short for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome – a medical condition where a person suffers blood clots along with a low platelet count. Platelets typically help the blood to clot.

The complication – listed as a potential side effect of the jab – has previously been called vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).
