### Seven Days In Sri Lanka: My Mother’s Life & Shadows of Betrayal

*2024-08-03 18:25:29* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/seven-days-in-sri-lanka-my-mothers-life-shadows-of-betrayal/) · `en`

Mother died three days ago. Or maybe it was the day before. I’m not sure. It feels surreal, as if she’s still present. Her absence is heavy, a palpable silence thick with the memory of her voice. In those last days, she would call out my name in the evenings at the Cancer Hospital. I flew back for her from the US to Sri Lanka. It was a gruelling 20-hour journey.

Upon landing, I was arrested at the airport. They threw me into a cramped cell with two others: a Tamilian and a man who had stolen copper wire to feed his sick mother. The wire was worth Rs.22,000 (under 75 USD). It is in my opinion a desperate act in a country declared bankrupt in 2022. The economic collapse has driven many to crime, with Colombo’s streets mired in gun violence and systemic corruption.

To dive down to the deepest lengths of education and to acknowledge its contribution to society, we all should have an understanding of what is truly meant by the term, “Education”. As far as my knowledge goes, I think we can all agree that education is not merely the studying of books. The whole point of education is to gain new knowledge. But to realize that almost everyone thinks that this knowledge can ONLY be achieved by books is truly disheartening. This fact can indeed be proved wrong by looking closely at the early stages of human civilization.
