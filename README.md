### Men of note from the minorities

*2024-08-25 01:36:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/men-of-note-from-the-minorities/) ¬∑ `en`

I was born at the very end of the nineteenth century and in my eightieth year I can look back on the careers of some of the prominent minority leaders about whom I shall say something in this article.

The names that come to mind include the brothers Ponnambalam Ramanathan and Ponnambalam Arunachalam and their kinsmen, Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy and Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy. They came from the same highly educated and successful families of Jaffna.

Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan had held the office of Solicitor-General under British rule and often acted as Attorney-General, a post reserved for officers recruited from abroad. He was a polished speaker, though in his old age he was inclined to be somewhat long-winded.

### Meetings with Gandhi and Nehru;Message from Ramgarh to Ceylon

*2024-08-25 01:33:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/meetings-with-gandhi-and-nehrumessage-from-ramgarh-to-ceylon/) ¬∑ `en`

The Ramgarh Session of the Indian National Congress, the last Session before Freedom was held in March 1940, in a small village, in Bihar Province, ‚Äúsanctified by the touch of the feet of Gautama, the Buddha‚Äù, said the Reception Committee Chairman, Rajendra Prasad, later President of Free India. I attended the Session as a delegate of the Ceylon National Congress and recorded my impressions then.

The little village of Ramgarh is today famous throughout the world. For here gathered the men and women of the new India with her beauty and her chivalry, intent on freeing their motherland from foreign rule. It was a pretty countryside that we passed through on our way, for over a hundred miles to the west of Calcutta. Ramgarh itself is very similar to Diyatalawa, undulating valleys, large plains and mountain streams abounding.

### The Ambani‚Äôs and India: A Fairytale Wedding as a Diplomatic Stage

*2024-08-25 01:24:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-ambanis-and-india-a-fairytale-wedding-as-a-diplomatic-stage/) ¬∑ `en`

Indian weddings are renown for their grandeur and extravagance, extending far beyond the union of two individuals. They are elaborate affairs that engage entire families and communities, often becoming the talk of the town. From the meticulous selection of auspicious dates to the inevitable family dynamics, these celebrations are a whirlwind of emotions and preparations.

The Ambani wedding was an exceptional example of this tradition, elevated to unprecedented heights. Spanning an astonishing seven months, it was a fairy tale-like spectacle characterized by opulence and grandeur. At its heart, however, was the solemn exchange of vows to be with each other for ‚ÄúSaat Janam‚Äù between Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant, a testament to their enduring love.

### Elections in Sri Lanka: A Preliminary Audit

*2024-08-25 01:17:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/elections-in-sri-lanka-a-preliminary-audit/) ¬∑ `en`

Sri Lankans will be voting in September, and they will be voting for the first time since 2020 or 2019 if you consider presidential elections. The economy, more specifically economic recovery, will figure as a top concern. People will be voting for candidates based on their perceptions of how well this government has done and how well they think the Opposition will do if they are given the chance. As of now, economic reforms have polarised opinion. One poll indicates that less than 10 percent ‚Äì eight, to be exact ‚Äì believe Sri Lanka is headed the right way. That leaves a staggering 92 percent who disagree or are unsure.

### What the majority want from a new government

*2024-08-25 00:45:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/what-the-majority-want-from-a-new-government/) ¬∑ `en`

Now that the presidential election is round the corner and would be followed by a general election, the majority of law-abiding, patriotic, selfless and non-partisan people would want many changes in the system to bring this country back to where it was in the early nineteen fifties.

The first thing many are clamoring for is to abolish the executive presidency. This office has been a bane rather than a boon to this country and its people. It has only helped to enrich some who achieved this position. As we can remember, there were many previous occupants of this office who promised abolish it if they were elected, but reneged on their promise.

The powers attached to the executive presidency have been misused even by those with a good educational background and we have seen how the prerogative of the presidential pardon had been utilized to pardon murderers, drug dealers, child rapists, etc.
