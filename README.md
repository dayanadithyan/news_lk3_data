### Biden stands defiant on critical night - but gaffes mar fightback

Joe Biden took to the stage at his Thursday night news conference with everything on the line ‚Äì his presidency, his re-election hopes, his political life.

If those were the stakes, he barely acknowledged them at the hour-long session to mark the end of a Nato summit, having earlier introduced Ukraine‚Äôs President Zelensky as ‚ÄúPresident Putin‚Äù at a separate event.

The news conference was his first unscripted appearance after a disastrous debate with his rival Donald Trump, leading to calls from several Democratic politicians and donors for him to drop out of the race for president.

Mr Biden, 81, has faced continuous questions over his age and ability to serve another term, which intensified after the debate.

But at the highly anticipated news conference, he dismissed the concerns about his campaign that were posed again and again by a room full of reporters, and promised that he was fighting not for his legacy, but to finish the job he started when he took office in 2021.

Vijayadasa Rajapaksa, Minister of Justice, highlighted the importance of adhering strictly to the five-year presidential term limit post-retirement, emphasizing the need to respect the constitution and avoid trivializing legal proceedings. This stance led to challenges against the 19th Amendment in the High Court, which was eventually upheld, except for requiring referendums for certain issues. Despite this, concerns over the misuse of judicial processes persist, with cases filed both in the Supreme Court and High Court in Kurunegala challenging the amendment's implementation and the appointment of judges.

Therefore, he repeatedly filed a case in the High Court regarding the president's tenure and asked not to make a mockery of the court.

The 19th Amendment of the Constitution was not properly passed in Parliament on Friday (12).

The 19th Amendment to the Constitution of 2015 was passed with the People's Order.. Most parties challenged the bill in the High Court.

The petitions were taken up for hearing in a panel of judges headed by former Chief Justice Sripavan. The court said that only four matters must go to a referendum.

The court does not oppose the government's policy of the president's tenure for five years.. Cannot be in office for even a hour after the end of office. Therefore, all sides should avoid going to the subordinate as a crisis.

Landslides also blocked routes to the area in several places, according to Bhusal. Additional rescuers and security forces have been sent to help with rescue efforts.

The buses were swept off the highway around 3 a.m. near Simaltal, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of the capital, Kathmandu.

One bus was carrying at least 24 people, while the other had at least 42, but more could have boarded en route, Bhusal said.

### Exploitation Of Desperate Hajj Pilgrims By Some Deceitful Hajj Agents

Hajj is a pilgrimage (spiritual duty) made to the Kaaba (the house of Allah) in the sacred city of Makkah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the first ten days of the holy month of Dhul Hijjah, the 12th month in the Islamic calendar. It is one of the pillars of Islam, along with believing (1) there is no god but Allah, (2) prayer, (3) almsgiving, and (4) fasting during the month of Ramadan. Hajj is not obligatory for every Muslim. It‚Äôs obligatory, at least once in a lifetime, for a Muslim if he is physically, emotionally, and financially able to perform. For anyone preparing to perform Hajj, it‚Äôs an incredibly exciting time because they believe that the first ten days of the month of Dhul Hijjah offer true Muslims the opportunity to gain immense rewards, have their sins forgiven, and reach great levels of piety. In other words, it offers the Muslims an opportunity to refresh their spiritual selves, cleanse them of their sins, and draw closer to Allah.
