ECONOMYNEXT – Employees of the State Pensions Department ask questions not within their remit, and make the rules up as they go, a government legislator has said.

“In some instances, the Department of Pensions asks questions that they do not have the legal right to ask, and therefore people do not get their pensions,” Chairman of the Sectoral Monitoring Committee for an Open and Responsible Government and Member of Parliament, Jagath Kumara Sumitraarachchi, said at a press briefing on Friday (16).

Sumitraarachchi alleged that certain employees of the department take the law into their own hands adding that there have been instances where government employees make up laws and slash pensions.

“In one instance, there was a husband and a wife who had not lived together, so the department had given a letter saying a pension could not be approved.”

“Public officials must not operate based on personal preferences,” Sumitraarachchi criticized the unethical professional conduct.
