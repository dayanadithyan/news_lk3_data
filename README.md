### Choosing between Robert Wilmot Horton and Ponnambalam Arunachalam

Changing names of places and roads bearing the names of foreigners is common in countries that have gained independence from foreign rule. Such changes can be easily justified in some cases where the foreign ruler was despotic, but in others it may be a bit tricky as both personalities may have had significant contributions to their credit.

In most cases, the personages displaced are driven into oblivion despite their contribution to society, and erased from history.

The proposed change-over from “Horton Place” in Colombo 7 to “Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam Mawatha” is justified given the yeoman service rendered by Arunachalam to Ceylon, and the fact that he resided there.

### We need a Foolproof Mechanism for Presidential Pardon

Many hailed the recent Supreme Court ruling on the case against the granting of Presidential pardon to former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva who had been convicted for the murder of former Presidential Advisor Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8, 2011, calling it a landmark judgement. However, their stand on the mater does not seem to be so different than the decision by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to grant the pardon to Silva. Both were politically driven.

The irony of the decision by former President Rajapaksa was that at the time of the murder, both Silva and Premachandra were working closely with him, one as a monitoring MP for the Defence Ministry to which Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the Secretary, and the other as the Advisor to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on trade union affairs. However, the family of Premachandra distanced themselves from the government alleging that the government of the day was siding with Silva during the investigations.

Imagine a tomorrow where Sri Lanka paves its tech avenues with 5G, virtual reality, and augmented reality — a visionary dreamscape manifesting in real-time, shaking the foundations of its economic and competitive stratum

A leap into the innovation frontier has its challenges. The lack of extensive citation networks, a shortfall in venture capital funding, and skill mismatches represent the systemic constraints strangling the pipeline of creativity and opportunity. Sri Lanka stares down these bottlenecks, aware that overcoming them is a prelude to any genuine advancement in global standing

Original BRICS member and last year’s chair of BRICS, South Africa gained the admiration and appreciation of most of the world for its moral courage and example in acting to intervene in the horrific tragedy in Gaza by taking legal action at the Hague against Israel’s “genocidal acts” in its conduct of the war, calling inter alia, for an urgent ruling in favour of the immediate suspension of hostilities.

### Measles vaccine already administered to 91% of children – Health Minister

Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana announced a staggering 91% vaccination rate for measles among children, a crucial step in combating a recent resurgence of the disease after eradication. This achievement demonstrates the country’s dedication to proactive healthcare, he said.

Speaking at a media briefing on Monday, Dr. Pathirana outlined further health priorities for 2024. Disease prevention takes centre stage, with plans to bolster primary healthcare services and improve efficiency for patients. Prompt access to essential resources is also a key focus, he stressed.

However, tackling non-communicable diseases (NCDs) remains a major challenge. Over 20% of Sri Lankans battle diabetes, and the country holds the dubious distinction of having the highest prevalence of high blood pressure among over-35s in South Asia. Addressing these concerns and their associated complications like heart disease and stroke is critical for Sri Lanka’s long-term health, the minister said.
