A rare and massive comet with a devilish nickname is set to pass by Earth for the first time in 71 years and may be visible during the highly anticipated April 8 total solar eclipse, according to NASA.

Officially named comet 12P/Pons-Brooks, the cryovolcanic comet is known as the "devil comet" due to its formation of two "horns" made up of ice and gas and periodic explosions.

Comets are made up of dust, frozen gases, ice and rocks bound together following the formation of the solar system, NASA says.

The devil comet is heading for its next perihelion passage, when it will reach its closest point to the sun and shine the brightest, on April 21, according to NASA. The agency says this astronomical event coincides with the April 8 total solar eclipse in North America, which will shadow parts of the United States from Texas to Maine when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth.

*2024-03-19 10:34:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179092) · `ta`

The upcountry parties' role and support are a topic of debate.

The CWC's support for President Wickremesinghe over the UNP indicates a shift in alliances. The TNA's demands, including housing, salaries, and land rights, highlight the government's obligations. The situation suggests a complex political landscape with shifting alliances and demands for social justice.
