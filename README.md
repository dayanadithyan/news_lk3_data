### Explosive ‚Äôdevil comet‚Äô returns for 1st time in 71 years

A rare and massive comet with a devilish nickname is set to pass by Earth for the first time in 71 years and may be visible during the highly anticipated April 8 total solar eclipse, according to NASA.

Officially named comet 12P/Pons-Brooks, the cryovolcanic comet is known as the "devil comet" due to its formation of two "horns" made up of ice and gas and periodic explosions.

Comets are made up of dust, frozen gases, ice and rocks bound together following the formation of the solar system, NASA says.

The devil comet is heading for its next perihelion passage, when it will reach its closest point to the sun and shine the brightest, on April 21, according to NASA. The agency says this astronomical event coincides with the April 8 total solar eclipse in North America, which will shadow parts of the United States from Texas to Maine when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth.

### To whom and to support the upcountry parties?

*2024-03-19 10:34:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179092) ¬∑ `ta`

The upcountry parties' role and support are a topic of debate. National parties are forming alliances, with the Tamil Progressive Alliance and Ceylon Workers Congress showing shifts in their political stances. The TNA has signed an agreement with Sajith, focusing on social justice and land rights, raising questions about the government's responsibilities. The CWC's support for President Wickremesinghe over the UNP indicates a shift in alliances. The TNA's demands, including housing, salaries, and land rights, highlight the government's obligations. The situation suggests a complex political landscape with shifting alliances and demands for social justice.

üü©

Questions about whether the first to come to the parliamentary election or the presidential election is in the minds of the people of the country. National parties are busy creating alliances. The people of the country know that no coalition other than the national power of the people. This is why Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is avoiding joining anyone in his alliance, is on the verge of not joining with whom.

In this case, what is the point of the upcountry political parties. The Tamil Progressive Alliance, which is already a coalition, is working in favor of the Sajith -led United People's Power. The Ceylon Workers Congress initially supported the coalition of many parties called the PA. Now, it is directly supporting President Ranil Wickremesinghe. For that, the CWC cannot be assumed to support the United National Party.

Due to deforestation in urban areas, Western purple-faced langurs also known as purple-faced leaf monkey are forced to use rooftops for travel in search of food and resting places, putting them at risk of encounters with dogs, people, and vehicles which can be fatal for the animals, a primatologist and behavioral ecologist said.

A recent post on social media revealed that three purple-faced langurs near Thalangama Lake were shot at, resulting in two animals succumbing to their injuries

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Smithsonian primatologist and behavioral ecologist Prof. Wolfgang Dittus said that the purple-faced langur is highly arboreal and that they come to the ground only under extreme circumstances when their arboreal pathways have been blocked by the removal of trees.

It is in this backdrop that people in urban settings now perceive Purple-faced langurs as a pest.

### Don‚Äôt cry for me Sri Lanka, if wrong people are elected - EDITORIAL

Elections have been the main focus among frontline political parties these days with the Presidential election scheduled for this year.

According to the Sri Lankan Constitution ‚Äúthe poll for the election of the President shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office.‚Äù

Since the incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe is holding office ‚Äúonly for the unexpired period of the term of office‚Äù of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the term in this case is considered to be the term of President Rajapaksa who was sworn in on November 18, 2019. Hence the next Presidential election should be held between September 18 and October 18 this year.

### African debt crisis and lessons for Lanka

In the last two decades since Arrighi wrote his seminal article, Sri Lanka and many African countries have been on the same path of commercial borrowing. The process has resulted in the extraction of more wealth and further exacerbated balance of payment problems, even as the elite in these countries sprawl in luxurious consumption.

Crisis and despair push us to learn rapidly and that is true of debt crisis as well. But whom do we learn from and whom do we work with to find solutions to the crisis?

The IMF team in all their pomp are again visiting Sri Lanka. Their tutelage continues to be the same for us as many other countries in debt distress‚Äîausterity, repaying creditors and promoting free markets.
