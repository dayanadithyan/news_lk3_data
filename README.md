“As a result, there is an estimate that a surprising 17 billion US dollar financing gap for women-owned MSMEs in Sri Lanka.

“The gender gap in employment and entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka continues to affect women’s economic empowerment opportunities and their resilience to economic shocks.”

### Sri Lanka says imputed rental tax will not apply to all

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s planned imputed rental tax will only apply to wealthier persons, according to a Finance Ministry statement.

Wealth taxes, which have been implemented in a number of other countries, have had detrimental impacts on housing as well as other negative fallouts, partly due to the lack of cashflows to pay such taxes.

“The envisaged property tax is in an advanced stage of design and therefore, it is premature to outline specific details of rates and thresholds,” the Finance Ministry said.

“However, the focus of this tax is on high wealth individuals, and not on average income earners.

“This objective will be achieved by a suitable tax-free threshold to ensure that the tax is targeted on very high value property or multiple properties that are owned by wealthy members of society.

Most assets have been built out of earnings already taxed by the state. Taxes that penalize thrift in general tend to have negative consequences, critics say.
