Colombo, March 28 (Daily Mirror) - Following the exclusive revelation by the Daily Mirror on Tuesday that the presidential election will be conducted in the first week of October, MPs from across the divide - except those from the National People’s Power (NPP) - have ramped up efforts to prevail upon President Ranil Wickremesinghe to declare a snap general election as early as possible.

Earlier, Basil Rajapaksa of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), requested the President in his one on one meeting that the parliamentary election should precede the presidential election. In his calculation, a parliamentary election at this juncture is more advantageous to his party than a presidential election which is slated to be conducted before October 17.

### The digital road to heaven

Developing digital public infrastructure – a critical measure to accelerate economic growth

Infrastructure development is a fundamental for economic growth. Any country seeking to improve its people’s lives must invest in infrastructure to ensure free and speedy movement of goods and services. Trade and commerce and therefore economic growth depend on such developments.

So historically the road to economic heaven has been literally that – building of roads, and other infrastructure for free and easy movement of goods. And this kind of development took years. Sometimes decades before its fruits could be tasted by the common man.

It’s the same in 2024. Except the new road that promises a speedy compressed gateway to economic heaven is also digital. And digital infrastructure building is fast becoming a way of catapulting and accelerating economic development.

“A. K. Dissanayake increasingly has the demeanour of a national leader…”Prof. Mick Moore, OBE

‘Why Bharat Matters’, matters. The new book by one of the world’s most outstanding and admired foreign ministers, India’s Dr. S. Jaishankar, makes clear the centrality of Ramayana mythology within ‘Bharat’ as BJP’s India and BJP worldview. Cosmology dominates ideology.

In an ambitious exegetical enterprise, Dr. Jaishankar strives to confer the (non-secular) Ramayana a methodological and intellectual status as a strategic text that is implicitly above Kautilya’s (secular) Arthashasthra, a Realist classic. A tough sell, that.

The prism through which the island of Lanka is ineluctably viewed by Bharat;

Visible appetite for credit, as rates have come to levels palatable to borrowers

The Central Bank has been caught off guard by the break in the months-long expansion seen in the private sector credit in January and considered it to be a one-off development and attributed it to the appreciation of the rupee and after-season settlement of facilities by the borrowers.

The seven-month-long streak in the continuous growth in the credit offered to the private sector from the licensed commercial banks (LCBs) broke down in January, when the net credit to the private sector contracted by Rs.52.2 billion, after growing by slightly over Rs.100 billion in December 2023.

It is not the country per se, but the politicians and the people who are wrong. While politicians should take 70 percent responsibility, the people also should take the rest or 30 percent. It is true that these wrongs on the part of the politicians or the people are not limited to Sri Lanka. Even in a country like Australia where I now live, there are intermittent corruption, crime, gender abuse, killing, and misguided politics. However, the difference is extremely vast. Sri Lanka’s wrongs are perhaps 50 times higher than a country like Australia.

More than 750,000 cars and vehicles passed through Baltimore in the last year, he told Radio 4’s The World Tonight.

*2024-03-27 22:58:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179849) · `ta`

Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa argues that the 1972 Constitution's abolition of the Senate system led to ethnic problems. He suggests discussing its reinstatement, citing the need for a system like the Senate to foster ethnic harmony.

🟩

In the 1972 Constitution, the Senate system was canceled in our country.Senate's abolition was a reason for the ethnic problem. Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa said that the Senate should be discussed.

He was speaking at a discussion held in Colombo yesterday evening on the new election amendment.

The existing electoral system in the country must be changed. 994, 2015 elections and many other occasions were recommended to change this election system. It has been proposed to elect 160 MPs in the new electoral system and 65 MPs under the proportional system.

The Regulatory Act on Election Costs is currently permitted. The authority to implement it belongs to the Election Commission. At the same time, some say that the comment on changing the electoral system is to retrose the election. This electoral system is not going to take any election in any way. All party leaders should discuss and decide on electoral change.

### Has evolution found ways to prevent cancer and halt progression to old age?

*2024-03-27 22:56:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/has-evolution-found-ways-to-prevent-cancer-and-halt-progression-to-old-age/) · `en`

The high incidence of cancer alarms us. Around six percent of the human population worldwide suffers from cancer. It is the most challenging health issue to resolve and the leading cause of death, only second to cardiovascular disease. More than 10 million people die of cancer every year. In some regions, cancer deaths exceed heart disease mortality because of the availability of more successful preventive and curative measures for the latter.

With all these fears, the relief and the promise are cancers occur less frequently than expected. Many live beyond 100 years without contracting cancer but die because of other natural causes. Animals also get cancer, but there are species exceptionally resistant to it. And evolution has found solutions to suppress malignancy. Following them would be a hopeful avenue to prevent and cure this dreadful malady.

### Tropical Hydration Smoothie

*2024-03-27 22:52:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/tropical-hydration-smoothie/) · `en`

Phew! The heat! Yes, that’s what everyone keeps saying these days. And the heat is awful, indeed.

With the heat situation hardly showing signs of improving, I thought of giving my readers something different this week.

Now place the pineapple chunks, mango chunks, banana, and coconut water in a blender. (If you are using spinach, add the handful of spinach as that would give an extra nutritional boost.)

Blend all ingredients, on high speed, until you achieve a smooth consistency. If the smoothie is too thick, you can add more coconut water to reach your desired thickness.

This smoothie is excellent for keeping your body hydrated, especially during this hot weather. Coconut water is rich in electrolytes, which help maintain hydration levels.

Pineapple and mango are both rich sources of Vitamin C. Vitamin C is essential for collagen production, which is crucial for maintaining skin elasticity and promoting skin repair.

### Powering the Future: Innovations driving the Electric Vehicle revolution

*2024-03-27 22:23:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/powering-the-future-innovations-driving-the-electric-vehicle-revolution/) · `en`

New Energy Vehicles (NEV) are no longer a futuristic vision; they’re rapidly transforming the automotive landscape. This shift wouldn’t be possible without ground-breaking innovations that have addressed key challenges and made NEVs more efficient, safer, and sustainable. Leading the charge in these advancements is BYD, a company proving that electric mobility is not just feasible but the future.

Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) Batteries: A Safer, Longer-Lasting Power Source

One of the biggest hurdles EVs faced was battery technology. Traditional Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, while effective, carried concerns about potential thermal runaway (overheating). BYD emerged as a pioneer in LFP batteries, a Li-ion variant offering several advantages. LFP batteries boast superior thermal and chemical stability, significantly reducing the risk of fire. Additionally, they offer a longer lifespan and better tolerance for extreme temperatures, making them ideal for diverse climates.
