### AKD‚Äôs speech on police and rule of law: Merits and demerits

Anura Kumara Dissanayake‚Äôs (AKD) speech as the Leader of the National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) at the National Convention organised by the Retired Police Officers Collective on 9 June 2024 is quite promising in terms of establishing or reestablishing rule of law in the country, if they get the opportunity to govern the nation. They have been talking about a ‚Äòsystem change‚Äô now for some time, and various independent critics and observers were asking the details of this promise, without merely depending on the slogan.

I was fortunate to listen to this speech online and live, through ‚ÄòHorawa News,‚Äô and one weakness or wrong that I immediately observed was its leading phrase ‚ÄòMalimawa shows its police power.‚Äô I have no idea about who runs the ‚ÄòHorawa,‚Äô but that was not what AKD was quite obviously advocating. ‚ÄòPower‚Äô is not a good word to use in democracy, worst still is the ‚Äòpolice power.‚Äô

‚ÄòIs There Another Way? Debt Restructuring, the IMF and the Future of Sri Lanka‚Äô, was the title and topic of the most educative, enlightening public policy event of this year. Organised by Yukthi a newish civic association spearheaded by Ahilan Kadirgamar, Ermiza Tegal and Melanie Gunatilleke, it featured three top-notch international economists, Prof. Jayati Ghosh, Prof. Martin Guzman --former Economics Minister of Argentina-- and Charles Abugre. (https://www.youtube.com/live/3SF2L0nh_l4?si=G7D82fcNI2YSxu5A)

Watching the video, my wife Sanja and I had the same thought: these experts and not Lazard et al, should be our advisors on debt restructuring and consultants on our negotiating team, and our negotiating team should certainly not be the current one.

My key takeaways from what Ghosh, Guzman and Abugre said were:

Each country must do its own expert research rather than blindly accept the IMF narrative.

### Sri Lanka president needs referendum to extend his tenure: Justice Minister

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe will need a referendum if he needs to extend his tenure by one year despite an error in the constitution‚Äôs 19th amendment when it was passed in 2015, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.

Speculations have been on rise that the island nation‚Äôs constitution could allow President Wickremesinghe to extend his tenure by one year due to a mistake in the constitution, which was approved with more than two-third majority.

While all references to the six-year terms of both the president and parliament were changed to five years in line with the 19th Amendment, Article 83(b) was overlooked and left unchanged, giving a loophole to extend his term for President Wickremesinghe.

However, Minister Rajapakshe said despite an inconsistency, the rulers need both two-third majority and referendum to change 9 clauses in the constitution which also include the people‚Äôs voting right.
