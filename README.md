### Surprise defeat for far-right in France in MacronтАЩs snap election gambit

ECONOMYNEXT тАФ President Emanuel MacronтАЩs gamble in calling a snap poll somewhat paid off after a left-wing alliance secured the highest number of seats in the French parliament, effectively defeating an alliance led by the far-right National Rally.

The Economist reported that Marine Le PenтАЩs National Rally (RN)-led bloc, which was widely anticipated to top the voting, will now end up in third place, securing 134 to 152 seats. However, this is still a major win for the once-fringe party which only held 88 seats in the outgoing parliament, indicating the mainstreaming of its hard-right ideology.

A left-wing alliance led by Jean-Luc Melenchon is projected to have secured 171-187 seats after what CNN has called tactical voting in SundayтАЩs second round election. CNN noted that France will be left in political limbo after no party came close to winning an absolute majority.

### Presidential pardons: an unchecked executive power

*2024-07-08 11:07:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/presidential-pardons-an-unchecked-executive-power/) ┬╖ `en`

A pardon is defined in BlackтАЩs Law Dictionary тАШas an act of graceтАЩ. In the Oxford Dictionary it is defined as an тАЬaction of forgiving or remission of the legal consequences of an offence or convictionтАЭ. Some argue that the power to grant a pardon is a check on the powers of the judiciary rectifying any miscarriage of justice. But this executive power unchecked could result in the abuse of power.

In recent times, President Sirisena granted two pardons тАУ one within six months and the other within nine days of relinquishing office while President Gotabay Rajapaksa granted two pardons тАУ one within four months of becoming president and the other seven months after he received a two thirds majority in Parliament.

Aseni:┬аGrandpa, I have listened to the address of President Ranil Wickremesinghe to the nation last month and to the Parliament early this month over the success of his Government in reaching an agreement with bilateral creditors to restructure Sri LankaтАЩs external debt.

### Worsening external deficit to improve fiscal deficit: Jumping from frying pan into the fire

*2024-07-08 00:31:31* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Worsening-external-deficit-to-improve-fiscal-deficit-Jumping-from-frying-pan-into-the-fire/4-763944) ┬╖ `en`

Are we taking the right measures to address the debt problem?

After a disastrous handling of the economy during and in the immediate aftermath of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021, the then President was unceremoniously (and possibly justifiably) removed from office. But is the economy on the right track since then?

The relative stability of the economy since mid-2022 was broadly due to the following:

2. Increase in rainfall in mid-2022, which eased the power cuts. As the rainfall reduced towards the end of 2022, electricity tariff was increased sharply which reduced demand.

3. Halt of service of foreign debt which decreased foreign currency outflows.

4. Exorbitant increase in interest rates and depreciation of currency in mid-2022 which plummeted demand for imports and eased foreign currency outflows. While interest rates have fallen sharply in recent months, Rupee has also strengthened to an extent.

### Will environmentalists stall new 50MW Mannar wind power project?

Instead of protesting against an RE project, which will contribute to Sri LankaтАЩs much needed energy security and take us a step forward towards freedom from fossil fuels, why arenтАЩt these protestors doing some real environmental work on the ground?

Recently a group of environmentalists and a religious leader approached the Supreme Court against a renewable energy project to come up in the countryтАЩs north.

Environmentalists rallying against a renewable energy project is odd. As they should be against fossil fuel-based projects and push for a quicker energy transition for Sri Lanka to achieve its goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.

Throughout its post-independence history, Sri Lanka has been a big consumer and a bad saver

The Central Bank alone had a foreign debt obligation of $ 6 billion, converting its foreign reserves to a net negative position of $ 2.5 billion. The country should repay all its foreign debt when it will become due, not merely the central government foreign debt. It would have been better had the President spoken of the total country foreign debt position as the Head of the State without confining himself to a small fraction of the central government debt
