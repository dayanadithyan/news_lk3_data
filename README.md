Colombo, March 23 (Daily Mirror) - A General Election will be held if the members of Parliament want an early dissolution of Parliament, Senior Presidential Advisor Ashu Marasinghe said yesterday.

“A General Election could be held if the MPs adopt a resolution calling for the dissolution of Parliament,” Professor Marasinghe said in response to a question raised by the journalists on the reports which said former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and President Ranil Wickremesinghe had come to an agreement on elections.

“Only a Presidential Election could be held within this year legally while there is more time for a General Election. A resolution has to be passed calling for the dissolution of Parliament if an early General Election is to be held. One wonders whether MPs would adopt a resolution,” he said.

It’s growing hotter by the day. Last Saturday the temperature in Colombo rose to around 89 degrees Fahrenheit.

Forecasters have predicted that there will be no let-up in the spell of hot weather. Rather they are warning that temperatures will rise further by April when the sun will be directly over Lanka.

Doctors also warn the public to avoid strenuous labour, to wear white clothing that absorbs solar energy and drink more water. A difficulty here is that our reservoirs are running low on water supplies. The Department of Irrigation is requesting the public to reduce the consumption of water!

The irony of it all is that the Department of Meteorology warned us of the impending dry spell around mid-last year. In this column we have constantly drawn attention to the need to dredge our ancient tanks and the need for clearing waterways which feed the tanks, thereby enhancing the collection of greater quantities of water.

Chapter I of the Constitution specifies, the people, the state and sovereignty.

However, the mandate given to both Executive and Legislator has been grossly violated undermining people’s power delegated to elected

Russia launched one of its biggest missile and drone barrages on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure overnight into Friday since the start of its full-scale invasion more than two years ago.

Ukrainian officials said at least 10 of the country’s regions were struck in an attack targeting power supplies in multiple towns and cities, including Kharkiv in the east, Odesa on the coast and Kryvyi Rih in the center.

The attacks have left well over 1 million households without electricity Friday morning, according to reports from multiple regional authorities. Only Kyiv and the northwest of the country were spared.

Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had “launched a massive strike” on Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex” in response to recent strikes on Russia’s territory. Ukraine’s military – as well as pro-Ukrainian groups of Russian fighters – have this month targeted Russia’s border regions of Belgorod and Kursk, forcing schools to close and residents to evacuate.

In 2009 we inaugurated the Elephant Information Centre at the Elephant Transit Home in Uda Walawe. It was the first time Sri Lanka’s Department of Wildlife Conservation was able to engage visitors with the story of elephants. Last Saturday, it was thrilling – 15 years later – to do as my son Amrit and I in 2009, building on the success of the unique facility with the renewed Dilmah Conservation ‘Elephant Knowledge Walk’.

The question hung in the 40 degree heat, as renowned Elephant Conservationist Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya explained the significance of elephants, why a tea company should invest in a long-term partnership for the conservation of Sri Lankan elephants in isolated Uda Walawe.
