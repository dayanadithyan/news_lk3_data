### Income tax payment methods limited

*2024-04-30 05:00:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Income-tax-payment-methods-limited/108-281618) ¬∑ `en`

As per the recently issued gazette notification, the income tax payments can only be made using three methods.

The methods are by depositing cash, depositing pay order or bank draft or by the use of Online Tax Payment Platform (OTPP).

While previously tax payments may have been made by cheque, the recent gazette notification does not identify payments via this avenue as an accepted method.

Accordingly, the income tax payments, including payment of taxes administrated under the Inland Revenue Department, will not be allowed to be made by cheque.

However, the payment methods highlighted in the April 4 gazette only apply to the tax payments under the provisions of Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017. That is for Corporate Income Tax, Personal Income Tax, Withholding Tax, Advance Personal Income Tax and Capital Gain Tax.

The payments of other taxes such as Value Added Tax, Social Security Contribution Levy, Stamp Duty and others can continue to be paid by cheque.

Colombo, April 29 (Daily Mirror) - The political parties should publicize their election manifestos well in advance of any election, be it a Presidential or Parliamentary poll, to create a better and responsible political culture in the country, the Peoples' Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) said.

What is actually happening in Sri Lanka right now is that the political parties present their policy statements merely a month or so in advance of an election. Thus, the public will get no chance to build a fruitful discussion on them, the polls observer said.

Executive Director PAFFREL Rohana Hettiarachchi made these remarks while addressing a programme held in Colombo to raise awareness on creating a responsible political culture by encouraging political parties to present responsible and timely policy statements.

The National Peace Council (NPC) in a statement said yesterday that the international role in ascertaining the truth of the 2019 Easter Sunday tragedy remains relevant even today.

On April 21, the country marked the fifth anniversary of the tragic Easter Sunday bombing that claimed the lives of approximately 300 persons and left more than 500 others injured and maimed. The enduring consequences of the Easter Sunday bombing need to be kept in mind. The economic repercussions, stemming from the decline in foreign investments and tourism, continue to haunt the country, contributing to the economic challenges faced today. The National Peace Council is particularly concerned that the erosion of trust in Government leadership, exacerbated by perceived failures in accountability and transparency, remains a pressing concern for all citizens. Unfortunately, this leads to frustration and loss of faith in the system, which can also lead to further injustices.

### A call to end  ‚ÄòCorporal Punishment‚Äô  and create a fear-free childhood

School and home are the places where children spend most of the time of the day; hence corporal punishment should be absent in both places and they should feel safe in such environments

Research unequivocally shows that corporal punishment is linked to adverse outcomes, including increased aggression, poorer mental health, and diminished cognitive development, which could result in long-term psychological issues and social dysfunctions, ultimately contributing to a cycle of violence that affects the broader society and future generations

A study on the perceptions of Sri Lankan parents on the use of corporal punishment (2012) found that 74 per cent of parents resort to corporal punishment

The alternatives are rooted in communication, understanding, and mutual respect

When land-based feudalism replaced urbanism and trade, Buddhism waned in India, says Indian scholar Balkrishna Govind Gokhale

In sixth century BC, Buddhism thrived in the Gangetic Plain in North India due to urbanisation and the development of trade. According to the renowned scholar of Buddhism in India, Balkrishna Govind Gokhale, Buddhism began to decline in India when urbanisation and trade yielded place to feudalism.

In his paper in the Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies (Vol Number 2, 1982, University of Wisconsin Madison), Gokhale says that the use of iron tools, beginning from the seventh century BC, increased agricultural productivity, which in turn led to larger commodity surpluses, which became available for exchange through trade.

*2024-04-29 22:53:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/fahmy-doing-ithis-way/) ¬∑ `en`

Fahmy Nazick will be seen in action at the Anchorman‚Äôs 20th Anniversary Gala Dinner Dance, on 31st, May, in Canada, and he is eagerly looking forward to entertaining the large crowd expected with his style of music.

Says Fahmy: ‚ÄúLots of events are taking place but not my style of music. I have nothing against oriental music but that seems to be the trend now.

‚ÄúIn fact, Binara, from Binara and the Clan, reached out to me recently and is keen to organise a dance and have me doing all my style of music because he says that some of the audience may not even know what western music is like.

Fahmy is a classy singer whose style of singing covers the Elvis Presley/Jim Reeves era.

*2024-04-29 22:53:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/redeemersbig-scene-this-year-as-well/) ¬∑ `en`

The year 2023 was a happening scene for the band Redeemers, especially their tour of Australia in July/August.

The Sri Lankans, in that part of the world, went ga-ga over their music and there were lots of positive comments, on social media, about their performance, Down Under.

They were also seen in action, in Bahrain, in November of last year.

According to a spokesman for the band, the Redeemers have got some foreign assignments coming up this year, as well.

‚ÄúThere are about four-plus countries that we are negotiating with and, hopefully, 2024 will be another good year for the band where overseas trips are concerned‚Äù.

### May Day, May Day! Collective Rights versus Individual Rights

Weakening labour rights and a race to the bottom is never a recipe for inclusive, equitable and sustainable development

When employers are permitted to collectively represent their interests, it is an implicit acknowledgement that there is unity in strength. If so, why should workers, weakly placed in the labour contract, evidenced by the fact that they do not earn a living wage, currently in a poverty trap and earning poverty wages, be curtailed from union representation? The few unions in the apparel sector do have to change their officer constituency and make them more representative of their workers. We are aware that unions need change, but that does not mean we throw the baby out with the bathwater

Following is a statement by UNITE ‚Äì (a coalition of trade unions and mass movements) on May Day, pledging to fight against the inequalities which exist amongst us, and forging a struggle against the neoliberal State and international world order, which dispossess the working people

On 4 May 1886, workers in Chicago staged a protest in the Haymarket Square, fighting for an eight-hour workday. Workers withstood brutal attacks by the police and sacrificed their lives and bodies to make the eight-hour workday a reality. All of us in Sri Lanka enjoy an eight-hour work day, which became one of our fundamental rights as working people as a result of the struggles and sacrifices of our predecessors. Today, we have come full circle where our Government and employers are drafting a new labour law shredding sanctified labour rights, including the eight-hour workday, under the guise of a single Employment Act.

Today, I stand at the intersection of corporate leadership and social responsibility, deeply reflecting on the vital role we play in shaping a society that cherishes and protects its most vulnerable members‚Äîour children. Today, 30 April, is the International Day to End Corporal Punishment and I invite you to join me on a journey of reflection, action and commitment towards eradicating this deep-rooted societal ill.

A study on the perceptions of Sri Lankan parents on the use of corporal punishment (2012) found that 74% of parents resort to corporal punishment and believed it to be a necessary means of disciplining children. Meanwhile, a National Child Protection Authority (2017) study on disciplinary methods practiced in Sri Lankan schools found that 8 out of 10 students have experienced at least one episode of corporal punishment in the school setting.

Out of all the Lankan politicians, the most baffling case for me is Ranil Wickremesinghe. I mean, what leadership theory can explain his behaviour? What management theory can predict his actions? How can the same man ruin his party beyond repair and still become the president of a country? Who would even believe this stuff? It simply doesn‚Äôt add up, which makes it an interesting topic for research. Let‚Äôs try to analyse this anomaly, this outlier.

Well, for starters, Ranil is one tough cookie. The man knows how to survive in the treacherous hellhole of politics. He‚Äôll climb over dead bodies or lie under dead bodies, depending on the situation, just to live another day. I mean, think about all the UNP leaders who died along the way. But Ranil survived. Maybe that‚Äôs it. The whole of RW phenomena can be defined with just that simple explanation. But I think it‚Äôs more complicated than that.

### Pope will decide on Cardinal Ranjith‚Äôs retirement date: Fr. Jude Krishantha

Colombo, April 29 (Daily Mirror) - Pope Francis will decide as to when Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith should retire, Director of Communications, the Archdiose of Colombo Fr. Jude Krishantha said today.

"It is the Pope who will decide as to when Cardinal Ranjith should go on retirement and the latter has no say in it," Fr. Krishantha told the media.

"Every Bishop is bound to inform the Pope that he has reached the retirement age when they become 75. Therefore, Cardinal Ranjith informed one and a half years ago that he had completed his 75th year. However, the Pope had told him to continue as the Archbishop of Colombo for some more time as he is still lively. In the meantime, a Cardinal can remain active and can vote at a conclave to elect a new Pope until he reaches the age of 80. This is the tradition of the Catholic Church," he added.

The rating is driven by Fitch‚Äôs expectation of extraordinary support from Union Bank of Colombo PLC, which owns 89.9 percent of UB Finance.

‚ÄúUBF‚Äôs rating is constrained by our view that any support required may be more of a burden relative to UB‚Äôs modest balance sheet size, compared with other Fitch-rated financial leasing companies owned by larger banks,‚Äù Fitch said in its assessment.

While participating as the chief guest at the launch of the official internet radio channel of the National Institute of Education (NIE Visual Radio) at the Maharagama National Institute of Education, the Minister said the decision was taken due to the closure of schools during the last Covid pandemic and according to the programme to cover up missed studies and school examination schedules.

The aim of action is to prevent undue delays, such as possible delays for schoolchildren to enter the university, and to restore the studies that were missed during the last Covid period.

The Minister said that therefore everyone's support and dedication are essential to make this successful.
