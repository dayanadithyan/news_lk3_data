### The Muslim community should consider and decide who to support Muslim political leaders in the presidential election -Faizer Mustafa

*2024-08-23 18:11:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191825) ¬∑ `ta`

Faizer Mustafa urges the Muslim community to thoughtfully choose their support in the presidential election, cautioning against blind loyalty to Muslim leaders. He criticizes the dual stance of Muslim party leaders supporting both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa, suggesting this divides the community. Mustafa emphasizes the importance of the community making informed decisions based on national interests rather than following political leaders' endorsements blindly.

üü©

The Muslim community should consider and make a decision in the presidential election. Former minister Faisal Mustafa said that Muslim leaders should not support any candidate by blaming the Muslim community.

He was speaking at a press conference held at his party office on Friday (23) in Colombo.

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has decided to support President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the upcoming presidential election. I am with the party's decision. However, the leaders of the Muslim parties are with Sajith Premadasa, but their MPs are with Ranil Wickremesinghe. This is a double -standing policy of the leaders of the Muslim political parties.

The leaders of the Muslim parties must have sent the other members to support Ranil Wickremesinghe.

He was speaking at a campaign meeting held on Friday (23) in the Varakapola constituency in Kegalle district.

Government officials have seen state officials as a burden to the country. But now the state officials are important to this government. This is opportunism. The current government is working to deceive state officials to retain their positions.

A few months ago, the state service was ineffective and the number of state officials would be reduced and they were burden to the country. But today the same people are making fake promises. We will not make fake promises to do so. Let us do everything that says.

### India‚Äôs Modi meets Zelensky on historic Ukraine visit, pushes for end to war

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Ukraine‚Äôs leader Volodymyr Zelensky on a historic visit to Kyiv on Friday, where he is pushing for a solution to end more than two years of war with Russia.

Modi embraced Zelensky ‚Äì who looked visibly emotional ‚Äì at the Mariinsky palace in Kyiv, in the first ever visit by an Indian premier to Ukraine.

The Indian leader is casting himself as a possible peacemaker between Moscow and Kyiv.

But his visit comes at a dramatic moment in the two-and-a-half year war, with a diplomatic settlement appearing more elusive than ever.

Kyiv‚Äôs forces are mounting a major incursion into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region while Moscow‚Äôs army is advancing in eastern Ukraine, claiming to have seized a swathe of towns and villages in recent weeks.

‚ÄúNo problem can be resolved on a battlefield,‚Äù Modi said in Poland on Wednesday before heading to Ukraine.

India, he said, supports ‚Äúdialogue and diplomacy for restoration of peace and stability as soon as possible‚Äù.

Not only that, they are ready to get down on the field. In Jaffna, I have spoken to many members of the Tamil party's youth team.

They are sure to carry out this. Sridharan from Kilinochchi has congratulated the common candidate. Already, meetings - have been gathered in Kilinochchi.

Senathirajah, who is also the leader, has welcomed this. Therefore, the majority of the TNA have welcomed this.

Some people oppose their own reasons. In particular, Chanakyan has said that the Sri Lankan government has given him the development of the government.

It appears that even as the Muslim party leaders are losing their hold over their MPs, the Muslim parties themselves are beginning to lose their grip on their voters

Nominations have closed for the long awaited 2024 Presidential election. 39 candidates are in the fray. It is widely acknowledged by the press and public that the chief presidential contenders are incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, leader of the opposition Sajith Premadasa and JVP/NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

In a true democracy, the selection of candidates and the election process should involve the entire population equally. Unfortunately, our current election rules allow only a select few to become candidates without requiring any public endorsement, such as a stepwise regional election process within the party. Our system favours existing politicians and makes it virtually impossible to register a political party to address specific issues. It is a significant obstacle to a fair and inclusive democratic process. Despite the wishes expressed by the ordinary people during ‚ÄòAragalaya 2022,‚Äô we are left with mostly the same 225 candidates to choose from once again, a situation that should concern us all.

We the undersigned call upon all candidates contesting the forthcoming 2024 Presidential election to firmly and publicly commit to the abolition of the executive presidential system within the first year of the next Parliament.

The experience of 46 years of the operation of the 1978 Constitution shows that the executive presidential system has not delivered on any of the aims for which it was introduced: accelerated and sustained economic growth and development; communal harmony; and political stability. Executive presidentialism has only had a negligible impact on development. It has worsened rather than improved peace and stability, by accelerating ethnic conflict and making our political system prone to frequent crises.

In Sri Lanka, where women make up approximately 52% of the population, significant challenges remain in achieving gender parity within the entrepreneurial sector. Currently, women represent only 27% of the workforce, with even fewer in leadership roles. Events like this are vital in addressing these disparities by offering women a platform to connect, collaborate, and succeed in the business arena.
