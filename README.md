No political leader has been subjected to vilification and character assassination like RW in the history of this country

Two years ago, Sri Lanka was in a complete state of anarchy. The nation was undergoing its worst economic and political crisis in its contemporary history. People died while they were languishing in long queues to buy fuel, powdered milk, gas cylinders, and various other essentials. Schools and universities were not functioning, and the future of the youth and children appeared bleak. The first half of 2022 was one of the most unfortunate periods in the history of the island, characterised by despair, grief, and severe turmoil, which nobody in the country even wants to recall.

This highly-publicised law and order operation was viewed by critics as an attempt to gain political mileage by the President and privileges by relevant ministers and public officials

The incident brought the issue of law and order to the forefront of the public discourse and news cycle. These developments have imparted more purchase for the ‘Yukthiya’ operation, a war on drugs spearheaded by Minister of Public Affairs Tiran Alles.

Substitution of the words, “to over five years” replacing “to over six years” is yet another amendment replacing the original provision giving an entirely different version amounting to a complete change

The issue is centred on the controversy over the term of office of the President and the period of continuity of the Parliament once elected.

Already two parties have gone before the Supreme Court invoking determination on the consistency with the Constitution of repealing and replacing Article 30, under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, certified on 15 May, 2015.

Leaving the argumentation part to the more qualified legal profession I intend to set out below the issues concerning the matter about which there is a growing strong dispute debated in public and the media.
