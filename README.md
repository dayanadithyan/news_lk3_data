President Joe Biden is hosting Jordan’s King Abdullah II in Washington Monday and the two leaders are expected to discuss the ongoing effort to free hostages held in Gaza, and growing concern over a possible Israeli military operation in the port city of Rafah.

It is the first meeting between the allies since three American troops were killed last month in a drone strike against a U.S. base in Jordan. Biden blamed Iran-backed militias for the fatalities, the first for the U.S. after months of strikes by such groups against American forces across the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.

The meeting with King Abdullah II comes as Biden and his aides are working to broker another pause in Israel’s war against Hamas in order to send humanitarian aid and supplies into the region and get hostages out. The White House faces growing criticism from Arab-Americans over the administration’s continued support for Israel in the face of growing casualties in Gaza.

Parliament, Feb. 11 (Daily Mirror)- The Privilege Committee of Parliament has recommended that Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne and Army Commander Vikum Liyanage must apologise to Parliamentarian Chandima Weerakkody for making threatening statements against the MP during a committee meeting inside the Parliament Complex.

The Privilege Committee has issued the recommendation after investigating into a privilege issue raised by MP Weerakkody in Parliament last October, stating that the Defence Secretary and the Army Commander had threatened him at the meeting of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security chaired by MP Sarath Weerasekara on October 5, 2023.

The MP had told Parliament that he had mentioned at the particular Committee meeting that reducing the expenses of high-ranking military officers was better than reducing the number of soldiers to reduce the defence budget and that the Defence Secretary had made a threatening statement when he had said so.
