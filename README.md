"It is clear that an election is near and politicians tend to inject all their saved black money into the upcoming election campaigns and it has become a good time for the people who engage with money laundering activities.

"Accordingly, we have some doubts on how Piumi Hansamal managed to get the Range Rover vehicle (CBH 1949) which was used by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

"The question arises whether the Range Rover vehicle was given to the former president or if Gotabaya has given it to Piyumi," said Mahawatta and further alleged that the model currently resides in a super luxury apartment, owns other properties and leads an exceedingly luxurious lifestyle.

The Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) is presently facing the heat as allegations have surfaced that the party is forcing Estate Superintendents within the estate community to select members loyal to the CWC as beneficiaries for an Indian grant which gives houses funded by the Indian government.

Reliable sources told the Daily Mirror that under this Indian housing grant, those individuals who have left the estates, those who already have houses and reside in the estates, but work for other private entities are not eligible for these houses.

"But sources linked to the project said they have come under tremendous pressure from the CWC to give houses to individuals falling into these categories; which is not the requirement of the Indian Government.

"What we were told by the Indian High Commission offices is to select the most suitable beneficiaries, but not to do it based on affiliation to any trade union," sources said.

### Addressing gender inequality key priority for Sri Lanka: ADB

*2024-04-17 04:24:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Addressing-gender-inequality-key-priority-for-Sri-Lanka-ADB/108-280806) ¬∑ `en`

As Sri Lanka looks to reach higher growth aspirations, addressing gender inequality is a key priority, the Asian Development Bank said.

In an economically active population of 8.5 million in 2022, female labour force participation in Sri Lanka was only 32.1 percent, down from 33.6 percent in 2018 prior to the economic crisis.

Key reasons for this include lack of safe and affordable childcare facilities, inadequate provision for flexible working hours, onerous household responsibilities and care duties socially imposed on women, and public transport inadequacies for women.

‚ÄúWhile the private sector has addressed these shortcomings to some extent, the government can tackle gender inequality through a more supportive framework for female labour participation by introducing flexible work hours and mandating equal pay, the ADB said in its recent outlook report.

### What I learnt and what Tamil political leaders never learnt

*2024-04-17 03:11:08* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-I-learnt-and-what-Tamil-political-leaders-never-learnt/4-760701) ¬∑ `en`

Who is responsible for emerging religious extremism in Tamil North? Let me tell you, it‚Äôs the callously irresponsible Colombo resident Tamil leaderships. In democratic electoral politics, the strength of leaderships lies in how open and committed they stand against injustice and for democratic and fundamental rights. In Sinhala South, mainstream political leaderships took over majoritarian extremism. In post-war Tamil politics, established political leaders failing to stand with their people allows religious extremism.

### Broadening medical education: Who‚Äôs paying, and for what?

*2024-04-17 03:07:36* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Broadening-medical-education-Who-s-paying-and-for-what/4-760700) ¬∑ `en`

What is required for medical education is a decentralised incentive-based solution that makes the best use of taxpayer funds

According to the University Grants Commission (UGC), the second most expensive undergraduate degree program offered by state universities is the MBBS (after dental). Battles over who gets to be a doctor under what terms have been ongoing since the 1980s with no clear resolution. Workaround measures implemented at various times are posing significant challenges, which are being met with further ad hoc remedies, the latest being the Cabinet decision to allow students satisfying UGC requirements to be admitted to the Kotelawala Defence University‚Äôs (KDU) medical faculty.
