Colombo, March 10 (Daily Mirror)- The book released by Gotabaya Rajapaksa on an alleged Conspiracy to Oust him is the latest attempt by the “president who ran away” to paint an image of innocence,National Unity Alliance said.

A statement issued by the National Unity Alliance said  the seventh executive president was ousted by the people of Sri Lanka.

"The people highlighted his lack of equitable governance, his penchant for unchallenged power and his serious lack of accountability, responsibility and willingness to be portrayed as a racist apart from turning a blind eye towards corruption and the erosion of the rule of law.

He appeared to have completely forgotten the ideals of democratic ideals so cherished by all Sri Lanka. Gotabaya was ousted not just by the people - divine intervention came into play when he without rhyme or reason gave his name to the cremation of Muslims who perished due to Covid 19," the statement added.

Colombo, March 10 (Daily Mirror) - Due to the affordability of sanitary napkins half the number of girls and women in Sri Lanka do not include sanitary napkins in their household expenditures, the Advocata Institute said.

They said the affordability of sanitary napkins and its significant impact on the welfare of girls and women in Sri Lanka has become more pronounced in recent years.

This is particularly evident due to the decline in their purchasing powers stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis.

Approximately 4 million Sri Lankans have descended into poverty since 2019, making the total number of Sri Lankans living in poverty approximately 7 million.

Therefore, it is necessary to examine the ramifications of the lack of affordability of sanitary napkins which has been worsened by the imposition of high taxes on sanitary napkins.

### Sri Lanka central bank mainly responsible for electricity price cut

ECONOMYEXT – Sri Lanka’s power tariff cut was made possible by an appreciating exchange rate and falling interest rates (monetary stability) that cut costs of the Ceylon Electricity Board and reduced coal import prices, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

Sri Lanka slashed electricity prices as much as 33 percent for small users and 21 percent overall, after hiking them in October as losses mounted due to low rainfall.

Minister Wijesekera said the price cut went beyond the increase in October.

“Most people think that the price reduction came only because of the hydro-electricity,” Minister Wijesekera told reporters.

“Producing more hydro-electricity was only one factor. The main fact was the gradual emergence of the country from the unstable economic conditions, especially the strengthening of the rupee.

“The rupee was at around 370 to the US dollar, which has come down to 314 to 317 to the US dollar. Yesterday it was reported that was down to 307.

### Irish voters reject constitutional amendment about women’s role in home

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar conceded defeat Saturday as two constitutional amendments he supported that would have broadened the definition of family and removed language about a woman’s role at home were headed toward rejection in early vote tallies.

Varadkar, who pushed the vote to enshrine gender equality in the constitution by removing “very old-fashioned language” and trying to recognize the realities of modern family life, said it was clear the amendments were “defeated comprehensively on a respectable turnout.”

“It was our responsibility to convince the majority of people to vote ‘yes’ and we clearly failed to do so,” Varadkar said.

Opponents argued that the wording of the changes was poorly thought out — an argument that appeared to have gained traction in the final days of the campaign. Voters said they were confused by the questions and others said they feared changes would lead to unintended consequences.

The Cabinet has rejected the Treasury's decision to cancel the free Lanka bus pass issued to parliamentary employees.

Considering the country's economic status, the Treasury decided to cancel the pass from the beginning of this year.

The government provides eight crores annually for the bus permit to the Sri Lanka Transport Board.

Treasury has informed parliament that this year cannot be allocated so much in accordance with the current economic situation in the country.

When we asked a parliamentary officer in this regard, he said that the Cabinet has decided to continue to provide free bus pass to Parliament employees.

He added that it is more advantageous to make such a license than to use buses in Parliament.

### Nuwan Thushara takes hat-trick in third Bangladesh T20I

*2024-03-09 17:03:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Nuwan-Thushara-takes-hat-trick-in-third-Bangladesh-T20I/108-278548) · `en`

Nuwan Thushara became the fifth Sri Lankan to take a hat-trick in T20I cricket, as he made early breakthroughs to cripple Bangladesh's run chase in the third T20I in Sylhet.

Thushara, bowling his first over in the series, removed Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, Towhid Hridoy and Mahmadullah -- all deceived by his sling arm action -- to reduce the home team to 15 for 4, chasing a target of 175.

Thushara broke through Shanto's defence and castled the stumps with the second ball of the over, before uprooting the off stump to dismiss Hridoy on the next delivery.

He then completed the hat-trick of wickets when he trapped Mahmadullah leg before wicket, the decision being upheld despite the batsmen's review.

Thushara joins Thisara Perera, Lasith Malinga, Akila Dananjaya and Wanindu Hasaranga as the only Sri Lankans to take a hat-trick in the T20I format.

In a report to the Human Rights Council, Türk said that the establishment and continuing expansion of settlements amount to the transfer by Israel of its own civilian population into the territories that it occupies, which amounts to a war crime under international law.
