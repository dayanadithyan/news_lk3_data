State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday reassured the public that the Finance Ministry can support Presidential polls with any number of candidates.

Speaking to the media after an event in Yatiyanthota, the State Minister emphasised that the Government is prepared to cover the costs associated with the estimates presented for the election.

Siyambalapitiya noted that the expenditure estimate for the Presidential polls has not yet surpassed the Rs. 10 billion limit set for the event.

However, he acknowledged that if the number of candidates grows significantly, it could lead to additional expenses. “For instance, if the ballot paper needs to be extended by another page to accommodate all candidates, the cost of one candidate could increase by around Rs. 100 million due to the need for more ballot boxes and other logistical requirements,” he explained.

### No one can build the PA;Ranil's success is the country's victory - Wimalaweera Dissanayake

*2024-08-11 23:29:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190845) · `ta`

Wimalaweera Dissanayake supports Ranil Wickremesinghe for the upcoming election, emphasizing his leadership during the economic crisis. She highlights Ranil's selfless dedication to the nation over his political future. Despite challenges, including the unfeasibility of building a united front, she advocates for Ranil's victory as crucial for the country's recovery.

🟩

No one can build the Sri Lanka PA. President Ranil Wickremesinghe should win the upcoming election.

While the country was opposed to the worst economic crisis, none of the heroes who are currently speaking of the government have been responsible for the government. The country was on fire. President Ranil Wickremesinghe took the country without considering his political future.

The ruling and opposition parties must remember that no one can do election campaigns if the Age of 20122 is present in the year 20122.

I will be happy if the PA wins, but it is impossible to practice. No one can build public Peramuna. President Ranil Wickremesinghe should win the election. If he wins, the country will win.

The firm structure for recovering from the economic crisis has now been implemented.

A nation desirous of surviving and prospering should necessarily embrace ‘innovation and creativity’

The innovation inputs consist of five broad categories, namely, institutional structure, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication and business sophistication. In innovation outputs, there are two categories, namely, knowledge and technology and creativity. In all these categories, Sri Lanka’s performance as an innovative economy has been far from the desired. It also opens a wide policy corridor for Sri Lanka Government to adopt for implementation if it is really interested in building its knowledge base and its application in business

### Avoid candidates who come forward to contest the election for personal reasons - February

*2024-08-11 20:58:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190830) · `ta`

Rohana Hettiarachchi warns against candidates running for personal gains, labeling it as an abuse of democracy. He urges voters to be cautious, highlighting the increasing trend of individuals seeking office for self-serving motives rather than national interest. This behavior not only undermines democratic principles but also inflates election costs due to the growing number of contestants. History shows that only the main candidates receive significant support, with others struggling to secure even 2% of the vote.

That works out to be 807 watt-hours of solar power with a PV panel of 3 ft X 3 ft size every hour.

Another report by the ADB put the potential available capacity of solar power of SL at 16 GW or 16000 MW. This is huge and free power all year. Currently Sri Lanka houses about 750 MW of solar power or a pathetic 4.6% of available solar power.
