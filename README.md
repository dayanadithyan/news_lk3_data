Words that acquire new meaning in the public psyche are the loudest witnesses of unfolding history

тАЬThe future has many names: for the weak it means the unattainable; for the fearful, it means the unknown; for the courageous, it means opportunity.тАЭ

Victor Hugo the French writer provided this advice to France in the turbulent days of the end of the тАЬancien r├йgimeтАЩ and the birth of the new republic.

Meaningful change occurs when a vision is combined with realism and pragmatism to turn it into something tangible, concrete. Clarity of ideas shape reality.

The NPP presented its party manifesto yesterday (26 August). I watched the finely choreographed presentation on YouTube. I listened to the candidate AKD. This is my take.

President WickremesingheтАЩs case for being popularly elected for the first time, after two previous attempts, to the office he now holds by parliamentary selection, has 4 pillars:

1. There is no alternative to his economic policies, starting with his agreement with the IMF.

2. His IMF agreement cannot and should not be sought to be renegotiated.

3. There is nothing to be renegotiated as there is nothing amiss with his IMF agreement.

4. His continuity in office is thus the key to stability, which is the key to economic recovery.

### Best business practices from an Islamic standpoint

Many of the teachings embodied in both the QurтАЩan and Hadiths are actually followed by┬а multinationals in spirit - Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a very efficient leader. He had excellent XQ (Execution Quotient) i.e. ability to get things done. The secret of his efficiency was his sense of urgency. Once a task was decided he would formulate a plan with relevant parties and execute it as fast as possible. This was evident in his many actions from winning over tribal chiefs to the many campaigns he led to ensure Islam triumphed and a commonwealth based on the brotherhood of man finally emerged. That he was supremely successful in this nobody will deny. We know in our personal life that anything we decide to do later, rarely gets done. One delay leads to another, which is why procrastination is regarded almost as a sin in Islam

### Public-Private Partnerships: Pathway to sustainable infrastructure development in Sri Lanka

Given the fiscal constraints faced by the Government of Sri Lanka, PPPs should be a key implementation mechanism for large-scale infrastructure projects

Public Private Partnerships (PPP) are long-term agreements between the public and private sectors to create or operate public assets. The advantages of PPPs extend far beyond mere financial considerations. They bring with them the efficiencies of the private sector in construction and operations, enhancing the speed of development and the quality of infrastructure. One of the key benefits is the ability of PPPs to generate additional resources outside government budgets.

A major fire has broken out in the Nettamaluwa mountain reserve, located within the Wellawaya Divisional Secretariat Division, rapidly spreading and consuming more than 20 acres of the protected forest area.

The blaze had reportedly started last afternoon (27), and has spread rapidly during the night due to the dry weather and strong winds in the area, intensifying the destruction in one of the reserveтАЩs most sensitive ecosystems.

While firefighting teams managed to bring the fire largely under control by this morning (August 28), Ada Derana reporter said that some areas of the reserve are still experiencing active flames.

### Sri Lanka government would be owed Rs656bn for CPC debt taken over by end 2024

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ There will be owed 656 billion rupees of debt taken over by Sri LankaтАЩs central government to be offset by taxes on fuel by the beginning of 2025, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

The Treasury took over 1,200 billion rupees of debt (3.4 billion US dollars) in 2022 and a 25 rupee tax was imposed on fuel, he said in a twitter.com message.

At the end of it is estimated that 656 billion rupees will remain to be offset by taxes, Wijesekera said.

At this rate it would take another four years (2029) to offset the debt, he said.

Wijesekera was responding to comments made by National PeoplesтАЩ Power leader Anura Dissanayake.

The CPC ended up with large volumes of debt partly due to forex shortages coming from flexible inflation targeting (cutting rates with inflationary open market operations claiming that historical 12-month inflation index was below 5-oct) with a peg.
