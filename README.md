Mar. 22 (BBC) - Former Brazil international football player Robinho has been arrested to serve a nine-year prison sentence for rape.

He was convicted two years ago in Italy for his part in the gang rape of an Albanian woman at a night club in Milan in 2013.

Robinho, 40, was arrested at his flat in his home city of Santos.

The Italian government had requested that he serve his sentence in Brazil after failing to get him extradited.

On Wednesday, a court in Brazil upheld the decision and also ruled that he should serve his time behind bars instead of under house arrest.

Earlier on Thursday, a Supreme Court judge rejected a request to halt his detention.

The decisive action taken by Brazil's justice system has been praised by many on local media, who feared that Robinho would evade justice thanks to his fame and his wealth.

Nirmalanathan argued against police anarchy, while Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakse defended the decision, stating the issue was resolved within two hours.

üü©

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian Charles Nirmalanathan questioned whether the police could hold the Buddhist Poson Day in the daytime, as the police say to hold the Hindus Shivaratri in the daytime.

He said this while addressing the third day debate on the no -confidence motion against the Speaker held in Parliament on Thursday (21).

The police refused permission even when the court had allowed the Hindus to observe Shivaratri at the Adilingeswarar Temple at the Attukkunnarimalai.

If the rituals are damaged, the police must have seen the damage to them without being damaged if they are damaged.. As well as the Shiva Temple. So the Hindus will not damage their temple.

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakse, who intervened, said that when you brought this issue to Parliament, we settled within two hours.

So why are you talking about again.

Charles Nirmalanathan, who got up again, said that such a police anarchy should not happen again.
