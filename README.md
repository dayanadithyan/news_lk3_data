He hopes that National People's Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) makes positive statements regarding his visit to India and understands the need of investors in Sri Lanka, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

Addressing the media, he said that whoever had invited AKD to India, had done a good thing.

"AKD might have gained a vast amount of experience over the need for investors in our country from any country in the world, including India. After experiencing the development of India's energy sectors, I don't think that AKD would get a chance to chase away the investors who are coming to the country.

"AKD dressed according to the European dress code, ignoring his traditional dress. I don't think his trade unions understand how he behaves," he said.

It is very common to see political parties visit India every month, but this is the first time that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is in India, he said.

### Critical Atlantic Ocean current system showing early signs of collapse - report

*2024-02-10 17:10:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97168/critical-atlantic-ocean-current-system-showing-early-signs-of-collapse-report) · `en`

A crucial system of ocean currents may already be on course to collapse, according to a new report, with alarming implications for sea level rise and global weather — leading temperatures to plunge dramatically in some regions and rise in others.

Using exceptionally complex and expensive computing systems, scientists found a new way to detect an early warning signal for the collapse of these currents, according to the study published Friday in the journal Science Advances. And as the planet warms, there are already indications it is heading in this direction.

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (the AMOC) — of which the Gulf Stream is part — works like a giant global conveyor belt, taking warm water from the tropics toward the far North Atlantic, where the water cools, becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean, before spreading southward.

### Moody’s downgrades Israel’s credit rating on war risks; outlook negative

Moody’s downgraded Israel’s credit rating on Friday, citing material political and fiscal risks for the country from its war with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The impact of the conflict raises political risk and weakens Israel’s executive and legislative institutions, and its fiscal strength for the foreseeable future, said Moody’s, which had begun the review for a downgrade on Oct. 19.

The country’s rating was cut to “A2,” which is five notches above investment grade, while its credit outlook was kept at negative by Moody’s, meaning a further downgrade is possible.

The war between Israel and Hamas, which has raged since Oct. 7, is the latest in a conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that has rumbled on for seven decades and destabilized the Middle East.

No group or party appears on course to win an overall majority. The final results are yet to be announced.

In a staunch video message posted on X created using AI, Mr Khan claimed his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party had won a “landslide victory” despite what he has called a crackdown on his party.

He is currently in jail having been convicted in cases he says are politically motivated.

The success of the PTI-linked candidates was unexpected, with most experts agreeing that Mr Sharif - believed to be backed by the country’s powerful military - was the clear favourite.
