### Sri Lanka to shut oil refinery for ‘turnaround’ maintenance

*2024-03-02 06:22:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-shut-oil-refinery-for-turnaround-maintenance-152743/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation said its refinery will be shut for 45 days for scheduled ‘turnaround’ maintenance, which is required every three years.

“This is a mandatory requirement, in compliance with international norms, that qualifies the refinery for safe and reliable operation for a further 03 years,” CPC said in a statement.

“Once the refinery is brought back on stream after the Turnaround, it will be subjected to upgrades designed to increase its contribution to Sri Lanka’s changing product requirements.”

CPC will maintain a buffer stock of double the demand of refined products during the shut down period.

Sri Lanka’s 50,000 barrels per day refinery produces a relatively large share of furnace oil and is more geared to refining light crudes. (Colombo/Mar02/2024)
