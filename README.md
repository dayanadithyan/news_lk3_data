üü©

The veterinary pedestal at the University of Peradeniya has introduced a new uterine tool to control the breeding of monkeys.

The instrument was once used for testing for a one -and -a -half -year -old monkey.

Senior Professor Asoka Thangolla from the University of Peradeniya University said that the radiological examination carried out after the test was noticed that the uterus was successfully operated.

It reached the throat when it used the normal level of tool in the practice of preventing pregnancy for women. So we decided to create a small ring.

He noted that the doctors of the Department of Maternity and Neurology of the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital and the Paradise Faculty of Dental Medicine in Peradeniya have cooperated with the effort.

‚ÄúIt takes half an hour to calm the animal, which takes another half an hour for surgery. This time it has the potential to control the number of monkeys in the country. ‚Äù

It is said that the ring will cost 2000 rupees to produce the new uterine tool.

Colombo, April 26 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka has come to the forefront among the countries in the world suffering from asthma, Sri Lanka Respiratory Disease Specialists' Association President Dr. Neranjan Dissanayake said.

He said between 10% and 15% of the country's population suffers from asthma, and it affects children, young adults and the elderly with great mental and physical discomfort.

If asthma is not controlled properly, it can even lead to death. About 95% of asthma patients can be controlled with simple, very cost-effective, high-performance medications, Dr. Dissanayake said.

But, unfortunately, around 500,000 people worldwide die from asthma every year, he said.

This year, Asthma Day falls on May 7, and an awareness programme has been organized by the Association of Respiratory Disease Specialists, Dr. Dissanayake said.

Colombo, April 26 (Daily Mirror) - Ahead of the presidential election scheduled for October this year, the foreign powers have ramped up their efforts in the assessment of ground political developments as was in the case of vital elections in the past.

The political situation is likely to heat up after May Day events in which the respective parties will try to show their political might as a launching pad for electioneering.

It is natural for foreign countries having bilateral relations with Sri Lanka to be watchful of political developments with key elections pending. However, countries such as the United States, India, China, Japan, the United Kingdom and other Western countries take particular interest in the possible outcome of elections. They have strategic and competing interests in the country.

### Not AirAsia bidding to acquire SriLankan: Capital A CEO clarifies

Capital A CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes clarified that it is AirAsia Consulting Sdn Bhd that is bidding to acquire SriLankan Airlines, and not AirAsia.

If successful, the soon to be re-branded AirAsia Consulting will raise its own capital for the acquisition, Fernandes told reporters in Malaysia this week at a media conference that was held to announce the extension of his tenure as chief for another five years.

‚ÄúJust to clear that up for everyone, AirAsia is not buying SriLankan Airlines. AirAsia Consulting, which will set up its own fund, is looking at buying SriLankan Airlines. So, it‚Äôs not AirAsia,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs confusing, and AirAsia Consulting will be changing (its name) to Capital A Consulting very soon. So, that‚Äôs for airlines who want to consult our 23 years of experience, but AirAsia Consulting is also looking for opportunities to invest in airlines outside of ASEAN. AirAsia is fully focused on ASEAN. That‚Äôs our goal,‚Äù

Sri Lanka must integrate with global production networks that require trade reforms, removal of tariffs and protections across sectors and joining free trade agreements.

I hope to convince the reader that despite some of the commentary, Sri Lanka is not on the road to recovery. Numerous predictably dysfunctional policies with questionable rationalisations were implemented in 2019 and 2020; there was no discernible deliberative process. The underlying fragility of governance that precipitated the collapse is still prevalent. Two years on, the Wickremesinghe Government is exhibiting the same tendencies: a concentration of power in the office of the presidency with the executive holding the critical ministries of finance and defence; this Wickremesinghe Government has not materially altered the conditions that led to our crisis.

But none of the myriad wars and conflicts could be as brutal as the war Israel‚Äôs hardline prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been waging against the hapless people of the Gaza Strip for the past 200-plus days. What is happening in Gaza is not a war; it is genocide, period.

Both the Government and the Sports Minister have maintained silence over the incident. Only the Opposition alliance Samagi Jana Balawegaya has demanded to know whether the organizers of the sporting event carry a liability
