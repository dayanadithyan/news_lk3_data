### The appointment of the Inspector General of Police is legally and constitutional: Speaker

*2024-07-26 11:54:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189418) ┬╖ `ta`

Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena defended the appointment of the Inspector General of Police as constitutional and correct, despite criticism. He denied allegations of wrongdoing, stating decisions were made in accordance with the constitution. The process involved the approval of both the Constituent Assembly and Parliament, marking an unprecedented move. He suggested that in cases of vacancy, there should be established procedures or judicial intervention, emphasizing that even the President cannot make such appointments unilaterally.

ЁЯЯй

The police chief affair is very complicated. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said that allegations are being made against me that this situation was due to the wrong decision taken by me.

The Speaker said this while commenting on the appointment of the Inspector General of Police in Parliament today (26).

We have not taken any wrong decision. We have taken a reasonable, right resolution of the constitution deeply. That resolution may seem incorrectly for you (awakening the opposition). But we made that decision in the right way.

I have taken this decision from the house and is completely false. 41 (d) - I used the word for me in Article 5. The appointment of the Inspector General of Police with the approval of the Constituent Assembly and the approval of the Parliament was unprecedented.

So there are steps to solve this post in case of vacuum. Or the court must provide a solution for this. He said that even the president could not decide on this.

The Supreme Court gave an order suspending him from his office and suggesting that an acting appointment be made.

Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardana said there were no legal provisions to do so.

An election had been declared and there the next court hearing is in November after the elections he said.

Prime Minister Gunawardana also maintained that the Constitutional Council which approved the original appointment, was an extension of the parliament as the legislature.

The parliament could not therefore accept a order that was not founded on a legal basis and appeared to be illegal he said.

Gunawardana said he was reminding the speaker to intevene in the matter and invalidate the interim order.

### Sri Lanka election announcement triggers unexpected constitutional conundrum

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ The formal announcement of the presidential elections on Friday has triggered limitations on the executive that will complicate its uneasy relations with the judiciary and plunge the country into a constitutional conundrum, as an acting police chief was not immediately appointed following a court order.

Incumbent Inspector General, Deshabandu Tennakoon, was barred from exercising the powers of his position by the Supreme Court, which decided to hear nine petitions against his controversial appointment in February.

Election officials said the executive loses its power to make any appointments or even transfer public servants when an election has been called. This restriction could hinder the appointment of an acting police chief.

Although the court has said President Ranil Wickremesinghe can appoint a suitable officer as the Acting Inspector General, no immediate action was taken, and the operation of election law from Friday bars him from doing so.
