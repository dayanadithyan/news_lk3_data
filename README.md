Colombo, March 3 (Daily Mirror)- While highlighting that the Suwaseriya ambulance service is fighting for its survival, its founder Harsha de Silva said its employee should be given a salary increment as a priority.

"The CEO of Suwaseriya is fighting to save the ambulance service. Its employees can easily obtain visas from countries like Canada. A battle is being fought to save the ambulance service in such a scenario," he told a media briefing.

He said it was most unfair for the Central Bank officials to increase their own salaries when Suwaseriya employees have not received any increments despite working 24 hours of the day," he added.

### “The farmers are a great profit for the country”

*2024-03-03 16:20:13* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/விவசாயிகளால்-நாட்டுக்கு-பெரும்-இலாபம்/175-334139) · `ta`

Farmers in Sri Lanka, led by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, have significantly reduced the country's reliance on imported rice, saving over $600 million in 2023 and 2024. They've achieved this by increasing rice production, with a record harvest of 12,000 kg per hectare. The government is promoting Giri Samba cultivation, giving farmers control over rice prices.

🟩

Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera says farmers and foreign workers have been dedicated to reduce the value of the increased dollar rate.

The Minister said that the value of the dollar against the rupee in recent years has increased rapidly and the value of the dollar has declined somewhat.

By 2022, Sri Lanka was imported about 800,000 metric tonnes of rice, for which the government had to spend $ 300 million.

But not a single rice was imported in 2023, and in the two years 2023 and 2024, farmers in the country saved over $ 600 million.

In addition, in 2023 and 2024, the people of this country will consume domestic rice, not the imported rice, but that respect and pride must join the Sri Lankan farmers.

Representatives of some political groups that claim to be farmers' representatives are trying to disrupt agriculture by acting like farmers, but farmers are not caught up in this trap.

### Disturbing Echoes Of The Last Phase Of The Civil War In Sri Lanka & The Treatment Of Palestinians Under Zionist Occupation – Part III

In the Manichean universe of the Zionists and the Lankan state their actions are beyond reproach, but the actions of the oppressed are unjust and immoral. They make no allowance for the historical reasons for resistance. Violence by the oppressed is not new. The First Nations of Australia resisted the colonisers from 1788 to just before the Second World War; there were indigenous rebellions in many parts of what is now South America and in the United States, including the Nat Turner revolt by enslaved African Americans; there was the Mau Mau rebellion in the British colony of Kenya. There were many others less well known. What they share is resistance to a better armed and resourced enemy. Armed resistance follows a period where the possibilities of negotiation are narrowed until they are non-existent and violence seems for some the only other choice.

### Sri Lanka seeks five-month hold on bondholder suit

*2024-03-03 08:34:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97697/sri-lanka-seeks-five-month-hold-on-bondholder-suit) · `en`

(Bloomberg) -- Sri Lanka is seeking a five-month hold on a lawsuit filed by a bondholder over the country’s historic debt default, telling a New York federal judge that it wants more time to negotiate with private creditors.

The island nation was sued in July 2022 by Hamilton Reserve Bank Ltd., which sought full payment on more than $250 million of Sri Lanka’s dollar bond that was due that month. The bank says it holds more than 25% of the bonds, which would likely enable it to block any modification of the notes.

On Friday, Sri Lanka sought an extension of a delay of the lawsuit that was granted in November. Hamilton Reserve opposed the new request, saying that the country has kept the bank “in the dark” about the negotiations despite repeated requests for information.

The island nation is prioritizing restructuring obligations to its private creditors as it seeks to fast-track a debt overhaul and exit a sovereign default, the foreign minister told Bloomberg last month.
