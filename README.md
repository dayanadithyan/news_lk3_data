### Honouring the Unsung Heroes of Sri Lanka on International Women’s Day

*2024-03-06 03:15:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Honouring-the-Unsung-Heroes-of-Sri-Lanka-on-International-Womens-Day/172-278301) · `en`

As we celebrate International Women’s Day, it prompts us to wonder, what does it truly mean to be a woman? In a world marked by increasing competitiveness and relentless pace, women often find themselves questioning their place and value. Today, as we honour the spirit of womanhood, it is imperative to recognise the enduring legacy of women and address the scarcity of female role models to inspire the next generation.

Being a woman is a profound journey, marked by the diverse roles of daughter, wife, mother, educator, career woman and a caregiver to her family. From the moment a child is cradled protectively in her womb, she begins a journey of nurturing and guidance that extends far beyond birth. A mother’s love envelops her child, shaping their perceptions and experiences as they navigate the world.

### Could Party Politics Resolve Ongoing National Crisis in Sri Lanka?

*2024-03-06 03:13:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Could-Party-Politics-Resolve-Ongoing-National-Crisis-in-Sri-Lanka/172-278300) · `en`

It has been observed that divisive politics is one of the inborn deficiencies in party politics although political parties are considered as vital components of Parliamentary Democracy. It is not possible to activate representative democracy or parliamentary democracy without political parties.

Professor Von Beyme, Head of the Institute of Political Science at the University of Heidelberg, in his book titled “Political Parties in Western Democracies” has pointed out that “political parties are often defined as power oriented organizations aiming at governmental responsibilities without accepting a share in the burden of running a government which pursue the goal of placing their avowed representatives in governmental position”.

*2024-03-06 03:06:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-Gentlemens-Game-in-need-of-Gentlemen-EDITORIAL/172-278299) · `en`

Hooray and congratulations! Our national cricket team won a full series of matches. It was against Afghanistan, but no matter, at last we have won a whole series. It was refreshing to see our team win. The huge crowd at the third T-20 match, vouched for the regeneration of interest among the fans of the game in the country.

While we won all of the test matches, it was the absence of spectators which was prominent. Despite the fact entrance to the games were free, a sparse crowd attended the matches.

During an earlier era we were enthralled when we beat teams like India, Pakistan and Australia. In those days beating even England was no big deal.

But times have changed. At the Dambulla Cricket Stadium where the last T-20 match between Afghanistan and our national team took place, we witnessed a sad change for the worse in the spirit the game was played.

### Militarisation: Something old; something new

*2024-03-06 01:19:31* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Militarisation-Something-old-something-new/4-759217) · `en`

If dignity was what the retired general was after, higher pensions/benefits to lower rank retirees would have served better (especially the disabled/seriously injured)

“Are we so morally sick, so deaf and dumb and blind, that we do not understand this?”

In 2023, bankrupt Sri Lanka added $ 16.6 billion to its central government debt, an increase of 21%.

Sri Lanka ranks a high 43 in Global Militarisation Index and a low 83 in Social Progress Index. When it comes to militarisation, Sri Lanka outranks most developed countries. We also outrank our neighbours, including India (77); only Pakistan, at 44, is slightly ahead of us.

The United Nations has found “reasonable grounds” to conclude that Hamas committed sexual violence during its Oct. 7 attack in Israel, and said there are indications such violence continues to be carried out against those being held hostage by the group.

A UN team that investigated the allegations against Hamas, which is designated a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, received what it called “clear and convincing information” that women and children held in captivity were subjected to rape, torture and inhumane treatment.

The team reviewed more than 5,000 photos and 50 hours of footage of the attacks, as well as conducting interviews with dozens of Israeli officials. It said the true prevalence of sexual violence during the attack and afterward “may take months or years to emerge and may never be fully known.”

The government should decide on giving this power to the central bank. Opposition member Dayasiri Jayasekara said that the salary increase of central bank officials is contrary to the law.

He said this while addressing the second day debate on the Bind Receivables Bill, Trusting Receivables (Amendment) Bill, Amendment (Amendment) Bill, Financial Leasing (Amendment) Bill.

Other banks and financial institutions in the country are based on the actions of the central bank in the country. Bank loans are only one hundred per cent of the Central Bank. But if the rest of the country goes to the banks of the country, the interest is 20.5 per cent.. That is why when we were told to allow the central bank to act independently, we were told that it should be somewhat independent.

Raising a question under 27/2, he told Parliament that financial institutions had published advertisements on auctioning property of the Small and Medium Scale entrepreneurs even after the Cabinet decision to suspend the Parate execution laws.
