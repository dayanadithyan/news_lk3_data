It was only after I saw thousands of Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãwho lost their homes as an unexpected violence that had been unleashed on the morning of Monday 25th, and I decided to record the events in the quarter.

Many people lost their loved ones, and many were killed by Sinhalese.

I begin this diary with the firm belief that someday the people who call themselves Sinhalese Buddhists can someday be carried to the civilized world or somebody.

I am going to inform you about the things that took place at this camp and my personal experiences before sheltering at the Ratmalana Airport.

I am going to share their experiences with other refugees in this camp.

### The people's struggle will fight for the autonomy of the Tamil people - our position is the recognition of Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãas a national race.. -Rajivkan

Rajkumar Rajeev Khan, the activist of the People's Movement, said that the people's struggle's leading political arena has jumped into this political arena, with the promise of an autonomous, rejecting a single rule and creating units.

He said this at a press conference held at the Front of the People's Struggle

To this day we have regret that our political issues have been resolved to this day, as they are born in the North East and have been very badly met with the oppression of the North East.

Today, the Tamil people were killed in the capital of 1983, especially in 1983, without any science.

How many thousands of murders, violence and disappearance have been committed against the Tamil people.

At this time, how many parties from the South are coming north, they will say something about what they are going to give to the Tamil people, and they will say something else in the South.

There, Sinhala politicians continue to adhere to racism and the tactic for voting here.

### 41 years ago, the Sinhala Buddhist chauvinist policies responsible for the Black July are the cause of the military occupation of today- Pearl.

*2024-07-24 12:11:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189249) ¬∑ `ta`

In 1983, the Sinhala Buddhist majority's policies sparked the Black July massacre, leading to ongoing military occupation and economic exclusion of Tamils in Sri Lanka. The event, commemorated by the Pearl Organization alongside global Tamils, highlights the enduring impact of Sinhalaism on Tamil rights and safety. Despite calls for reconciliation and accountability, including at the UN Human Rights Council, little has changed for Tamils, who face continued marginalization and lack of justice. The organization advocates for international support and self-determination for the Tamil people.

üü©

The Sri Lankan government has said that the same Sinhala Buddhist majority policy is due to the Sri Lankan government's land grabbing military occupation and economically exclusion, the same Sinhala Buddhist policy that has led to the riots.

To commemorate the 41st anniversary of the Black July, the Pearl Organization is joining Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãaround the world to commemorate the victims of the planned massacre against Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãtoday.

Moreover, Sinhalaism, which is responsible for violence, is trying to investigate how to influence the current events, as well as the Tamil nation.

After the independence of 1948, Sinhala Buddhist chauvinism was rapidly rooted in the structure of Sri Lanka.

The abolition of the rights of Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãand national communal rhetoric led to many anti -Tamil massacres.

Black July is one of the most ruthless horrible massacre that took place before the war.

Bangladesh partially restored telecommunication services on Wednesday although Internet connection was slow and social media remained suspended, days after deadly protests against reservations for government jobs killed almost 150 people.

The country has mostly been calm since Sunday when the Supreme Court scaled down reservations for various categories to 7 percent, overruling a high court verdict reinstating a 56 percent quota in government jobs that had been scrapped in 2018.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina‚Äôs government said on Tuesday that it would heed the Supreme Court ruling.

As demonstrations against the quotas ¬†which included a 30 percent reservation for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan ¬†tapered off, the government started easing the curfew imposed last week.

Restrictions will be relaxed for seven hours on Wednesday and offices will also be open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., officials said.

The minister further stated that the egg prices have suddenly dropped by Rs. 6 and that he will thoroughly look into this by obtaining reports from the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA).

He expressed concerns stating that if an egg cannot be sold for at least Rs. 40, they would have to import eggs from India. He pointed out that during the festival season in December, cake manufacturers will also be purchasing a large quantity of eggs.

Therefore, he emphasized that if the egg prices are not reduced by then, the government will have to import eggs or ensure customer protection by providing eggs at the correct price.
