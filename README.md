Sri Lankan electors are awaiting a change from the status quo of a sluggish and slow-moving economy towards a more seriously planned progress. With fresh memories of extreme hard time sufferings of the recent past, only palliatively handled with haphazard responses to meet emergency situations, the body politic is hopeful of a dawn of an economy progressing under a planned pursuit of a clear vision.

### Rajapaksas  Backstabbing Ranil  Over the Presidential Candidacy Issue   Backfire  on the SLPP.

*2024-08-07 01:11:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84468) · `en`

President  Ranil Wickremesinghe was cruelly bamboozled by the Rajapaksas early this week. The incumbent president was given false promises that the Medamulana clan-led “pohottuwa”party was firmly behind him in his bid to contest the forthcoming presidential poll. The note of discord struck by Namal Rajapaksa was lightly dismissed as being of very little consequence. The message conveyed was that Wickremesinghe should formally seek the suppo rt of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna(SLPP) for his candidacy and that it would be accepted and approved by the SLPP as a matter of course. But when Ranil did so, the carpet was yanked from under his feet.

### Demise of Rajapaksa power and triumph of Rajapaksaism

*2024-08-07 01:09:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Demise-of-Rajapaksa-power-and-triumph-of-Rajapaksaism/4-765215) · `en`

The Rajapaksas have nothing to gain from a Ranil Wickremesinghe victory. He was never a Rajapaksa creature. He saved the Rajapaksas from popular fury and used their backing to implement his own politico-economic agenda. If he wins the Presidential election, he would go his way, irrespective of whether the Rajapaksas back him or not. So the Rajapaksas decided to cut their losses, a decision that makes sense from the perspective of familial power. For them, defeat and a stint in the opposition would be less ruinous than growing irrelevance under a victorious President Wickremesinghe. Their only way out was persuading President Wickremesinghe to publicly anoint Namal Rajapaksa as the next prime minister. They made the demand and he refused, because he is not Ranil Rajapaksa. With that correct refusal, the raison d’être of the Wickremesinghe-Rajapaksa alliance vanished

“The king is dead, long live the king” (Traditional proclamation made following the death of a monarch indicating the continuity of the monarchy)

Mahinda Rajapaksa’s second presidential investiture was held two days after his 65th birthday, the twin occasions marked by grandiose displays of Rajapaksa power. The highlights of this political spectacle included a shipload of Buddhist monks voyaging from Galle to the Hambantota Rajapaksa Port, chanting the ‘Sagara Piritha’, and the cooking of world’s largest milk-rice weighting 4,000 kg by 300+ chefs (relayed live on TV). Tuition-guru turned Education Minister Bandula Gunwardane ordered all school children to listen to President Rajapaksa’s ‘Address to the Nation’.

Most of the courtiers who pledged eternal fealty to High King Mahinda during that spectacular week in 2010 are unlikely to grace his 79th birthday in 2024.
