### Sri Lanka faces barriers in reclaiming priceless artifacts from Britain

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka is facing legal barriers in its efforts to reclaim priceless artifacts from Britain, as many of these items are held by private individuals rather than the state, Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Minister Vidura Wickremenayake said.

Sri Lanka has been actively requesting the return of invaluable artifacts taken during colonial rule prior to the countryтАЩs independence in 1948.

Last year, the Netherlands returned six Kandyan artifacts, including gold and silver ceremonial swords, two wall guns, and Lewke DisaveтАЩs cannon, after a formal request.

тАЬWe have made similar requests to the British government. However, the challenge is that many of these artifacts are in the possession of individuals, not the state,тАЭ Wickremenayake told EconomyNext.

тАЬWe cannot ask private British citizens to return these items in the same way we request from the British government. We have a substantial list of artifacts taken during the British period.тАЭ

### India election results 2024: BJP-led alliance ahead as Modi eyes win

*2024-06-04 10:31:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/India-election-results-2024-BJP-led-alliance-ahead-as-Modi-eyes-win/108-284059) ┬╖ `en`

India, June 4 ( Al Jazeera) - Prime Minister Narendra ModiтАЩs Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led alliance is leading as India counts votes after a mammoth seven-phase election тАУ the worldтАЩs largest democratic exercise тАУ that began on April 19 and ended on Saturday.

A party or coalition needs 272 seats to cross the majority mark in the 543-member Lok Sabha, the lower house of IndiaтАЩs parliament.

Exit polls show Modi is well on track to return to power for a third consecutive term, while the Indian National Congress party-led opposition bloc hopes to upstage him.

The Election Commission says a record-breaking 642 million voters cast their ballots in the staggered election as it dismissed opposition concerns over how the votes would be counted.

However, the voter turnout this year was 66.3 percent, about one percentage point lower than 2019.

### Sri Lanka explores including pharmaceuticals, machinery in Pakistan FTA: Envoy

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka is exploring the inclusion of pharmaceuticals and machinery in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Pakistan, Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Pakistan, Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne said.

Experts view the move as a potential step for Sri Lanka to reduce the prices of the both goods.

Both South Asian nations began implementing the FTA in 2005, allowing each side to export up to $1 billion worth of goods to the other.

тАЬThe trade volume should be increased,тАЭ Wijegunaratne told EconomyNext from Islamabad.

тАЬDuring the last 20 years, Pakistan has improved tremendously, specially in the pharmaceutical and machinery sectors. We have to include these through negotiations,тАЭ he said when asked if Sri Lanka considers expanding the FTA list with Pakistan.

The aims of the FTA were to strengthen economic relations between the two nations, increase trade in goods and services, and reduce or eliminate tariffs on a wide range of products.

### India begins counting votes in marathon election expected to bring Prime Minister Modi a third term

India began counting more than 640 million votes Tuesday in the worldтАЩs largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power.

The six-week election was seen as a referendum on Modi. If the 73-year-old wins, it will only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the countryтАЩs first prime minister.

Exit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for ModiтАЩs Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.

Indian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results.

Nearly 970 million people, more than 10% of the worldтАЩs population, were eligible to vote. Turnout was around 66% on average across the seven phases, according to official data.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs budget deficit fell to 129.3 billion rupees in the first two months of 2024 down from 322.9 billion rupees last year, with tax revenues climbing 41 percent and interest costs also showed a downward trend.

Total revenues were up 41 percent to 647 billion rupees in the first two months of 2024, on top of a 35 percent rise achieved in 2023 with a rise in tax rate also helped by recovering economic activities and currency appreciation made possible by deflationary policy.

Currency appreciation brings prices down, boosts disposable income, bringing more value added tax, even as income taxes (direct taxes) kill productive spending of the people and transfers money for bureaucratic and political spending.

Sri Lanka has raised state worker salaries in 2024 by 10,000 rupees, effective April after the worst currency collapse in the history of the central, coming from the central bankтАЩs mis-targeted policy rate and a surrender rule.

(New York) - South Africa's Anrich Nortje took a remarkable four wickets for just seven runs as the Proteas dismissed Sri Lanka for a record low 77 on their way to a six-wicket win in the teams' T20 World Cup opener in New York on Monday.

Sri Lanka's total was their lowest in all T20 cricket, with fast bowler Nortje's figures the best by a South African at a T20 World Cup, surpassing his own 4-10 against Bangladesh in Sydney two years ago.

Kagiso Rabada (2-21) and left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who took two wickets in two balls on his way to 2-22, also damaged Sri Lanka's cause.

Opener Kusal Mendis (19) and veteran all-rounder Angelo Mathews (16) were the only Sri Lanka batsmen to pass 15 after their captain, Wanindu Hasaranga, seemingly misread conditions by opting to bat first after winning the toss in what was the first match at a Long Island ground built specially for this tournament.
