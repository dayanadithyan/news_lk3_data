Russian families must produce at least two children for the sake of the nation’s ethnic survival, and three or more if it is to develop and thrive, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.

Russia has suffered heavy but undisclosed casualties since launching its war in Ukraine nearly two years ago, and hundreds of thousands of people have fled the country out of opposition to the conflict or fear of being called up to fight.

Putin told employees at a tank factory in the Urals region that two children per family was the minimum number if the peoples of Russia were to preserve their identities.

“If we want to survive as an ethnic group - well, or as ethnic groups inhabiting Russia - there must be at least two children,” he said.

If each family had just one child, the population would shrink, he said. “And in order to expand and develop, you need at least three children.”

Gnanasaraderera has informed the Colombo High Court that I have apologized to the Muslim community of the country for a sense of disgust due to the controversial comments I made eight years ago.

Gnanasaraderera said that he is ready to inform the Muslims in the country for my actions.

The judge said the verdict would be announced on March 28 as investigations into Gnanasaradere's controversial comments were completed.

The lawmaker had filed a lawsuit at the temple on March 30, 2016, saying that Gnanasaraderer's comments and Gnanasara Thera's comments are affecting the unity of ethnicity.

### US concerned about reports of intimidation, voter suppression in Pakistan election

*2024-02-16 09:21:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97312/us-concerned-about-reports-of-intimidation-voter-suppression-in-pakistan-election) · `en`

The United States is concerned about reports of intimidation and voter suppression in Pakistan’s election, the White House said on Thursday after reports of protests in some parts of the country.

Pakistan’s election last week did not return a clear majority for anyone but independent candidates backed by jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan won 92 out of 264 seats, making them the largest group.

Questions have been raised about the fairness of the Feb. 8 election both inside Pakistan as well as in major foreign capitals, with Washington having previously said there were “undue restrictions” on freedoms of expression and assembly.

“We are watching this very, very closely,” White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday, expressing concern about “intimidation and voter suppression.”

“International monitors are still taking a look at those tallies, I’m not going to get ahead of that process,” he added about the vote count.
