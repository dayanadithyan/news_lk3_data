MK Sivajilingam, a former NPC member, announced his readiness to run independently in the upcoming presidential election if there are issues with the Tamil general candidate. He mentioned efforts to prevent a Tamil candidate from running, but the public seems to favor a common candidate. Meanwhile, MP MA Sumanthiran addressed concerns about representation, emphasizing that the civil society should reflect the people's choices and needs.

Former Northern Provincial Council Member MK Sivajilingam says I will contest independently if there is a problem with the Tamil general candidate.

He said this during a media briefing held at the Jaffna Media Center on Tuesday (11).

Efforts are being made to stop the Tamil general candidate. This time, the common candidate is spoken of among the people.

So, this time a general candidate will be presented in the presidential election. He said that if there were any problems, I would contest independently.

Meanwhile, parliamentarian MA Sumanthiran said that the civil society has no people's order at the People's Forum held in Jaffna last Sunday.

That is wrong. People have made MPs as their representative. Yet people will choose themselves. The civil society was formed by the people. Sivajilingam also said that they can tell them what they need.

### Risk of diarrhea, viral infection with increased flies

*2024-06-11 15:53:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185824) ¬∑ `ta`

Floods in Sri Lanka have led to a fly infestation, exacerbating the spread of diarrhea and viral infections due to the presence of organic matter in flood waters. Flies mature quickly and proliferate, spreading pathogens from feces and contaminated surfaces. This increases the risk of diseases like diarrhea and viral fever, causing symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, and fever. To combat this, it's crucial to use covered containers, manage waste, ensure clean water, and seek immediate medical attention to mitigate the impact of these diseases.

üü©

Deepal Perera, a specialist on the children's disease of the Children's Hospital in Colombo, said that the floodwaters in the country are increasing the proliferation of flies and the spread of diarrhea and viral infection.

The presence of a large number of organic substances in flooded areas accelerates the maturity of the eggs and leads to the rapid increase in the number of flies when flooding is reduced.

These newly fried flies, searching for food resources, often go to feces, debris and contaminated surfaces and further enhance the health crisis.

He pointed out that the effects of increasing flies are scary and that flies bring pathogens, including diarrhea and viral fever, etc.

"If you eat contaminated food and water, you can lead to many symptoms, including abdominal pain, cramps, nausea and relaxed feces," he said.

He also said that the risk of viral infection, characterized by symptoms such as fever, headaches and nausea, also increases in areas where flies are high.

The blaze was started by an electrical short circuit, authorities said, adding that no human casualties or injuries have been reported.

With tens of thousands of shops crowding narrow lanes, Chatuchak is one of South East Asia's biggest markets.

### Future government under Sajith to implement 13th Amendment

A government under him in the future will be committed to implementing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said recently.

During the donation of a smart classroom to the Bharathipuram Maha Vidyalayam in Kilinochchi under the 'Sakwala' programme, he stated that many politicians visit Sinhalese communities, claiming to support only them, and then visit Tamil areas, making similar claims. This tactic is used to gather votes.

"While other parties spread lies in different areas, the Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) consistently advocated for implementing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. We made this commitment across all provinces and remain determined to see it through.

"When discussing the 13th Amendment, some look away, some pretend not to hear, some chang the subject, some run away in fear, and some feel ashamed. I must say that all of them are political opportunists." he said.

### SA on brink of Super 8s with tense win over Bangladesh

New York, June 11 (BBC) - Heinrich Klaasen hit a vital 46 as South Africa claimed a nervy four-run victory over Bangladesh that put them on the brink of securing a place in the T20 World Cup Super 8s.

A combination of the pitch, poor shot selection and good bowling from Bangladesh saw South Africa teetering on 23-4 after they won the toss, as Tanzim Hasan Sakib snaffled 3-18.

Klaasen hit three fours and two sixes in his 44-ball innings as he shared a 79-run partnership with the dependable David Miller to help South Africa recover to compile a defendable 113-6.

Bangladesh made a decent fist of the run chase and at 94-4 with three overs remaining were probably slight favourites.

However, when Kagiso Rabada took the key wicket of Towhid Hridoy for 37 the momentum swung back to the Proteas.

### Rise in flies poses risk of diarrhoea and contagious viral fever

Colombo, June 11 (Daily Mirror) - As floodwaters recede, the proliferation of flies has raised alarms among health authorities due to the increased risk of diarrhoea outbreaks and the spread of contagious viral fevers.

According to consultant Dr Deepal Perera, the abundance of organic matter in flooded areas accelerates the maturation of fly eggs, leading to a rapid increase in fly populations as floodwaters subside. These newly hatched flies, seeking food sources, often gravitate towards faeces, garbage, and contaminated surfaces, further exacerbating the health crisis.

‚ÄúThe consequences of the surge in fly populations are dire. Flies are notorious carriers of pathogens, including bacteria and viruses responsible for diarrheal diseases and viral fevers,‚Äù he pointed out.
