### Australia lifts minimum wage as families grapple with higher living costs

*2024-06-03 10:42:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99615/australia-lifts-minimum-wage-as-families-grapple-with-higher-living-costs) · `en`

Australia’s independent wage-setting body on Monday raised the national minimum wage by 3.75%, largely in line with inflation, as families tackle soaring living costs.

The minimum rate will rise to A$24.10 ($16.05) per hour from July 1, resulting in an extra A$33 per week for about a fifth of the Australian workforce or about 2.6 million employees.

In its annual review, the Fair Work Commission said cost-of-living pressures have hit low-income employees the most, though inflation is considerably lower now than it was at this time last year, when it awarded an increase of 5.75%.

But the report said it was not “appropriate at this time to increase award wages by any amount significantly above the inflation rate principally because labour productivity is no higher than it was four years ago.”

Australian consumer price inflation rose at an annual pace of 3.6% in April, the highest level in five months, adding to risks the next move in interest rates might be upward.

The former MP said he had never intended to call Musk an “Economic Hitman”.

“What I meant was that due to the lack of law, discipline, and rampant political interference in businesses, world-renowned and recognised investors and businessmen will not come to Sri Lanka. It doesn’t matter if President Ranil Wickremesinghe or anyone else invites them; they simply won’t come,” he explained.

### Exports continue to do well in April narrowing trade deficit

The growth in merchandise exports outstripped the growth in imports to help narrow the trade deficit in April compared to a year ago levels, but the cumulative four months deficit stands higher compared to the corresponding period of last year signalling an expanding economy.

Sri Lanka earned US$ 877.6 million from merchandise exports in April, up 3.4 percent from a year ago.

However, the figure was down from US$ 1,139 million earned in March, which was the highest since August 2022.

Imports recorded US$ 1,435.2 million, up just 0.3 percent from a year ago.

This together resulted in a trade deficit of US$ 557.7 million, eased from US$ 582.6 million a year ago. For the four months, the deficit was recorded at US$ 1,777.1 million, up from US$ 1,479.0 million in the corresponding period in 2023.

The rising trade deficit wasn’t something to be alarmed of as it reflects that the economy was expanding after a prolonged contraction caused by ultra-tight monetary and fiscal policies.

Participants in the construction sector said they remain buoyant over the rising opportunities for tenders for new development projects in the country as the economy is now equipped with both foreign currency and rupee liquidity.

However, they cited the breakneck competition in the market and also the easing prices for construction sector materials which could reactivate more activities in the sector which was in a prolonged decline for two years.

“Most respondents were confident that the increasing trend in tender opportunities will continue in the upcoming months,” said the construction sector Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for April.

“Moreover, the participatory firms widely highlighted the intense competition in the market”, the statement released by the Central Bank added.

The PMI dedicated for construction sector activities unsurprisingly contracted due to the seasonality as the long holidays for the New Year temporarily closed construction sites for extended periods.

### Can any candidate achieve 50%+1 at presidential polls - EDITORIAL

*2024-06-03 00:35:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Can-any-candidate-achieve-50-1-at-presidential-polls-EDITORIAL/172-283932) · `en`

All political parties are in election mode. Presidential elections are scheduled to be held between September and October this year. However, reaching the magical 50%+1 seems like a distant dream for the candidates in the running.

In the first presidential election in October 1982, President Jayewardene’s main rival Mrs.Sirimavo Bandaranaike was banned from contesting. Jayewardene was able to collect only 52.91 percent of the votes.

The 1988 election saw several election violence-related actions. That election was won by Ranasinghe Premadasa who received 50.4 percent of the votes. Voter turnout was low-around 55.3 percent, the lowest for a presidential election.

### McDonald’s secret: Shares rise while food sales decline

The  Official Poverty Measure, according to which the official US  poverty rate in 2022 was 11.5 percent, with 37.9 million people in  poverty

It’s hard to believe, but McDonald’s is losing customers in the US because they can no longer afford McDonald’s prices.

Americans spend eleven per cent of their earnings on food. Eating out is a major pastime. But, those in the median income groups (including sections of the middle class) are feeling squeezed as they need to spend more on almost everything, including rents, mortgages, cars and transport. Unemployment is on the rise, with Silicon Valley and Amazon among the earliest to begin layoffs.

Those earning $45,000 or less are less and less able to eat out, and McDonald’s outlets are favourite havens for that.

A meeting between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the IMF team at the Finance Ministry in March 2024

Even as Sri Lanka prepares for elections, laws are being rushed through a parliament without legitimacy. Among those many draft laws– the President in his Budget Speech in November 2023 said he wants to create or amend sixty new laws–one of the most notorious so far is the Economic Transformation Bill. If the citizenry is being devastated by the severe austerity measures imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), this new bill seeks to legislate the very conditionalities and targets set by the IMF.

### Iran’s ex-President Ahmadinejad to run again: state TV

*2024-06-02 22:03:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99606/irans-ex-president-ahmadinejad-to-run-again-state-tv) · `en`

(Reuters) - Iran’s hardline former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has registered to run for president in the country’s June 28 election, organized after the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month, Iran’s state television reported on Sunday.

However he could be barred from the race: the country’s cleric-led Guardian Council will vet candidates, and publish the list of qualified ones on June 11.

Ahmadinejad, a former member of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, was first elected as Iran’s president in 2005 and stepped down because of term limits in 2013.

He was barred from standing in the 2017 election by the Guardian Council, a year after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned him that entering was “not in his interest and that of the country”.

A rift developed between the two after Ahmadinejad explicitly advocated checks on Khamenei’s ultimate authority.

In 2018, in rare criticism directed at Khamenei, Ahmadinejad wrote to him calling for “free” elections.
