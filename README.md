тАЬWhich candidate should support the presidential election?тАЭHe said this while hearing the people's views on the North and East on the last 10,11,12.

тАЬCan't support any presidential candidate due to the leadership and relationships with the leadership. We cannot forget the troubles that our society faced in about four and a half years of rule. Similarly, when we were in the opposition, the suffering that the party's supporters and leadership was unforgettable.

After the leadership and the party in Colombo decide, we are not saying that the people come to support this candidate.. After hearing the opinions of the people, we will make decisions on the basis of advice. Whatever the candidate is for the inter -ethnic harmony, we will work to choose him.
