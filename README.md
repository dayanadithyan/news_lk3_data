### Education Is Not A Business But A Way Of Life!

To dive down to the deepest lengths of education and to acknowledge its contribution to society, we all should have an understanding of what is truly meant by the term, “Education”. As far as my knowledge goes, I think we can all agree that education is not merely the studying of books. The whole point of education is to gain new knowledge. But to realize that almost everyone thinks that this knowledge can ONLY be achieved by books is truly disheartening. This fact can indeed be proved wrong by looking closely at the early stages of human civilization.

Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has accused groups she referred to as ‘anarchists’ of trying to create Sri Lanka-type mayhem in the country during the recent quota reform movement. She has claimed they had planned to topple the Government.

“Actually, they planned to create a Sri Lanka-type violence and oust the Government,” she said when Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma called on her at her official residence Ganabhaban this week.

According to Bangladeshi news reports the Prime Minister had told Verma that the recent movement centring on quota reform was not a normal movement at all, rather at one stage it turned into almost a terrorist-like attack.

Hasina, who sanctioned a brutal crackdown on the protestors has called for the people involved in the violence to be brought to justice.

The unrest which took place in Bangladesh in mid-July killed at least 150 people, injured several thousand people and damaged major Government agencies.

Will Gnanasara provide a golden opportunity for RW to postpone or cancel the election by instigating widespread violence and declaration of emergency?

Prisoner Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera, a social miscreant and public provocateur in saffron robes, who was condemned by a Colombo High Court Magistrate to four years rigorous imprisonment with an additional fine of Rs. 100,000, had been released on bail after intense pressure from Buddhist prelates and the Sinhala Buddhist supremacist organisation Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) whose Secretary General happens to be this notorious prisoner. His release is the latest victory for political Buddhism, a deviant creed drawn up by a group of Buddhist monks, which in course of time became a vote winner in almost every election in Sri Lanka.

### Need for an epistemological break

In a country like Sri Lanka, where ethno-nationalist politics has polarised the communities and made them see each other as enemies, we need a new language to talk about our political future under a framework of devolution which emphasises inclusiveness rather than exclusiveness

Devolution of power to regions is essential for a democratic society. However, as Rosa Luxemburg warned, national self-determination can be a dangerous distraction from the imperative to collaborate with labour movements. Sri Lanka faces a severe economic crisis, debt burden, and exploitation of labour and natural resources by multinational corporations and governments. The marginalised, such as workers, peasants, plantation workers, women, LGBT+ individuals, and oppressed castes, are the most affected. The Alliance, as a progressive movement, ought to address fundamental issues such as devolution of powers and class, caste, and gender divisions, as well as exploitation and dispossession, to unite the people

Prasanna Vithanage returns to hilly terrain, its misty mountains and cold climes in this ‘Sri Lankan-Indian co-produced drama film’, Paradise, 2024. We remember Oba nathuwa oba ekka (With You, Without You), 2012, where the backdrop was also in an Up Country setting, as we sit down to experience his latest feature film. Reminiscent of Oba nethuwa, we also see Vithanage returning to Indian actors–this time the key protagonists are both from India and they form the visiting tourist couple (Kesav and Amritha), in the film. Interestingly, Sri Lankan actor and key protagonist from Oba nethuwa oba ekka, Sharm Fernando, is the tourist guide-cum-driver in Paradise too, forming the threesome that push forward the story, apart from how the film starts with. Starting off as fellow travellers on a journey, Sharm Fernando as Mr Andrew the chauffeur, also remains at the end of the film, alongside Amritha, the surviving member of the Indian couple.
