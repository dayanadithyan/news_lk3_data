The challenge for the major political parties is to accept the concept and then work out any areas of contention, and areas of improvements

The concept of a legislated economic plan that incorporates economic parameters (or targets) is an opportunity to end 76 years of insanity. The challenge for the major political parties is to accept the concept and then work out any areas of contention, and areas of improvements. Opposing the concept is insanity and a disservice to future generations.

The Economic Transformation Bill is expected to provide for the National Policy on Economic Transformation and for the establishment of the Economic Commission of Sri Lanka, Investment Zones, Office for International Trade, National Productivity Commission, and Sri Lanka Institute of Economics and International Trade, and for the repeal of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law No.4 of 1978 and other matters connected.

### Interventions of a freelance intellectual: A review of Dayan Jayatilleka’s selected writings

British philosopher and historian Perry Anderson defines Western Marxism as the product of defeat. Unlike in the Soviet Union and China, there were no successful Marxist revolutions in the West. The Western Marxist is then a vanquished and disenchanted figure. Never having known the taste and trials of success, the Western Marxist reduces socialism to an abstract ideal and an impotent exercise in scholasticism.

The theologian and Marxist scholar Roland Boer identifies the “freelance intellectual” as the chief proponent of Western Marxism. In short, the freelance intellectual is the academic, journalist, cultural critic, etc. who purveys a form of Marxist analysis but is, for the most part, independent of the discipline and accountability enforced by membership in a Communist Party or trade union. In China, to be a Communist means to be a Community Party member. In the West, one is free to adopt any label one pleases.

As has been usual in our country, at every monsoon season especially during the South-West monsoon flooding, landslides and displacement of citizens have become normal. Every year this newspaper has highlighted this fact and called on authorities to draw up plans to prevent these disasters.

To date, 16 people have died, 5 remain missing and 84,749 persons have been displaced. Sadly, nothing has changed. Have our engineers run out of ideas as to how such disasters could be prevented?

Media reports show 2017 was perhaps the worst year since torrential rains soaked the country in May 2003. The Disaster Management Center reported more than 150 deaths, over 1,800 damaged homes and almost half a million people becoming homeless. The worst-affected area was Bulathsinhala in the Kalutara District.

### Modi claims victory for his alliance in India’s general election

*2024-06-04 21:08:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99664/modi-claims-victory-for-his-alliance-in-indias-general-election) · `en`

(AP) — Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed victory for his alliance on Tuesday in India’s general election, despite a lackluster performance from his own party as it faced a stronger than expected challenge from the opposition, which pushed back against his mixed economic record and polarizing politics.

Modi told a crowd at his party’s headquarters that his National Democratic Alliance will form the government for the third consecutive time, saying Indian voters had “shown immense faith” both in his party and the coalition alliance.

“Today’s victory is the victory of the world’s largest democracy” he said.

Still, for the first time since Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it appeared unlikely it would secure a majority on its own, and the prime minister would instead need the support of the other parties in his coalition for his third five-year term in the world’s largest democratic exercise.
