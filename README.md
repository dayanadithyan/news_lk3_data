Therefore, various groups associated with the United National Party are making a very false message to prevent the Tamil people from joining us.

With 11 runs needed in the final three balls for Sri Lanka to win, a full toss from Afghanistan's fast bowler Wafadar Mohammad soared above the waist of all-rounder Kamindu Mendis, as he stepped out of the crease and attempted to heave the ball onto the leg side.

With the no ball not signaled, Kamindu Mendis pleaded with umpires Ravindra Wimalasiri and square leg umpire Lyndon Hannibal to review the call, but the umpires chose not to.

### Abolishing the executive presidency – is time running out?

*2024-02-22 01:24:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Abolishing-the-executive-presidency-is-time-running-out/4-758749) · `en`

In this crucial election year, we need to ask ourselves why it is necessary to change the existing system – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Earlier this week, the President’s Media Division issued a statement to the effect that the next Presidential election will be held on schedule. What was the need for that statement? In terms of the Constitution, the President’s term of office ends not later than 18 November 2024. As far as I am aware, no Member of Parliament has given any indication that he or she intends to introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution to extend the term of office of the President, as required by article 83 of the Constitution. Such a Bill, if passed with a two-third majority, will also need to be approved by the people at a referendum. In the absence of any such move, what was the need for the President’s Media Division to assert the obvious? Was it to stifle the movement for restoring the parliamentary executive that now appears to be gathering wide public support?

### The President should take steps to recover the ban imposed by the Ministry of Defense to bring the Arab Buddha into the country - Rishad Bathiudeen

*2024-02-22 01:23:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177003) · `ta`

The government should take immediate action to reopen the Ragama and Mahara schools closed following the Easter bombing. National People's Congress leader Rishad Bathiudeen said that the President should take steps to restore the ban imposed by the Ministry of Defense to bring the Arab Buddha into the country.

He said this while addressing the debate on the current state of the country held in Parliament on Wednesday (21).

The Secretary of the Ministry of Defense is still in force forbidding the Arab Buddha following the Easter bombing. So the Arab Mattarasas in the country are unable to bring the Arabic bottles.

Similarly, even tourists from Arab countries are unable to bring Arab books. The President should therefore take action to withdraw the letter to the Secretary of the Ministry as the Minister of Defense.

The private sector preferred to mind its business and the JVP didn’t wish to team up with any government and get its hands dirty.

NPP Leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake has stated on numerous occasions that the alliance he leads will appoint as Heads of State Institutions, professionals with a proven educational background.

### Afghanistan win three-run thriller, but Sri Lanka take T20 series

Dambulla, Feb. 21 - Afghanistan salvaged some pride on Wednesday when they secured a nail-biting three-run win over hosts Sri Lanka in the third T20 international, the last game of their multi-format tour.

It has been a wretched tour for the Afghans -- losing six matches in a row -- but skipper Ibrahim Zadran said he was "feeling great" after his team held their nerve in a dramatic close with a hard-fought win.

"I am happy with the win," Zadran said. "Unfortunately, we lost the series."

Sri Lanka had already secured the three-match T20 series after winning the first two games, the first by four runs, and the second by 72 runs.

They had also won the one-off Test match and the one-day international series in a 3-0 clean sweep.

But Afghanistan seemed determined to win at least one match.

Sri Lanka required 36 off the last two overs, with Dasun Shanaka bringing the chase down to 24 off eight balls -- but was run out.

### Anura, Sajith, Champika: Presidential chances, hopes, targeted by abolition ambush

“Ranil will have to go home even before his term of office, if he attempts to evade the Presidential election.”

The interim report of the Presidential Commission headed by former Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, appointed to suggest electoral reforms, will be presented to President Wickremesinghe in April. This gives cause for apprehension on several counts.

As a president who was appointed and not elected, and was not even elected to the legislature in the first place, Ranil has no mandate to examine, still less attempt wide-ranging arrangements which would require a change in or of the Constitution. His task is to complete his predecessor’s term on the basis of his mandate and that mandate was the opposite of one committed to abolishing the executive presidency.

The SLPP has no mandate to support him in doing so, because it was elected on the contrary mandate.

### Sri Lanka partially repays Iranian oil USD 20 million worth of tea

Sri Lanka said on Wednesday (21 Feb.) it had exported tea worth USD 20 million to Iran to partially repay its USD 251 million oil debts, with Colombo saying Tehran’s visiting foreign minister had expressed “satisfaction” at the deal.

“So far USD20 million worth of tea has been exported to Iran under the barter trade agreement,” Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena’s office said in a statement after talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.

The tea-for-oil deal was agreed upon in December 2021, but exports were delayed by Colombo’s economic crisis that forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down in July 2022.

The barter deal allows sanctions-hit Iran to avoid having to use up scarce hard currency to pay for imports of popular tea.

It also allowed Sri Lanka to pay with tea, as the country was short of foreign currency.
