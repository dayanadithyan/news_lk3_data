Details of the deal were still being hashed out as G7 leaders gathered for a summit in Italy, but the money could reach Kyiv before the end of the year. ThatтАЩs according to a French official who confirmed the agreement Wednesday ahead of a formal announcement at the summit. HereтАЩs how the plan would work:

Most of the money would be provided in the form of a loan from the U.S. government that would be backed by windfall profits being earned on roughly $300 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of the money is being held in European Union nations.

A French official said that while the loan would be mostly U.S.-guaranteed, it could be тАЬtopped upтАЭ with European money or other national contributions.

### Kadirgama Wildfire: Confusion among Hindus

The Kadirgama Wildfire has caused confusion among Hindus due to sudden changes in the opening dates of the footpath leading to the Kadirgamak Kandan Temple. Initially set to open on July 2, the decision was made at a meeting in Kadirgama on June 11. However, concerns were raised as the usual six-day journey through the forest was reduced to four days, sparking suspicions of a planned conspiracy. The temple's opening was also criticized for lacking essential facilities like water supply. Despite these issues, fundraising efforts are underway to address the shortcomings. The Hindu community fears this could lead to future disruptions in the pilgrimage route.

ЁЯЯй

The historic Kadirgamak Kandan Temple has been re -changed on the date of the opening of the wildfire for the footpaths.

That is, the date of the opening of the route is said to be on July 2.

The date was decided at a meeting held at Kadirgama on Tuesday (11). Moneragala District Government Agent Ratnayake has announced that it will be closed on July 2 and closed on the 14th.

Can't cross the forest in four days. Normally need six days. It is therefore thought that this country may be a planned conspiracy.

At that time, the pilgrimage was opened ten days before the flag pole and was specially featured without any water supply or water supply.. The wildflower is open for about 20 days.

However. The Lakugala Divisional Secretariat is collecting funds for this purpose. A few more charities also collect funds for water supply. People are unaware of what is going on. "Even the days are expensive if we open it. We have gone in three days," an official said at the Kadirgamaka meeting.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ The International Monetary Fund has approved Sri LankaтАЩs program review allowing the disbursement of 330 million US dollars, while calling for monetary policy to be used only for stability.

тАЬMonetary policy should continue prioritizing price stability, supported by a sustained commitment to refrain from monetary financing and safeguard central bank independence,тАЭ Kenji Okamura, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair said in a statement.

The call comes as inflationists are calling for rates cuts to support тАШgrowthтАЩ and early noises are starting to be made about тАШpositive real interest ratesтАЩ based on historical inflation.

Sri LankaтАЩs inflation is currently low as anchor conflicts have not yet re-emerged, though the operating framework of the monetary authority remains deeply flawed without a credible anchor, critics have said.

### Conflict left in Sri Lanka constitution to avoid referendum

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ The 19th Amendment created a conflict in Sri LankaтАЩs constitution, but it remained unresolved because the then government was determined to avoid a referendum.

The deficiency in the constitution was highlighted in a report by  EconomyNext on Tuesday and later taken up during a government meeting at the highest levels, sources familiar with the issue said.

The constitutional error, which has persisted since April 2015, could allow an incumbent president to extend his term by less than a year without facing a referendum.

Former legislator and PresidentтАЩs Counsel Jayampathy Wickramaratne said the brief from the then government was to come up with a bill for a 19th Amendment which could be passed without a referendum.

тАЬAs a member of the team that drafted the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, I wish to make a clarification,тАЭ Wickramaratne said, adding that they were aware of the issue.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs PlantersтАЩ Association said a government mandated wage hike which amounted to 70 percent, will be contested in court, as the islandтАЩs wages were double that of India.

Tea and rubber estates may have difficulties in servicing loans due to the wage hike.

тАЬSri Lanka already grapples with the highest production costs, wages, and lowest productivity among all tea-growing nations.

тАЬNotably, the newly gazetted wage is double that of India, creating significant cost disparities in the global market.

This unilateral increase affects not only the regional plantation companies but also over 400 private tea factories in Sabaragamuwa and the Southern province, smallholders employing external labor, and all rubber producers and factories, the statement said.

### Competition against the West Indies is decisive to New Zealand

*2024-06-13 01:48:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185957) ┬╖ `ta`

In the R20 World Cup, New Zealand's C team faces the West Indies after losing to Afghanistan. A win against the West Indies could secure New Zealand's spot in the Super 8 round, enhancing their chances. Historically, New Zealand has performed well in World Cups, reaching the semi-finals or finals multiple times since 2015 but struggled against Afghanistan this year. The match against the West Indies is crucial for New Zealand, who leads 10-4 in international T20 encounters but faced a tie and loss in previous meetings. Both teams aim to advance to the Super 8 round, making this match pivotal.

ЁЯЯй

The New Zealand C team, which lost its first match against Afghanistan, will oppose the West Indies in its second match in the R20 World Cup.

The tournament will begin at 6.00 am on Thursday (13).

If the West Indies wins the match, the fourth team will qualify for the Super 8 round, while New Zealand's Super 8 round chance will be questioned.

So in today's match, New Zealand will try to increase its Super round chance by defeating the West Indies.

New Zealand, which has revealed the best in the World Cup since 2015, has advanced to the semi -finals of 2015, 2019, 2019 and 2023 in 2016, 2021 and 2022. On 3 occasions, he played in the final game, but did not hesitate.

However, there is suspicion that New Zealand will leave the first round of Afghanistan by 84 runs this year.

So the rivalry against the West Indies will be a knock out of New Zealand.

On the other hand, the West Indies will also try to win the Super 8 round.

*2024-06-13 01:29:14* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Mullaitivu-fishermen-threaten-action-amidst-illegal-fishing-crisis/56-763030) ┬╖ `en`

Tensions are rising among fishermen in Mullaitivu as Government authorities allegedly continue to fail to stop illegal fishing by fishermen from other provinces, leading to the risk of a major conflict in the region. Local fishing leaders have given the authorities a two-day ultimatum to address the issue, warning of drastic measures if their demands are not met.

Fishermen from outer provinces have been accused of using prohibited gear to fish in the Mullaitivu sea, depleting resources and threatening the livelihoods of local fishermen. This has prompted the Jaffna District FishermenтАЩs Cooperative Society Vice President, Antonipillai Francis Ratnakumar, to issue a stern warning during a protest held on 10 June in front of the Mullaitivu District Secretariat.

India beat the United States by 7 wickets in the R20 World Cup, qualifying for the Super 8 round. In a challenging pitch, India, after electing to chase 111 runs, achieved the target in 18.2 overs despite early losses. Key contributions came from Suryakumar Yadav (50 runs) and Shivam Dube (31 runs). The United States, batting first, managed 110 runs in 20 overs, led by Nitish Kumar (27) and Steven Taylor (24). India's bowlers, Saurab Nethravalkar and Arshdeep Singh, were standout performers.

ЁЯЯй

India won by 7 wickets in the R20 World Cup for A Group, which ended some time ago at the New York Nasav County Cricket Stadium between India and the United States.

With this victory, India qualified for the third team in the Super 8 round.

South Africa (D Group) and Australia (B Group) are the first two teams to be selected for the Super 8 round.

In the strange pitch, the players also faced the difficulty of facing the bowlers.

In some cases unthinkable, the ball flowed and in some cases the ball went down.

In response to the United States, India won the toss and elected to win 111 runs, losing 3 wickets in 18.2 overs.

Virat Kohli (0), team captain Rohit Sharma (3) and Rishabh Bant (18) lost 39 runs in the overs.

India's total number was 47 runs for the loss of 3 wickets in 10 overs.

Hi! This week, IтАЩve decided to do the Beauty Tips scene with tomatoes.

Mix the lemon juice and tomato pulp and apply this pack to the affected areas of your face (blemishes).

Let it dry for 10-12 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water.

You will need 1/2 cup of mashed tomato and 1/4 cup of grated cucumber.

Apply this mixture to your face, wait for 20 minutes and then wash with lukewarm water.

You will need 1/2 tomato (mashed), 01 teaspoon of coconut oil, and 01 tablespoon of yoghurt.
