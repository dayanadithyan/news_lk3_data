### Choosing between Robert Wilmot Horton and Ponnambalam Arunachalam

*2024-01-23 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Choosing-between-Robert-Wilmot-Horton-and-Ponnambalam-Arunachalam/172-275517) · `en`

Changing names of places and roads bearing the names of foreigners is common in countries that have gained independence from foreign rule. Such changes can be easily justified in some cases where the foreign ruler was despotic, but in others it may be a bit tricky as both personalities may have had significant contributions to their credit.

In most cases, the personages displaced are driven into oblivion despite their contribution to society, and erased from history.

The proposed change-over from “Horton Place” in Colombo 7 to “Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam Mawatha” is justified given the yeoman service rendered by Arunachalam to Ceylon, and the fact that he resided there.

Drones in warfare are primarily used for surveillance, intelligence gathering, propaganda, and strikes

In the realm of drone warfare, Stealth and Survivability are important factors

Technology that classifies drones will usually be able to separate drones from other types of objects-like planes, trains, and automobiles

State Actors, such as the United States, China, and Russia, have invested heavily in the development of sophisticated drone technology using Advanced Technology

The Ukrainian battlespace features the most intensive use of drones in a military conflict in history, marking a shift in warfare tactics and technology

### We need a Foolproof Mechanism for Presidential Pardon

*2024-01-23 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/We-need-a-Foolproof-Mechanism-for-Presidential-Pardon/172-275516) · `en`

Many hailed the recent Supreme Court ruling on the case against the granting of Presidential pardon to former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva who had been convicted for the murder of former Presidential Advisor Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8, 2011, calling it a landmark judgement. However, their stand on the mater does not seem to be so different than the decision by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to grant the pardon to Silva. Both were politically driven.

The irony of the decision by former President Rajapaksa was that at the time of the murder, both Silva and Premachandra were working closely with him, one as a monitoring MP for the Defence Ministry to which Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the Secretary, and the other as the Advisor to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on trade union affairs. However, the family of Premachandra distanced themselves from the government alleging that the government of the day was siding with Silva during the investigations.

Tapping into advanced technologies, such as all-photonics networks and quantum and edge computing, could be the linchpin in harnessing what’s beyond the horizon. Imagine a tomorrow where Sri Lanka paves its tech avenues with 5G, virtual reality, and augmented reality — a visionary dreamscape manifesting in real-time, shaking the foundations of its economic and competitive stratum

A leap into the innovation frontier has its challenges. The lack of extensive citation networks, a shortfall in venture capital funding, and skill mismatches represent the systemic constraints strangling the pipeline of creativity and opportunity. Sri Lanka stares down these bottlenecks, aware that overcoming them is a prelude to any genuine advancement in global standing

Unless that political culture is removed and replaced with a secular democratic culture there is no

hope for ethnic and religious minorities to live in Sri Lanka with dignity, freedom and justice

To the two minorities therefore the choice is starkly evident. Either they vote for a leader and party that advocates system change to bring about a new socio-economic order grounded in integrational politics, secular democracy and corruption free governance or vote for a champion of the old system that has kept the nation divided since independence, immiserised the economy and created a class of political parvenus thriving on public wealth.

The presentation at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) by 8 legal experts on behalf of South Africa was dazzling, perfectly structured, scripted and choreographed, and flawlessly executed throughout. The moral outrage in the tone of presentation was effectively rendered, and resonated with most of the world. It thereby stands tall today as the new moral force shining a light on barbarism, wresting the self-acclaimed title from countries in the West that chose to back the accused in this case

Original BRICS member and last year’s chair of BRICS, South Africa gained the admiration and appreciation of most of the world for its moral courage and example in acting to intervene in the horrific tragedy in Gaza by taking legal action at the Hague against Israel’s “genocidal acts” in its conduct of the war, calling inter alia, for an urgent ruling in favour of the immediate suspension of hostilities. It also won enormous respect for delivering its case with impressive competence and style.

Dubai seems to be the number one destination for Merlina Fernando and that’s where she is at the moment, since early 2023, operating as Merlina & Mission.

They are being featured at the Citymax Hotel Bur Dubai and are doing this scene as a trio.

This is not Merlina’s first assignment in Dubai; her very first trip was in 2006 with the band Dream Team, and, since then, she has been checking out Dubai on a regular basis.

Before travelling to Dubai, Merlina was performing with her husband, as a duo, in the Maldives.

Initially, they operated as a four-piece outfit, when they got to Dubai in 2023, but at a different venue.

Says Merlina: “We got a good offer and so we decided to switch venues, and the Citymax Hotel Bur Dubai, where we now perform, is awesome.

“We are featured at the High So, six nights a week, from 9.30 pm onwards, along with a DJ, and the crowd is great, and we are extremely happy doing our thing here.”

Last week the IMF team was in Sri Lanka to review the process and commended Sri Lanka’s progress, but emphasized that the external debt restructuring, especially with commercial creditors, needs to be completed before April.

Amid those developments both indices moved downwards. The All- Share Price Index went down by 61.2 points and S and P SL20 declined by 27.8 points. Turnover stood at Rs 978 million with two crossings. Those crossings were reported in Wind Force, which crossed 25 million shares to the tune of Rs 482 million; its shares traded at Rs 19.70 and Renuka Foods 6 million shares crossed for Rs 120 million and its shares sold at Rs 20.

The general rule is that teams have to send in a concussion substitute from the players list submitted ahead of the match.

### Measles vaccine already administered to 91% of children – Health Minister

Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana announced a staggering 91% vaccination rate for measles among children, a crucial step in combating a recent resurgence of the disease after eradication. This achievement demonstrates the country’s dedication to proactive healthcare, he said.

Speaking at a media briefing on Monday, Dr. Pathirana outlined further health priorities for 2024. Disease prevention takes centre stage, with plans to bolster primary healthcare services and improve efficiency for patients. Prompt access to essential resources is also a key focus, he stressed.

However, tackling non-communicable diseases (NCDs) remains a major challenge. Over 20% of Sri Lankans battle diabetes, and the country holds the dubious distinction of having the highest prevalence of high blood pressure among over-35s in South Asia. Addressing these concerns and their associated complications like heart disease and stroke is critical for Sri Lanka’s long-term health, the minister said.

UN experts on Monday expressed alarm at the heavy security-driven approach of Sri Lanka’s drug response. They called on authorities to immediately suspend and review so-called Operation ‘Yukthiya’ and to focus on policies based on health and human rights.

“Drug users have human rights,” the experts said. “They deserve to live a life with dignity without facing further discrimination and stigmatisation.”

They deplored reported cases of arbitrary arrests of thousands of drug offenders from marginalised socio-economic groups, and the detention of hundreds in compulsory military-run rehabilitation centres. Torture and ill-treatment were also reported during the security operation known as ‘Yukthiya’.

“The current context of severe repression against suspected drug offenders is deeply worrying,” the experts said.
