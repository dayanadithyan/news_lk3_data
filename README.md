### Candidate in the same name;Namal faces a different challenge in the presidential election

*2024-08-14 10:47:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191048) · `ta`

In Sri Lanka's presidential election, Namal Rajapaksa faces unique challenges due to the presence of other candidates with similar names. This situation, reminiscent of past tactics by the Rajapaksas to confuse voters, has led to a confusing electoral landscape. Despite attempts to split votes among similarly named candidates, such strategies have historically failed to significantly impact the outcome.

🟩

The next -haired successor of the Rajapaksa lineage faces a different challenge in the upcoming presidential election.

Sri Lanka's voters face an unprecedented long -standing ballot as 36 candidates have been restricted until Tuesday evening.

Two nams in this ballot have turned the ballot into a confusion.

Stopping candidates of the same name is a tactic used by Rajapaksas in the past.

Rajapaksas stopped Sirisena to confuse Maithripala Sirisena's supporters who contested the presidential election in the 2015 presidential election as the general candidate of the opposition parties.. He was seen as a look like Maithripala Sirisena.

AR Sirisena, who stopped Rajapaksakkal, received 18174 votes, though many were not disappointed by this deception.

If his name is written in C.S.

However, the letter H in English is overwhelmed by a few people.

### Japan PM Kishida to step down as scandals prove too much

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he will step down in September, ending a three-year term marred by political scandals and paving the way for a new premier to address the impact of rising prices.

“I will continue to do everything I can as prime minister until then end of my term in September,” Kishida said in a televised press conference on Wednesday to announce his decision not seek re-election as Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader.

His decision to quit triggers a contest to replace him as party boss, and by extension as the leader of the world’s fourth-biggest economy.

Kishida’s public support eroded amid revelations about the party’s ties to the controversial Unification Church, and more recently, unrecorded political donations made at LDP fundraising parties.

Government officials, including the Trincomalee District Government Agent, Kuchchaveli Divisional Secretary, visited the site on Tuesday (13).

In the meantime, the people's land documents were investigated and the relevant authorities and the relevant Vikramadi would take action soon.

Kuchchaveli - Illandaikulam 5th Kuttai was suspended following the issue of the Kuchchaveli Divisional Secretariat as the people's land was cleaned up to set up a Buddhist Vihara under the leadership of a Buddhist monk from the night of the 25th of last month.. Subsequently, the matter was taken to the attention of top state officials, including MPs.

People who lived in the Lantaikulam area have been displaced in the 1990s and adjoining periods due to the war, and the people are concerned that the people who have long had been resettled in the area, despite the fact that the people have not been resettled.
