Questions have been raised about the fairness of the Feb. 8 election both inside Pakistan as well as in major foreign capitals, with Washington having previously said there were “undue restrictions” on freedoms of expression and assembly.

“We are watching this very, very closely,” White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday, expressing concern about “intimidation and voter suppression.”

“International monitors are still taking a look at those tallies, I’m not going to get ahead of that process,” he added about the vote count.

The arguments against VAT on books, including the negative impact on education, culture, intellectual progress, literary aesthetics, the knowledge economy and social mobility, are irrefutable.

I have just come from the fabulous Galle Literary Festival, an annual event described by many of the internationally renowned authors attending as the “best literary festival in the world” which attracts a huge influx of tourists and is a massive boon to the economy.

Tourism authorities are in the process of creating a Buddhist trail in Sri Lanka, a fresh effort towards luring religious travellers.

“Sri Lanka, as a Buddhist country, holds immense potential to establish a unique tourism brand that resonates globally,” he said.

“With rich heritage, breath-taking landscapes and profound spiritual significance, Sri Lanka can emerge as a leading destination for Buddhist pilgrimages and cultural exploration on the global tourism map,” Gajabahu added.

When compared to the Ramayana trail, he opined that the proposed Buddhist Trail can gain more traction from a broader section of travellers from South East Asian countries to East Asian countries such as China to European countries.

There was a popular breakfast show on television a few days ago where singers Bathiya and Santhush shared their ideas about being successful in music; the business that’s close to their hearts.

What the duo underscored was the fact that they didn’t merely enter the music industry, but created a space for themselves in the music market. In other words, the duo had ‘selling’ in mind, whenever they came up with a new album.

There are many talent shows in this country which serve in finding the next generation of performance artistes. Bathiya maintained that during these live shows, coaches can only focus on improving skills of budding singers, but cannot teach them marketing.

We can see hordes of teachers entering the teaching profession and being unhappy after a few years in the industry. On the contrary, we also see the tuition masters rule the roost; enjoying the time spent with children and minting money.

Children sit inside a vehicle loaded with items secured by rope as people flee the southern city of Rafah toward the centre of the Gaza Strip to escape Israel’s ground war in the city

Never has an Israeli government been as cruel or malicious as Benjamin Netanyahu’s hardline government, which is planning to unleash what is feared as the worst phase of Israel’s genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip. With 1.5 million starving and suffering Palestinians crammed into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, Israel has pledged to launch a massive ground, air, and sea offensive.

And never has a United States government been as weak in its diplomatic coercion as the present Joe Biden administration is. Diplomatic power is seen not only when a nation uses its diplomatic clout to tame a hostile nation but also in the ability to coax or coerce a friend.

### Sri Lanka’s inflation expected to hit 5% in medium term, report says

Sri Lanka’s spike in inflation is expected to be short-lived and will return to the targeted 5% in the medium term, a monetary policy report released by the central bank said on Thursday as the island nation’s economy stabilises from a crippling financial crisis.

Sri Lanka’s economy is seeing glimmers of recovery, helped by a $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, after it went into freefall in 2022 due to a severe foreign exchange shortage.

At the start of 2024, Sri Lanka raised its value added tax (VAT) to 18% from 15% to meet revenue targets under the IMF programme, sparking a renewed rise in its key inflation rate, which rose to 6.4% at the end of last month from 4% in December.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which committed to maintaining inflation at 5% under a new law introduced last year, said price increases from the tax hike in January were unlikely to persist due to subdued demand and the economy operating below its full capacity.
