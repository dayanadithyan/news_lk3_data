### CEDAW and the rights of working women in Sri Lanka

*2024-02-29 01:39:56* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/CEDAW-and-the-rights-of-working-women-in-Sri-Lanka/4-758967) · `en`

Violence and harassment against working women transcends borders, salary brackets and levels of job security

Incidence reports appearing in newspapers, and complaints made at police stations are just the tip of the iceberg and the magnitude of the problem is much greater and most of the time hidden and unspoken of. Discrimination occurs when a woman reasonably believes that expressing her objection would negatively impact her employment, including aspects like recruitment or promotion. This recognition underscores the importance of fostering an environment where women can voice their concerns without fear of repercussions

“No country can ever truly flourish if it stifles the potential of its women and deprives itself of the contributions of half of its citizens”

It is a mood and movement of the masses powered by layered generations of the state university educated modern middle-class, led by its organised vanguard intelligentsia (the JVP leadership comprising former university student leaders) and affiliated or networked intelligentsia (the NPP leadership). The JVP is leftist, of a Marxist-Leninist formation; the NPP, left-inclined.

It is a revolution with a vision of modernisation and inclusive, non-discriminatory nation-building. The modernisation is not led by the bourgeois elite but the educated middle-classes. It is not statist, but is not anti-state, coming as it does from the beneficiaries of state education and professionals of the public sector. In terms of ethos, the state university educated generations have residual socialist sympathies.

Following a long spell of about five months of rainfall in most parts of the country, especially in the wet zone which devastated the agriculture in those areas, the country has begun to experience seemingly a similar long spell of drought which seems to be carrying devastating effects on the same farming community.

It might have a huge effect on hydro power generation as well, making in turn a negative bearing on the electricity consumers who have already been hit hard by two consecutive tariff hikes within a short period with relatively massive margins such as 70 percent. Interestingly, the authorities responsible for supplying electricity to the country (who refused to reduce the electricity tariff during the recent rainy period despite repeated requests by various groups in the country) are going to reduce the tariffs by 18 percent now, according to media reports.

### Exponential Growth Of BJP In Tamil Nadu In Five Years (2019 – 2024)

*2024-02-28 18:54:05* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/exponential-growth-of-bjp-in-tamil-nadu-in-five-years-2019-2024/) · `en`

“Precise dates, picturesque outbreaks; these are conventions and conveniences of historians but history is a process too subtle for such methods.” – Lord Acton

To many a student of history the above quote is a truism. Keen observers of recent times too would admit to its exactitude. There is a qualification however. Every historic event has had a fair period filled with  long gestating antecedents. French Revolution did not explode just on 14th July 1789. German nationalism grew up with philosopher Fichte’s ‘Addresses to the German Nation’ after 1812. What followed was Bismark’s ideology of ‘Blood and Iron’ which unified Germany with wars in the sixties. Likewise, the Russian and Chinese revolutions had their protracted struggles.

### Gaza: Creating Hell On Earth

*2024-02-28 18:46:16* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/gaza-creating-hell-on-earth/) · `en`

I have been deeply distressed by Israel’s military assault on the population of Gaza. Many people of Sri Lankan origin had not bothered to study the history of the plight of Palestinians until the brave military operation by the Palestinian Resistance on 7th Oct 2023.

Consider the background of the Zionist apartheid state; one issue is the Right of Return. Within two years of the Zionist state calling itself Israel being proclaimed in the Knesset, ‘The Law of Return’ was established, a law which allows any Jew around the world to migrate to Israel and automatically become citizens, developing illegal settlements with impunity. In 1952, the Knesset passed the Citizenship Law, which effectively bars any Palestinian not living in Israel from returning and reclaiming their former property from the colonisers.
