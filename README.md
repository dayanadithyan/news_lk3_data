Therefore, he stressed that it is the duty of adults to immediately rush them to hospital when such incidents occur as well as to prevent such situation from arising.

Meanwhile, a tragic incident has been reported from the Munhena area of Maggona, where a three-and-a-half-year-old girl has died allegedly due to electrocution while using a mobile phone that was plugged into a charger.

The girl, who had returned home from preschool, was using a mobile phone while it was charging in a room of the house. Her elder brother discovered her lying unconscious and immediately alerted their father.

As far as the government is concerned, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) is refreshing to recall on May 18.

The reasons for the ban on the events have been changed from preventing the spread of the disease from the prevention of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).

According to reports, people in Batticaloa this morning have blocked the transport of Mullivaikkal porridge.

Colombo, May 14 (Daily Mirror) - Cabinet approval was granted today to commence the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Level (A/L) classes immediately after the completion of the GCE Ordinary Level (O/L) examinations.

Cabinet spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardana said it will take at least three months for the Examinations Department to release the results after the completion of the GCE (O/L) examinations.

"During this period, the students' deviation from school education is the reason for the decrease in their tendency to proceed for the GCE (A/L) education, and it also creates various social issues," he said.

Taking these facts into account, it has been identified that it is appropriate to start the GCE (A/L) education in schools with the completion of the O/L examinations in 2024. This makes it possible to manage the students' time effectively and provide enough time for teachers to cover the GCE (A/L) syllabus, Minister Gunawardana said.

ЁЯЯй

Australian court has sentenced lawyer David Makbright to five years in prison for exposing Australia's war crimes in Afghanistan.

He said he thought it was his moral duty to convey the truth.

Historical inquiries revealed that Australian soldiers killed 38 civilians in Afghanistan.

Her supporters have consistently accused the Australian government for not trying to punish the culprits for exposing the war crimes.

Ravan Arao, Executive Director of the Australian Center for International Justice, said that the first person who was first imprisoned in Australia's Afghan war crimes was not a war criminal.

The law director of the Melbourne Human Rights Law Center has stated that this is the black day of Australian democracy.

He said that Makbrat's prison sentence would be a serious fear for those who are interested in exposing the truth.

In an interview with Al Jazeera last year, he said he had never kept the secret that the documents were shared
