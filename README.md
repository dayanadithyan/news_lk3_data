### Trump ordered to pay $354mn in New York civil fraud case

*2024-02-17 07:05:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97337/trump-ordered-to-pay-354mn-in-new-york-civil-fraud-case) · `en`

Former President Donald Trump must pay nearly $355 million (£281 million) to New York state for lying about the values of his properties, a judge has ruled.

Judge Arthur Engoron also banned him from serving as a company director or taking out loans from banks in the state for three years.

The New York real estate mogul escaped having some of his companies dissolved, which could have meant bankruptcy.

Speaking from his Florida estate, Mr Trump said he would appeal the ruling.

“A crooked New York state judge just ruled I have to pay a fine for $350 million for having built a perfect company,” the former president said from Mar-a-Lago on Friday, calling the ruling a political witch hunt.

In the ruling on Friday, Judge Engoron referred to previous allegations of wrongdoing in justifying the large amounts he ordered the defendants to pay, writing that they “are likely to continue their fraudulent ways” unless he imposed a “significant” penalty.

The journey to independence was arduous, as Lithuania had endured subjugation under the Russian Empire, suppressing its cultural and national identity. Nevertheless, the Lithuanian spirit remained resolute, fuelling the persistent struggle for

### Waning hegemony

*2024-02-17 05:28:48* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Waning-hegemony/4-758585) · `en`

With the rise of China and much of Asia, the US no longer dominates the world economy

In the 16th century, Spain became the first global empire. Spain flexed its military prowess, but also prospered culturally, architecturally, and formulated ground-breaking ideas on natural law, sovereignty, international law and economics. They even themselves philosophically questioned the validity of imperialism!

By the 19th century, Britain became a global hegemon. This was inaugurated by the British Empire’s earlier defeat of the Spanish Armada coinciding with the flowering of the Elizabethan age, vast voyages of exploration and soon, the greatest navy the world had seen. This continued through Victorian England and the industrial revolution, until two world wars displaced an Empire on which once “the sun never set.”

With increasing grassroot support for NPP and its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) those two have become enemy No. 1 to champions of and campaigners for the corrupt system that is currently in vogue. All signs point towards a national mood for radical change led by AKD and his NPP. It is in that context that the recent visit to Delhi by AKD at the invitation of India is significant.

He spent a few hours discussing in English with the Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. This invitation would not have been issued without advice from India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in Colombo. RAW must have been closely watching and doing its own home work about the rapidly changing political scenario to convince itself of the winning chances to AKD at the next Presidential election. Hence their message to Delhi and the invitation followed.

Upali also went into aviation and began local helicopter and airline services

When working for a Tamil newspaper, I have come across many Sinhala persons who simply did not care a hoot about the Tamil media. I have also come across many Sinhalese who were extremely concerned about what appeared in the Tamil newspapers. Upali belonged to the latter group. Though he could not read Tamil he got his Tamil employees at the Upali Group to inform him about what was appearing in the Virakesari.

Today (Feb 17) is the birthday of Sri Lanka’s popular business magnate Philip Upali Wijewardene. If Upali Wijewardene were among the living now, he would have celebrated his 86th birthday this year.  Alas, this was not to be as the Lear Jet he was travelling in disappeared on 13 February 1983, just 4 days before his 45th birthday.

The President, in his policy statement said “However, contentment with this progress alone is not sufficient… By September 2023 our total debt burden was US $ 91 billion

One of the main points that were highlighted by the media from the policy statement presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on February 7 after opening of the new session of the Parliament was the need for unity among major political parties in Parliament.

He questioned as to why the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) cannot join the government if the Sri Lanka Podujana Permuna (SLPP) can do so in the interest of the country. He also questioned as to why the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) could not join hands with his government if they could work with his party in 2015 with a view to eradicate corruption.

Again, at a function to mark the inauguration of the Anuradhapura North Water Supply Project on Thursday, the President reiterated his call for unity among political parties.

The health sector is one of the most important departments in any country. Recently, we had a Health Minister who dumped drugs unfit for human consumption on an unsuspecting population. Trade unions demanded his prosecution, and they were right.

Now these self-same unions are attempting to hold the nation to ransom via unreasonable demands for what amounts to a huge Rs. 35,000 travel allowance.

Two days ago, striking health workers once again called off their trade union action. This has been the second time within a week, these workers have taken trade union action demanding a Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance of Rs. 35,000.

Calling off the strike, union authorities declared they called off their action further to the Health Ministry promising to discuss their grievances. What is strange about the sudden about turn however is that these TUs were days earlier in discussion with the health authorities regarding this very demand.

ECONOMYNEXT — Former minister Udaya Gammanpila plans to present a private member’s bill to parliament seeking a ’22nd amendment’ to Sri Lanka’s constitution seeking the removal of police powers devolved to the provinces by the 13th amendment.

Gammanpila told reporters that devolving police powers to the provincial councils could pose a threat to national security.

“If there is a separatist war in the future, that war will be fought between the provincial police of the north and the Sri Lanka Army. Both will be official armies,” the former minister who now sits in the opposition said.

“Countries that work against Sri Lanka could openly, without hesitation, provide aid to that separatist armed movement, or in the other words, the northern police army,” he said.

Asked if his bill could get a two-thirds majority in parliament, Gammanpila said it would test parliament’s resolve.
