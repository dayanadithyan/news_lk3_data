Eight hundred pregnant women in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu took part in the study, which was started in 2017 by the Faculty of Public Health at the Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (SRIHER) in Chennai.

### Parents in Sri Lanka in a major crisis;Drug shortages;Increase in prices multi -fold

*2024-03-21 15:11:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179333) ┬╖ `ta`

Sri Lanka faces a health crisis due to drug shortages and rising prices. The government's health budget is insufficient, impacting patients like Nuwan, who travels for cancer treatment. The National Cancer Hospital is crucial for those without private access. The economic downturn exacerbates the crisis, with drug shortages and price increases. The pharmaceutical industry is affected, with international corporations contributing to the shortage. The Sri Lankan currency's fall in 2022-3 increases drug prices, and some fraudsters sell medicines at inflated prices. Health Minister Ramespatra acknowledges these issues, noting increased budget funds to address drug prices but also highlighting outdated drugs in government hospitals.

ЁЯЯй

Nuwan, a native of Medimalai, travels 230 kilometers every time he is suffering from cancer.

It was revealed last year that his 18 -year -old son was suffering from a bloodbath, and the two parents came to Makarahamavi every time they were treated from their homes.

The government has allocated four percent of its budget for health services to provide free medical mission to all Sri Lankan people.

However, due to the consequences of the economic downturn, the health sector, which has previously been acclaimed, has been in the crisis of drugs.

National Cancer Hospital, such as Puspakumara's family, is very important for many who cannot be treated in private hospitals.

Patients such as Nuwan should be given free of charge but have not recently seen such a situation.

Treatment is excellent but there is a shortage of drugs.

I am buying medicines from my family and friends, but the number of drugs has increased many times, he said.

Parliament, March 21 (Daily Mirror)- The Viyathmaga had no connection to the economic crisis and the expulsion of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa from office, Parliamentarian Nalaka Godahewa said today.

He told Parliament that the crisis situation was a result of the banning of chemical fertilizer, shortage of gas, the power crisis and depletion of foreign reserves.

The MP said Gotabaya Rajapaksa in his book which was released recently clearly said that former Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage had supported him in the implementation of the organic farming policy.

He said the Viyathmaga members who were appointed as Secretaries to the Ministries were against the decisions taken by the President and as a result, four of them were removed.

The MP said this in response to a claim made by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, who said that the Viyathmaga was behind the faulty decisions taken by Gotabaya Rajapaksa resulting in the expulsion of the then President and the government.

From Saturday, English language requirements for student and graduate visas will be increased, while the government will get the power to suspend education providers from recruiting international students if they repeatedly break rules.

"The actions this weekend will continue to drive migration levels down while delivering on our commitments in the migration strategy to fix the broken system we inherited," Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said in a statement.

A new "genuine student test" will be introduced to further crack down on international students who look to come to Australia primarily to work, while the imposition of "no further stay" conditions will be used on more visitor visas.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has unveiled immediate plans to swiftly develop the Mahaweli A and B zones, previously overlooked by the Mahaweli project, as part of the nationтАЩs transition towards a modern agricultural economy.

Further, he emphasized that this initiative would bring significant benefits to the people residing in these areas, the PresidentтАЩs Media Division (PMD) said.

Without the pioneering efforts of the late Mr. Gamini Dissanayake in implementing the Mahaweli project, which revolutionized irrigation practices in the country, Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would not have achieved self-sufficiency in rice production nor would it have met its electricity demands.

The Head of State made this statement while participating in the ceremony commemorating late Minister Gamini DissanayakeтАЩs 82nd birth anniversary on Wednesday afternoon (March 20).

The ceremony took place in front of the Gamini Dissanayake statue at Ananda Kumaraswamy Mawatha in Colombo.
