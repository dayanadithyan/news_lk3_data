However, confusion arises among non-Tamil speakers about how to properly dispose of these items, as instructions are primarily in Tamil and Sinhalese.

UNITED NATIONS, May 29 (Reuters) - The United States will boycott a United Nations tribute on Thursday to Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed earlier this month in a helicopter crash, a U.S. official said.

The 193-member U.N. General Assembly traditionally meets to pay tribute to any world leader who was a sitting head of state at the time of their death. The tribute will feature speeches about Raisi.

"We won't attend this event in any capacity," a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. The U.S. boycott has not previously been reported.

Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York declined to comment.

Raisi, a hardliner who had been seen as a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was killed when his helicopter came down in poor weather in mountains near the Azerbaijan border on May 19.

### Do you use the power to recover the flower of the flower?-The Blessed Chancellor

*2024-05-30 15:24:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184879) ¬∑ `ta`

A controversy erupted when Sri Lanka's TS. I Company featured a Tamil symbol in its product, sparking accusations of cultural appropriation and political bias. Activists argue this reflects the country's chauvinistic politics towards Tamils. The incident, including the use of the symbol at a school event and concerns over potential legal action, highlights deeper issues of ethnic tension and political manipulation. Calls for unity among Tamil nationalists and a focus on electoral strategies are emerging as responses to these incidents.

"It is openly rooted to the politics of the Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãby uniting the flower of the flower," said Sathivale, a social justice activist and a national organization for the release of political prisoners.

Sri Lanka's leading footwear company TS. The I Company has recently posted a flower in one of its products marketed. It shows how much of Sri Lanka's chauvinist political bourgeoisie occupies and is publicly caught by one of the political identities of the Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãto trample the politics of the Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãby trampling and trampling the flower.. This is strongly condemned and the Tamil -conscious patriots must reveal the appropriate lesson.

Australia will boycott Ibrahim Raisi's tribute to the United Nations General Assembly.

According to reports, Australia will also boycott the Iranian president's tribute to the US.

The Guardian said it was sure that no Australian representatives would attend the United Nations General Assembly.

The Australian government has the moral duty to boycott the UN's today's event, which is a tribute to the many Iranians as Tehran's butcher, said the Liberal Party's Glyrey Sandler.

Australia should be supported by the innocent civilians under the Raisi government, so many of the victims are women.

US officials, who have said that Ibrahim Raisi is the worst human rights violations in Iran, have killed thousands of prisoners in 1988, they said they would boycott the tribute event.

This has led to increased fish prices due to reduced supply and warnings of strong winds and sea turbulence by the Department of Meteorology.

### The general candidate should start the choice from the east;To stop him as a symbol of the Tamil people - Jaffna. University Student Union Request

*2024-05-30 11:01:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184838) ¬∑ `ta`

The Jaffna University Student Union urges the Tamil community to select a general candidate from the East as a symbol of unity and to avoid candidates tied to specific political parties. They emphasize the importance of addressing the structural genocide faced by Eelam Tamils and moving beyond the limitations of the 13th Amendment. The union calls for a focus on creating foreign policies and engaging with multinational corporations independently. They also stress the need for a non-politician as a common candidate, capable of working across political lines post-election. The statement highlights the critical role of Tamil votes in challenging Sinhala-Buddhist chauvinism and the necessity of making informed decisions based on the broader interests of the Tamil people.

üü©

The general candidate should not reflect the political interests of certain parties- the Jaffna University Student Union, which has appealed to the Tamil people, should be held from the East to identify the entire occupied Eastern Province to identify the occupied Eastern Province.. If the candidate is a woman, it is said.

While the elections related to the election of the head of the state of Sri Lanka have been initiating, the Eelam Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãwho are in the Structural Genocide within the structural genocide are required to take up the election in their political liberation.

In the 15 years since 2009, the Tamil people and the Tamil nationalist politicians have failed to save an inch of the homeland from the Tamil language and the Tamil people and the Tamil nationalist politicians have failed to make the people of Tamil Nadu, which has only been promoted by the Tamil parties, which are only relying on empty promises in the name of diplomacy and diplomacy.
