### Biden warns Netanyahu US policy depends on Gaza civilian protection

President Joe Biden warned Israel of a sharp shift in his policy over the Gaza war Thursday amid growing frustration with Benjamin Netanyahu and mounting domestic pressure in a US election year.

A tense phone call between the two leaders appeared to yield at least some results, as NetanyahuтАЩs office announced within hours it would temporarily allow more aid to flow into Gaza.

Biden has stood solidly behind Israel and its prime minister since HamasтАЩs October 7 attacks, and his criticism of civilian deaths in Gaza has not stopped Washington from supplying military hardware to its key ally.

But the Democrat faces spiraling anger from Muslim and younger voters over his support for Israel, and political allies have been pressing him to make the aid conditional on changed Israeli behavior.

In a 30-minute call with Netanyahu after Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers from US-based charity World Central Kitchen, Biden hinted at doing just that.

### Can the IMF program be renegotiated by a future government?

President Ranil Wickremesinghe chairs a meeting with the IMF in Colombo тАУ File photo

In my opinion, the IMF program Sri Lanka has got now is lenient when you compare it with many other countries. The 17th IMF program may not be enough even if implemented fully. Therefore, there is very little space to make changes in the broader program targets.

1.Achieve a primary budget surplus of 2.3% by 2025 and beyond

2.Bring annual foreign currency debt service from 9.4% of GDP in 2022 to 4.5% of GDP during 2027-2032. Reduce the governmentтАЩs gross financial needs which was at 35% of GDP in 2022 down to below 13% from 2027-2032.

3.Public debt, which was 128% to GDP, should be reduced to 95% by 2032.

If there were to be any renegotiations of the IMF deal by a future government, it will have to change one or all of the above. Let me go through them one by one.

What then does sustainability mean, and what should it mean in business? What ought we sustain, and does sustenance suffice?

The need to address sustainability in business arose because irresponsibility in commerce and industry have led inter alia to scarcity of clean water, drain of natural resources, ill health of communities, strained employees and landfills of unsold produce тАУ not only when mistakes have occurred, but even when operating as designed and being economically profitable.

Let the entire world suffer and let millions of people die in such a war, which will have a devastating effect on developing countries. Israel will not stop until it conquers the world.

This is not a dark prophecy. Israel is well on the path to achieving its ambitions. With the West, the Arab world, and one-time Non-Aligned Movement stars paying obeisance to Israel, the Zionist state believes it is special and above the law.
