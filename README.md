### Chinese onion becomes cheaper in Sri Lanka than Indian ahead of festivals

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Price of imported Chinese big onion has been reduced sharply than Indian one in Sri Lankan markets with effect from Tuesday, in a move to provide some relief ahead of the festive season in the island nation battered by an unprecedented economic crisis.

Many Sri Lankans have blamed the government for expensive commodity prices in the country amid an unprecedented rise in the poverty level after the 2022 economic crisis.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe government has been in the process of reducing the prices of essential goods ahead of the festival season. Muslims will celebrate Eid and both Sinhalese and Tamils will celebrate their traditional new year this week.

Wickremesinghe government has been also trying to win people ahead of a presidential election between September 18 and October 18 this year.

### National Education Policy

*2024-04-09 02:49:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180772) ¬∑ `ta`

The Jaffna University Teachers Union opposes the National Education Policy Framework (NEPF 2023-2033), arguing it threatens Sri Lanka's long-term free education tradition by prioritizing profit over education quality and welfare. NEPF aims to transform education into a profit-making business, abolishing state education and the University Grants Commission (UGC), and introducing university fees. It also focuses on economics and digital education, ignoring broader educational goals like literacy and critical thinking. The union calls for the withdrawal of these reforms and prioritizes the interests of the people over market forces.

üü©

The Jaffna University Teachers Union alleges that the National Education Policy Framework (NEPF) is a significant threat to the tradition of long -term free education in Sri Lanka.

As a Federation of University Teachers' Association (FUTA), we strongly oppose the proposed National Education Policy Framework (NEPF 2023-2033), which is a significant threat to our country's long-term free education heritage.

The NEPF program transforms the education system into a profit -making business by highlighting the government's responsibility in education, the abolition of state education, and the abolition of the University Grants Commission (UGC).

These reforms prior the profit rather than the quality of education and the welfare of students and educators. By introducing tariffs at the university level and withdrawing state funds for higher education, the NEPF undermines the equal access policy for education centered on Sri Lanka's social structure after independence.

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) politburo appointed SLFP Senior Vice President Nimal Siripala de Silva as its Acting Chairman yesterday replacing the embattled Chairman Maithripala Sirisena who now faces a barrage of legal challenges to secure his post.

This decision followed an interim injunction issued by the Colombo District Court last week, which prohibited SLFP Chairman Maithripala Sirisena from carrying out his duties in the position. This injunction stemmed from a complaint filed by Kumaratunga claiming Sirisena was unsuitable to carry out the role.

### Role of Buddhism in fight against caste oppression in Tamil Nadu

Buddhism flourished in ancient India, including Tamil Nadu from the early years of the Christian era till about the 14th century. At its height, it enjoyed royal patronage and was the religion of the elite which at that time comprised the urban and mercantile classes.

Buddhism ceased to exist in India in the medieval period for a variety of reasons, and saw a revival of sorts only in the closing years of the 19th century.

The discoveries of British archaeologists and anti-colonial and religious revivalist movements in Ceylon and India spurred by Europeans interested in Eastern thought, were factors responsible for increasing interest in Buddhism at the end of the 19th century.

In Ceylon, the Buddhist revival was a part of a nationalistic upsurge, the search for a national identity. But in India, its revival was part of the movement to liberate the traditionally oppressed ‚Äúuntouchable‚Äù castes, now called Dalits.

If you are to grab the spotlight, in a big way, in the scene here, and have the masses on your side, you have got to do songs in the official language, and that‚Äôs Sinhala.

Says Janaka: ‚ÄúYou need Sinhala songs in your repertoire, and originals, as well. Without Sinhala songs, it‚Äôs very difficult to make it big in Sri Lanka.

‚ÄúThe masses, and the electronic media, won‚Äôt accept anything other than Sinhala, so we need to give them what they want.‚Äù

(Reuters) - A Hamas official said on Monday no progress had been made at a new round of talks in Cairo on a ceasefire in the Gaza war after the Egyptian hosts said headway had been achieved on the agenda.

Israel and Hamas sent teams to Egypt on Sunday after the arrival on Saturday of CIA Director William Burns, whose presence underlined rising U.S. pressure for a deal that would free Israeli hostages held in Gaza and get aid to Palestinian civilians. Qatari representatives also attended.

‚ÄúThere is no change in the position of the occupation (Israel) and therefore, there is nothing new in the Cairo talks,‚Äù the Hamas official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. ‚ÄúThere is no progress yet.‚Äù

Western powers have voiced concern over the high Palestinian civilian death toll and the humanitarian crisis arising from Israel‚Äôs military onslaught to destroy Hamas in the densely populated Gaza Strip.

Colombo, April 8 (Daily Mirror) - The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leaders will not be able to hold on to their positions for long if the membership lose their faith in them, MP Sarath Fonseka said today.

"Party leaders should think of their party membership and not their personal success," Fonseka told the media.

"A few in the SJB want to push me out, but I am not scared of them. I am a man who has confronted political giants like Mahinda Rajapaksa," he said.

He also said former President Maithripala Sirisena should not be taken seriously.

"Former President Sirisena is not focusing on issues faced by the people but playing practical jokes," he added.

Parliamentarian Sivagnanam Sreedharan held a media briefing on Sunday.

Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda's actions were not yesterday, but when he was a Member of Parliament, he was openly aware that he had the anti -Tamil activities of the Tamils..

If he has identified himself as a Member of Parliament who represents the aspirations of a legitimate honorable Tamils, he should not plunder the resources of the Tamil people and maintain the resources of the Tamil people.

But it is not a matter of fact that it is not a matter of identification as a minister who takes the land of the Tamils, selling sand and selling stone.

New Zealand tightens employment visa laws, requiring low-skilled workers to meet English language standards and limiting their stay to three years, previously five. This change aims to rebuild the economy and ensure employers meet skill and experience requirements.

üü©

New Zealand has taken steps to raise employment visa laws in response to a "unsustainable" immigration increase.

Low skilled applicants should now meet the English language requirements and are only three years allowed to stay in the country. Previously, such people were allowed to stay in New Zealand for five years.

"It is important to maintain the country's immigration methodology," says Immigration Minister Erika Stanford, to maintain the economy to rebuild the economy.

Under the laws, many employers should meet the requirements of skills and work experience.

New Zealand authorities say they are the responsibility of the employers before the migrants are served.

The authorities have planned to add 11 more careers for the identified occupations identified as the citizenship of the country.
