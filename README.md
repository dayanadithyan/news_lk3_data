Former President Donald Trump easily won New Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday, seizing command of the race for the Republican nomination and making a November rematch against President Joe Biden feel all the more inevitable.

The result was a setback for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who finished second despite investing significant time and financial resources in a state famous for its independent streak. She’s the last major challenger after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his presidential bid over the weekend, allowing her to campaign as the sole alternative to Trump.

Trump’s allies ramped up pressure on Haley to leave the race before the polls had closed, but Haley vowed after the results were announced to continue her campaign. Speaking to supporters, she intensified her criticism of the former president, questioning his mental acuity and pitching herself as a unifying candidate who would usher in generational change.

### Sri Lanka central bank equity positive by end 2023, no need for govt capital yet: Governor

*2024-01-24 11:05:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-equity-positive-by-end-2023-no-need-for-govt-capital-yet-governor-148503/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank had positive equity in its balance sheet by end December and the central bank does not need a government capital injection, after losses made in debt restructuring, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

The International Monetary Fund has asked the central bank to be recapitalized if its capital is negative by 2025, he said.

“If you look at end December balance sheet, we still maintain positive equity,” Governor Weerasinghe said.

“So I think there is no need for us to seek recapitalization at this point.”

Due to converting Treasury bills to bonds, the lower yielding bonds led to a large capital loss at current yields immediately.

The central bank, while losing money on central bank dollar swaps and dollar borrowings, makes cashflow profits on its Treasuries portfolio coupons, though at a lower rate than before restructuring. Foreign assets also bring profits.

### Prevailing prices of commodities cannot be reduced further - Sagala

Sagala Ratnayaka, the President’s Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of the Presidential Staff, states that there is no possibility of further reducing the prevailing prices of commodities.

Ratnayake expressed that since the rupee is appreciating very slowly, what needs to be done now is to take steps to increase the income of the people.

“The price of goods has been brought to the lowest possible point. The prices of some goods like vegetables, fluctuate frequently. However, in terms of foreign exchange, the prices of goods have reached the lowest point”, he said.

“Further appreciation of the rupee is happening very slowly. All we have to do now is to increase the income of the people. Otherwise, we have to make the income of people match the tripled prices of goods.”

Meanwhile, he also said that although the salaries of government employees are increased by Rs. 10,000 from this year, that amount is nowhere near enough to cover the expenses considering the price hikes.

### Health Ministry denies Onco Surgeon’s retirement request

Colombo, Jan 24 (Daily Mirror) -  Notwithstanding official reports indicating that Onco Surgeon Dr. Crysantha Perera, accused of allegedly assaulting a female hospital staffer, has sought early retirement, the Health Ministry is reported to have rejected his request, Daily Mirror learns.

The surgeon, in accordance with the recently issued circular, is eligible to continue serving until the age of 63. However, the 61-year-old surgeon had formally submitted his retirement request two years prior to reaching the retirement age.

Against this backdrop, informed sources suggest that the Health Ministry's refusal is based on the pressing service requirements at the Karapitiya Hospital, where Dr. Crysantha plays a pivotal role as the chief Onco surgeon.

Highlighting Dr. Crysantha's significant contributions to the hospital, sources emphasise that his departure would create a void that cannot be easily filled at this juncture due to the absence of any immediate replacements.

*2024-01-24 05:28:05* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Four-lessons-for-bridging-the-urban-rural-e-commerce-divide-in-Sri-Lanka/4-757705) · `en`

Some rural sellers continued to encounter delivery issues due to gaps in the availability of fast and reliable logistics services in remote areas

Across the globe, e-commerce has emerged as a powerful engine of economic growth, job creation, innovation and trade integration. Research by the World Bank suggests that ‘e-commerce can flourish in developing countries and in rural areas and be a powerful instrument to create employment for semi-skilled workers, women and other groups.’ Correspondingly, the usage of e-commerce in Sri Lanka also appears to be gaining traction, with a recent report published in 20231 revealing that e-commerce is already an ‘island wide phenomenon’ in Sri Lanka, with over 50% of the survey respondents in all provinces affirming their use of e-commerce to purchase goods and services.

### Curbing spam, scam and fraud in Sri Lanka

*2024-01-24 05:23:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Curbing-spam-scam-and-fraud-in-Sri-Lanka/4-757704) · `en`

The Sri Lankan Government is said to have approved the creation of an international A2P SMS centre to curtail fraud and spam. A private company, Infobip, has submitted a proposal to the Cabinet in this regard. The President has proposed appointing a committee with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Technology and the TRCSL to evaluate this proposal.

The need for such a centre to be set up at this time, approved at Cabinet-level, and run by an international private messaging aggregator raises multiple questions.

Spam, scam, and fraudulent communications are a valid cause for concern.

However, we have no publicly available information on how significant the issue of scams and frauds are in Sri Lanka. It would be good to start off with knowing how bad is the spam, scam, fraud situation in Sri Lanka? Do we have numbers and statistics, gathered by the Government or independent researchers, to go by?
