### ICJ to rule on jurisdiction in Russia-Ukraine genocide case

*2024-01-29 19:20:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96830/icj-to-rule-on-jurisdiction-in-russia-ukraine-genocide-case) · `en`

The United Nations’ highest court will rule on Friday whether it will hear a case in which Ukraine has accused Russia of violating international law by saying its invasion was launched to stop an alleged genocide.

Ukraine brought the case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, days after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

In hearings in September, lawyers for Moscow urged judges to throw out the case, saying Kyiv’s legal arguments were flawed. The ICJ on Monday said a ruling on Russia’s objections to the court’s jurisdiction will be handed down on Friday.

Kyiv says Russia is breaching the 1948 Genocide Convention by saying the invasion was justified to stop an alleged genocide of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine says there was no risk of genocide in eastern Ukraine, where it had been fighting Russian-backed forces since 2014.

### Sri Lanka exports down 9.54-pct in 2023, rupee appreciates

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s merchandise exports fell 9.54 percent to 11,856 million US dollars in 2023, with December exports falling 11.5 percent, data from the state Export Development Board showed in a year that the rupee appreciated amid better monetary policy.

The rupee appreciated from 363 to the US dollar in December 2022 to 323 by December 2023.

In December, when exports fell 11.25 percent from a year earlier to 947.5 million US dollars, the rupee appreciated from 329 to 323 to the US dollar.

That exchange rate depreciation (the price of a US dollar measured in locally made paper) is determined by exports,  imports or the trade deficit and is not a monetary phenomenon linked to the producer of the bad money  – the central bank – is an idea dating back to classical mercantilism of the 17th century.
