*2024-03-04 14:41:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177874) ¬∑ `ta`

A study by Peradeniya University reveals that 49% of phones in Sri Lanka's state agencies are non-functional, impacting service delivery. The police are identified as the most corrupt sector. Despite efforts to contact state institutions via phone, many are unresponsive or inaccessible. This situation reflects broader issues with government efficiency and corruption, with officials often prioritizing personal gain over public service.

### Can workers get the salary of the lease agreement?

*2024-03-04 14:37:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177873) ¬∑ `ta`

Workers' salaries in lease agreements are a complex issue. The Ceylon Workers Congress and unions argue for higher wages, but companies warn of stopping welfare services if basic salaries increase. The 1995 lease agreement between the government and plantation companies led to a joint contract for workers' welfare, but it's unclear if this affects the lease agreement's terms. The 2003 Labor Welfare Joint Agreement, made every three years, includes provisions for fair additional allowances and specific conditions for workers. Despite these agreements, plantation workers' welfare has declined over the years, leading to calls for negotiations and reforms. The government has decided to extend the lease agreement, but unions argue that companies have not complied with agreed salaries.

üü©

Talks about the agony of plantation workers may have begun a goal. When the General Secretary and Minister of the Ceylon Workers Congress, Jeevan Thondaman, during a media briefing held last week, responded to this, the companies say that if the basic salary was paid Rs 1,700, other welfare services would be stopped.. If that happens, he said he would have to lease with companies in this regard.

The unions must understand that the workers' pain and the leasing agreement with the government with the government. At the same time, the unions have forgotten that there is a joint venture on the welfare of the workers.

The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Myanmar Janaka Priyantha Bandara says that unverified reports have been received claiming that a group of eight Sri Lankans who were held hostage at a Cyber Slave Camp in Myanmar have been rescued.

In December, reports were rife about a group of Sri Lankans who were lured with tourist visas behind the false front of lucrative job offers in the IT sector and were trafficked to Myanmar through its border with Thailand. These workers had reportedly travelled to Myanmar without registering with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE).

The Sri Lankans forcibly detained at the terrorist camp in Myawaddy ‚Äì an area infested with cybercrimes under the grip of an armed group ‚Äì were reported to be working as cyber slaves forced to commit internet scams.

### Globally, a rightward political shift is visible

*2024-03-04 13:24:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/globally-a-rightward-political-shift-is-visible/) ¬∑ `en`

The global political scene was very left-inclined from about the mid-1960s to say 10 or 15 years ago. The sweeping trend to social democracy in post-war Europe, a surge to the left throughout Asia (Chinese Revolution, defeat of US Imperialism in Vietnam, post-war USSR, our own JVP) and a little later in Africa (Patrice Lumumba, revolution in Mozambique, Nelson Mandela etc), signposted what may be loosely called a period of global shift to the left. That ended about 10 years ago. The last spurt was perhaps Obama‚Äôs re-election. The reverse trend became prominent in the US with Trump and internationally a dynamic that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.

üü©

Most of the coconut milk is made of coconut milk, and the rise in the price of coconuts will have a severe impact on the future of the food pack and curry, the food sector unions said.

Rukshan Harshana, president of the All Ceylon Resources Owners Association, told the media yesterday that the usual price of coconuts from 60 to 80 has doubled.A coconut is currently sold for Rs.120 to 150.

He said that snacks and restaurant owners are in great difficulty without being able to prepare rice and curry packets under the increased coconut prices and are in the uncertainty to sell food packages at higher prices.

Coconuts have an unexpected rise in rice, including rice, chicken, eggs and gas.

Harshana has warned that the price of coconut oil will rise in the coming days due to the sudden increase in coconuts.

Colombo, March 04 (Daily Mirror) -¬† The skyrocketing prices of coconuts will have a serious effect on the packed rice and curry meals in the future, as most of the curries are prepared with the coconut cream, food industry trade unions said.

All Island Canteen Owners Association President Rukshan Harshana told the media yesterday the usual price of a coconut, which was at Rs.60 to 80, has increased to almost double. A coconut is currently sold between Rs.120 to 150.

He said the canteen and eatery owners are faced with a serious situation to prepare the rice and curry meal packets under the increased coconut prices, thus in uncertainty of having to sell meal packs for a very high rate.

The unexpected price hike of coconuts comes at a moment when everything else including rice, chicken, eggs and gas has significantly gone up.

Harshana warned that the prices of coconut oil will also go up in the coming days owing to the sudden hike of coconuts.

Records Rs. 75 .5 bn profit for group, Rs. 61.2 bn for Board

Even without favourable weather conditions, CEB would have made profits amounting to Rs. 40 bn

The financial performance of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is largely positive as it ended the financial year 2023 with a massive profit.

Unaudited interim financial statements filed to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) showed Rs. 75.7 billion profits for the Group, and Rs. 61.2 billion for the Board.

The improvement in the financial performance is largely due to the increase in rainfall from September, and the hike in electricity tariff that came in the fourth quarter (4Q23). However, as per the statements, even without the heavy rainfalls which reduced its reliance on oil and coal-based generation, CEB would have still made profits of about Rs. 40 billion.
