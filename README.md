ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port said it has seen a steep increase in oil and gas vessels in 2023 helped by Sinopec’s bunker operations, and is expecting to double throughput in 2024.

More than 300 oil and gas vessels had called at the port up, 132 percent from the crisis year in 2022.

A key reason for this is the port’s bunkering partner Sinopec actively operating in the market, bringing significant value addition to the HIP’s commercial operations.

The overall oil and gas throughput handled by the port in 2023 was 918,000 metric tonnes with 700,000 MT of bunker and 218,000 MT LPG cargoes.

“We are looking at the energy sector as a growth market for HIP and are actively promoting it,” Chief Operating Officer of Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) Tissa Wickremasinghe, said in a statement.

### Malaysia welcomes new king in unique rotating monarchy

*2024-01-31 10:19:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96873/malaysia-welcomes-new-king-in-unique-rotating-monarchy) · `en`

Sultan Ibrahim, the wealthy and outspoken ruler of Malaysia’s southern Johor state, was sworn in as the country’s new king in a ceremony on Wednesday.

Malaysia practices a unique rotational form of monarchy, in which the heads of the country’s nine royal families take turns to be king for a five-year reign.

The monarchy plays a largely ceremonial role, but has become more influential in recent years due to prolonged political instability during which the king has wielded rarely used discretionary powers.

Nine of Malaysia’s 13 states are headed by a traditional ethnic Malay ruler, mostly known as the sultan, in one of the world’s largest monarchy systems.

The constitutional monarchy was established after Malaysia’s independence from Britain. Every five years, the nine rulers elect one among themselves to be Malaysia’s king through a secret ballot.

The order of rotation among the sultans was originally determined by seniority, based on how long they had been ruling.
