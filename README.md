Water shortages in Cuba are increasingly flaring tempers, including in capital Havana, as problems mount for hundreds of thousands of residents already ragged from shortfalls in food, fuel and electricity.

Upwards of 600,000 people - more than 1 in 20 on the Caribbean island of 10 million citizens - are suffering from water supply issues, officials said earlier this month.

Havana is the worst affected by water shortages, though most of the country’s largest cities report over 30,000 customers without water, the government has said.

Officials blame the growing problems on crumbling infrastructure and a persistent lack of fuel, symptoms of a festering economic crisis that has blighted growth and left the Communist-run country nearly bankrupt.

Rachel Trimiño, 32, said the root causes are no mystery, even in her Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a comparatively upscale district of the capital.

The departing head of the ICC Anti Corruption Unit (ACU), Alex Marshall, believes that elite cricket is largely free from corruption, but he cautions that those seeking to manipulate the sport are targeting entry through local T20 leagues that are not under the jurisdiction of the global governing body and are instead managed by the respective boards of member nations.

Marshall, a former British police officer, did not specify which local leagues or member nations he was alluding to.

“I am confident that the cricket you watch is safe and clean,” Marshall told ESPN Cricinfo as per PTI.

“But I am also absolutely sure that corruptors are constantly looking for a route into the game, particularly in badly-run lower-level franchise leagues. The threat to the game is corruptors won’t go away while there is always money to be made and they will look for weakness in the system to get in.” he added.

Here's a summary of the text in approximately 200 characters:



Eelam Tamil lands face challenges. Southern presidential candidates emphasize Sinhala-Buddhist nationalism. Existing democratic system favors majority rule. Candidates reject Tamil rights and Joint Political Accord. Military presence increases in Tamil areas. Eelam Tamils' existence threatened. Hope lies in Tamil people's choices strengthening political unity.

🟩

On behalf of the Priests of the North and Eastern Provinces, Arutpani Christopher Jayakumar has said that the candidates who contest the presidential election from the South are decorating the campaign platforms to insist on the management of the Sinhala and Buddhist nationalism.

They issued a media statement yesterday (13). In the statement further,

The country is preparing for a presidential election again.

There is no need to underline how confident this is. The fact that this presidential election is being conducted from the frame within the monopoly political system cannot be told.

The fact that the existing democratic system is determined by numbers is subject to common sense.

The president's democratic election, centered on the number of votes, is defined as the influence of the votes of the Eelam Tamil people and other minority ethnic groups.
