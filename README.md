### Two men, one culture, same result

Today while an impoverished nation stands marooned on a shore of despair, the duo remains unrepentant and unperturbed

Dissimilarities in dress and manner aside, they share more commonalities than usually recognised. Methods could vary, the goal is the same, power by any means. Power is not something new to them, for nearly 25 years now, they have headed alternate governments, if not directly, by proxy. They want more, a craving that cannot apparently be gratified. Going on their record, neither deserves power. Economically as well as socially, the country is on its knees today, hopeless, its institutions in shambles; surely in these 25 years, something could have been done to avoid this plight or in the very least, forewarned the country of the impending disaster
