Imitiaz, the humble and down-to-earth former Minister of Mass Media in the UNP government of 2001-2004, possesses many leadership traits. Threfore, our focus is now directed towards tackling the inquiry presented in the title of this article

ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்க ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலை முதலில் நடத்த விரும்பும் வேளையில் ராஜபக்சக்கள் பொதுத்தேர்தலை முதலில் நடாத்த விரும்புவதாக தேசிய மக்கள் சக்தியின் தலைவர் அனுரகுமார திஸாநாயக்க நேற்று தெரிவித்தார்.

அடிமட்டத்தில் தனக்கு வலுவான ஆதரவு இல்லாததால், பொதுத் தேர்தலை விட முதலில் நடத்தப்படும் ஜனாதிபதித் தேர்தலையே ஜனாதிபதி விரும்புகிறார்.

ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலில் போட்டியிடுவதற்கு வலுவான வேட்பாளர் இல்லாததால், ஜனாதிபதித் தேர்தலுக்கு செல்வது தங்களுக்கு பாதகமானது என்று கருதுவதால், ராஜபக்சக்கள் முதலில் பொதுத் தேர்தலை விரும்புகிறார்கள் என்று கொழும்பு மாவட்ட மகளிர் பேரவையில் உரையாற்றிய அவர் கூறினார்.

ராஜபக்சவை மீண்டும் தலைவராக கொண்டு வர முடியாது என ஸ்ரீலங்கா பொதுஜன பெரமுனவுக்கு தெரியும். பசில் அண்மையில் நாட்டிற்கு வந்தார். ஆனால், ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலில் போட்டியிட அவருக்கு வாய்ப்பு இல்லை. எனவே பொதுத் தேர்தல் தங்களுக்கு சாதகமாக இருப்பதாக அவர்கள் நினைக்கின்றனர்.

### Foreign reserves expand reaching US$ 4.5bn in February

Official reserves in February reach US$ 4,517 mn, up from US$ 4,496 mn in January

In February, official foreign currency reserves inched up as the Central Bank maintained its efforts to shore up reserves by accumulating foreign currency from banks. This accumulation comes at a time when demand for foreign currency remains subdued compared to the ample supply from remittances, tourism, and robust exports.

Latest figures reveal that by the end of February, the Central Bank held US$ 4,517 million in official reserve assets, a modest increase from US$ 4,496 million reported in January.

With the absence of large-scale demand for foreign currency from the importers, and also the absence of substantial foreign currency, debt repayments have provided more wiggle room for the Central Bank to collect dollars from the market and rebuild its reserve buffer.

### UNHRC Robust on Lanka, Hypocrisy in Gaza - EDITORIAL

Earlier this month, the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) once again took up the issue of its resolution on “Promoting Reconciliation, Accountability and Human Rights in Sri Lanka”. We also heard for the umpteenth time representatives of western nations pontificate on how wars should be conducted with minimum loss to civilians, women and children.

Believe it or not, it is we Lankans who have undergone civil conflicts on three or more occasions. It was after all our men and women (brothers, sisters, husbands, wives and children) who paid the price in blood, sweat and tears. It was we who suffered the pain of inquisition. We have seen it all and still feel the pain.

War means killing and being killed. The rules of war – the protection of women, children and non combatants – are often ignored during armed conflicts. However, the cold-blooded killing of civilians is not only a war crime, but a crime against humanity and cannot be tolerated.

(Reuters) - Palestinians prepared for Ramadan in sombre mood with heightened security measures by Israeli police and the spectre of war and hunger in Gaza overshadowing the normally festive Muslim holy month as talks to secure a ceasefire stalled.

Thousands of police have been deployed around the narrow streets of the Old City in Jerusalem, where tens of thousands of worshippers are expected every day at the Al Aqsa mosque compound, one of the holiest sites in Islam.

The area, considered the most sacred place by Jews who know it as Temple Mount, has been a longstanding flashpoint for trouble and was one of the starting points of the last war in 2021 between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls Gaza.

That 10-day conflict has been dwarfed by the current war, which is now in its sixth month. It began on Oct. 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, by Israeli tallies.

Ukrainian and allied officials criticized Pope Francis for saying that Kyiv should have the “courage” to negotiate an end to the war with Russia, a statement many interpreted as a call for Ukraine to surrender.

The foreign minister of Poland, a vocal ally of Kyiv, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the Vatican, both used World War II analogies to condemn the pope’s remarks.

And a leader of one of Ukraine’s Christian churches on Sunday said that only the country’s determined resistance to Moscow’s full-scale invasion, launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 24, 2022, had prevented a mass slaughter of civilians.

In an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI and partially released on Saturday, Francis used the phrase “the courage of the white flag” as he argued that Ukraine, facing a possible defeat, should be open to peace talks brokered by international powers.

Kuliyapitiya, March 10 (Daily Mirror) - Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa is ignoring members of his own party and is listening to outsiders. This is why he decided not to participate in the debt restructuring process, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.

President Wickremesinghe told a UNP rally in Kuliyapitiya that Sajith Premadasa had actually started ignoring and sidelining his own party members like Dr. Harsha de Silva.

“Dr. De Silva requested me to involve the Opposition in the debt restructuring process. Accordingly, I invited the SJB to join us in meeting the IMF and the debtors. However, Premadasa informed me that his party is not willing to participate in those meetings. It was MP G.L. Peiris who has encouraged Premadasa to ignore my request. Premadasa has actually begun to ignore his own party members. The SJB is controlled by outsiders. Therefore, I invite those who opposed me in the past to join us,” the President said.

### Suspension of parate execution won’t do; establish Bad Bank to resolve issue permanently: Dr. Anil Baddevithana

There is a sustainable solution in setting up a licenced specialised national bank which I call a ‘Bad Bank’ by the Government as a public-private partnership or PPP. Its task should be to buy and restructure bad debts from the lending banks and support the MSME sector with advisory services and continuous business supervision for recovery and development. The private sector shareholders will be the licenced commercial and specialised banks. It can get funding as well as technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank’s private sector lending arm called the International Finance Corporation. Even the US Government’s international development agency known as the USAID can be invited to help.  It should be aptly named to signify its mission as a ‘National Recovery and Renewal Bank’ or NRRB
