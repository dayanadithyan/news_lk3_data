Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander and other senior figures in the Lebanese movement in an airstrike on Beirut on Friday, vowing to press on with a new military campaign until it is able to secure the area around the Lebanese border.

The Israeli military and a security source in Lebanon said Ibrahim Aqil had been killed with other senior members of an elite Hezbollah unit in the airstrike, sharply escalating the year-long conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed group.

Hezbollah confirmed Aqil’s death in a statement just after midnight that called him “one of its top leaders,” without providing details of how he died.

In a later statement summarising Aqil’s biography, Hezbollah said he was killed in Beirut’s southern suburbs of Dahiyeh in what it called a “treacherous Israeli assassination”.

It is alarming that many middle-class Sri Lankans, the majority group, continue to rely on family-driven, self-proclaimed, high-class politicians to lead the country, from the presidency to the parliament.

This has led to a decline in the country’s wealth and foreign reserves, and an increase in unemployment, poverty, and malnutrition. Sri Lanka has been ensnared in this destructive cycle for far too long, and the need for a change in the political system is more urgent than ever.

The stock market yesterday revived further with a high performance in banking sector counters following the announcement that bondholders have made more concessions during the latest round of negotiations in the debt restructuring process.

Consequently, the present value benefit may increase from 27 percent in a July deal to 33 percent in a September deal, if the economy performs better than expected.

Sri Lanka’s bondholders sought so-called macro-linked bonds where the hair cut will reduce if the economy grows faster than the IMF expects in a debt sustainability analysis.

Amid those developments both indices moved up. The All Share Price Index went up by 89.7 points while S and P SL20 rose by 41.7 points.

Turnover stood at Rs 1.3 billion with a crossing. The crossing was reported in HNB, which crossed 1.14 million shares to the tune of Rs 189 million; its shares traded at Rs 109.
