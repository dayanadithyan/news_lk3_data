April 16 - Experienced Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has revealed he asked to sit out a recent Indian Premier League (IPL) match to give himself a 'mental and physical break' ahead of June's ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

Maxwell watched on from the sidelines as his Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) fell to a 25-run loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday, with the Australia star admitting after the match that he had asked team management to omit him from the side.

The 35-year-old has made an indifferent start to the ongoing IPL season with just 32 runs from six innings and the dip in form has seen the highly-rated RCB outfit manage just one win from seven matches and sees them languish at the bottom of the IPL table.

With Maxwell set to play a major role in Australia's tilt for T20 World Cup success in the USA and Caribbean in June, the veteran said he requested to team management that he be dropped from the side so he could reset ahead of the 20-over showcase.

A group of ruling party and opposition MPs have urged the Speaker and state officials to issue low -cost vehicle permits if they are unable to provide previously issued permits before the upcoming presidential election.

Many parliamentarians from both political wing have explained to parliamentary leaders who have been challenging the lack of vehicles to carry out political activities during the upcoming elections.. Many newly elected MPs have insisted that there are no vehicles.

In the past, every Member of Parliament has been granted unresolved vehicle permits and they have been allowed to buy a vehicle worth about 20 million rupees.

However, due to the economic conditions of the country, these licenses were discontinued nearly nine years ago, last in 2015. It is noteworthy that the government has not taken a decision in this regard, although MPs have continued to demand a tax license.
