At least 60 people were believed missing in Nepal after two buses were swept by a landslide off a highway and into a swollen river early Friday.

Three passengers were rescued as the continuous rain made rescue efforts difficult.

The three survivors were being treated in the hospital, government administrator Khima Nanada Bhusal said, adding that they reportedly jumped out of the bus and swam to the banks, where locals found them and took them to a nearby hospital.

Landslides also blocked routes to the area in several places, according to Bhusal. Additional rescuers and security forces have been sent to help with rescue efforts.

### Exploitation Of Desperate Hajj Pilgrims By Some Deceitful Hajj Agents

Hajj is a pilgrimage (spiritual duty) made to the Kaaba (the house of Allah) in the sacred city of Makkah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the first ten days of the holy month of Dhul Hijjah, the 12th month in the Islamic calendar. It is one of the pillars of Islam, along with believing (1) there is no god but Allah, (2) prayer, (3) almsgiving, and (4) fasting during the month of Ramadan. Hajj is not obligatory for every Muslim. It’s obligatory, at least once in a lifetime, for a Muslim if he is physically, emotionally, and financially able to perform. For anyone preparing to perform Hajj, it’s an incredibly exciting time because they believe that the first ten days of the month of Dhul Hijjah offer true Muslims the opportunity to gain immense rewards, have their sins forgiven, and reach great levels of piety. In other words, it offers the Muslims an opportunity to refresh their spiritual selves, cleanse them of their sins, and draw closer to Allah.

It said these actions were initiated due to perceived grievances and unmet demands from the Customs Officers’ Union on various issues.

NCE President Jayantha Karunaratne highlighted the significant disruptions caused by these actions. He emphasised that the work-to-rule approach has resulted in substantial delays in clearing imported goods at ports and checkpoints, causing disruptions in production schedules and logistical operations. These delays have particularly impacted exporters, who face stringent deadlines to fulfil international orders, leading to strained relationships with overseas buyers and potential financial penalties for missed deliveries.

Elections were not held in a timely manner. The election was postponed by the referendum in 1981. In this case, the election cannot be held.

The President's term of office was reduced to 5 years in the 19th Amendment of the Constitution. However in 83 (b) string is not mentioned in it. The idea has been brought to the cabinet to replace it. There is no need to doubt the presidential election. The election will be held before October 17.

### Is excessive board interference killing executive spirit?

Management’s role is to manage, and the board’s role is to oversee without killing the innovative spirit of management

Whilst in law, and on paper, a board is superior in rank to management, it is important that a board must never make the management feel inferior. Directors and executives must cohabit on a platform of collaboration, trust, and respect. The board-management relationship must be positioned as a value creating partnership where the board is humble in displaying some subservience to management’s technical, functional, and integrating expertise in running the company and the management appreciates the board’s advisory, guidance, governance, and oversight roles in increasing stakeholder value. A shared vision is vital and will result in management accepting the board’s untethered authority over selected aspects of the company

In addition to pressures of acquiring customers, there are also the stringent compliance regulations from these blocs

The EU and the US disburse significant amounts of money under the banner of doing good, and often mandate local partners with no subject matter expertise to drive programs on mental and sexual health, child welfare, nutrition and employee rights that do more damage than good to the future of our nation. When these are married to local individuals and organisations that give scant regard to the nation, its people and future; the outcomes can be perilous

The European Union and the US are amongst preferred export destinations, but winning buyers from these markets do not come easy. In addition to pressures of acquiring customers, there are also the stringent compliance regulations from these blocs. Hypocrisy and geo-political powerplay is rife, but cracks are slowly but surely beginning to show.

### Change, system or the people?

*2024-07-12 01:02:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Change-system-or-the-people/4-764161) · `en`

Whether a nation with this record can find the balance after a summersault of an attempted system change, only history will tell

From 1948, it has been an endless series of missteps, reflecting a national temperament which urges the path of backwardness and poor productivity. The emphasis was not on becoming a stronger or a wealthier nation, but on a hazy idea that all our ills are due to the nastiness of the system, there is this wealth somewhere in the country which should be distributed equally! A system must be created that feeds all the braggarts and the laggards (our Parliamentarians have already done this by voting in all kinds of benefits for themselves!)

A spectre is haunting Sri Lanka – the spectre of the NPP/JVP.

All powers of old Sri Lanka have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: A President without a popular mandate, a Government lacking credibility, political parties with tired faces, and businessmen with dark histories.

### Questions over the term of the President

*2024-07-12 00:57:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Questions-over-the-term-of-the-President/4-764160) · `en`

Unsurprisingly the SC has dismissed the Fundamental Rights petition requesting the Supreme Court to hold that the President has a term of six years, in limine. Reportedly, the SC has found no merit in the petition.

If the term of office of the President had been interpreted to be six years, as the petitioner had sought, it would no doubt have been expressly in violation of the Constitutional provisions, limiting the President’s term to five years, introduced by the 19th Amendment.

What the petitioner had pleaded for was sort of a judicial review of post-enactment legislation by the Supreme Court, a power which the SC is not vested with under the Constitution of Sri Lanka. It could hardly be surmised that the SC could arrogate to itself a power that is not vested in it by invoking any other doctrines of law, including inherent jurisdiction. However, the power of interpretation of the Constitution that lies with the SC is a power that it can use as it may deem fit.
