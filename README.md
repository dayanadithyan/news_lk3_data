“The discussions are at an advanced stage. A formal agreement on the terms can be expected very soon,” the Colombo-based source told The Hindu on Thursday, after a recent discussion among members of the Official Creditor Committee [OCC].

As many as 17 countries that have extended loans to Sri Lanka formed the Committee last year for ease of debt restructuring negotiations. China opted to stay out of the platform, but has been attending its meetings as an observer. Meanwhile, Colombo has repeatedly assured the OCC that it would negotiate repayment of Chinese loans on comparable terms.

*2024-03-22 10:21:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179385) · `ta`

Charles Nirmalanathan, TNA MP, questioned police's permission for Buddhist Poson Day, citing inconsistency with Hindu Shivaratri. Despite court approval for Shivaratri at Adilingeswarar Temple, police denied permission. Nirmalanathan argued against police anarchy, while Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakse defended the decision, stating the issue was resolved within two hours.

🟩

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian Charles Nirmalanathan questioned whether the police could hold the Buddhist Poson Day in the daytime, as the police say to hold the Hindus Shivaratri in the daytime.

He said this while addressing the third day debate on the no -confidence motion against the Speaker held in Parliament on Thursday (21).

The police refused permission even when the court had allowed the Hindus to observe Shivaratri at the Adilingeswarar Temple at the Attukkunnarimalai.

If the rituals are damaged, the police must have seen the damage to them without being damaged if they are damaged.. As well as the Shiva Temple. So the Hindus will not damage their temple.

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakse, who intervened, said that when you brought this issue to Parliament, we settled within two hours.

So why are you talking about again.

Charles Nirmalanathan, who got up again, said that such a police anarchy should not happen again.

"As far as we see, none of the previous Presidents had the ability to manage. With the powers of the country, a President should be the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the country. Being such a person, he or she should have a better knowledge of everything, especially economics. The lack of knowledge causes many issues," he said.

The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council on Friday to back a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an Israel-Hamas hostage deal, increasing pressure on its ally Israel to allow more humanitarian aid and better protect civilians.

Nate Evans, spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations, said on Thursday that the resolution resulted from “many rounds of consultations” with members of the 15-seat Security Council.

The resolution marks a further toughening of Washington’s stance toward Israel. Earlier in the five-month-long war, the U.S. was averse to the word ceasefire and vetoed measures that included calls for an immediate ceasefire.

The draft resolution, seen by Reuters, says an “immediate and sustained ceasefire” lasting roughly six weeks would protect civilians and allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance.

### Absolute independence is the bane for CBSL enhanced salary revision

The enormous independence given to the CBSL in the determination of salaries of its employees has been the bane for this unethical and anomalous situation

The famous dictum made by John Acton, a British jurist (1887) that absolute corruption corrupts absolutely comes to my mind when I read the unilateral decision taken by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in granting an obnoxious salary revision (70%) to its employees across the board, behind the cover of the unfettered autonomy and independent status given to the CBSL by Act No. 16 of 2023. One could argue whether the CBSL’s sense of morality has lessened to such a low ebb with the discretionary powers it has secured with the new Act at a time when the CBSL itself had declared the country as a bankrupt state in terms of economic and financial terms.

### Meeting in Court; COPE; poem read at Oscar Awards 76

*2024-03-22 05:54:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/meeting-in-court-cope-poem-read-at-oscar-awards-76/) · `en`

One of two headlines in The Island of Monday March 18 was “Let’s meet in court, JVP tells Rohitha.” The proposer JVP will be represented by former COPE Chairman Sunil Handunetti and Vijitha Herath and of course Rohitha is Abeygunawardena, always in the news. The challenge is consequent to the newly appointed Chairman/COPE threatening to bring legal action against Vijitha Herath who, Rohitha accuses, made a defamatory statement against him. Handunetti states: “We accept the challenge and dare Abeygunawardena to go before the courts. We will get an opportunity to prove all allegations against him.”

Will Rohitha A institute legal action against these two stalwarts of the JVP? Cassandra places a sure bet: he won’t. Our politicians usually threaten to go to courts but definitely fight shy of doing so. If they are as white as their kapati suits, they need not fear appearing in any court or public forum. But many have skeletons rattling in their cupboards. And they rattle loud and clear.

Sri Lanka is now clearly emerging from an unprecedented economic crisis that imposed significant hardships on its people, especially the most vulnerable. There are now some clear signs of recovery. The IMF has projected that the economy will expand in 2024 and that growth will accelerate. Tight borrowing conditions and reduced disposable income still holds back domestic consumption whilst the reform momentum is hurting the poor in some ways.

The next election if it were to be dominated by economic issues would be a contest between NPP’s system change with a market model cleansed of its rigidities and the IMF path embraced by its opponents – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Election fever is gripping Sri Lanka. It appears that a General Election could precede the Presidential Election mainly because of Ranil Wickremesinghe’s (RW) rising unpopularity largely due to his IMF led economic recovery path.

IMF for its part has no choice but to slow down its program after completing its second review, because election fever demands more time and energy from parliamentarians outside the legislature than inside, and consequently it would not be possible for the Parliament to pass the necessary reforms required for the recovery. Economy therefore is destined to take the back seat and allow politics to dominate national attention for the rest of the year.

Commemorative events were held in Palestinian territories despite the melancholy over the unending destruction with which genocide-committing Israel is visiting the Palestinians day in and day out and the ever-increasing death toll, which now stands at 32,000—nearly half of the children.

### Biggest mysteries in Aviation history

*2024-03-22 01:05:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/biggest-mysteries-in-aviation-history/) · `en`

Humans, for generations, would have been envious of birds as the freedom of the skies was entirely theirs. Born with abilities of terrestrial pursuits, humans soon took to water and mastered the art of transport in water too but attempts at flying like birds were in vain, most ending in disaster! However, myths abound. Daedalus, the engineer and his son, Icarus, are supposed to have flown with wings of wax and feather, according to Greek legend.

Though Daedalus flew successfully from Crete to Naples, overambitious Icarus, who flew too high got close to the Sun and fell to his death in the ocean due to wax wings melting. Persian King Kaj Kaoos is supposed to have flown around his kingdom with eagles attached to his throne and Alexander the Great is supposed to have done the same in a basket powered by four Griffins. If Valmiki’s Ramayana is to be believed, as many Indians do, our King Ravana ought to be considered the pioneer aviator!

Bangladesh finished last in the 2021-2023 World Test Championship, winning just one of their 12 matches.

But in their previous Test series, against New Zealand in November-December, Bangladesh won the first match in Sylhet before losing the second in Dhaka after a close fight.

"We have high expectations," Bangladesh coach Chandika Hathurusingha told reporters in Sylhet ahead of the first Test, part of the 2023–25 World Test Championship cycle.

"If we can win most matches at home, then we give ourselves a good chance to be in contention in the World Test Championship."

"This Test series gives us a good challenge, but we are up for it," he added.

Hathurusingha warned however that he was expecting a tough challenge from his home nation Sri Lanka, calling them a "formidable, very experienced side".

(Reuters) - Leo Varadkar announced on Wednesday he was stepping down as Ireland’s prime minister in a surprise move, saying the country’s coalition government would stand a better chance of reelection under another leader.

Varadkar’s Fine Gael party will open nominations for a new leader on Thursday with the results to be announced on April 5. Parliament would then vote on that person succeeding Varadkar as prime minister after it returns from Easter recess on April 9.

The shock departure of Varadkar, who became the first gay prime minister of the once-staunchly Catholic country in 2017 and returned to the premiership just 15 months ago, does not trigger a general election. A vote must be held by March 2025.

“My reasons for stepping down are both personal and political,” Varadkar, 45, told a hastily arranged news conference at government buildings in Dublin, sounding emotional as he spoke.
