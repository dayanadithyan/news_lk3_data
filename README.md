Candidates contesting the presidential election from the south are decorating the campaign platform by emphasizing the management of the Sinhala Buddhist nationalism.

### Is Ranil Committing Harakiri?

*2024-09-15 05:14:06* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/is-ranil-committing-harakiri/) · `en`

In leadership, knowing when to step down can be as crucial as knowing when to step up. This principle holds true across various fields, be it politics, the military, or sports. Leaders who exit at their peak often leave behind legacies of dignity and respect.

However, many choose to stay, risking the tarnishing of their once-glorified images. Sri Lanka’s political landscape provides ample examples of this phenomenon, with Ranil Wickremesinghe being the latest figure in the spotlight, in the event he doesn’t succeed in his Presidential aspirations.

As Sri Lanka navigates through a complex political and economic environment, the need for a shift in governance has become more apparent. After years of economic challenges, corruption scandals, and political instability, the prospect of a political party coming to power with a commitment to zero corruption and high development potential is both timely and crucial. In the context of Sri Lanka’s current situation, such a transition could have far-reaching effects on the stock market, potentially leading to increased investor confidence, economic recovery, and long-term growth.

We are warned by those who are in the political arena and others outside that this presidential election on September 21 is vitally important; it can further break our wonderful country, now sunk in bankruptcy, or usher in much needed change and hope.

To me the most important consideration is the team the winner of the presidential election will harness to govern the country. It is just one of the 39 contesting who will win but many would have earmarked likely cabinet ministers and other top notchers who will carry out their policies as promised in manifestos – or some at least. The general election to follow will choose winners. So we need to consider those in the vanguard of the three main contestants: Ranil, Anura Kumara and Sajith. It is best if the winning president has the most winning the general election in his party, but it could very well be otherwise.

(Excerpted from NM – in his own words; as seen by others Edited by Prof. Colvin Goonaratna)

Somewhere towards the end of the war in 1918, I left St. Joseph’s School Grandpass, and sought admission to St. Thomas’ College, where my brothers were already boarded. Rev. Stone, who was Warden at the time, suggested that I make my application a year later, after a year at Cathedral Boy’s School, Mutwal, which was a branch of St. Thomas’ at the old premises.

I spent an uneventful year at the school to which I walked from home every morning, a distance of about three miles. My mother gave me 15 cents to spend on my lunch. I generally ate a bun with a cup of plain tea thrown in. Rest of the money I devoted to gram. After school, I trudged back home for a hefty plate of rice.

I need not deal with the events that led to the formulation of the final Draft of the Treaty which we are considering.

Royal College Colombo-7 was formed by the British Government in 1835, primarily for the education of the children of the British administrators.The first principal was Rev. Joseph Marsh, (1835-38) and later Dr Barcroft Boake (1842-1870).

DL Seneviratne, a current vice president of the Royal College Union, took the trouble to visit the place where the then Colombo Academy and Royal College were located. It is a matter of regret that many Royalists did not bother to acquire and read the book edited by DL.

Major HL Reed, MA, was the principal of Royal College Colombo from 1920 to 1932. Major Reed had as his vice principal, LHW Sampson, BA, (1932-38) who succeeded him as principal.

### Maids and Ayahs then and now

*2024-09-15 01:09:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/maids-and-ayahs-then-and-now/) · `en`

As one gets older, far away times somehow do not seem so far away. I can recall a time when maids were called ayahs and were as numerous as those unemployed graduates constantly and publicly demanding government jobs.

Ayahs generally lasted a long time. They came when quite young and often stayed on as family retainers. If they came from family-owned estates, marriages were arranged for them and everyone remained in the ‘big’ house till old age set in. The ayahs dressed comfortably and very prettily in the redda/hette and the word ayah had not become politically incorrect.

It is now. A crisis among my old ayahs (sorry maids) of 15 years had them quarreling mightily with each other (not even with me) and skittering off without so much as a sad backward glance. My home was literally thrown to the wolves. New maids came and went with demands that left me pale with shock.

“About six, including the servants,” (only I didn’t say servants. I said ‘helpers’).

### Capitalizing on the Sun, Sea, and Sand

*2024-09-15 01:03:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/capitalizing-on-the-sun-sea-and-sand/) · `en`

During my seven years at beach resorts along Sri Lanka’s west coast—spanning Beruwala, Aluthgama, Bentota, Ambalangoda, and Matara—I discovered that informal events, like beach parties, can create a refreshingly relaxed atmosphere for both guests and staff. While hotels typically operate in a formal setting, occasional events with a casual ambiance can be incredibly popular and add a welcome variety. This realisation influenced my approach to event planning throughout my career as a hotelier. The process of conceptualizing, planning, organising, choreographing, and promoting events is one of the most exciting and enjoyable aspects of the hospitality business. Crafting the right ambience is essential.

### The Countdown Week & The Debate Week

As Sri Lanka starts the countdown week before its September 21 presidential vote, the US finished the debate week that is expected to set the campaign tones for the remaining eight weeks before its presidential election on November 5. In a riveting performance last Tuesday, the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris exceeded all expectations and with consummate lawyerly skill laid bare the utter limitations and disqualifications of Donald Trump to be America’s president a second time.

The incoherent and blustering Trump undoubtedly made Harris’s debate tasks a whole lot easier, but the pre-debate onus was on her to show that she could perform in an unscripted engagement just as well as she is showing herself to be in organized rallies and in delivering tele-prompted speeches. And she did that superbly.

### The Papal Guidance On Voting: The Less Evil Candidate

*2024-09-14 20:17:57* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-papal-guidance-on-voting-the-less-evil-candidate/) · `en`

Today (14 Sept. 2024, both on the BBC and Al Jazeera) the Holy Father, Pope Francis, urged the faithful to vote for the less evil of the two major US presidential candidates who are “against life.” Kamala Harris is openly for abortion while Trump is waffling – against one day and for the next. The pontiff said not welcoming migrants – seemingly referring to Trump –  is a “grave” sin, and compared Kamala Harris’ stance on abortion to an “assassination”.

I am elated. For in the 2018-2020 elections I was on the Election Commission and could not openly identify with any candidate. As a citizen, however, I felt duty-bound to advise the voters. So I publicly urged voters during the Local Government, Parliamentary and Presidential elections to vote for the least bad of the candidates. Indeed, nearly all of them were bad in some way, while most were murderers and thieves.

Water shortages in Cuba are increasingly flaring tempers, including in capital Havana, as problems mount for hundreds of thousands of residents already ragged from shortfalls in food, fuel and electricity.

Upwards of 600,000 people - more than 1 in 20 on the Caribbean island of 10 million citizens - are suffering from water supply issues, officials said earlier this month.

Havana is the worst affected by water shortages, though most of the country’s largest cities report over 30,000 customers without water, the government has said.

Officials blame the growing problems on crumbling infrastructure and a persistent lack of fuel, symptoms of a festering economic crisis that has blighted growth and left the Communist-run country nearly bankrupt.

Rachel Trimiño, 32, said the root causes are no mystery, even in her Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a comparatively upscale district of the capital.
