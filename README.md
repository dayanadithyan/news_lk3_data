As long as the people keep asking for giveaways as against conditions for life improvement, the takaran era will not end – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

It is because of this increased literacy that people are asking politicians making promises to also state how the money will be found. The politician who some time back promised to zero out VAT, has now retreated to saying that VAT will be removed for educational and healthcare services (leaving aside the fact that most of these services are already exempt from VAT). Even then, he is being challenged to explain how the shortfall is going to be covered

“We all know what to do, but we don’t know how to get re-elected once we have done it” ― Jean-Claude Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg 1995-2013

Handing out roofing sheets used to be a thing in Sri Lankan elections. It was thought that giving tangible things to people would motivate them to vote for the giver. Now we use the term metaphorically, hopefully.

A country interested in creating a creative economy should put all the four essential ground conditions in place if it is to succeed in its attempt. First, knowledge must be created by its universities and research institutions. Then, such knowledge should be made available to prospective entrepreneurs for use in commercially viable productions known as innovation. Once the initial entrepreneurs become successful, that knowledge, both invention and innovation, should be disseminated or diffused across the economy to facilitate others to imitate the original inventors and innovators

### Beyond red tape: How digitalisation can save Sri Lanka’s economy

In the high-stakes world of trade and logistics, corruption at Sri Lanka’s customs, IRD, ports, and airports is not just an inconvenience—it’s a crisis that’s crippling the nation’s export sector. Outdated, manual systems have become breeding grounds for corruption, where bribery and inefficiency rule, bleeding exporters dry and stifling economic growth. The country stands at a critical juncture, where the only viable path forward is the digitalisation of customs and trade operations.

These antiquated, paper-based customs processes are no match for the demands of the modern global economy, where speed, accuracy, and transparency are paramount. Instead, they are plagued by errors, deliberate delays, and a lack of accountability, allowing corrupt practices to thrive unchecked. As global trade standards become stricter, the need for transparent, secure, and efficient customs operations has never been more urgent.

### UN mission is concerned by Afghanistan’s morality law

*2024-08-25 19:07:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101494/un-mission-is-concerned-by-afghanistans-morality-law) · `en`

The UN mission in Afghanistan said on Sunday it was “concerned” about a morality law recently ratified by the Taliban authorities, criticising in particular restrictions on women.

The Taliban authorities on Wednesday announced the codification of a law with 35 articles detailing wide-ranging behaviour and lifestyle restrictions based on their strict interpretation of Islamic law.

The law sets out graduated punishments for non-compliance — from verbal warnings to threats, fines and detentions of varying lengths — imposed by the morality police under the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.

“It is a distressing vision for Afghanistan’s future, where moral inspectors have discretionary powers to threaten and detain anyone based on broad and sometimes vague lists of infractions,” said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama).

### Why Most Current Political Leaders Are Unsuitable For The Presidency

*2024-08-25 18:43:47* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/why-most-current-political-leaders-are-unsuitable-for-the-presidency/) · `en`

Sri Lanka has reached a crossroads where it could save for future generations as a prosperous country or become a permanently underdeveloped nation like some debt-ridden African nations. Voters can and must change direction, but they must be educated based on facts. With the declaration of the elections in September 2024, political leaders are playing games to leap forward deceptively, misleading and disregarding voters.

The current political landscape in Sri Lanka is fraught with issues that render the existing politicians unsuitable for the presidency. How can people trust members of parliament who become politicians purely to make money, sell their duty-free car permits, and abuse power? Honesty, integrity, transparency, and following the election promises are essential. None of the current leaders can pass this est. Here are ten more reasons why the current political leaders (and presidential nominees) are unsuitable for running the country.

### Israel and Hezbollah trade heavy fire before pulling back, jolting a region braced for war

*2024-08-25 17:08:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101491/israel-and-hezbollah-trade-heavy-fire-before-pulling-back-jolting-a-region-braced-for-war) · `en`

Israel launched a wave of airstrikes across southern Lebanon early Sunday in what it said was a preemptive strike on Hezbollah. The militant group responded that it had launched hundreds of rockets and drones to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders last month.

The heavy exchange of fire does not appear to have ignited a long-feared war, but the situation remains tense. Meanwhile, Egypt on Sunday is hosting high-level talks aimed at brokering a cease-fire in the 10-month-old Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, which diplomats hope will tamp down regional tensions.

The Israeli military said it struck because Hezbollah was planning to launch a heavy barrage of rockets and missiles toward Israel. Soon after, Hezbollah announced it had launched an attack on Israeli military positions as an initial response to the killing of Fouad Shukur, one of its founding members, in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last month.

### The IMF & Election Propaganda

*2024-08-25 15:33:54* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-imf-election-propaganda/) · `en`

During the ongoing debates, conversations and media shows, there is a strong focus on the IMF assistance we have obtained in the recent past. Some Political leaders and their spokesmen canvassing support for their candidacies, are repeatedly stating that the IMF agreements we have already concluded will be revisited by them if they come to power and revised according to their wishes.

In such a context it has become necessary for an independent review of these aspirations which unfortunately appear to gain ground and causing mind boggling confusions among the gullible public.

This is not the first occasion of our country getting IMF assistance. According to the known history last IMF assistance was the 17th in line with several other facilities granted before between 1966 and 2016  extending as follows. Four arrangements from 1965-70;  Four arrangements between 1970-80 ; 2 from 1980 to 1990; and –  In six occasions between 1990- to 2016.
