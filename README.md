### Ruthless Australia crush England at T20 World Cup

*2024-06-09 02:31:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Ruthless-Australia-crush-England-at-T20-World-Cup/108-284416) ¬∑ `en`

(Bridgetown) - Australia crushed England by 36 runs in Barbados on Saturday to leave the defending champions' T20 World Cup hopes in the balance.

Defeat means Jos Buttler's men are still winless after their opening game against Scotland was wrecked by rain.

But Australia, who posted 201-7, are top of Group B with two wins after restricting their fierce rivals to 165-6 in their 20 overs.

Australia's openers raced out of the blocks and the team posted the first score of 200-plus at the tournament even though no batsman reached 40.

Phil Salt and Buttler gave England a solid platform in their reply, reaching 54-0 after six overs before going up a gear, taking 19 off Mitchell Starc's third over.

But spinner Adam Zampa bowled Salt (37) with his first ball to leave England 73-1 in the eighth over and took the prized wicket of Buttler in his next over for 42.

### SCHOOL DAYS AT ROYAL COLLEGE (1939-1946)

*2024-06-09 02:24:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/school-days-at-royal-college-1939-1946/) ¬∑ `en`

During World War II (around 1939), the British military took over the buildings of Royal College, including the College Boarding, where I was boarded. The whole of the Race Course was taken over together with the Royal College and University grounds to make an airfield for the British fighter planes. Meanwhile, Royal College was forced to share classrooms with the University. Since we were short of classrooms, some of our classes were actually held under the wings of the ‚ÄòHurricane‚Äô fighter planes and the camouflage nets covering them! After about a year, Royal was able to rent four large houses down Turret Road, where I spent the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Forms. Discipline became lax, with the boys taking the chance ‚Äúto scoot‚Äù (play truant) whenever they changed classes from one building to another.

*2024-06-09 02:01:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/great-betrayals-in-appointing-some-igps/) ¬∑ `en`

Lakdasa (Lucky) Kodituwakku was the Inspector-General at the time the Waymaba Provincial Council elections took place early in 1999. He was blamed for the violence and the malpractices that took place during those elections. The 17th Amendment to the Constitution was the result of a political initiative launched by MPs in the Opposition led by the UNP in 2001 as a response to the Wayamba election incidents.

This was the second betrayal by a Head of State/Government. President¬†Chandrika Kumaratunga decided to appoint Lucky Kodituwakku the 26th IGP ignoring so many seniors over him just because of the special position he enjoyed as the Personal Security officer (PSO) of a VVIP that gave him an advantage over his seniors to canvass for the post. The Wayamba election bungling and the 17th Amendment to the Constitution was the result.

### Myanmar‚Ä¶..unlike any land you know about

*2024-06-09 02:01:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/myanmar-unlike-any-land-you-know-about/) ¬∑ `en`

A desire to visit Burma (Myanmar since 1989) having seen the film ‚ÄòThe Story of Dr. Wossell‚Äô as a school boy was fulfilled recently. The film was about a dedicated British Army Medical Officer who during World War II fell in love with the country and more deeply with a lithesome and compassionate Buddhist Burmese lady and chose to remain with her in her country after demobilization.

Several books, fiction and non-fiction of the country read over the years made the desire greater. However, Burma‚Äôs isolation from the rest of the world since 1962 when the military junta known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) seized power, rumours of political unrest, and later the house arrest of the Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of the National League for Democracy, Aung San Sun Kyi made one think twice about making the journey. However, recently people spoke of trickles of tourists flowing into the country and we, a party of five, including my sister followed suit.

### The non-debate and two questions from Sajith and AKD

*2024-06-09 01:16:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-non-debate-and-two-questions-from-sajith-and-akd/) ¬∑ `en`

SJB and Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa faced two significant setbacks last week, the repercussions of which are expected to unfold in the coming days. The most notable was the backlash on social media following his failure to attend the highly anticipated debate with JVP/NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. After weeks of boasting and challenges, the debate was scheduled for Thursday at the ITN studio. While the JVP leader arrived promptly, Premadasa was conspicuously absent.

This triggered a wave of negative feedback and disappointment, not only among SJB members but also among many who had eagerly awaited the debate for weeks. The ramifications of this absence and the resulting damage will become clear in the days ahead.

### Tissa and Sonia Weeratunga

*2024-06-09 00:25:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/tissa-and-sonia-weeratunga/) ¬∑ `en`

I will be turning 59 in a few days. Strangely or maybe not so strangely as I grow older I think more often of my late parents, how they were when they were my age, what they did and this makes me reflect on what I do now.

My father, Tissa Indraka Weeratunga, the first four-star general of the regular forces of the Sri Lanka Army, was promoted on his 55th birthday, August 29, 1985. He was the first ever Chief of Defence Staff and the ninth Army Commander in independent Sri Lanka. This is not the place to roll out his extensive curriculum vitae. To me, he was the person who understood me most, cheered me on when I excelled in sports, never missing a single rugger match when I played for Royal and CR&FC, and encouraged me to show similar commitment to my studies.

### Thaththa‚Äôs Wireless

*2024-06-09 00:24:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/thaththas-wireless/) ¬∑ `en`

Thaththa(my late father) was an avid radio listener. He called the radio a ‚Äòwireless.‚Äô Early in the morning, he listened to the news and, after dinner, to Sinhala and English songs. He allowed no one to talk aloud while he listened to the radio. Listening to the news and music was a struggle because of poor reception. He said the poor reception was because of the remoteness of Hambantota, where we lived. His friends advised him to buy a ‚Äòsix-valve‚Äô Grundig radio for better reception. They coaxed him, saying he could, of course, as the Principal of St. Mary‚Äôs College, afford to buy a powerful radio. But Thaththa refused to discard his old Philips radio. Its front screen looked like an old rag, and the pilot light on the upper left corner was dead.

David Miller's unbeaten 59 off 51 balls saw the Proteas safely home at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, the South Africans finishing on 106-6 after restricting the Dutch to 103-9 from their 20 overs.

For a moment however it looked as if the Dutch were poised to inflict another famous upset on the South Africans following wins at the 2022 T20 World Cup and 2023 ODI World Cup.

The Proteas were left reeling at 12-4 after 4.3 overs and had even been 3-3 at one stage as the Dutch bowling attack broke through early.

But Tristan Stubbs and Miller hauled South Africa off the ropes with a fifth wicket partnership of 65 to leave the Proteas in a winning position.

In the ongoing T20 World Cup, both South Africa and the Netherlands have strong records, with the Netherlands winning their last two encounters against South Africa. The Netherlands, known for their adaptability across pitches, might hold an edge over South Africa, who are also formidable but facing unfamiliar conditions. The outcome could significantly impact the tournament standings, especially considering the Netherlands' potential to secure the top spot if victorious.

The T20 World Cup for the T team has begun at the New York Nasav Cantry International Cricket Stadium.

South Africa and Netherlands won Sri Lanka in their opening events in the 9th World Cup chapter.

South Africa is said to be a powerful team compared to South Africa and the Netherlands.

However, the Netherlands won the two types of World Cup cricket matches that the two teams finally clashed.

Netherlands won by 13 runs in the T20 World Cup in Australia by 38 runs in the 50 -over World Cup in India in 2023.

If the Netherlands wins this time, the teams for the T. team will take the top spot and Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will face a severe crisis.

This is how South Africa played in its early stadium again as they played again and again understand the nature of the pitch.. But for the first time, the Netherlands are likely to face the pitch on the pitch.

It is not surprising, however, that South Africa faces crying because the Netherlands are able to play efficiently on any pitch.

(Dallas) - Bangladesh emerged victorious from a gripping encounter with Sri Lanka in Texas with the two-wicket victory getting them off to a winning start in Group D of the T20 World Cup.

Rishad Hossain produced a brilliant spell of leg-spin as Bangladesh fought back to restrict Sri Lanka to 124-9.

Then Liton Das (36) and Towhid Hridoy (40 from 20 balls) put Bangladesh in command before some excellent pace bowling from Nuwan Thushara (4-18), in his second spell threatened a late twist in the plot.

But veteran Mahmudullah Riyad showed all his experience at the end to see Bangladesh over the line with an unbeaten 16.

It was the final of four games at the Grand Prairie Stadium and the Dallas crowd have been treated to some top entertainment on a surface which offered some bounce and produced good contests between bat and ball.

Officials say a small plane he was flying crashed into the water north of Seattle, Washington.

Anders' son Greg confirmed that his father was flying the small plane, and that his body was recovered on Friday afternoon.

"The family is devastated. He was a great pilot. He will be missed," a statement from the family reads.

Anders - who was a lunar module pilot on the Apollo 8 mission - took the iconic Earthrise photograph, one of the most memorable and inspirational images of Earth from space.

Taken on Christmas Eve during the 1968 mission, the first crewed space flight to leave Earth and reach the Moon, the picture shows the planet rising above the horizon from the barren lunar surface.

Anders later described it as his most significant contribution to the space programme.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Two-time Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs less-than-expected win at the India‚Äôs parliamentary election may not change its foreign policy towards Sri Lanka, but aggressive push for connectivity and infrastructure projects in the island nation could be slowed, analysts say.

Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost its outright majority in the election and found itself reliant on support from regional parties.

Broader coalition National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 293 seats in the 543-member lower house of parliament, where 272 constitutes a simple majority.

However, Modi‚Äôs BJP won only 240, less than outright majority, making two regional parties‚Äô leaders kingmakers in the alliance with their 28 seats in total.

India has been pushing for land, oil, gas, and power grid connectivity in Sri Lanka along with securing lucrative renewable energy and port projects in partnership with Indian private sector.
