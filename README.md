Sri Lanka is set to hold a Presidential Election in September this year, followed closely by a General Election. However, the country continues to grapple with widespread allegations of malfunction, corruption, fraud, nepotism, and the pervasive influence of party politics across nearly every facet of society.

Over the last 70 years since independence, our governing political parties and coalitions have introduced policies under the guise of Capitalism, Socialism, and Liberalism. They have also advocated local and foreign policies based on Americanisation, Europeanisation, Neutralisation (non-aligned), Globalisation, ‚ÄúChineseisation‚Äù and more recently possible ‚ÄúIndianisation.‚Äù All political parties and their coalitions came to power insisting that there was ‚Äúno other way‚Äù to develop the nation other than through the emulation and absorption of one of these political cultures and their policies for economic, social, and political development.

### To All Presidential Candidates: Harnessing The Ocean: A Strategic Economic Plan For Sri Lanka

As the race for the presidency intensifies, it is disheartening to see some candidates failing to present concrete economic plans. Instead, they resort to empty rhetoric, hoping to win over voters with hollow promises. However, politics is not a game of words; it requires well-thought-out strategies. Among the most critical elements that any serious economic plan must include is the ocean‚Äîan invaluable resource that has long been overlooked.

Sri Lanka is often described as a nation sitting on a treasure chest, surrounded by the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean. This includes a large Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and a significant confidential shelf landmass rich in valuable graphite. Yet, despite the wealth of resources it offers, there has been no comprehensive plan to unlock its true potential. The ocean is not just a body of water; it is a reservoir of economic opportunities that could propel our nation to new heights.

This is because in the first innings, the West Indies lost its last 6 wickets in 16.1 overs by 60 runs.

However, with the help of 92 runs in the second innings, the leader of the two teams decided to end the match when the West Indies lost 5 wickets in 56.2 overs.

The two teams are in the same position as the ICC World Test Championships ended in the face of the World Test Championships.

South Africa continued to rank 26.67 percent with 16 points and the West Indies continued at 9th with 20.83 per cent.
