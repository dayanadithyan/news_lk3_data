செவ்வாய் கிரகத்தில் நிலவும் சூழலை நகல் எடுத்தது போலவே வாழ்விடத்தை உருவாக்கி, அதில் செவ்வாய்க்கு செல்ல விரும்பும் மனிதர்களை தங்க வைத்து நாசா சோதனை மேற்கொண்டு வருகிறது.

இதற்கான ஆராய்ச்சி  ஹூஸ்டனில் உள்ள ஜோன்சன் விண்வெளி மையத்தில் இடம் பெற்று வருகிறது.

அதில், இலங்கையைச் சேர்ந்த கலிபோர்னியாவின் சிலிக்கான் பள்ளத்தாக்கில் உள்ள நாசா அமெஸ் ஆராய்ச்சி மையத்தில் உள்ள கதிர்வீச்சு உயிரியல் இயற்பியல் ஆய்வகத்தில் முதுகலை ஆராய்ச்சி விஞ்ஞானியான பியுமி விஜேசேகரவையும் நாசா தெரிவு செய்துள்ளது.

அதன்படி, ஜேசன் லீ, ஸ்டெபானி நவரோ, ஷரீஃப் அல் ரொமைதி மற்றும் பியுமி விஜேசேகர ஆகியோர் மே 10 ஆம் திகதி ஏஜென்சியின் மனித ஆய்வு ஆராய்ச்சி அனலாக் அல்லது ஹெராவில் நுழைவார்கள் என்று நாசா அறிவித்துள்ளது.

செவ்வாயில் அமைக்கப்படும் பேஸில் இருந்து ‘மார்ஸ் சூட்’ அணிந்து கொண்ட பின்னர் அதிலிருந்து வெளிவந்து, ரோவரில் பயணித்து மாதிரிகளை இவர்கள் சேமிக்க வேண்டும்.  அதன் மூலம் மனிதர்கள் உயிர் வாழக்கூடிய சாத்தியம் குறித்து ஆய்வு செய்யப்படும் என்பது குறிப்பிடத்தக்கது.

Fresh off a stunning 195* that powered her team to the highest successful run-chase in women's ODIs, Sri Lanka captain Chamari Athapaththu has set high expectations for her team at the ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2024.

Sri Lanka have a hurdle before they reach Bangladesh for the mega event – they will play the ICC Women's T20 World Cup Qualifier in UAE beginning April 25, and will need to be one of the finalists to qualify for the main event.

However, that isn't stopping Athpaththu from aiming high. "I want to see my team in the semi-finals of the World Cup," she said after her brilliant knock in a series-levelling win against South Africa.

Athapaththu, who had already led the team to a historic T20I series win in South Africa as Sri Lanka warmed up for the Qualifiers in UAE, has ticked off several personal and team milestones in recent years.

### Sri Lanka rupee quoted wide to US dollar as peg inconsistencies flare up

*2024-04-19 10:40:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-rupee-quoted-wide-to-us-dollar-as-peg-inconsistencies-flare-up-159244/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rupee opened wide at 301.50/302.50 to the US dollar Friday, as was quoted even wider at 301/303 to the dollar in early trade, dealers said, as dollar demand resumed following a 715 million dollar purchase of forex by the central bank in March.

Sri Lanka has a deeply flawed non-floating ad hoc soft-peg arrangement found in all defaulting IMF advised countries, with inconsistent policies where external and domestic anchors conflict, critics have pointed out.

In May 2023, after the central bank collected 666 million dollars amid panic sales by market participants when inconsistent peg was allowed to appreciate to 295 to the US dollar from 321 in April, the rupee came under pressure in the following two months.

As the inconsistencies of the deadly flexible exchange rate clash, the rupee is quoted wide, spot trading disappears, moral suasion comes in and the spot next and one week market becomes active.

### India heads to the polls in world’s biggest election

*2024-04-19 08:21:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/international/India-heads-to-the-polls-in-worlds-biggest-election/107-280956) · `en`

(CNN) - Polls opened Friday for the first and largest phase of India’s marathon general election, kicking off a vote in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to win a rare third consecutive term.

About 969 million people are eligible to vote in the biggest election in human history, with polling taking place in seven phases over the next six weeks in the world’s most populous country.

The nationwide vote is considered among the most consequential in decades as Modi’s powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) aims for an outright majority and a mandate to widen its development and Hindu-nationalist policies established during its 10-year rule.

Those policies have transformed India economically and culturally, and BJP rule has been defined by a pull away from India’s secular foundation, toward Hindu majoritarianism.

Under Modi’s leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world’s fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power.

Colombo, April 19 (Daily Mirror) - A request by some MPs across the political divide for concessionary vehicle permits is likely to be shot down by the party leaders given the dire economic situation of the country, Daily Mirror learns.

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne brought to the notice of the Business Committee last week that a letter is being signed by the MPs for such a request.

He said such a request would tarnish the honorary services of the MPs and therefore such facility should not be granted to them in adherence to due protocols as in the case of other public servants and judicial officers.

However, SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella said at the same meeting that such a request should not be entertained at all due to what they called bankruptcy of the country.

The Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK) known in English as the Federal Party will celebrate its 75th birthday in December this year. The premier political party of the Sri Lankan Tamil people known as “Ilankai Thamizhar” in their mother tongue was born on 18 December 1949. On that day, a group of 60 Tamils including two parliamentarians and two senators convened at the Government Clerical Service Union (GCSU) hall in Colombo.

That historic conclave resulted in the launching of a new political party with the avowed goal of establishing an autonomous State for the Tamil-speaking people of Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was known then) within a united island. The new party was named in Tamil as “Illankai Thamil Arasu Katchi” meaning Ceylon Tamil State or Tamil Government Party.

Book review: “Backstage – The story behind India’s high growth years” by Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia

In the face of a deep balance of payments crisis in the 1980s, a recession was triggered in India in 1991. Prices for necessities were soaring, the unemployment rate was rising, and the public’s despondency deepened while facing shortages of nearly everything. The future looked very bleak for many. While some people got onto the streets out of desperation, another group of smart individuals who were passionate about getting India’s economy back on track, worked relentlessly to find solutions to their economic issues, which had a transformative effect on India to become the regional powerhouse it is today.

### Dialog-Airtel Lanka merger comes centre stage

*2024-04-19 05:29:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/dialog-airtel-lanka-merger-comes-centre-stage/) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s premier mobile phone company, Dialog Axiata, will issue 952 million shares by way of a share swap to Bharti Airtel to acquire the latter organization. The deal was finalized yesterday, CSE market analysts said.

Bharti Airtel and Dialog Axiata entered into a Binding Agreement to merge their operations in May 2023. Dialog is the largest telecom service provider in Sri Lanka with more than 17 million subscribers as of 2021, representing around 51 percent of the market. Airtel Lanka has about 5 million subscribers. The 952 million Dialog shares amount to 10.4 percent of the total shares issued by the company.

However, the stock market was sluggish because profit takings came to the fore due to continued uncertainty in the external debt restructuring exercise. Both indices moved downwards. The All Share Price Index went down by 33.1 points, while the S and P SL20 declined by 8.81 points. Turnover stood at Rs 2.22 billion with 3 crossings.

Port City Colombo officials expressed frustration over delays in opening the downtown duty-free mall in Colombo.

While concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact of the duty-free mall on local businesses and Sri Lanka’s taxation framework, CHEC Port City Colombo Deputy Managing Director Thulchi Aluwihare has asserted that the facility will not have the negative effects perceived by some in the political and business communities.

“The aim is not to cannibalise but to expand the market and promote economic growth. The broader objective of Port City is to increase footfall and benefit the entire Colombo ecosystem,” Aluwihare told Mirror Business.

Claims agreement with bondholders fell through due to Govt.’s refusal to set up anti-corruption framework

Says failure to tackle corruption is delaying IMF second tranche and deal with bondholders

Stresses combating corruption would attract foreign direct investments through increased investor confidence

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar yesterday claimed that the Government’s hesitance to establish an effective anti-corruption framework, as demanded by sovereign bondholders, stems from its own corrupt practices.

Speaking at a press conference in Colombo, the MP said the Government allegedly could not reach an agreement with sovereign bondholders because it refused to comply with their requirement to implement an anti-corruption framework.

He noted that this has caused a delay in the disbursement of the second tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and in reaching an agreement with international sovereign bondholders.

### Suppressing a community by denying education - EDITORIAL

These are days when politicians in the country are getting ready for upcoming elections, hence there are thoughts about whether anyone of them would use schools and education to promote their cause.

Some of the candidates have already started mingling with students and presenting them with opportunities to ask questions on hot topics that are bothering them. One of the probable candidates in the presidential elections is seen offering material goods to students. He dare not present the opportunity for students to ask questions because he would then be putting himself in a very uncomfortable position. There is one other election candidate who offers this opportunity to students and by doing so makes the questioner lose his way in a temporary world of stardom; because the student loses focus of the existing world when he or she gets to question the highest authority in the country. These are all political gimmicks.

A woman walks past a banner depicting launching missiles bearing the emblem of the Islamic Republic of Iran in central Tehran. AFP

Israel’s hardline and war-thirsty Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is more than ever before well close to dragging the United States into a war with Iran. Ever since Iran launched its nuclear programme in the late 1980s, Israel has been jittery. It fears an Iranian nuke will undermine its nuclear monopoly in the region.

Since Netanyahu became Israel’s prime minister for the first time in 1996, his main foreign policy objective has been to get the United States to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities and prevent the Islamic Republic from achieving nuclear power parity vis-à-vis Israel.

Colombo, April 18 (Daily Mirror) - People should not make the 2024 Presidential election a regime changing poll as it has to be one which elects a custodian for the nation, UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardana said today.

"The Presidential election should be one which elects a custodian who is capable of making Sri Lanka a stable country. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe is the only leader who has such a capability. People can use the  general election to bring about a regime change. They can send all 225 MPs home including me at the general election, the MP told a briefing.

Asked whether people will accept  Wickremesinghe as a good custodian, the MP said such an eventuality will be obvious.

"Most of you don't see what is happening behind the scenes. Therefore you  have to wait and see what will happen at the Presidential election," he said.
