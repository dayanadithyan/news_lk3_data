### Fitch confirms ‘A(lka)’ domestic rating of Sampath Bank Plc

*2024-07-24 14:37:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/fitch-confirms-alka-domestic-rating-of-sampath-bank-plc-173579/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings said it was confirming a national long-term A(lka) rating on Sri Lanka’s Sampath Bank Plc with a stable outlook, amid an improvement in operating environment, indicated by headline macroeconomic indicators.

The bank had stage 3 loans of nearly 17 percent at end-1Q24 (2023: 16.6 percent).

Fitch expected this ratio to decrease in the near- to medium-term alongside focused recoveries.

“We expect Sampath’s impaired (stage 3) loans ratio to decline gradually in the medium term, due to its recovery efforts, improvements in repayment capacity of borrowers from the stabilisation in economic conditions, and moderate loan book growth.”

The bank also had defaulted sovereign bonds. “Defaulted foreign-currency sovereign bonds, which accounted for 1.9% of assets, had impairments amounting to 52% of its holdings as of end-1Q24.”

### 41 years ago, the Sinhala Buddhist chauvinist policies responsible for the Black July are the cause of the military occupation of today- Pearl.

*2024-07-24 12:11:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189249) · `ta`

In 1983, the Sinhala Buddhist majority's policies sparked the Black July massacre, leading to ongoing military occupation and economic exclusion of Tamils in Sri Lanka. The event, commemorated by the Pearl Organization alongside global Tamils, highlights the enduring impact of Sinhalaism on Tamil rights and safety. Despite calls for reconciliation and accountability, including at the UN Human Rights Council, little has changed for Tamils, who face continued marginalization and lack of justice. The organization advocates for international support and self-determination for the Tamil people.

🟩

The Sri Lankan government has said that the same Sinhala Buddhist majority policy is due to the Sri Lankan government's land grabbing military occupation and economically exclusion, the same Sinhala Buddhist policy that has led to the riots.

To commemorate the 41st anniversary of the Black July, the Pearl Organization is joining Tamils ​​around the world to commemorate the victims of the planned massacre against Tamils ​​today.

Moreover, Sinhalaism, which is responsible for violence, is trying to investigate how to influence the current events, as well as the Tamil nation.

After the independence of 1948, Sinhala Buddhist chauvinism was rapidly rooted in the structure of Sri Lanka.

The abolition of the rights of Tamils ​​and national communal rhetoric led to many anti -Tamil massacres.

Black July is one of the most ruthless horrible massacre that took place before the war.

Bangladesh partially restored telecommunication services on Wednesday although Internet connection was slow and social media remained suspended, days after deadly protests against reservations for government jobs killed almost 150 people.

The country has mostly been calm since Sunday when the Supreme Court scaled down reservations for various categories to 7 percent, overruling a high court verdict reinstating a 56 percent quota in government jobs that had been scrapped in 2018.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government said on Tuesday that it would heed the Supreme Court ruling.

As demonstrations against the quotas  which included a 30 percent reservation for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan  tapered off, the government started easing the curfew imposed last week.

Restrictions will be relaxed for seven hours on Wednesday and offices will also be open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., officials said.

### If AKD Is Going To Be Another Political Leader?

The major argument of this article is to discuss whether Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s political path is suitable for the socio-political recovery in Sri Lanka. Apparently, he seems to be a possible candidate for the forthcoming presidential election because of his long-term political experiences as a member of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. But is it enough to be a leader of this fallen land? This land is at present going through different crises. It is in chaos. There is no point in becoming a microphone-political-leader who addresses people with heavy arguments. That is an outdated tradition, which has no sense at all.

It is so easy to speak with so many rosy words and please people with different tongues. The majority of citizens of this land are fond of jokes but never listen to concrete discussions that lead to being better countrymen. Most of the people live in an illusion. Myths are the way of life that they deserve always. This is Sri Lanka!
