Colombo, Jan 30 (Daily Mirror) - The Immigration and Emigration Department yesterday asked the local travelers to be extremely cautious of bogus travel agents who would arrange fake foreign visas or travel documents for exorbitant rates, following such a passenger with a fake Italian visa was intercepted at the airport.

The immigration authorities requested from the public to be watchful when paying large sums of money to agents to get their travel documents done as they could easily be deceived by the fraudsters.

If a traveler is doubtful about the authenticity of their visa or any other travel document they could simply check it with the respective embassy or foreign mission of the country they intend to visit.

The immigration officials at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) departure terminal were tipped off about a suspicious passenger bound for Oman on Sunday morning.

### Is a “production economy” the solution?

*2024-01-30 00:07:59* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Is-a-production-economy-the-solution/4-757912) · `en`

Is the Government capable of identifying what we should produce for export? Isn’t it better to leave that to the entrepreneurs? What can the Government do? Remove whatever barriers enterprises face. If information gaps exist, help bridge them. But in many cases the most helpful thing Government can do is to improve infrastructure services

Every few years, Sri Lanka’s weakness in manufacturing comes up as the cause of our economic malaise. Economic growth through services is not real, they argue. In the most recent iteration, the slogan is that of a production economy, code for manufacturing.

### Politics without substance or substance without politics? People have a choice

It will be interesting to make an assessment of what Sri Lankan leaders have been demonstrating vis a vis the ideals and objectives of the World Economic Forum

Sri Lankans need to be told the truth by all political parties. Their credibility will hinge on this. Solutions to address this truth might be different, but they need to be based on the true situation the country is in. What is the true situation? It is that the country is in debt to the hilt, its current GDP growth would not allow it to repay the debts, and if they are not honoured, the country will not be able to borrow any more even for development work, let alone for consumption

The Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum for the year 2024 is held from 15-19 January in Davos, Switzerland, under the theme ‘Rebuilding Trust’. It aims to restore collective agency, and reinforce the fundamental principles of transparency, consistency, and accountability among leaders.

### The Contribution of Siam and Burma to Buddhism in Sri Lanka

*2024-01-30 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-Contribution-of-Siam-and-Burma-to-Buddhism-in-Sri-Lanka/172-275930) · `en`

It is well known that monks from Siam and Burma (as Thailand and Myanmar were called earlier) helped stem a decline in the practice of Buddhism, and contributed to its democratization in Sri Lanka during certain periods in the island’s history.

The circumstances which necessitated help from Siam and Burma, the process of securing such help, the role of the Dutch in it, and the  results of foreign involvement are vividly described by Auckland University sociologist Kitsiri Malalgoda in his book Buddhism in Sinhalese Society 1750-1900 (Tambapanni Academic Publishers, Colombo, 2023).
