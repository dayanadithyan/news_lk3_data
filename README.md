### Sri Lanka central bank buys US$121mn in July, taking total to US$1.87

*2024-08-19 07:57:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-buys-us121mn-in-july-taking-total-to-us1-87-177150/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has bought 121 million US dollars from banks in July 2024, taking net purchases to 1.87 million US dollars in 2024.

The central bank had to sell dollars on a net basis in June after an ealier spike in unsterilized excess liquidity and credit.

In order to collect reserves permanently the liquidity created from dollar purchases has to be mopped up.

Mopping up prevents domestic investments of the same amount, allowing the central bank to invest the funds abroad as reserves.

Sri Lanka gets about 2.0 billion dollars of current receipts every month, of which about 1.5 billion US dollars are used in imports now. Some money is also used for outward travel and paying bonds.

The central bank can collect reserves from whatever that is saved by recipients of US dollars and is not re-lent to the domestic economy to invest as credit.

In June the central bank had to sell 52 million US dollars on a net basis, amid a spike in credit and exchange rate volatility.
