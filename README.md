The Excise Department has not received any directive or instruction from its qualified finance ministry to revise the excise tax on liquor, so the price of liquor will not be reduced.

Therefore, news about the reduction in the price of liquor is false and baseless, he said.

MJ Gunasiri, the chief of the Department of Excise last week, commented to the Daily Mirror, "The use of liquor in the country has been reduced significantly.. He said the department has been given a new annual target of Rs 232 billion by the end of this year.

Developing digital public infrastructure – a critical measure to accelerate economic growth

Infrastructure development is a fundamental for economic growth. Any country seeking to improve its people’s lives must invest in infrastructure to ensure free and speedy movement of goods and services. Trade and commerce and therefore economic growth depend on such developments.

So historically the road to economic heaven has been literally that – building of roads, and other infrastructure for free and easy movement of goods. And this kind of development took years. Sometimes decades before its fruits could be tasted by the common man.

It’s the same in 2024. Except the new road that promises a speedy compressed gateway to economic heaven is also digital. And digital infrastructure building is fast becoming a way of catapulting and accelerating economic development.

In an ambitious exegetical enterprise, Dr. Jaishankar strives to confer the (non-secular) Ramayana a methodological and intellectual status as a strategic text that is implicitly above Kautilya’s (secular) Arthashasthra, a Realist classic. A tough sell, that.

Visible appetite for credit, as rates have come to levels palatable to borrowers

The Central Bank has been caught off guard by the break in the months-long expansion seen in the private sector credit in January and considered it to be a one-off development and attributed it to the appreciation of the rupee and after-season settlement of facilities by the borrowers.

The seven-month-long streak in the continuous growth in the credit offered to the private sector from the licensed commercial banks (LCBs) broke down in January, when the net credit to the private sector contracted by Rs.52.2 billion, after growing by slightly over Rs.100 billion in December 2023.

It is not the country per se, but the politicians and the people who are wrong. While politicians should take 70 percent responsibility, the people also should take the rest or 30 percent. It is true that these wrongs on the part of the politicians or the people are not limited to Sri Lanka. Even in a country like Australia where I now live, there are intermittent corruption, crime, gender abuse, killing, and misguided politics. However, the difference is extremely vast. Sri Lanka’s wrongs are perhaps 50 times higher than a country like Australia.

The ship, named the Dali, hit a support column of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the early hours of Tuesday morning, causing it to collapse.

The bridge spanned the entrance to the Port of Baltimore, the busiest port in the US for car exports and the ninth-busiest overall.

Officials have said that maritime traffic through the port - which last year amounted to more than 47 million tonnes of foreign cargo - will be suspended “until further notice”.

The suspension could have a “significant ripple effect on global supply chains”, Marco Forgione, Director General at The Institute of Export and International Trade, told the BBC.

More than 750,000 cars and vehicles passed through Baltimore in the last year, he told Radio 4’s The World Tonight.

The existing electoral system in the country must be changed. 994, 2015 elections and many other occasions were recommended to change this election system. It has been proposed to elect 160 MPs in the new electoral system and 65 MPs under the proportional system.

The Regulatory Act on Election Costs is currently permitted. The authority to implement it belongs to the Election Commission.

### Has evolution found ways to prevent cancer and halt progression to old age?

The high incidence of cancer alarms us. Around six percent of the human population worldwide suffers from cancer. It is the most challenging health issue to resolve and the leading cause of death, only second to cardiovascular disease. More than 10 million people die of cancer every year. In some regions, cancer deaths exceed heart disease mortality because of the availability of more successful preventive and curative measures for the latter.

With all these fears, the relief and the promise are cancers occur less frequently than expected. Many live beyond 100 years without contracting cancer but die because of other natural causes. Animals also get cancer, but there are species exceptionally resistant to it. And evolution has found solutions to suppress malignancy. Following them would be a hopeful avenue to prevent and cure this dreadful malady.

### Tropical Hydration Smoothie

*2024-03-27 22:52:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/tropical-hydration-smoothie/) · `en`

Phew! The heat! Yes, that’s what everyone keeps saying these days. And the heat is awful, indeed.

With the heat situation hardly showing signs of improving, I thought of giving my readers something different this week.

Now place the pineapple chunks, mango chunks, banana, and coconut water in a blender. (If you are using spinach, add the handful of spinach as that would give an extra nutritional boost.)

Blend all ingredients, on high speed, until you achieve a smooth consistency. If the smoothie is too thick, you can add more coconut water to reach your desired thickness.

This smoothie is excellent for keeping your body hydrated, especially during this hot weather. Coconut water is rich in electrolytes, which help maintain hydration levels.

Pineapple and mango are both rich sources of Vitamin C. Vitamin C is essential for collagen production, which is crucial for maintaining skin elasticity and promoting skin repair.
