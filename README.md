LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - A Houthi missile attack killed three seafarers on a Red Sea merchant ship, which had a crew of 20 members including two Sri Lankans, on Wednesday, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said, the first fatalities reported since the Iran-aligned Yemeni group began strikes against shipping in one of the world's busiest trade lanes.

The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, which set the Greek-owned, Barbados-flagged ship True Confidence ablaze around 50 nautical miles off the coast of Yemen's port of Aden.

In an earlier message on X responding to the Houthi claim, Britain's embassy wrote: "At least 2 innocent sailors have died. This was the sad but inevitable consequence of the Houthis recklessly firing missiles at international shipping. They must stop."

The Houthis have been attacking ships in the Red Sea since November in what they say is a campaign in solidarity with Palestinians during the war in Gaza.

As a state agency, the Central Bank should not hike salaries so steeply, especially after Treasury circulars were issued to cut spending, legislators said.

The low level of teacher capacity along with reduced affordability of hardware remains major barriers towards successfully implementing ed-tech in Sri Lanka, a recent Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) study revealed.

The COVID-19 pandemic sparked renewed interest in ed-tech worldwide, leading to diverse impacts in the way it has been integrated into policies, programmes and interventions, while the interest in ed-tech continued to grow in the post-pandemic period.

In Sri Lanka, the Akura initiative and Nenasa programme have been recognised as two such successful ed-tech programmes.

The Akura initiative in Sri Lanka enables schools to connect with parents, individually and collectively, to communicate school activities, send invoices and provide feedback on student learning outcomes, by facilitating clearer and easier communication between schools and parents.

However, the access to and affordability of hardware for the users remain key challenges, in addition to high operational costs.

### Defense sharing should not split the country and make power sharing from the dark age -Foreign Minister insists on

*2024-03-06 23:59:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178124) ┬╖ `ta`

Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabri emphasizes the importance of power devolution in Sri Lanka, arguing it's crucial for national unity and progress. He cites Sri Lanka's economic recovery post-crisis and India's stabilization under Manmohan Singh as examples. Sri Lanka's multi-ethnic community, including Tamils, Muslims, and Sinhalese, can progress together, with the Tamil National People's Front advocating for a political solution. The minister warns against the dangers of language-based division, referencing Colvin R.D. Silva's warning against a war that could have been avoided if Tamil-Sinhala languages were declared royal in 1956. He calls for all political parties to focus on the country's welfare over politics, highlighting the need for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address war-related issues without external interference.

ЁЯЯй

Devolution of power does not split the country. Therefore, political parties should dedicate their position on the sharing of power and refer to the country for the country.. If ethnic harmony is confirmed only can the country progress. Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabri said devolution of power should be made possible to get out of the dark era.

He was speaking at a debate on the Taxes Bill on Wednesday (6) in Parliament.

Sri Lanka is an excellent example of what will happen if you make popular decisions in the economy and what will happen if timely economic policies change. The people of the country will take the benefit of taking strict resolutions to recover from the economic crisis.

India faced the worst economic crisis in 1991. The then Prime Minister of India Narasinghe Rao. Manmohan Singh appointed Finance Minister and stabilized India's economy. Since 1991, many political parties have ruled India but economic policy has not been changed for political purposes.

The Officer-In-Charge (OIC) of the Udappuwa Police Crimes Division was arrested and subsequently suspended from the service, for allegedly assaulting a group of villagers on Tuesday night (05 March).

According to police, witnesses had also videotaped the police officer in question using crude language with the area residents, blasting them for reportedly having spat on his vehicle, in which he had been travelling in with two other persons.

Two civilians were subsequently admitted to the Udappuwa Rural Hospital after sustaining injuries in the altercation. Meanwhile, the Crimes OIC who claims to have also sustained injuries in the incident, was also hospitalised.

He was arrested this morning (06) while still in hospital, and was suspended from his duties pending investigations.

Police stated that blood samples were also obtained from the policeman in question, to determine whether or not he had been under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident.

They have done so, because they are not boring while almost all others are; they have not lost credibility as all others have; they are interesting and have social energy while the others are tired and lack authentic passion; they have a positive message which motivates and mobilises while others are shrilly negative, imaginatively timid, stale and samey.
