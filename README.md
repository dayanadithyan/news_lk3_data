Kagiso Rabada (2-21) and left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who took two wickets in two balls on his way to 2-22, also damaged Sri Lanka's cause.

Opener Kusal Mendis (19) and veteran all-rounder Angelo Mathews (16) were the only Sri Lanka batsmen to pass 15 after their captain, Wanindu Hasaranga, seemingly misread conditions by opting to bat first after winning the toss in what was the first match at a Long Island ground built specially for this tournament.

### Just think about us

*2024-06-03 21:58:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/197353) ┬╖ `si`

A powerful entity transforms into a vast, harsh body of water, capable of devastating human lives. Despite its cruelty, it embodies the essence of life: breath, birth, emotions, protection, and warmth. Amidst the rain, individuals reflect on their achievements while the innocent, sheltered within the water, remain oblivious to their fate. As time passes, memories of these innocents fade, yet reminders of their existence persist, urging for their release from this oppressive force.

ЁЯЯй

He became a great body of water and cruel enough to turn human lives in the earliest.

Lives of breathing, emergence, feelings, protection, and warm.

In the middle of the rains, everyone looks at what they have earned and carefully carefully.

In the meantime, they are the innocent people who believe in the life of their master about their master.

They are hiding among the waters of the waters of the water and the increasing weight of the water.

There is plenty of information about the innocent innocent.

As the Maha Vanage is gradually, you can forget these dear pets.

Whenever you have all of their belongings, we also do not forget these innocent.

We ask you to be released as you can't take the least.

### Is the future Palestinian government possible?

*2024-06-03 21:21:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185247) ┬╖ `ta`

The possibility of a future Palestinian government hinges on resolving longstanding conflicts, including border disputes, the status of Jerusalem, and the right of return for refugees. Recent international support, exemplified by European countries recognizing the Palestinian state, underscores the global desire for a peaceful resolution. However, challenges such as Israel's expansion beyond UN-defined borders, the presence of Jewish settlements, and the political implications of evacuating settlers complicate the path to a two-state solution.

ЁЯЯй

The Hamas Movement on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the war on Israel's continuing war on Gaza has brought back the Palestinian issue in West Asia.. The world sees more countries to give a firm support for a future Palestinian state, with the destruction of a large part of the war Gaza and killed more than 36 thousand of its people.

Recently, three European countries, Spain, Norway and Ireland have recognized the Palestinian state. Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, say that if the Palestinian issue is not resolved, there will never be strict peace in the region. If the crisis is a solution with international recognition, it is a two -state solution.

The brief answer to this question is easy. The two state solution is to divide the land between the historical Balasatinam, the Jordan River to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the West of the Mediterranean.. But the long answer is complicated.

The Central Bank should be urged to unwind its large Treasury bill holdings, depreciate the currency aggressively, and cut the statutory reserve ratio to encourage risk-taking by banks

Many of us were puzzled by the recent monetary policy announcement where the monetary board chose not to lower interest rates, despite inflation being below 5%. When a journalist questioned the Governor about this, asking if they expected inflation to exceed 5% in the latter half of the year, it was like asking if the emperor had any clothes on. The governorтАЩs response was unclear, referencing a dynamic model before deferring to Dr. S. Jegajeevan, head of the Economic Research Department. Dr. Jegajeevan clarified that they do not foresee inflation approaching 5% later this year.

### Sri Lanka Government awaits Supreme Court ruling to cancel LG polls: State Minister

*2024-06-03 16:55:00* ┬╖ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-government-awaits-supreme-court-ruling-to-cancel-lg-polls-state-minister-165984/) ┬╖ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ The Sri Lankan government will not enact the necessary legislation to cancel already declared Local Government (LG) polls, a State Minister said, amid growing concerns over potential violations of election laws through various development projects and a poverty alleviation program.

The islandтАЩs Election Commission initially scheduled the LG polls for March 9, 2023, later postponing them to April 25, 2023. However, the elections were not held after President Ranil WickremesingheтАЩs administration cited a lack of funds due to the countryтАЩs recovery from an unprecedented economic crisis.

Despite the postponement, the LG polls have not been officially canceled, meaning that standard election laws, including restrictions on political parties engaging in development projects or distributing funds, remain in effect.
