Former Finance Minister and Colombo district leader Ravi Karunanayake has said that 90 per cent of the members who have left the UNP for various reasons will be reunited with the UNP.

He said this while addressing a media briefing in Colombo.

He also said that the party's members will be informed of the UNP people's power on May Day with the working workers.

He said that the political coalition for narrow political and powerful purposes would never benefit the people and that the rapidly growing political alliances would fall quickly.

He also said that when the United National Party was strong, the country was developed and the United National Party was in a state of disrepair.

### тАШNo groundтАЩ for IndiaтАЩs request for return of Kachchatheevu: Minister Douglas

*2024-04-05 14:28:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98447/no-ground-for-indias-request-for-return-of-kachchatheevu-minister-douglas) ┬╖ `en`

The statements coming out of India on тАЬreclaimingтАЭ Kachchatheevu island from Sri Lanka have тАЬno groundтАЭ, the Sri Lankan Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda has said.

The senior Sri Lankan Tamil politicianтАЩs comments came days after the Narendra Modi government targeted the Congress and its ally the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu accusing them of overlooking national interests in the ceding of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka in 1974.

The BJP has also been targeting the two parties for not ensuring the rights of the fishermen wanting to fish in waters around the Katchatheevu island.

тАЬIt is the election time in India, it is not unusual to hear such noises of claims and counterclaims about Kachchatheevu,тАЭ Devananda told reporters in Jaffna on Thursday, 4 April.

тАЬI think India is acting on its interests to secure this place to ensure Sri Lankan fishermen would not have any access to that area and that Sri Lanka should not claim any rights in that resourceful areaтАЭ, Devananda said.

### Biden warns Netanyahu US policy depends on Gaza civilian protection

President Joe Biden warned Israel of a sharp shift in his policy over the Gaza war Thursday amid growing frustration with Benjamin Netanyahu and mounting domestic pressure in a US election year.

A tense phone call between the two leaders appeared to yield at least some results, as NetanyahuтАЩs office announced within hours it would temporarily allow more aid to flow into Gaza.

Biden has stood solidly behind Israel and its prime minister since HamasтАЩs October 7 attacks, and his criticism of civilian deaths in Gaza has not stopped Washington from supplying military hardware to its key ally.

But the Democrat faces spiraling anger from Muslim and younger voters over his support for Israel, and political allies have been pressing him to make the aid conditional on changed Israeli behavior.

In a 30-minute call with Netanyahu after Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers from US-based charity World Central Kitchen, Biden hinted at doing just that.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ  Sri LankaтАЩs container transshipment volumes rose 29.1 percent to 528,348 twenty foot equivalent unit (TEUs), in February 2024 as shipping lines use Colombo port to drop off and pick up cargo linked to by-passed Middle Eastern ports.

Meanwhile domestic container volumes were also picking up as the economy recovered from a currency crisis and tourism inflows boosted incomes of the people, driving more imports, despite foreign reserve collections.

Domestic containers surged 39 percent to 92,097 in February 2024, from 66,236 in February 2022.

Sri LankaтАЩs total container volumes in February were up 30.3 percent to 1,337,557 TEUS.

In my opinion, the IMF program Sri Lanka has got now is lenient when you compare it with many other countries. The 17th IMF program may not be enough even if implemented fully. Therefore, there is very little space to make changes in the broader program targets.

1.Achieve a primary budget surplus of 2.3% by 2025 and beyond

2.Bring annual foreign currency debt service from 9.4% of GDP in 2022 to 4.5% of GDP during 2027-2032. Reduce the governmentтАЩs gross financial needs which was at 35% of GDP in 2022 down to below 13% from 2027-2032.

3.Public debt, which was 128% to GDP, should be reduced to 95% by 2032.

If there were to be any renegotiations of the IMF deal by a future government, it will have to change one or all of the above. Let me go through them one by one.

Develop an engine which can generate more revenue at decreasing marginal cost with the right DNA

Growth is the fundamental focal point behind any business decision. However, whether businesses achieve meaningful growth is the big question today. For the growth to be meaningful it has to come at a decreasing marginal cost. Meaningful growth happens only where businesses build with scalable DNA. This thinking has to be calculated into the business at the startup conceiving stage itself.

### Sustainability in business тАУ or corporate greenwash

*2024-04-05 04:50:19* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sustainability-in-business-or-corporate-greenwash/4-760321) ┬╖ `en`

тАШSustainтАЩ is derived from Latin and it means hold up or support. Its etymology suggests endurance without yielding; continuity without downfall. Sustainability, by extension, may well be the capability of sustaining, but in common speech and in commercial jargon it has become a vague and abused term, laying claim to a plethora of definitions. What then does sustainability mean, and what should it mean in business? What ought we sustain, and does sustenance suffice?

The need to address sustainability in business arose because irresponsibility in commerce and industry have led inter alia to scarcity of clean water, drain of natural resources, ill health of communities, strained employees and landfills of unsold produce тАУ not only when mistakes have occurred, but even when operating as designed and being economically profitable.

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed concern regarding the recent statement by former President Maithripala Sirisena concerning his knowledge of the mastermind behind the terror attacks on Easter Sunday in 2019.

This statement, coupled with the ongoing lack of accountability for these heinous acts, raises serious questions about potential security lapses that led to the death of innocent civilians.

The BASL reiterated its commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice for the victims.

тАЬIn this spirit, the BASL filed a Fundamental Rights application, against the former President, other members of the leadership, and senior officials for their failure to discharge their fundamental duties towards the people of our country,тАЭ the organisation said.

### A face-off that promises a surprise ending - EDITORIAL

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and his camp received a positive response from the National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) for a debate on the countryтАЩs economy. ItтАЩs a bit strange for the NPP to have agreed to a face-off with Premadasa because the JVP-led alliance prefers staging debates in an environment where experts speak on topics where analysis, statistics, reasoning and logic shape the direction of the тАШconversationтАЩ.

We all know that тАШconversationтАЩ might not be the most appropriate word to use in the context of a debate. Debates where Sri Lankan lawmakers feature in are hostile and very seldom do parties at loggerheads accept shortcomings and agree on a compromise. But this time around things might be different, according to reports reaching us from reliable sources.

### Attack on Iran: Amid lies and deception, Gaza war may escalate into a regional conflict

The April 1 attack by Israel on the Iranian consular office in the Syrian capital of Damascus, killing several people including a senior Revolutionary Guard general and diplomats, is a potential trigger for a regional war. Let the entire world suffer and let millions of people die in such a war, which will have a devastating effect on developing countries. Israel will not stop until it conquers the world.

This is not a dark prophecy. Israel is well on the path to achieving its ambitions. With the West, the Arab world, and one-time Non-Aligned Movement stars paying obeisance to Israel, the Zionist state believes it is special and above the law. It believes international human rights laws, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and myriad United Nations mechanisms for a rules-based world order are only for nations other than Israel.
