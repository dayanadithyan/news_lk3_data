The fact that poverty rate increased during the recovery period and that there is still no sign of that rate falling has been ignored. What is more significant is the fact that many of those who sing the praise of RW are the ones who were originally responsible for causing the economic wreckage.

It is not surprising that the construction industry has shrunk in the last four years by 65-70%. Due to this, industry professionals, quantity surveyors, architects, engineers, etc. are leaving the country. We believe that, by now, a few thousand professionals have left the country. More than this, the biggest issue we are facing is losing the skilled workforce in the country. We can see a light at the end of the tunnel by potentially starting a few projects in the country by 2025.
