From the fact the Sri Lankan developers of wind farms source many of the needed inputs from India, it should be

evident that the eco system of supportive manufacturers is well established there and not here

The 13-hour power cuts two years ago should have educated us on the importance of reliable power supply. But we forget after two weeks, it is said.

The impact of these dynamics will be felt in terms of reduced export revenue, within approximately nine months – which is the typical lead time on apparel orders

Politics and economics are concepts that are fundamentally intertwined. Yet the unprecedented economic crisis of 2022 highlighted the complex challenges of aligning short-term political goals with long-term economic strategies.

While the sharp appreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee in recent months has been roundly welcomed by most sectors of society as a positive signal, this optimism overlooks the nuanced factors influencing our currency’s strength and the medium-long-term challenges that could arise from volatile fluctuations in the price of the rupee.
