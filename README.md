Colombo, May 30 (Daily Mirror) - Thailand’s cabinet approved a range of visa promotions to attract more tourists from other countries, including Sri Lanka, Foreign Affairs Minister M.U.M. Ali Sabry said.

He said these measures include visa-free and visa-on-arrival schemes, longer stays for students, and reduced compulsory health insurance for retirees.

According to him, Sri Lankan tourists, along with visitors from 36 other countries including Albania, Cambodia, China, India, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Laos, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, Romania, Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan can now enter Thailand without a visa and stay for up to 60 days.

However, according to Thai government spokesman Chai Wacharonke, this expansion increases the number of countries eligible for visa-free entry from 57 to 93. The initiative aims to boost the national economy, which relies heavily on tourism, he said.

Visa-on-arrival: The number of countries eligible for visa-on-arrival has increased from 19 to 31.

### UK Parliament dissolves ahead of July 4 general election

The British parliament dissolved on Thursday ahead of a July 4 general election, which looks set to bring Labour to power after 14 years of Conservative rule.

Five weeks of campaigning officially began as 650 seats of members of parliament (MPs) became vacant at one minute past midnight (2301 GMT) in line with the electoral schedule.

The first week of campaigning has seen a shaky start following Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s rain-drenched election announcement, with many observers taking the downpour as a bad omen.

Sunak set the election for July 4, instead of later in the year as had been widely expected, in what observers said was an attempt to regain momentum as his party slides in opinion polls.

After 14 years in opposition, the Labour party now has the chance to win back power with its leader Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, at the helm.

ECONOMYNEXT – The objective of Sri Lanka’s monetary policy is not to promote growth but provide stability to achieve its growth potential, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said though it could be a secondary aim.

“The objective of monetary policy is not to promote growth, but to stabilize and facilitate for the country to achieve potential growth, whatever the levels,” Governor Weerasinghe told reporters in Colombo, after keeping rates unchanged.

“A lot of other policies will have to take place to enhance growth in the medium to long term.”

Critics have complained that Sri Lanka’s central bank has in the past tried to push growth by cutting rates by printing money through liquidity tools and denied monetary stability to the people and businesses by trying to close a potential ‘output gap’.

### Vietnam example: Communist factor in JVP-NPP mix could prove constructive

“First as tragedy, then as farce”. Marx’s legendary riff on Hegel springs to mind when forecasting the political future of Sarvajana Balaya, the rebranded bloc of Islamophobic ultranationalists from the Zombieland of the Gotabaya Presidency and old Leftists.

I expect it to be extinguished through Sarvajana Chanda Balaya (universal franchise) at the forthcoming Parliamentary election just as the SLFP’s allies were in 1977. Its rancid ultranationalism is anathema to the youth of the Aragalaya generation and while its old personalities and discourse will give ex-MR voters someone to punish, for the painful Gotabaya fiasco.

For the CPSL and Vasu’s DLF there will be no coming back from this last cruise on the Titanic. Criticising the JVP-NPP is fine but doing so in alliance with and on the same platform as three notorious political purveyors of dangerous Islamophobia (Muslim birth-rates, Dr. Shafi, etc.) is morally grotesque and ethically disgusting.

### Yukthiya anti-drug operation: Separating fact from fiction

The impact of the operation on respect for the rule of law and the protection of human rights has been adverse

Minister Alles and Deshabandu Tennakoon, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), have repeatedly proclaimed the success of Yukthiya (means justice in Sinhala), the anti-drug operation they launched in December 2023. The facts say otherwise.

As of 22 May 2024, 113,974 persons have been arrested as part of Yukthiya, with the majority of such persons released soon after arrest either after being fined or on bail. Releasing most arrested persons within a few hours of arrest demonstrates that the intent is to create the illusion of effective government action to address drug trafficking by showing a high number of arrests. However, most of the arrested persons are drug users, many of whom are drug dependent, and not drug traffickers.

### How transparency and competitive bidding could have averted VFS visa fiasco

*2024-05-30 04:46:09* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/How-transparency-and-competitive-bidding-could-have-averted-VFS-visa-fiasco/4-762351) · `en`

The recent outrage over the outsourcing of Sri Lanka›s visa issuance to VFS Global stemmed from two controversies: 1) the secretive selection process of VFS Global without broader consultation and 2) neglecting value for money by not considering alternatives.

Addressing two key gaps in Sri Lanka›s public procurement system could have prevented the uproar: 1) lack of transparency and 2) excessive reliance on cabinet discretion over competitive bidding.

The first point of contention is the secrecy and lack of consultation surrounding the decision to grant VFS Global the contract. The public, and even the Parliament, learned crucial details about the terms and conditions of the handover—such as service fees, investment and contract duration—only through ad-hoc statements by the authorities after VFS Global began operations. This, too, was in response to the backlash following a viral video criticising VFS Global›s management.
