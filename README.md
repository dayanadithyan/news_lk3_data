Here's a 200-character summary:



Hope vs Faith: "Hope Against Hope" concept in politics. Voters' expectations often unmet. Sri Lankan presidential elections highlight cycle of disappointment. Candidates promise change but fail to deliver. Public seeks real transformation beyond economic issues. Political system needs overhaul for lasting reform.

🟩

There is a traditional series called Hope Against Hope in English. It can be translated directly into Tamil as a confidence against trust. But, it does not give the object of the source. Although it knows that a thing is not a chance to happen, it will indicate that it will happen. This can be a mood for belief in one of the most confident environments. Hope Against Hope is the name of his wife Natasha Mandalstam, who wrote the tragic biography of Soviet poet Osip Mandalstam, which was the most vulnerable in Stalin's time.

Who should vote in the presidential election in a few days?When I read many people in the face and WhatsApp, I appeared to be writing to my role.

Based on the information provided, it seems you are asking about the impact of social media on elections in Sri Lanka. Here's a summary of the key points:



1. Social media plays a significant role in influencing elections in Sri Lanka.



2. Candidates and their campaigns heavily utilize social media platforms to disseminate information and sway public opinion.



3. Disinformation and propaganda spread through social media can be difficult to detect and regulate.



4. The Election Commission faces challenges in monitoring and regulating social media content during elections.

9. Younger generations are more active in spreading election-related content on social media platforms.



10. Traditional methods like banners and posters are seen as less effective compared to social media in modern election campaigns.



To answer your specific questions:



1. The generation most focused on by presidential candidates appears to be younger voters, particularly those active on social media platforms.



2. The Generation Z demographic is likely the primary target for many candidates due to their high social media usage and engagement rates.



Regarding the results of 8 presidential elections in Sri Lanka, I would need more specific information to provide detailed analysis. However, I can offer general insights:



1. Sri Lanka has experienced political instability and frequent changes in leadership since gaining independence in 1948.



2. The country has held eight presidential elections since its first democratic election in 1982.



3. The most recent presidential election took place in 2019, which saw Gotabaya Rajapaksa elected as president.



4. Prior to that, Maithripala Sirisena won the 2015 presidential election, defeating incumbent Mahinda Rajapaksa.



5. Other notable winners include Chandrika Kumaratunga (1994), Ranasinghe Premadasa (1989), and Junius Richard Jayewardene (1978).



6. The election system in Sri Lanka has evolved over time, with various reforms aimed at improving transparency and fairness.
