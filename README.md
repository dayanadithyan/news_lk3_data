### Election ’24: Judicial Evolution, Power Devolution, and a New Tamil Leader

*2024-02-06 11:59:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/election-24-judicial-evolution-power-devolution-and-a-new-tamil-leader/) · `en`

Sunday this week marks Sri Lanka’s 76th independence anniversary. By President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s reckoning another twenty four years will have to go by before Sri Lanka’s economy could fully recovery from the man made crisis it contracted two years ago. And what is immediately ahead is a “grueling recovery path.” That is the grim warning of Dushni Weerakoon, the respected Economist.

Another Economist from abroad, Prof. Mick Moore, who coined the phrase “man-made crisis” to describe Gota’s debacle, has now advised that it is time for Sri Lanka to have an “authentic finance minister” after more than 30 years. Like the UB Wanninayake’s, NM Perera’s and Ronnie de Mel’s of old. Not the tandem Executive President / Finance Minister model of today.

*2024-02-06 06:01:00* · [`newsfirstlk`](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/02/06/king-charles-diagnosed-with-undisclosed-form-of-cancer/) · `en`

Colombo (News 1st) – King Charles III has been diagnosed with cancer and began treatment on Monday, Buckingham Palace said in a statement. It did not state what type of cancer the King has been diagnosed with.

The cancer was identified during the King's recent hospital 3-day treatment for a benign enlarged prostate. "A separate issue of concern was noted, and subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer", the Palace said.

Charles, 75, who assumed the throne last May, will postpone public duties, but will continue to undertake state duties.

His treatment is being carried out on an out-patient basis, and he does not need to stay overnight in hospital.

DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan, Feb 5 (Reuters) - At least 10 police personnel were killed and six others injured in a pre-dawn attack on Monday by militants on a police station in northwest Pakistan, police said, as violence escalated ahead of general elections this week.

At around 3 a.m. local time (2200 GMT Sunday) militants attacked the police station with sniper fire and then entered the building, said police officers in Pakistan's Draban region in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province.

"After entering the building, the terrorists used hand grenades which caused more casualties to the police," said Malik Anees ul Hassan, the deputy superintendent of police in Draban.

It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack and whether it was related to the election.

A national assembly candidate was shot dead on Wednesday elsewhere in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. On the same day, another political leader was shot dead in his party's election office in Balochistan province.

Colombo, Feb 6 (Daily Mirror) - The Government Medical Officers' Forum (GMOF) yesterday accused the female medical officer in charge of Welikada prison of allowing VIPs who were imprisoned, to enjoy life inside the Prison Hospital.

GMOF President told Daily Mirror the authorities keep mum despite repeated complaints to the Health Ministry against the said medical officer of misusing her powers.

"The action of the said medical officer has not only allowed VIPs but also imprisoned drug smugglers to comfortably stay inside the prison hospital," he said.

Dr. Bellana said that in this situation, the real patients who are in the Welikada prison have lost the opportunity to receive a response.

Moreover, he said several complaints have been made to the Human Rights Council and to internal doctors and no action have been taken against the doctor yet.
