The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB) has announced that the water supply to Godagama, Homagama, Pannipitiya, Pelanwatta, Rukmalgama, and Mattegoda areas has been restored today (18).

The NWS&DB states that due to this, the water supply to a number of areas in the Colombo District was disrupted and as the damaged pipeline has been repaired, the water supply was restored by around 2.00 a.m. today (18).
