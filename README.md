*2024-06-11 17:25:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185846) ┬╖ `ta`

Ranil Wickremesinghe may extend his term and Parliament's lifespan by one year due to a constitutional loophole not addressed since the 19th Amendment in 2015 aimed at democratic reforms. Despite amendments reducing terms to five years, Article 83(D) allows him to extend it without parliamentary approval for extensions over six years, enabling an 11-month extension without constitutional violation. Political analysts suggest he deserves more time as the country isn't ready for elections.

Ranil Wickremesinghe may use a mistake of the political system that has not been paid since the 19th Amendment in 2015.

The 19th Amendment sought to ensure democratic reforms and to ensure the nation and reduce the term of the parliament and the president.

Although all the references to the six -year term of the Parliament and the President of the Parliament, in accordance with the 19th Amendment have been changed to five years, Article 83 (D) has given President Wickremesinghe to extend his tenure.

Any Bill to extend the five -year tenure of the President or Parliament must be approved by a two -thirds majority in Parliament.

However, under Section 83 (D), the universities are only needed if they are extended for more than six (6) years, not five (5) years

Sri Lanka has seen bottom trawling by Indian fishermen during the peak fishing season in Sri LankaтАЩs northern waters off Jaffna. Bottom trawling is banned by Sri Lanka and is a punishable offense, which has led to arrest of a raft of Indian fishermen along with their bottom trawlers.

Depletion of fish resources in the Northern sea in the face of continuous Indian bottom trawling, a method of banned fishing that involves dragging heavy weighted nets across the sea floor, has pushed some Northern fishermen to take up Chinese funded sea cucumber farming.

Sri LankaтАЩs North is just 27 km from the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

### Risk of diarrhea, viral infection with increased flies

*2024-06-11 15:53:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185824) ┬╖ `ta`

Floods in Sri Lanka have led to a fly infestation, exacerbating the spread of diarrhea and viral infections due to the presence of organic matter in flood waters. Flies mature quickly and proliferate, spreading pathogens from feces and contaminated surfaces. This increases the risk of diseases like diarrhea and viral fever, causing symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, and fever. To combat this, it's crucial to use covered containers, manage waste, ensure clean water, and seek immediate medical attention to mitigate the impact of these diseases.

ЁЯЯй

Deepal Perera, a specialist on the children's disease of the Children's Hospital in Colombo, said that the floodwaters in the country are increasing the proliferation of flies and the spread of diarrhea and viral infection.

The presence of a large number of organic substances in flooded areas accelerates the maturity of the eggs and leads to the rapid increase in the number of flies when flooding is reduced.

These newly fried flies, searching for food resources, often go to feces, debris and contaminated surfaces and further enhance the health crisis.

He pointed out that the effects of increasing flies are scary and that flies bring pathogens, including diarrhea and viral fever, etc.

"If you eat contaminated food and water, you can lead to many symptoms, including abdominal pain, cramps, nausea and relaxed feces," he said.

He also said that the risk of viral infection, characterized by symptoms such as fever, headaches and nausea, also increases in areas where flies are high.

### Constitutional Error Could Give Ranil and Parliament Another Year

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs constitution could allow President Ranil Wickremesinghe to extend his tenure by almost a year due to a mistake in the constitution that has been overlooked since the 19th Amendment in April 2015.

The sweeping 19th Amendment sought to establish democratic reforms, ensure good governance, and shorten the terms of both the president and parliament to five years. However, it neglected to ensure consistency regarding tenure.

While all references to the six-year terms of both the president and parliament were changed to five years in line with the 19th Amendment, Article 83(b) was overlooked and left unchanged, giving President Wickremesinghe a loophole to extend his term.

Any bill to extend the five-year term of the president or parliament requires approval in parliament with a two-thirds majority, followed by endorsement at a referendum.

Bangkok, June 11 (BBC) - Around 1,000 animals were killed in a fire in Bangkok's famous open-air Chatuchak market early Tuesday, gutting nearly 100 shops.

Birds, dogs, cats and snakes were burnt to death in their cages in the pet zone, which also included rats, pythons and geckos.

The blaze was started by an electrical short circuit, authorities said, adding that no human casualties or injuries have been reported.

With tens of thousands of shops crowding narrow lanes, Chatuchak is one of South East Asia's biggest markets.

It's also the largest and best-known of Thailand's weekend markets. It claims to draw nearly 200,000 tourists every Saturday and Sunday.

But the portion of the market selling pets is open through the week. This accounts for about four of the 27 sections in Chatuchak market and is arguably its most controversial trade.

Speaking at a ceremony recognizing the top achievers of the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination, Minister Premajayantha highlighted the reforms aimed at minimizing delays in the educational timeline.

He emphasized that A/L studies will now begin before the release of O/L results, allowing for continuous academic progress without the previous 4-5 month gap traditionally experienced between the two examination stages.

Starting this year, the A/L examination, which has typically been held in November, will be rescheduled to September by 2025. This change aims to streamline the process and reduce the waiting period for university admissions.
