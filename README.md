### Cabinet approves import of 15,000 tons of cashew nut to address shortage

*2024-02-09 05:11:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/Cabinet-approves-import-of-15-000-tons-of-cashew-nut-to-address-shortage/34-758276) · `en`

The Cabinet of Ministers approved importing a maximum of 15,000 tons of cashew nuts in the shell this year as the local production capacity falls short to 12,500 tons, leading to an urgent need for intervention.

The annual demand is 25,000 tons of cashew nuts but the cashew industry in the country is facing a very unfortunate situation as the crop has not been harvested as expected in the last season.

Additionally, a committee comprising senior officials from relevant Ministries will determine the quantity to be imported from December to April over the next four years, bridging the gap during the offseason when local cashew harvests are unavailable.

The proposal presented by the Agriculture and Plantation Minister received approval at the Cabinet of Ministers’ meeting on Monday.

### SJB firm on non-support - Nalin Bandara highlights incompatibility with SLPP

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Nalin Bandara yesterday expressed the party’s inability to support the President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s endeavours to revive Sri Lanka, citing his collaboration with the leaders of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the same party responsible for the country’s bankruptcy.

“The President has made many statements of Government policy within the last two years. In turn, Government MPs are now singing the praises of the President. Yesterday President Wickremesinghe questioned why the SJB cannot support him as the Pohottuwa members have. That is the very reason we cannot support his efforts,” Bandara said.  He remarked that those responsible for leading the country to bankruptcy since 2005 are now praising Wickremesinghe, and they appear to view the President in a favourable light.  “SJB lawyers even filed cases against them, and they were found responsible for the crisis. Hence, we are unable to collaborate with them,” he said.

### When the ‘Weight’ of Bread is Too Much to Bear! - EDITORIAL

*2024-02-09 00:03:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/When-the-Weight-of-Bread-is-Too-Much-to-Bear-EDITORIAL/172-276625) · `en`

The study of the history of bread in Sri Lanka provides us with an interesting story. Despite Sri Lankan homes trying to dissuade eating bread - stating that such foods invite disease early in life - the baked meal made of flour has held on to its place on the dining table despite fighting for survival amidst government regulations imposed on bakery and restaurant owners.

The present regulation is that a loaf of bread must weigh a minimum of 450 grams. This was made mandatory following a government regulation confirmed through gazette notification recently. However, bakery owners are complaining that there must be a price control now because an unofficial price revision has taken place to balance costs with the increase in the weight of a loaf of bread.

### Covering Gaza: The imperialistic media deception

In east London, graffiti made by street artist Ed Hicks, also known as @ed_hicks, depicts Palestinian citizen journalist, Plestia Alaqad, as part of a peace project called “Heroes of Palestine” by the art platform Creative Debuts. AFP

Do as I say, not as I do. This is the mantra with which the imperialist West keeps its colonial or neo-colonial projects going. This duplicity is also evident in the imperialists’ media policy.

Often, developing countries’ mid-career journalists are invited to the West for training that lasts weeks, months, and even a year. The institutes to which they go meet the airfare, accommodation, and meal costs. They are even paid per diem. They are lectured on journalistic rules and dos and don’ts. They are taught that journalism’s first obligation is to the truth, which is sacred and cannot be warped or violated. The primary duty of the journalist is to find out the truth, verify it, fact-check it, and convey it to the people they are morally bound to serve.

Sri Lanka was a pivotal point in the historic silk route which was used extensively by the Arab traders. In ancient times Arabs called Sri Lanka ‘Serendip,’ which later added to the English vocabulary as ‘serendipity.’”

The ambassador said the Sri Lankan leadership had on numerous occasions expressed admiration for Saudi Vision 2030, which he said was a well-thought-out strategy that takes into consideration the Kingdom’s strengths and capabilities, as well as the impressive progress that has been made under the leadership of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Australia, Feb 8 (Independent) - Australia is set to pass a law that will provide employees the right to refuse unreasonable calls from bosses outside of work hours without facing penalty.

The "right to disconnect" is among the various changes to industrial relations laws proposed by the federal government in a parliamentary bill.

Prime minister Anthony Albanese’s government said these changes would safeguard workers’ rights and contribute to restoring a healthy work-life balance.

It would also mean potential fines for employers that breach the rule.

His Labor party’s so-called “closing loopholes” bill which is meant to plug gaps that undercut workers’ pay and conditions has won the support of the majority of senators for the legislation.

The left-wing Greens, which supports the rule and was the first to propose it last year, confirmed that the legislation was close to becoming a law after deals between Labor, smaller parties and independents to support this bill.

Sri Lanka is likely to extend visa exemption status for India after March to keep attracting travellers from the country and encourage repeat visits, Tourism and Lands, Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Harin Fernando said on Thursday.

“India is our number one source market and tourists from India helped our country on its path of recovery from the recent crisis we faced,” Fernando said in a session at OTM 2024.

Sri Lanka facilitated visa-free entry for Indian travellers from December 2023 to March. “We are working on extending it beyond March. We want to make Sri Lanka an easily accessible destination for Indians, who can just walk into our country for a hassle free holiday,” he said.

By offering visa exemption to Indians, Sri Lanka will attract more footfalls, especially those who make last-minute plans and find visa process a hindrance, he said.

### Loneliness declared a public health emergency in part of Silicon Valley, California

Loneliness has been declared a public health emergency in a Californian county that includes part of Silicon Valley.

San Mateo County is the first in the US to make such a declaration.

About 17% of US adults questioned by Gallup in February last year said they had experienced loneliness the day before.

In San Mateo, however, about 45% of residents are struggling with isolation, according to David Canepa from the county’s board of supervisors.

Across the US there is an “epidemic of loneliness and isolation”, US Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy has said.

It is an “underappreciated public health crisis” which has “harmed individual and societal health”, he added.

Concerns in San Mateo are not confined to one demographic, Mr Canepa said.

Teenagers and young adults spend a long time on social media, he pointed out, while Silicon Valley’s high-achieving atmosphere may put stress on those still in education.

Many older residents became especially isolated during the pandemic, he added.

“We believe that after March as usually every year, there will be reduction in the global oil prices and Singapore PLATTS. Last year for instance, we were able to reduce the fuel prices across the board by around 100 rupees during that period.”

COLOMBO (News 1st); In a significant development today, the opposition leader raised concerns over the Online Safety Act, pointing out nine clauses that are allegedly not in line with the determination given by the Supreme Court.

Despite these concerns, Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa maintained a firm stance, stating that no part of the passed Act can be altered.

A heated exchange erupted in the Sri Lankan Parliament today between Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena over the passing of the Online Safety Bill, which critics say violates Supreme Court rulings and disregards judicial guidance.

Premadasa accused the government of ignoring the court's recommendations on several key clauses of the bill, including those pertaining to revoking internet access and addressing contempt of court. He highlighted the court's emphasis on the need for due process and magisterial oversight, both of which he claims are absent in the current legislation.

The bill was passed in the Senate on Thursday but will need to go back to the House of Representatives to vote to approve some amendments.

“We all need to relax, we all need to be able to switch off and not be disturbed by emails and phone calls in the middle of the night. Both of my kids are lawyers as well, so they work horrendous hours as it is and you get things coming in at night time,” he said.
