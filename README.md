The general candidate is a poisonous exam than a poisonous exam. This is an event that is not the existence of the Tamil people. We should not go to the political leaders of the Tamil people.

Political leaders and political parties. Civil community can only offer advice. We welcome their advice.

Election is a political event. People did not choose the civil society to lead people in that politics. People have ordered us. We are the ones who can lead people politically. We cannot leave our responsibility and dismantle people.

It is our responsibility to keep the people awake if we stand on the single side that we will stop beyond all this.

Last month, Gantz presented Netanyahu with a June 8 deadline to come up with a clear day-after strategy for Gaza, where Israel has been pressing a devastating military offensive against the ruling Palestinian militant group Hamas.

As of December 2023, 25% of IMF-promised reforms for Sri Lanka remain unfulfilled, including crucial aspects like good governance and anti-corruption measures. Despite progress in some areas, the lack of fulfillment indicates potential obstacles to economic recovery. The upcoming third cash tranche from the IMF, set to be signed on June 12, aims to address these issues, emphasizing transparency and combating corruption. However, the success of this initiative hinges on fulfilling these unmet commitments, which are critical for long-term economic stability in Sri Lanka.

Will it be planned that the IMF can make the project a successful manner by improving the good governance system in Sri Lanka?

On June 12, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will sign a contract for the third cash allowance of the IMF.

According to the latest Verite Company's IMF watchdogs, 25 percent of the promises have not been fulfilled as of the renewed plan of December 2023.

Of the 63 promises to be completed in this scheme, 32 have been fulfilled, but 16 promises are not fulfilled and 15 are unknown. (Could not find the truth because of the data is not available.)

The 16 -unveiled promises have come to the conclusion that good governance will fail.

Sri Lanka has not accomplished the issues that have been identified as the root cause of the economic crisis by the IMF project.That means financialization and anti -corruption.

In September 2023, it was published in September 2023 that the Good Governance Review Report was made in Sri Lanka under the leadership of the IMF in Asia.
