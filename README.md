Sri Lanka is grappling with a severe cost-of-living crisis rooted in pervasive political corruption. Political intermediaries profit at every stage, shifting the burden onto consumers. The economy has plummeted due to corrupt leaders using the Government to further personal agendas and misusing public funds on unproductive projects while simultaneously selling national assets and depleting public reserves. Under such deceptive governance, our future hard work and increased taxes will be in vain, offering no relief to ordinary citizens as corrupt politicians continue to siphon off surplus funds.

More than at any time in the past those in whose hands lies the power to choose their leaders will also decide their own futures and that of their children ‚Äì Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

There has never been as important a period in the history of Sri Lanka as will be the next few months. The country is still reeling under the financial and economic battering of two years ago. As per the latest statistics the country‚Äôs debt burden has ticked over the $ 100 billion mark ‚Äì including the backlog of interest. Meanwhile, a deceptive sense of calm and even spots of prosperity ‚Äì for some ‚Äì seem to prevail on the surface disguising strong undercurrents of turmoil.

This turmoil is more than just a single facet. One could debate which of them is worse but the combination is a deadly cocktail which unless mitigated has the potential to cripple the country and the lives of its citizens for decades to come. Yet, the solution to this complex situation lies ‚Äì literally ‚Äì in the hands of the stakeholders.

Britain now has a new government after Labour Party won a landslide victory in last Thursday‚Äôs election, winning 412 seats and a huge 172-seat majority in parliament. While 2019‚Äôs general election was largely a story of two parties, this time national ballot led to historic gains for the¬†Lib Dems, the¬†Greens¬†and¬†Reform UK. The victories by pro-Gaza independent candidates, among them ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dealt blows to some of Westminster‚Äôs most prominent MPs. The rise of the ‚Äúpopulist‚Äù Reform UK Party led by Nigel Farage, particularly had leaders of the more established political outfits rattled.¬†(Interestingly the biggest donor to this party was a British entrepreneur with Sri Lankan heritage). Labour has also regained its dominance in Scotland, and Wales too.
