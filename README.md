‚ÄúThere was a German research vessel recently for replenishment and Sri Lanka allowed it.‚Äù

Chinese Embassy in Colombo has raised strong protest against the move to allow a German research vessel early this month following the island nation‚Äôs authorities turned down a Beijing request for a research vessel in February.

### Amid election fever a dark horse rises - EDITORIAL

Polls fever in the country is heating up. Yet, ‚Äòwe the people‚Äô are not certain whether the poll would be for a general election, presidential poll or whether a poll will be held at all. Our constitution however, dictates a presidential election is due during the fourth quarter of the year.

One thing seems certain; we still see the same faces who played a major role in bankrupting the country, putting themselves forward to lead us and our country into new vistas of prosperity.

While political parties are busy blaming each other for bringing this country to a state of bankruptcy, we do not hear any one of them raising a hand and saying ‚Äòmea maxima culpa‚Äô ‚Äì through my most grievous fault or even saying ‚ÄòI am sorry‚Äô. Rather, we are being treated to a number of political dramas.

### Why are all social issues not becoming political issues in Sri Lanka?

Solving social issues can be considered as the fundamental responsibility of the Government in a democratic country

It is vital to convert these social issues into political issues to get a reasonable solution for the issues. However, despite this critical nature, all these issues are not always translated into the political agenda of the political parties. You might observe even some crucial issues are not getting the attention of the policymakers in the country

Even though each of us has individual desires to achieve, we all live in a society in which the activities of various actors are interconnected as seen in a spider web. Thus, it is difficult to progress as an individual in society while ignoring these interactions. Social issues are problems or conditions that negatively impact individuals, communities, or society as a whole. These problems can affect different aspects of people‚Äôs lives due to various interdependencies existing in society.

### Bangladesh mocks Sri Lanka after series defeat

Mar. 19 (Daily Mirror) - Bangladesh clinched the third ODI against Sri Lanka by four wickets to secure a 2-1 series win on Monday (18) which was followed up by a celebration from their veteran wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim who brought his helmet as they were lining up to pose for the post-match photograph adding more fuel to the fire.

At the conclusion of the T20 series, Sri Lanka team brought out the 'timed-out' celebration which appeared to upset Bangladesh captain Najmul Shanto who claimed that the Islanders needed to move on from it, but on Monday Rahim probably made him eat his words when he went as far as taking his helmet to take the photographs after post-match presentation.

It doesn't look like either team is going to move on from the 'timed-out' celebration anytime soon as an unlikely rivalry is growing strong between a team that has won two ICC World Cups and played in six World Cup Finals, against a team that is yet to play ICC World Cup semi-final.
