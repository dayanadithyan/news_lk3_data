### India to assist with STEM teaching in Sri LankaтАЩs plantation sector

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ India will send 30 teaching experts later this month to train local teachers for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths (STEM) in the plantation sector for three months, Estate Infrastructure Development Minister Jeevan Thondaman said.

In November last year, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her visit to the island nationтАЩs central province promised to send teacher trainers to improve the education standards in the plantation sector to meet growing needs and aspirations of Sri LankaтАЩs up country Tamil students.

Upcountry Tamils are also referred as Indian Origin Tamil (IOT) as their ancestors were brought by British colonial rulers from India to work in Sri LankaтАЩs plantation.

Political leaders in plantation sectors time to time have demanded better services in education and health for their community which primarily works and live tea plantations in Sri LankaтАЩs up country.

The Constitutional Council has unanimously approved the nomination of Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe as the Attorney General.

Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe took oaths as the Acting Attorney General before the Chief Justice on July 01, after the proposal to extend former Attorney General Sanjay RajaratnamтАЩs term by another 06 months was defeated for the second time at the Constitutional Council meeting.

However, the appointment sparked controversy, as allegations were leveled against the government claiming that the new appointment overlooked Senior Additional Solicitor General Ayesha Jinasena, despite her seniority and eligibility for the role, due to gender bias.

However, in response to the relevant allegations, PresidentтАЩs Secretary Saman Ekanayake emphasized that there is no constitutional requirement to appoint the senior-most officer from the Attorney GeneralтАЩs Department to this position based on seniority.

Vadivel Suresh warns plantation companies: either raise workers' salaries or face changes in their operations. He highlights the struggle of hill country residents, whose legal salary hikes are being opposed, indicating potential legal challenges to plantation companies.

ЁЯЯй

Badulla District Parliamentarian Vadivel Suresh said that if the plantation companies do not change the salary of plantation workers, we will change the livelihood of the people.

He said this while addressing a debate in Parliament on Wednesday (10).

The people of the hill country are suffering from various hardships and are suffering from a salary for corruption. While the salary increase of these people is legally published in the gazette notification, the power to oppose it is surprising.

If the court goes against the salary hike in the hill people who are carrying the country's economy as a backbone, it is understood that the plantation companies are in a state of disrepair.

Plantation Company owners if you don't change we will change you тАЭ. Meanwhile, we are also telling the government that we will change the livelihood of the plantation people immediately.

The Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved a proposal to transfer a 52-perch plot of land in Kollupitiya to Expo Property Developers Ltd., under a 99-year lease.

The decision comes following complications in transferring a previously allocated 40-perch plot due to unauthorised occupants.

The land, owned by the Urban Development Authority (UDA), was initially approved for disposal in 2007 under a 50-year lease with 25% of the landтАЩs value charged. However, due to the presence of unauthorised residents, the transfer could not be completed.

Expo Property Developers requested an additional 12 perches adjacent to the original plot to facilitate a housing project, making the total requested area 52 perches. The Board of Management of the UDA has approved this request.

The Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal presented by the Urban Development and Housing Minister Prasanna Ranatunga to lease the land for 99 years based on the current valuation by the chief assessor.
