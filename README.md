In this context, the US federal Supreme Court judges on Monday (04) ruled that the Colorado High Court's ruling was 9: 0.

The US High Court said that the states do not have the authority to prevent competing under the charge and that the US parliament has such a power.

It is noteworthy that the Republican party elections will be held today in 15 states, including Colorado.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka may have to wait for an in-principle deal with private creditors before final restructuring deals are inked with official creditors, former central bank governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.

The official creditor committee made up of Paris Club lenders and India have given an in-principle deal for Sri Lanka. Exim Bank of China has also agreed to re-structure debt.

Official creditors are likely to wait for a deal with private creditors to check the comparability with their restructure offer, Coomaraswamy told a forum organized by Sri Lanka’s Institute of Chartered Accountants (CA Sri Lanka).

It will prevent a repetition of what happened in Zambia where the official creditors had a dispute over a private creditor deal, he said.

Official creditors will probably wait for the private creditor deal to get confidence that the principle of comparability is followed, he said.

### Sri Lanka reveal likely T20 World Cup selection plan

*2024-03-05 10:35:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Sri-Lanka-reveal-likely-T20-World-Cup-selection-plan/108-278266) · `en`

Mar. 5 (ICC) - The island nation looks set to give the nod to experienced players when deciding on their squad of 15 for the June event.

Chief selector Upul Tharanga has revealed Sri Lanka will favour experience over youth when deciding who will represent the side at this year's ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

The 2014 T20 World Cup champions caused a shock recently when they recalled experienced wicket-keeper-batter Niroshan Dickwella for their ongoing T20I series with Bangladesh and Tharanga indicated this would be the norm ahead of this year's 20-over showcase in the USA and Caribean in June.

It means the likes of left-arm spinner Dunith Wellalage and fellow youngsters Vijayakanth Viyaskanth and Shevon Daniel may have to bide their time and wait for further opportunities at the top level according to Tharanga.

"In T20s we need a wicket-taking option, which is why we opted for Jeffrey (Vandersay) over someone like Dunith (Wellalage)," Tharanga said.

### Sri Lanka rupee at 308 to US dollar after opening stronger

*2024-03-05 09:34:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-rupee-at-308-to-us-dollar-after-opening-stronger-153154/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka rupee opened stronger at 307.50/90 levels from yesterdays close of 307.90/95 and moved down to 307.90/308.10 levels amid official purchases, market participants said.

Sri Lanka’s rupee is stable amid largely deflationary policy from the central bank helped by slow private credit and improving government borrowings, which is triggering a balance of payments surplus.

Banks also tend to sell dollars and run negative net open positions when the central bank allows the currency to strengthen.

The rupee has in the recent past been volatile when small changes in import demand comes from changes in  credit as the central bank does sell dollars and banks also buy dollars to square their open positions, analysts say.

A bond maturing on 01.02.2026 was quoted at 10.65/75 marginally up from Monday’s 10.60/75 percent.

A bond maturing on 15.09.2027 was quoted 11.90/12.00 percent unchanged from 11.90/12.05 percent.

They also discuss historical salary policies and their impacts, urging the Governor of CBSL to consider social and moral implications in decision-making.

In the conversation between Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe and Mr. Jayantha Kovilkodake, we would like to raise some of the unprecedented things.

Central bank officials must have a wider understanding than the economy.Their education must include social science, such as human behavior to understand the social impacts of sociology, peace and conflict studies and the social impacts of their decisions.

The current decision -making process is the risk of maintaining social unrest due to lack of this broader understanding.This recent incident, which was brought to light through social media, illustrates this.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka, which is considered a professional organization that supports policymakers, has contributed to the current economic situation to affect other social development indicators.

### France becomes only country to explicitly guarantee abortion as constitutional right

French lawmakers on Monday overwhelmingly approved a bill to enshrine abortion rights in France’s constitution, making it the only country to explicitly guarantee a woman’s right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy.

The historic move was proposed by President Emmanuel Macron as a way to prevent the kind of rollback of abortion rights seen in the United States in recent years, and the vote during a special joint session of France’s parliament drew a long-standing ovation among lawmakers.

The measure was approved in a 780-72 vote in the Palace of Versailles. Abortion enjoys wide support in France across most of the political spectrum, and has been legal since 1975.

Many female legislators in the hall smiled broadly as they cheered. While a small group of protesters stood outside the joint session, there were jubilant scenes of celebrations all over France as women’s rights activists hailed the measure promised by Macron within hours of the Dobbs ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022.

Says in case of a delay, IMF is likely to provide breathing space

A potential delay in securing an agreement-in-principle (AIP) with Sri Lanka’s private bondholders is unlikely to impact the second review of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, former Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.

While this process could take some time, he was confident that the bondholders, based on the recommendations of their advisors, would soon come onboard to reach an AIP with the government, possibly within the second review of the IMF programme.
