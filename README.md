Britain looks set to elect Labour Party leader Keir Starmer as its next prime minister when voters go to the polls on Thursday, sweeping Rishi Sunak‚Äôs Conservatives out of office after 14 often turbulent years.

Opinion polls put Starmer‚Äôs centre-left party on course for a landslide victory as voters turn their backs on the Conservatives following a period of infighting and turmoil that led to five prime ministers in eight years.

However, surveys show many voters simply want change, rather than fervently backing Labour, meaning Starmer could enter office with one of the biggest to-do lists in British history but without a groundswell of support or the financial resources to tackle it.

‚ÄúToday, Britain can begin a new chapter,‚Äù Starmer told voters in a statement on Thursday. ‚ÄúWe cannot afford five more years under the Conservatives. But change will only happen if you vote Labour.‚Äù
