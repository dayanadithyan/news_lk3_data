### Importance of renewable energy for future energy security and economic growth

*2024-02-15 00:05:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Importance-of-renewable-energy-for-future-energy-security-and-economic-growth/4-758488) · `en`

It is time Sri Lankans considered in depth, the impact of energy on their day to day life and the national economy, as well as the sources of such energy. Leaving such matters entirely to the officials and the politicians to make all the decisions would only cause them to lament later on the hardships passed on to the consumers due to poor decisions, lacking in wisdom or vision for the future. It is increasingly evident that rampant corruption and deal making are in place as per comments made even by the Supreme Court from time to time as well as the findings of the Auditor General. The fact that no pressure is applied to follow up on these allegations and take action to bring the culprits to book, underscores both the lack of understanding and the apathy of the general public, that hitherto seem to believe they have no role to play.

As I was admiring a  skyscraper, I was jolted back to reality by a rickety old bus pulling up in front of it. Somehow, the blueprint to make Colombo world-class seems to have forgotten all about public transport

Colombo is a city in a hurry. New hotels, shopping malls and highways are mushrooming everywhere, and the skyline keeps growing upwards, promising to take us to a world-class future. I went to Galle Face and Port City recently to soak in the Global City in progress. As I was admiring a brightly-lit skyscraper, I was jolted back to reality by a rickety old bus pulling up in front of it. Somehow, the blueprint to make Colombo world-class seems to have forgotten all about public transport.

Despite widespread criticism especially by some media groups which obviously have some vested interests, President Ranil Wickremesinghe – giving steady leadership to the heavily divided Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) government – is making  steady progress in pulling Sri Lanka out of its worst ever economic and debt crisis. These moves come in an election year but some critics are alleging that the President might try to put off the elections by changing the Executive Presidential system of government. While these areas are important, the politicians and the people need to focus on areas, which have long-term consequences and add beauty to this paradise island. One such area is wildlife, though most people do not have direct interests or connections with it.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Treasury bill yields fell across maturities at Wednesday’s auction with all 135 billion rupees of bills sold, data from the state debt office showed.

The 3-month yield fell 117 basis points to 9.79 percent with 30 billion rupees in bills offered and 38.35 billion sold.

The 6-month yield fell 121 basis points to 9.86 percent with 45 billion rupees in bills offered 48 billion sold.

The 12-month yield fell 71 basis points to 10.02 percent, with 60 billion rupees of bills offered and 48 billion rupees sold.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has been selling down its Treasury bill stock to build forex reserves in recent months while fiscal corrections have helped moderate borrowings.

The central bank after selling bills outright at auctions is injecting money overnight and through term reverse repo auctions, in a policy that alters rupee reserves in individual banks and possibly encouraging them to overtrade, analysts say.

*2024-02-14 18:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-house-builders-should-look-for-the-sun-sea-officials-150867/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lankans building their new home should focus on the direction of the sun, and not just auspicious directions, officials at a Sectoral Oversight Committee on Energy have said.

Many Sri Lankans consult astrologers and mystics before building anything new, who advise on which direction a building must not face (ma-ru si-ti-na di-sha-va).

But house owners should also focus on the direction of the sun (hi-ru si-ti-na di-sha-va), officials of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) said.

“When building, constructors should consider a place to install solar panels in a new house,” a statement by the Department of Government Information quoted the officials as saying.

The officials pointed out that although people are concerned about the ‘direction of death’ based on occult science, they are not concerned about the direction of the sun. This has become a problem in the installation of solar panels, they said.
