*2024-08-12 16:29:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101181/greek-wildfire-spreads-to-edge-of-athens-towns-hospitals-evacuated) · `en`

A fast-moving wildfire fuelled by gale-force winds spread to the edge of Athens on Monday, torching trees, houses and cars and forcing evacuations of several hospitals and a dozen towns and villages, Greek authorities said.

Wildfires fanned by extreme heat have also raged this month in parts of Spain and the Balkans.

More than 670 firefighters backed by volunteers, 183 fire engines, 32 waterbombing planes and helicopters battled the latest wildfire that broke out at 3 p.m. (midday GMT) on Sunday near Varnavas 35 km (20 miles) north of the capital.

By Monday the conflagration, the worst in Greece this year, had advanced to the village of Grammatiko, the seaside municipality of Nea Makri and the fringes of Athens’ densely populated northern suburbs at the heavily wooded Mount Penteli.

### The Jayewardene tradition from the JR Jayewardene Felicitation Volume of 1978

I accede gladly to the request of the compilers of this volume on J. R. Jayawardene to write something about the Jayawardene Tradition, for I belong to a dwindling number who knew his distinguished father and uncles and have read about his earlier forbears.

Anyone familiar with the history of Sri Lanka must recognize the fact that even after foreign domination, the leadership, whether in government, politics or professional life, has come mainly from a leisured and enlightened minority. The spread of education and changes in income levels have to some extent modified the pattern but not eradicated it.

### Ukraine and Russia trade accusations over fire at occupied nuclear plant

Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of starting a fire on the grounds of Europe’s largest and now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Sunday, with both sides reporting no sign of elevated radiation.

The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog, which has a presence at the vast six-reactor facility, said its experts had seen strong, dark smoke coming from the northern area of the plant in southern Ukraine following multiple explosions.

“These reckless attacks endanger nuclear safety at the plant and increase the risk of a nuclear accident. They must stop now,” IAEA chief Rafael Grossi warned in a separate statement, without attributing blame for the attack.

The fire comes less than a week after Ukraine’s forces launched their largest incursion into Russian territory since the war-start in 2022, a surprise move that has brought conflict into a new phase, after weeks of Moscow’s battlefield gains.

### Sri Lanka to pay Rs6,000 to state pensioners in October after EC opposition

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s state pensioners will be paid 6,000 rupees in October after an increase of 3,000 rupees from September was shot down by the Elections Commissions, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

The cabinet decided to pay the 3,000 rupee allowance to 700,000 pensioners effective September.

But the elections commission opposed it as an election was declared, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

As a result, a 6,000 rupee payment would be made with arrears in October. From November 3,000 rupees would be added to the pension, he said.

Earlier this year a 2,500 rupee allowance was given to pensioners.

Unlike unemployed graduates who are hired without actual vacancies, many of Sri Lanka’s current pensioners were in government service working for small salaries.

In the 1980s and early 1990s when the central bank and macro-economists busted the currency incessantly without a credible anchor for money, they got very low real wages.
