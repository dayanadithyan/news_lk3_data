### Red herrings, referendums, poverty and postponing elections

Even though an election has not been officially announced by the Commissioner of Elections, election fever has hit our political parties. The Secretary of the United National Party (UNP) suggested a possible postponement of elections. Was he drawing a red herring to test the political waters?

The ordinary man on the street though, has not been drawn into this conversation. They are looking for ways and means to keep the wolf from the door. But this does not mean they are disinterested.

On 29 May, nearly all news media carried the pathetic tale of a mother of four living in Padaviya, having had electricity and water supply to her house being disconnected. Four months ago her husband-the sole breadwinner of the family died in a tragic accident. She has been unable to make ends meet since then.

The youngest child is 40 days old! The two elder children study in the fourth and second grades at their school, while the third child is a two-year-old.

### Referendum to extend President’s term: Is it ploy to avoid election defeat?

*2024-06-01 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Referendum-to-extend-Presidents-term-Is-it-ploy-to-avoid-election-defeat/172-283853) · `en`

It is undoubtedly election phobia of the United National Party (UNP) headed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe that prompted Palitha Range Bandara, the General Secretary of the Party to suggest on Tuesday to hold a referendum to extend the term of the President and Parliament for two more years.

“This is the best option at this moment to save the nation. The Government has reached agreements with the IMF, World Bank and other donors on economic reforms and it is essential to extend the terms of the President and Parliament to make this exercise a success,” Range Bandara told the media.

Although Wickremesinghe and several other UNP leaders have disowned their General Secretary’s statement, the general perception is that this is not his personal opinion but a collective decision of the top most few inner circle leaders of the party to test the waters – to feel the response of the people and the Opposition.

When some UNP seniors and party office-bearers met to discuss the situation  Range Bandara in his capacity as Gen Secy was also present. Some of those present began to criticise Range and blame him  for bringing the Government into disrepute. Ranil Wickremesinghe however intervened  and put a stop to “Bandara baiting”

Even though Range Bandara’s proposal was his personal point of view and only a suggestion, it was not perceived as such. Sections of the media and social media along with Opposition political parties treated it as an official Government announcement

The essence of what Palitha Range Bandara proposed was this -. Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the country’s leadership at a time of a great economic crisis

Yes, it came to an end 15 years ago with the LTTE proscribed in 33 countries as a “terrorist organisation” including in Canada, was completely annihilated.

Four Sri Lankans were arrested on Monday, 20 May 2024 at the Ahmadabad Airport in India for smuggling of gold and drugs.

According to Daily Mirror of 23 May 2024 Sri Lanka’s state intelligence has asked for further information from India’s state intelligence to verify the background of these alleged suspects, as well as to probe if they are actually linked to the ISIS network.

Thus so far there was no report of their involvement in any organisation promoting violence. One should not forget the government in power in India is extremely hostile to Muslims. They demonise and unleash violence against Muslims. On the other hand it is ridiculous to state that they went to India to commit crime for a mere Rs. 100,000 each.

### Extreme Asian heat spurs LNG demand ahead of summer months

*2024-05-31 19:26:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99569/extreme-asian-heat-spurs-lng-demand-ahead-of-summer-months) · `en`

Extreme temperatures across Asia are driving up liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand in the region as importers seek cargoes ahead of summer, with imports in South Asia hitting records.

This could tighten available supply and further lift Asian spot prices that have already gained a third since April, with heatwaves across South and Southeast Asia boosting air-conditioner use and other cooling demand. Prices are now at a near six-month peak at $12 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) and are expected to remain elevated.

“Spot prices are now driven by Asian demand. Temperatures in South Asia are rising due to a heatwave, increasing power demand,” said Siamak Adibi, principal consultant at energy consultancy FGE.

While China may still see lower demand compared with its record breaking shipments in 2021, demand from India and the rest of Asia has compensated for any drop-off, Adibi said.

### Sri Lanka renewables, power lines without tender to be legalized in new law: IESL

ECONOMYNEXT – Procurement of renewable energy as well as transmission lines without competitive tenders will be legalized in a planned electricity reform law, the Institution of Engineers of Sri Lanka has warned.

“Despite declaring the objects of the proposed Act to be “allowing open competitive procurement of new generation capacity including renewable energy”, the body of this Act states the complete opposite,” the IESL said.

“The present practice of procuring renewable energy projects at higher prices through negotiated deals and at feed-in-tariffs that never decrease, has been further strengthened by incorporating it into the main electricity legislation in the country, when most countries have given up such practices long ago to make way for competition.

“The proposed Act does not have clauses that bring any relief to Sri Lanka’s electricity customer, burdened with prices almost double that of competitor countries in the region.
