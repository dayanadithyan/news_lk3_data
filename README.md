Colombo, March 25 (Daily Mirror) - The first ever Solar Tunnel Dryer technology, which was introduced to dry grain seeds including maize, paddy, green gram, cow peas, sesame, finger millet and black seed was successful, the Agriculture Ministry said.

This new solar-powered system was inaugurated recently at Nelukkulam in Vavuniya, and the new seed drying system was inaugurated by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.

The entire warehouse is covered with glass so that natural sunlight and solar radiation are continuously available. Even at night, the optimum temperature required for drying the seeds can be obtained by using solar energy without any cost. Under this method, the seeds are completely protected from solar ultraviolet rays.

Addressing the event, Director of the Agriculture Sector Modernization Project, Dr. Rohan Wijekoon said the Solar Tunnel Dryer technology is being introduced to Sri Lanka for the first time, and the experiments have been 100 percent successful so far.

*2024-03-25 10:22:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-should-not-give-standing-facilities-as-lender-of-first-resort-155924/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s recent removal of counterparty limits for access to central banks’ printed money as a standing facility is a mistake which will make banks overtrade and contribute to monetary and financial instability in the future.

Standing facilities should be the last among lender of last resort facilities.

Essentially, standing facilities, term or permanent injections allow banks to lend without deposits, and trigger forex shortages in a soft-peg or flexible exchange rate.

The UK has a standing facility that prints money at 0.25 percent above the policy rate.

On September 6, 2023, the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights castigated Sri Lanka saying that the country suffers from a continuing accountability deficit- be it for war crime atrocities, more recent human rights violations, corruption, or abuse of power- which must be addressed for the country to move forward.

In Sri Lanka’s near three decade-long civil war, around 40,000 Tamil civilians reportedly died of military attacks. Thousands of others were wounded, while some were critical. Women suffered the most, and it is alleged that rape was used as a weapon of war.

Hundreds of Sinhalese civilians too were killed by armed Tamil militant groups -mainly the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)- during the course of the three decade-long war.

Since the civil war ended, there has been no credible government mechanism set up to apprehend these different merchants of death.

### A time to remember: the therapeutic power of emotion recollected in not-quite tranquillity

*2024-03-25 02:23:42* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-time-to-remember-the-therapeutic-power-of-emotion-recollected-in-not-quite-tranquillity/4-759891) · `en`

Beaten, broken and bruised: but carrying on with courage and compassion ‘beyond checkpoints’

In a nation notorious for not remembering many matters of importance beyond the news cycle, remembering right becomes a sacred trust and duty. Sri Lanka has faced many challenges as a country and a people in its chequered history since independence, and forgetfulness must not be added to its woes.

Thus a poignant memoir of episodes still not out of mind comes as a welcome reminder that once upon a time in our erstwhile island paradise, there was ‘something rotten in the state’. It was not a people, political party or government, or even a separatist movement that escalated into terrorism, which were solely to blame for the phenomenon we ironically recall as a ‘civil war’.

### Citizens should be aware of the burden of total Government expenditure

Higher the Government expenditure, greater the burden being borne by people

It is the total Government expenditure that should worry citizens instead of the mere tax payments. The total expenditure of the Government, known as gross government expenditure, is made up of the recurrent or consumption expenditure, expenditure incurred for building the country’s capital stock, and money used for repaying the maturing Government debt. Financing that expenditure, whether it is done through taxes, borrowings, or money printing, or a combination of all the three, is a burden to the people. Taxes force them to bear the burden today, borrowings tomorrow, and inflation today as well as the future

“We wanted them to come with an audit report and they thought it was too expensive, because they weren’t sure the product would be brought into the market or not. So, we haven’t had any party graduating from sandbox,” Wimalasuriya said while speaking at BankTech Asia 2024: Colombo Series last week.

The CB unveiled the regulatory sandbox to run innovative fintech experiments which can be released to the market after testing and gaining approval.

Russia struck critical infrastructure in Ukraine’s western region of Lviv with missiles early on Sunday, Kyiv said, in a major airstrike that saw one Russian cruise missile briefly fly into Polish airspace according to Warsaw.

Moscow launched 57 missiles and drones in the attack that also targeted the capital Kyiv, two days after the largest aerial bombardment of Ukraine’s energy system in more than two years of full-scale war, Kyiv said.

“There were two preliminary hits on the same critical infrastructure facility that the occupiers targeted at night,” Lviv’s regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

The strike used Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, which are harder to shoot down, he added, without identifying the facility.

The energy ministry said equipment caught fire when a critical energy facility in the Lviv region was attacked, causing it to lose power. It was unclear if they were talking about the same facility.
