### Do not tell the companies to leave the gardens because of the salary - Mano Ganesan

If President Ranil Wickremesinghe has not been able to pay the salary announced on the May Day platform, he must take an alternative action as the head of state.. The Minister of Labor, who declared the Gazette, should take action. The government in the state should stop the sports of friends in the state, the fireworks exploding and the pongal rice.. If we ask for our cooperation in this regard, we will consider it positively.

But I warmly tell the mountain friends in the state not to present the slogan, "Gardens should be handed over to the government and go to the companies". If the company goes to the company and the government takes responsibility for the land, they will be divided to their supporters. This is how the people of the government and the government of the government today have been issued without listening and our people who lived there are in the middle of the country.

MOSCOW, May 7 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin was sworn in for a new six-year term on Tuesday at a Kremlin ceremony that was boycotted by the United States and a number of other Western countries due to Russia's war in Ukraine.

Putin, in power as president or prime minister since 1999, begins his new mandate more than two years after he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, where Russian forces have regained the initiative after a series of reversals and are seeking to advance further in the east.

At 71, Putin dominates the domestic political landscape. On the international stage, he is locked in a confrontation with Western countries he accuses of using Ukraine as a vehicle to try to defeat and dismember Russia.

"For Russia, this is the continuation of our path, this is stability – you can ask any citizen on the street," Sergei Chemezov, a close Putin ally, told Reuters before the ceremony.
