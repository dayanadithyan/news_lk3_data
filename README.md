Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has suspended public duties to “stop and reflect” on whether to remain in the job, after a court opened a preliminary inquiry into his wife.

In a statement, the Spanish leader said he urgently needed to decide “whether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour”.

The court said it was responding to corruption claims against Begoña Gómez.

Mr Sánchez said his wife would defend her honour and work with the judiciary.

The complaint against Begoña Gómez was raised by anti-corruption campaigners Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), who have taken part in a number of high-profile court cases in recent years and are led by a man linked to the far right.

The Spanish prime minister said he would make a decision on his future before the media on Monday 29 April, after reflecting whether it was worth remaining in office “despite the mud” that the right and far right were trying to turn politics into.
