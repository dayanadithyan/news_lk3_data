The presidential candidate of the ‘Samagi Jana Sandhanaya’, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa reiterated his stance of amending Sri Lanka’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) following his election to the Office of the President, citing that the existing agreement does not focus on economic growth.

Addressing the National Visionary Summit in Colombo, organized by the National Council of Professionals, the Opposition Leader expressed his view that a government should not only focus on debt sustainability, adding that attention is also needed to be paid to other areas including trade.

Commenting further, Premadasa stated that a mere 3.1% economic growth by 2029, which is agreed by the IMF and the Sri Lankan Government is insufficient, highlighting that debt sustainability cannot be the sole focus.

“We must align our economy towards growth, not just growth, but tradable growth. It is a must to ensure that we achieve shared prosperity”, he added.

### Sri Lanka’s top court orders election commission to hold local govt polls

*2024-08-22 12:52:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-top-court-orders-election-commission-to-hold-local-govt-polls-177723/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT — The fundamental rights of voters have been violated through the postponement of the 2023 local government elections, the Supreme Court has said, ordering the election commission to hold the postponed election immediately.

Media reports said the apex court had ruled that the Minister of Finance and members of the election commission have violated the voters’ fundamental rights in delaying the election.

The verdict was issued upon hearing petitions  filed by several parties including the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), the leftist National Peoples’ Power (NPP) and the People’s Action for Free & Fair Elections (PAFFREL).

The election commission had originally scheduled the local government polls for March 9, 2023, but postponed them to April 25, 2023. The elections were not held, however, citing a lack of funds due to the country’s ongoing recovery from the worst financial crisis in decades. (Colombo/Aug22/2024)

The helicopter crash in which Iran’s late President Ebrahim Raisi was killed in May was caused by weather conditions and the aircraft’s inability to handle the weight it was carrying, Iran’s semi-official news agency reported on Wednesday (Aug 21), citing a security source informed of the final investigation results.

The communications centre of the Armed Forces General Staff, responsible for publishing information on the crash investigation, said the report was “completely false”, state media reported.

A preliminary report by Iran’s military had said in May that no evidence of foul play or an attack had been found during the investigation.

“The investigation in the case of Ayatollah Raisi’s helicopter crash have been completed ... there is complete certainty that what happened was an accident,” the security source, who was not named, told Fars.
