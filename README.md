### Asian Series Rout Championship: 4 x 400m for men. Gold to Sri Lanka in the series

*2024-05-21 20:10:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184173) · `ta`

In the inaugural Asian Series Championship, Sri Lanka clinched the gold in the men's 4x400m event, clocking 3:04.48. The team consisted of Aruna Darshana, Hunger Lakshan Kodikara, Dinukka Deshan, and Kalinga Kumarake. Despite missing out on direct Olympic qualification, a win in future series could secure them a spot based on rankings. India took silver (3:05.76), and Vietnam bronze (3:07.37).

🟩

Sri Lankan team won the gold medal in the men's 4 x 400m series in the inaugural Asian series championship, which ended on Tuesday (21) in Bangladesh, Thailand.

Sri Lanka won the gold medal in India, Vietnam, Qatar, the Philippines, Thailand and Chinese Breasty.

The Sri Lankan team won the gold medal in the men's 4 x 400m race in 3 minutes and 04.48 seconds.

Aruna Darshana, Hunger Lakshan Kodikara, Dinukka Deshan and Kalinga Kumarake were featured in the Sri Lankan series.

However, it is disappointing that the Sri Lankan team missed the directory level for the direct Olympic qualification.

However, if the Sri Lankan team wins the next series of matches, it is believed that the Sri Lankan series will be able to participate in the Olympics based on international rankings.

India (3: 05.76) won the silver medal and Vietnam (3: 07.37) won the bronze medal.

### Matheesha Pathirana becomes most expensive player in LPL history

*2024-05-21 19:24:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99365/matheesha-pathirana-becomes-most-expensive-player-in-lpl-history) · `en`

Young Sri Lankan fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana became the most expensive player ever in a Lanka Premier League (LPL) auction Tuesday when he was grabbed by Colombo Strikers for a record $120,000.

The 21-year-old – who has an unorthodox slinging delivery style – broke the $92,000 mark set by Dilshan Madushanka in last year’s edition of the T20 tournament.

Colombo Strikers bought Pathirana after matching Galle Marvels’ bid with their Right To Match option.

In an interesting turn of events, the Dambulla franchise began the bidding at USD 70,000 after Matheesha Pahitrana entered the bidding at his base price of USD 50,000.

However, Galle Marvels raised the stakes and took it to USD 100,000 straightaway. To avoid retention from Colombo Srikers, Galle even increased their own bid to USD 120,000 but their effort went in vain.

### The president's inherent involvement is essential for reconciliation

*2024-05-21 12:45:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184129) · `ta`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe aims to resolve Sri Lanka's economic crisis and address ethnic issues, promising self-governance and economic reforms. His policies, including tax relief and privatization, face opposition but could secure his reelection. Despite commitments to reconciliation, recent police actions against Tamil memorials and student protests indicate ongoing tensions rather than progress towards peace. International scrutiny, including calls for apologies and investigations into human rights abuses, further complicates the situation. Wickremesinghe's tenure ends with unresolved questions about his ability to lead Sri Lanka towards lasting reconciliation and economic stability.

🟩

Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that he was elected as the president and that Sri Lanka was to restore Sri Lanka from its economic crisis and that he would work for the self -government to fulfill that obligation.. Thus, before the economic success, there were great speculations about the President's objectives on holding the presidential election.

Through his commitment to the president's faith in resolving the economic crisis, the truth of his claims can be found in the vigilant and unwavering economic policies of the people.. The president is relaxing in the imposition of high taxes beyond the limits of the people and the privatization of state institutions that are strongly opposed by most employees.

Both policies are so influential that he can be re -elected president in the upcoming presidential election.. But he stands firmly in them with great confidence.
