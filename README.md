ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lankans building their new home should focus on the direction of the sun, and not just auspicious directions, officials at a Sectoral Oversight Committee on Energy have said.

Many Sri Lankans consult astrologers and mystics before building anything new, who advise on which direction a building must not face (ma-ru si-ti-na di-sha-va).

But house owners should also focus on the direction of the sun (hi-ru si-ti-na di-sha-va), officials of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) said.

“When building, constructors should consider a place to install solar panels in a new house,” a statement by the Department of Government Information quoted the officials as saying.

The officials pointed out that although people are concerned about the ‘direction of death’ based on occult science, they are not concerned about the direction of the sun. This has become a problem in the installation of solar panels, they said.

The strike, which commenced from 6.30 a.m. yesterday (13) was launched following unsuccessful discussions with officials from the Finance Ministry.

But the Free Democrats parliamentary group spokesman for Mittelstand (Small and Medium Enterprises) and Free Trade, Carl- Julius Cronenberg would like to see a softer approach in the implementation of the Act. Pointing out that India’s small and medium enterprises are not yet geared to meet such standards, he is of the view that the German legislation could be improved.
