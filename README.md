### Political accounts in the presidential election

*2024-04-16 01:48:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181186) ¬∑ `ta`

Minority parties, including Tamil, Muslim, and Upcountry groups, are negotiating political deals for influence, focusing on parliamentary victories and ministerial positions. Douglas Devananda, a key figure in the North, supports Ranil, influenced by past support from the TNA and his desire for autonomy. Ranil's potential support from SKK members and the All Ceylon People's Congress could secure his position in the UNP. Despite this, the UNP's chances in parliamentary elections are slim, leading to a strategic shift. Ranil is firm in the Vanni district, potentially leaving the PA for the UNP, with no immediate crisis for the UNP in Vanni. The Eastern Province's support for Ranil is also noted, with plans for ministry status in future elections. Other parties, including the Ceylon Workers Congress and the Tamil Progressive Alliance, have their positions, with the latter supporting Sajith. The Tamil National People's Front (TNA) plans to boycott the presidential election in the North and East, highlighting the complexity of uniting Tamil parties.

üü©

The minority nationals, the Tamil, Muslim and Upcountry parties, have put political accounts for bargains in accordance with their influence, like the political account centered on the main candidates of Ranil, Sajith and Anura.

In particular, all these parties make a final resolution, focusing on their victories in the parliamentary election, and the ministry and the ministry of the Ministry of State.

In that respect, Douglas Devananda in the North took a decision to support Ranil before the political parties or individuals in the country decided.. There are two reasons for this.

The first reason was during the 2015 regime change, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) supported the Ranil Federation. Even if Ranil wanted to incorporate Douglas, the federation did not allow it.

Even if the federation is currently in action, its membership parties are still in operation;Douglas may have thought it was appropriate to announce resolutions before such conditions occur.

SJB leader shares his vision at National Conference and Policy Dialogue Forum of the Samagi Buddhi Mandapaya featuring host of professionals who highlighted scientific and practical policies to rebuild Sri Lanka

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader and Presidential hopeful Sajith Premadasa on 7 April took the stage at the SJB National Conference with a clear message for the audience: ‚ÄúHe stands apart from other politicians in Sri Lanka today.‚Äù

In fact, while the event was organised to outline the party‚Äôs future policies, Premadasa in his speech made a concerted effort to distinguish himself from the current political system and issued a clarion call for the rejection of politicians he labelled as ‚Äúclassists, communists, and extremists.‚Äù

Though he failed to explicitly name these ‚Äúclassists, communists, and extremists,‚Äù Premadasa asserted that these groups are incapable of delivering the essential economic and social reforms the country desperately needs.

### Is the Indian Ocean ‚ÄúZone of Peace‚Äù sinking in troubled waters?

UNITED NATIONS (IDN) ‚Äì Just after a group of mercenaries tried to unsuccessfully oust the government of Maldives in 1979, I asked a Maldivian diplomat, using a military jargon, about the strength of his country‚Äôs ‚Äústanding army.‚Äù

‚ÄúStanding army?‚Äù, the UN diplomat asked with mock surprise, and remarked perhaps jokingly, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even have a sitting army.‚Äù

With a population of about 250,000, in a bygone era, (currently over 500,000), the Maldives was perhaps one of the world‚Äôs few countries, along with Costa Rica, with no armed forces, fighter planes, combat helicopters, warships, missiles or battle tanks.

As a result, the island‚Äôs fragile defences attracted a rash of free-lance mercenaries and bounty hunters who tried to take over the country twice-- once in 1979, and a second time in 1988.

Interestingly, both conflicts involved a female member of the Bandaranaike family and a person by the name of Maithripala ‚Äì the first tussle was between Sirimavo Bandaranaike and a former minister Maithripala Senanayake and the second between former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Maithripala Sirisena.

### Debate Over Profits Of Banks: Who Shares Them Ultimately? ‚Äì Part II

A reader of the Part I of this article has brought to my notice that banks should make profits, in addition to the reasons mentioned earlier, to support them when they are financially insolvent.

This argument has validity in the current legal context in Sri Lanka. It is the accepted policy of the Parliamentarians in Sri Lanka, as revealed in the new Central Bank Act and the Banking (Special Provisions) Act that when banks get into insolvency, they should not be rescued through printing of new money by the Central Bank. Section 6 of the Central Bank Act has stipulated that the primary objective of the bank is to achieve and maintain ‚Äòdomestic price stability‚Äô and ‚Äòthe other objective‚Äô shall be to secure ‚Äòfinancial system stability‚Äô.

### Adani Green‚Äôs Khavda power plant world‚Äôs largest, 5 times the size of Paris

A narrow airstrip that doesn‚Äôt even have an air traffic controller to guide incoming airplanes and whose only infrastructure is a portable toilet and a make-shift office in a container in the midst of miles of barren land bordering Pakistan is an unlikely gateway to the world‚Äôs largest renewable energy park.

The airstrip was even smaller in December 2022, when Adani Group Head Gautam Adani, who was then the second richest person in the world, first used a small aircraft to reach the barren area that didn‚Äôt even have a pin code and got its name from a village 80-kilometers away.

The land hardly had any vegetation due to its highly saline soil, leave alone any habitation. But Gautam Adani and his executives saw the potential that the area had.

An 18-km drive from the airstrip through dusty arid land is the site for his group‚Äôs Khavda renewable energy park spread over 538 square kilometres (roughly five times the size of Paris).

Needless to be worried about the country's foreign stockpile. We are gradually increasing our stockpile, our stockpile for the central bank was in the fungus. We are currently increasing $ 5 billion. It is possible to do this with a massive commitment. As well as the shortage of materials in large numbers. It is currently being controlled.

Due to inflation the cost of goods increased massively. The cost of increased goods has been reduced to somewhat. Inflation is also controlled. The shortage of essential commodities especially. Unrest in the country came from the country due to the increase in prices. But that condition is currently restricted.

### Debate over profits of banks: Who shares them ultimately? ‚Äì Part II

The largest recipient of the gross income of banks happens to be depositors and creditors who have invested in the debentures issued by banks

The actual distribution of banks‚Äô income shows that the major beneficiaries have been not the shareholders, but depositors, employees, other service providers, delinquent customers, and the government. All these categories together account for about 90% of banks‚Äô income and only about 10% is left for shareholders. Hence, the wide-spread belief that banks fatten themselves at the expense of customers is not supported by evidence

A reader of the Part I of this article (available at: https://www.ft.lk/columns/Debate-over-profits-of-banks-Who-shares-them-ultimately/4-760400) has brought to my notice that banks should make profits, in addition to the reasons mentioned earlier, to support them when they are financially insolvent.

We just witnessed Avurudu this year. Having been plagued by a planetary pandemic, the multi-faceted economic crisis intensified in creating chaos. At least a ray of hope for an economic recovery comes with a cautious optimism. In such a context, Avurudu can be seen as an invitation for awakening, individually as well as interactively. Let us discuss it further.

Avurudu invites us to awaken ourselves. Typically, it is the time to rejoice, relax, reflect, and reinforce. Celebrating as Sinhalese and Tamils alike is the central key. Collaboration, consensus, and connectivity are all coveted concepts associated with Avurudu. Cheerful, optimistic and an open mindset can be a good starting point. I know, it became challenging with COVID19-home-locked experience. Now, it appears to be more challenging amidst economics woes.

Talks were on hold for now after the International Monetary Fund indicated that the deal would not fit its debt sustainability parameters, which set out how much debt it thinks a country can afford, the government said in a statement.

Ghana had been in formal talks with two groups holding its international bonds since March 16 - one ‚Äúinternational‚Äù group of Western asset managers and hedge funds and another one including regional African banks.

The regional African bondholder group had also rejected part of the proposed rework, including an option to retain the original value of the bonds with a longer maturity and lower coupon.
