### Unveiling the dark reality: Sri Lanka’s deepening drug crisis

*2024-04-28 06:53:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/unveiling-the-dark-reality-sri-lankas-deepening-drug-crisis/) · `en`

Robert Frost once wrote, ‘Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.’ It’s a place like Hotel California in the popular Eagles song by that name — you can check out any time you like but you can never leave.

It’s all about family. The prodigal son or daughter can return. And when they do, other residents cannot pack their bags and leave, however distasteful the returnee has turned out to be or the returning is.

And even if they are far away, ‘family’ remains, in our thoughts and in our hearts, whether they are ‘prodigal’ or not. Indeed, while there are degrees of prodigality or extravagant behaviour that displease friends and relatives, few things can make people grieve as extreme addiction to narcotics and alcohol. It is a ‘family matter’ unlike anything else. It is in fact a household matter wherever the addict may reside.

### Sri Lanka’s Political Landscape: Navigating A Tripartite Contest

As Sri Lanka braces itself for a pivotal presidential election, the specter of a tripartite contest looms large, promising both challenges and opportunities for the nation’s political future. Against a backdrop of delayed and cancelled elections, disillusionment with traditional political parties, and socioeconomic turmoil exacerbated by the global pandemic, the stage is set for a seismic shift in the country’s power dynamics.

The protracted postponements of provincial and local government elections have fuelled public frustration and eroded trust in the democratic process. The vacuum created by these delays has allowed incumbents to wield disproportionate influence, exploiting executive powers for personal gain and partisan advantage. The unchecked exercise of authority by appointed governors and the manipulation of electoral timelines have further eroded the foundations of democratic governance.
