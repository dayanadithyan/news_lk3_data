ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank staff could continue to get high salaries for up to five years, and not three years as set out in a collective agreement, a committee that went into the matter after a public outcry has recommended, a legislator said.

A panel that went into the salary hike that the central bank staff had paid themselves had criticized the salary hike and a defined benefit pension plan, but said changing it would lead to legal problems, Chairman of the Committee of Public Enterprises, Harsha de Silva said.

The Committee had said it was wrong to apply the same salaries to office assistants and management assistants as senior officers in ‘mission critical’ roles.

The office assistants and management assistants should be given the same salaries as the rest of the government.

The panel has said that individuals should be given increments on a ‘meritocracy’.

There was a recommendation that a human resources manager be appointed to carry out a study in 2025 and changes made.

### A System Change

*2024-06-19 10:28:47* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/a-system-change/) · `en`

It was the principle slogan of the Aragalaya that there was a need for a System Change. The dominant theme and cry was for “Political Change” from the prevailing one, which after 75 years of operation, has failed. What then is the kind of change that was wanted? There may be many examples of changes that may occur to any who ponder this issue. The strident cry was “Chase out all 225.” Nothing could be clearer than that. The political establishment reacted with brutality. First, from “Temple Trees” and then from the newly installed Presidency, barely hours after Mr Wickremasinghe took over.

Several institutions, conventions and practices demand critical review. Mere cosmetic changes will no longer suffice, and radical changes are emphatically needed. We describe ourselves as a “Democratic, Socialist Republic.” Are we so?

Abraham Lincoln’s definition of Democracy as the “Rule of the people, by the people for the people,” I regarded as the bedrock of democracy.

This is a kind reminder for us in the industry to start getting ready now itself, and start negotiating with banks

We know very well that for the last four years the construction industry has been suffering due to delayed/non-payments, stoppage of projects, high interest rates, etc. So, many of us perished. Banks and contractors became enemies, with banks making extreme decisions such as seizing assets, with no relief. Parate became a very attractive idea for us.

However, the GoSL and Central Bank directed banks to provide relief to industries like construction, leisure and agriculture and become flexible. So banks established separate units specifically for restructuring non-performing loans (NPL) because banks were also suffering from abnormal NPLs, which threatened their stability. Thus under the Central Bank guidance, many banks made case-by-case analyses and restructured NPLs.

CDA Chairman Prof. Roshan Perera citing an analysis of current market conditions, stated that there have been no recent tax increases on imported coconut oil.

He revealed that as of May this year, 42,000 tons of coconut oil have been imported into Sri Lanka, marking a twofold increase compared to the previous year.

The announcement follows public outcry and claims from various consumer and industry groups about the unfair rise in coconut oil prices, which has contributed to the soaring cost of living.
