The Colombo Consumer Price Index fell 0.5 index points to 194.7 points in the month of July. The index is now slightly below the level seen in December 2023.

The central bank has generally kept the exchange rate stable, while collecting reserves and reducing its domestic assets to run deflationary policy. Exchange rate became volatile after a build up excess liquidity from dollar purchases in June.

The food and non-alcoholic beverage sub-index rose 0.1 percent in July after rising 2.8 percent a month earlier. The housing and electricity index fell 1.5 percent to 142.9 points.

Exchange rate stability has also boosted profits of the Ceylon Electricity Board and allowed it to cut rates.

Senior lawyers argue that the President's power to appoint the Inspector General of Police, as per the Constitution, doesn't breach election rules. Amidst controversy over the appointment process, especially concerning the interim High Court judge serving as the Police Chief, President Ranil Wickremesinghe clarified his stance. The Elections Commission can request police services from either the Inspector General or the Senior Deputy Inspector General during the election period, raising questions about the President's involvement. Despite this, Aamir Fais, an Election Commissioner, assures that the President's constitutional duty to appoint the Inspector General does not contravene election laws.

"Usually a meal is mainly intended to withstand disease, nutrition and disease. We calls drugs that heal diseases. Food cannot treat sickness. If anyone can heal any disease, you must really have permission from the main food authority. We see the names of various institutions, especially social media, especially the food is good for cancer. That propaganda often is wrong. A meal cannot be advertised that you can often heal a disease. If so, formal clinical data should be submitted to the Ministry of Health Ministry authority. It is illegal to do that. "

### Supreme Court interim ruling only a direction given to President

*2024-08-01 02:12:43* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Supreme-Court-interim-ruling-only-a-direction-given-to-President/4-764992) ┬╖ `en`

The recent Supreme Court interim ruling has two components. On the first, that is restraining Deshabandu from тАЬthe powers, functions and responsibilitiesтАЭ of the office of IGP, the interim order is broad and straightforward.

The second pertains to the appointment of a suitable officer to act in the office of IGP. The SC ruling states: тАЬ...His Excellency the President may, should he wish to, consider making appointment, in terms of the law, of a suitable person to act in the post of IGP for the duration of the afore-stated interim order.тАЭ

Strictly speaking, this is only a direction given to the President, respecting the legal provisions under which he has the power to make acting appointment. In effect, it suggests to him that he may, if he wants to, consider making an acting appointment, in terms of the law.

It has been made clear that the President is in no mood to consider this direction of the Supreme Court, to go by the special statement made by the PM in Parliament today.

тАЬтАжIn short, the global democratic trend this year is a resounding rejection of the status quo.тАЭ

тАУ тАШA Global Movement Against The Status QuoтАЩ By Ian Bremmer, TIME, 5 Aug. 2024┬атАУ

Given the global trend as summed-up by Ian Bremmer, one of the worldтАЩs best-known think-tank gurus, a win for incumbent Wickremesinghe is virtually unthinkable.

Given the decision by Mahinda RajapaksaтАЩs SLPP to fend-off WickremesingheтАЩs political piracy and field a candidate under the party banner, a Ranil win is logically impossible.

As PM in 2001-3, Ranil overstepped the mark and encroached on President KumaratungaтАЩs terrain. She tossed him out. As PM in 2015-2019, he did the same with President Sirisena, was turfed out, made a comeback thanks to the Supreme Court he now derides, and was evicted by the electorate.

Dr. Neelan TiruchelvamтАЩs legacy is one of profound intellectual and humanitarian impact, rooted in a steadfast commitment to nonviolence, human rights, and inclusive dialogue

The Sri Lankan civil war ended with a brutal and decisive Government victory in May 2009, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 40,000 Tamil civilians during the final stages of the conflict. If the LTTE and the Sri Lankan political parties had formed a consensus and worked to implement the constitutional reform proposals which Dr. Tiruchelvam helped formulate, the war likely could have ended much sooner, potentially saving countless lives

### A spotted affair: Has Sri Lanka over-promoted the iconic Sri Lankan leopard?

The Sri Lankan leopard тАУ тАШpanther pardus kotiyaтАЩ тАУ Pic by Srilal Miththapala

Of all the charismatic animals seen in Sri Lanka, there is none that has created so much interest and popularity, than the Sri Lankan leopard. And today it has become arguably one of the most sought-after tourist attractions in the country. But is the leopardтАЩs own popularity leading to its own destruction?

1 August is Sri Lanka Leopard Day, a day proposed by the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka in 2020 to celebrate our very own leopard sub species.

So this maybe an overtime moment to reflect on the problems that the Sri Lanka leopard is facing today.

The Sri Lankan leopard is a distinct subspecies тАУ тАШpanthera pardus kotiyaтАЩ (after Dr. Sriyanie Miththapala 1966). It is the only large carnivore found in Sri Lanka, and is therefore the apex predator in the wild, with no threats to it other than man.

With rough estimates suggesting fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining in the country, the conservation of this endemic subspecies has become increasingly vital.

### Understanding Sri Lanka presidentтАЩs lotus-shaped dilemma

ECONOMYNEXT тАФ On Monday July 29, the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) voted against backing President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the 2024 presidential election, opting instead to field its own candidate. The calculations that went into this decision are likely more complex than meets the eye and, given what is at stake, are worth discussing.

At the outset, it must be noted that in the absence of closely guarded inside information and scientifically sound polling data, any speculation on the outcome of a national election thatтАЩs still some time away has to necessarily involve reasoning built on publicly available information and a certain amount of guesswork. This analysis, therefore, attempts to work out the least unlikely rationale behind the SLPP politburoтАЩs decision and its possible implications, based on information already at hand.

### Hair Growth Mask Recipe

*2024-07-31 23:13:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/hair-growth-mask-recipe/) ┬╖ `en`

Although I still havenтАЩt finished with my Cucumber beauty tips, I thought IтАЩll tackle the hair growth problem this week and then go back to my Cucumber sceneтАжprobably next week.

You will need 01 medium-size onion (helps in stimulating hair follicles), a handful of curry leaves (promotes hair growth and strengthens hair roots), 02 tablespoons of coconut oil (moisturizes the scalp and adds shine), and the contents from 02 vitamin E capsules (nourishes hair follicles and promotes growth).

Heat the coconut oil in a pan, over low heat, and then add the chopped onion and curry leaves to the heated coconut oil.

Saut├й them together until the onions turn translucent and the curry leaves become crispy. This helps infuse their nutrients into the oil.

Strain the oil, using a fine sieve or cheesecloth, to separate the solid particles (onion and curry leaves) from the oil. You should be left with infused coconut oil.

Pierce the vitamin E capsules and squeeze out the oil into the strained mixture.
