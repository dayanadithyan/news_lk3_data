### Vietnamese tycoon accused in multi-billion dollar bank fraud faces possible death sentence

(BBC) ‚Äì It is the most spectacular trial ever held in Vietnam, befitting one of the greatest bank frauds the world has ever seen.

Behind the stately yellow portico of the colonial-era courthouse in Ho Chi Minh City, a 67-year-old property developer stands accused of looting one of Vietnam‚Äôs largest banks over a period of 11 years.

The numbers involved are dizzying. Truong My Lan is charged with taking out $44bn (¬£35bn) in loans from the Saigon Commercial Bank. Prosecutors say $27bn may never be recovered.

The habitually secretive communist authorities have been uncharacteristically forthright about this case, going into minute detail for the media. They say they have summoned 2,700 people to testify. There are 10 state prosecutors and around 200 lawyers involved.

The evidence is in 104 boxes weighing a total of six tonnes. Eighty-five defendants are on trial with Truong My Lan, who denies the charges. She and 13 others face a possible death sentence.

Jamuni Kamantha Thushara, Chairman of the Citizen‚Äôs Movement Against Fraud, Corruption, and Waste, who filed the complaint, told reporters on Wednesday April 11 that the deposit has been increased by 5,200 percent, which he claimed would give ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù political parties who can afford such exorbitant rates the upper hand.

Ismail Haniyeh‚Äôs sons are among the highest-profile figures to be killed in the war so far. Israel said they were Hamas operatives, and Haniyeh accused Israel of acting in ‚Äúthe spirit of revenge and murder.‚Äù

The deaths threaten to strain the internationally mediated ceasefire talks, which appeared to gain steam in recent days even as the sides remain far apart on key issues.

Gross official reserves went up by 431 million US dollars in March as debt was repaid from domestic savings.

A central bank is able to collect reserves when domestic credit is moderated by an appropriate interest rate (reducing domestic investments), and the rupees created by dollar purchases are mopped up by central bank securities sales to commercial banks.

The action constitutes a raising of ‚Äòdeposits‚Äô by the central bank (a note-issue bank) from the domestic economy and lending it to the US or other reserve currency nations to finance their deficits.

‚ÄúWe have met the enemy, and he is us‚Äù. Even as long ago as the Greek and Roman eras, playwrights have been engaging with the idea of tragicomedy, the dramatic coexistence of the two opposite elements in the human condition. ‚ÄúAll the world‚Äôs a stage, and all the men and women merely players‚Äù suggested the Bard; characters are inter-changeable, the dramatists introduced men as gods, slaves as masters, a trivializing portrait exemplifying the inherence of the two elements in the one moment, tragedy and comedy. The tragicomedy exaggerates and glorifies the trivial, the banal is presented as climacteric, a burlesque denying authenticity.

No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable.

‚ÄúThe difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones.‚Äù

It is showdown time. I borrowed the caption from the ‚ÄòThe Second Coming‚Äô by W.B. Yeats. Things fall apart and the centre cannot hold. Passionate intensity dictates debate.

The next election, Presidential or Parliamentary will be a ‚Äòhead-to-head‚Äô encounter between the ‚Äòdominant‚Äô and the ‚Äòdominated.‚Äô

Despite polls and engineered parades, the dismantling of the hegemony of the dominant class is not a certainty. Since hope is not optimism, I would say that it is a near certainty.

The Bastille will be breached. If not totally, substantially. 2024 is the year when people of Sri Lanka will prove Heraclitus right. ‚ÄúNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it‚Äôs not the same river and he‚Äôs not the same man.‚Äù

### Another withdrawn Gazette; controversy over auspicious times

*2024-04-11 04:23:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/another-withdrawn-gazette-controversy-over-auspicious-times/) ¬∑ `en`

One government matter done with speed is withdrawing printed gazettes, withdrawing meaning: gazettes are printed, distributed and called back. This is totally stupid and lacking in responsibility. A matter has to be considered, thoroughly debated, and a clear, unambiguous statement/rule decided on unanimously or on majority consent. Not in this fair isle!
