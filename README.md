Colombo, March 3 (Daily Mirror)- While highlighting that the Suwaseriya ambulance service is fighting for its survival, its founder Harsha de Silva said its employee should be given a salary increment as a priority.

"The CEO of Suwaseriya is fighting to save the ambulance service. Its employees can easily obtain visas from countries like Canada. A battle is being fought to save the ambulance service in such a scenario," he told a media briefing.

He said it was most unfair for the Central Bank officials to increase their own salaries when Suwaseriya employees have not received any increments despite working 24 hours of the day," he added.

Farmers in Sri Lanka, led by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, have significantly reduced the country's reliance on imported rice, saving over $600 million in 2023 and 2024. They've achieved this by increasing rice production, with a record harvest of 12,000 kg per hectare. The government is promoting Giri Samba cultivation, giving farmers control over rice prices.

üü©

Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera says farmers and foreign workers have been dedicated to reduce the value of the increased dollar rate.

The Minister said that the value of the dollar against the rupee in recent years has increased rapidly and the value of the dollar has declined somewhat.

By 2022, Sri Lanka was imported about 800,000 metric tonnes of rice, for which the government had to spend $ 300 million.

But not a single rice was imported in 2023, and in the two years 2023 and 2024, farmers in the country saved over $ 600 million.

In addition, in 2023 and 2024, the people of this country will consume domestic rice, not the imported rice, but that respect and pride must join the Sri Lankan farmers.

Representatives of some political groups that claim to be farmers' representatives are trying to disrupt agriculture by acting like farmers, but farmers are not caught up in this trap.

ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Reuters) - Pakistan's newly formed parliament elected Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday as prime minister for a second time, three weeks after uncertain national elections caused delays in the formation of a coalition government.

"Shehbaz Sharif is declared to have been elected the prime minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan," National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said, after announcing Sharif had secured 201 votes, above the required 169 votes in the house.

He beat Omar Ayub, the candidate backed by jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who secured 92 votes.

The declaration was met with loud protests from the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) party backed by Khan. The lawmakers called for Khan's release and shouted slogans alleging Sharif had come to power through electoral rigging.

The Feb. 8 election was marred by a mobile internet shutdown, arrests and violence in its build-up and the unusually delayed results triggered accusations that the vote was rigged.

Farmers and foreign employees made the most commitment to bring down the value of the increased dollar rate, Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.

He said the value of the dollar had increased rapidly against the rupee in recent times. By now, the value of the dollar has decreased to a certain extent, the Minister said.

In 2022, some 800,000 metric tons of rice was imported by Sri Lanka and the government had to spend USD 300 million for that.

But in 2023, not even a grain of rice was imported and in the two years 2023 and 2024, the farmers of this country have saved more than USD 600 million to the country.

Also, in 2023 as well as in 2024, the people of this country will consume local rice and not imported rice, and that respect and pride should go to the farmers of Sri Lanka.

### Sri Lanka seeks five-month hold on bondholder suit

(Bloomberg) -- Sri Lanka is seeking a five-month hold on a lawsuit filed by a bondholder over the country‚Äôs historic debt default, telling a New York federal judge that it wants more time to negotiate with private creditors.

The island nation was sued in July 2022 by Hamilton Reserve Bank Ltd., which sought full payment on more than $250 million of Sri Lanka‚Äôs dollar bond that was due that month. The bank says it holds more than 25% of the bonds, which would likely enable it to block any modification of the notes.

On Friday, Sri Lanka sought an extension of a delay of the lawsuit that was granted in November. Hamilton Reserve opposed the new request, saying that the country has kept the bank ‚Äúin the dark‚Äù about the negotiations despite repeated requests for information.

The island nation is prioritizing restructuring obligations to its private creditors as it seeks to fast-track a debt overhaul and exit a sovereign default, the foreign minister told Bloomberg last month.
