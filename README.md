Colombo, May 1 (Daily Mirror) - In a surprising move, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) leader Sajith Premadasa, in a meeting with a delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC), has offered to play a mediatory role between two Asian giants implying India and China, the Daily Mirror learns.

A source familiar with the meeting told Daily Mirror that Premadasa made such an offer during the discussion between his party and the CPC delegation that visited Sri Lanka recently.

However, the CPC is reported to have said that Sri Lanka should not attach special status to any country in its foreign relations.

The CPC delegation headed by Deputy Minister of the International Affairs Department Sun Haiyan called on Premadasa and a few other MPs as part of engagements with the Sri Lankan political parties.

At the meeting, Premadasa, apparently in reference to Indo-China conflict, said he, as a political leader, was ready for a mediatory role between the two Asian giants.

As Sri Lanka gets closer to the elections that are supposed to be held at the end of this year, a fierce contest seems to have occurred between the two main opposition parties, the Samaji Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Jathika Jana Balawegaya (NPP). Representatives of the SJB Economic Policy Committee, such as Eran Wickramaratne and Harsha de Silva, seem to have launched a strong attack on the NPP questioning the latter on economic policy matters.

One of the significant themes recurring in this attack is frequent references made to terms such as Socialism and Marxism. Addressing a press conference last week, MP Harsha de Silva stated that if the NPP Economic Council is not willing to come for a debate, the SJB economic committee trio would like to have the debate at the Galle Face Green, with cutouts of Marx, Engels, and Lenin in the opposing side.

The Gampaha High Court the Trial-at-Bar has deferred delivering the verdict in the case against a Brigadier and three soldiers of the Sri Lanka Army over the shooting to death of three persons and injuring several others during a protest by villagers demanding clean drinking water at Weliweriya Gampaha.

The court was scheduled to deliver its verdict yesterday, however when the case was taken up the Trial-at-Bar announced that the verdict will be delivered on 17 May 2024.

Colombo district prices have declined by 0.8 percent in April from a month ago. This was helped by the drop in both food and non-food prices in the month, in what appeared to be an idiosyncrasy as typically prices get a bump up during the festive month.

Inflation measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) fell after declining 1.9 percent in March, but the prices measured annually recorded a 1.5 percent increase.

The inflation measured annually declined to 0.9 percent in March due to both lower prices and higher base effects last year.

As a result, there were expectations for slightly higher prices in April from the level recorded in March.

Food prices rose by 2.9 percent in April from a year ago, cooler than 3.8 percent in March while non-food prices rose by 0.9 percent, after declining by 0.5 percent a month ago.

However, measured on a monthly basis, food prices have been on a deflation for the third month in a row. In April food prices fell by 1.0 percent.

### Are doctors‚Äô unions making threats again? - EDITORIAL

The doctors in our country seem to be girding up their loin cloths for a possible fight with the government in the aftermath of a government decision to set up a medical faculty at the ‚ÄòNational School of Business Management (NSBM) and at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU).

A study by ‚ÄòThe National Library of Medicine‚Äô shows currently around 1,450 doctors enter the health system annually and the national doctor-to-patient ratio is 1:671 to 1,000 patients. Not surprisingly there is a shortage of doctors in the country.

According to the 2019 GCE (A/L) Examinations Analysis Book 20,287 students sat for the biology science (medical stream). In 2023, 40,329 students took the Bio Science stream. Of this number only 23,178 were able to gain entry to the available facilities in the country.

In other words we have a huge gap between the number of candidates attempting to enter the medical faculties of the university in the country and the numbers they are able to absorb.

Colombo, April 30 (Daily Mirror) - The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is the only party that will conduct its May Day rally at a playground, maintaining tradition, while other political parties have been unable to secure similar venues, SLPP General Secretary MP Sagara Kariyawasam said.

Speaking to the media, he noted that previously, political parties held their May Day rallies on playgrounds, but this year, the SLPP has garnered the greatest support and trust to conduct their rally at such a venue.

"Regrettably, political parties other than the SLPP were compelled to conduct their May Day rallies on the streets, indicative of their limitations. The Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) were constrained to hold their rallies on the road, with some starting from playgrounds but concluding on the streets. This tactic often led to road closures, as they aimed to create the illusion of massive crowds," MP Kariyawasam said.
