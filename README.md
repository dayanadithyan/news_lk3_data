The government of the National People's Power is a government that conducts all citizens. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the National People's Power and the Presidential candidate, said that it was a human being.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake, president and presidential candidate of the National People's Power and Presidential candidate, was held at the Monak Imperial Hotel in Sri Jayawardenapura on Monday (26).

The moment we have evolved here today, as a political movement, is the most systematic basis in many sectors. First, we need to build a power to build this degraded country.

We moved forward with those who represent different fields in our country. But it will not only be enough for us. We must carry out a multi -faceted ideology among our people.

How to dissolve the causes of the disaster about the disaster that has occurred to our country?We have been talking to the public for a long time. I think the next step is to present a program that summarizes them all.

### Uncertainty, stability and the Executive Presidency

*2024-08-26 22:30:18* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Uncertainty-stability-and-the-Executive-Presidency/4-765997) · `en`

The total change of a system of government which has stood for 46 years is a very serious matter and anyone proposing to change it should present a convincing argument and show us how the new system will work. We need to remember that going back to the old system may no longer work, as the world and our country has changed around us, and we sit next to a giant economically powerful neighbour. A change of the Executive Presidency also means that the provincial councils will need to change

It is said that the beauty of cricket is in its uncertainty. This could be the reason why we are so preoccupied with politics; we love its uncertainty. We should be thankful, for if it were certain, we would no longer be living in a democracy. While uncertainty in the outcome of an election is democracy, the breakdown of the system of government could become anarchy.

### Sri Lanka’s NPP plans to raise tax-free threshold to Rs 200K monthly income

*2024-08-26 19:06:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-npp-plans-to-raise-tax-free-threshold-to-rs-200k-monthly-income-178110/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT — The leftist National People’s Power (NPP) has proposed that Sri Lanka’s income tax-free threshold be increased to 2.4 million rupees a year from the current 1.2 million and to “equitably” amend tax rates and tax brackets.

The NPP’s election manifesto released on Monday August 26 has also proposed that the tax base be widened according to taxation fundamentals.

Increasing the tax-free threshold to include people who earn up to 200,000 rupees a month will likely exclude many people from the tax base, however.

NPP leader and presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake first proposed this increase in January 2023. He also said at the time that an NPP government would cap progressive taxation at a maximum of 24 percent.

Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana said on August 18 2024 that Sri Lanka’s planned relief to personal income tax payers could cost 0.08 percent of gross domestic product in lost revenues and would be compensated by additional tax measures.
