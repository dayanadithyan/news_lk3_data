A 2020 rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden is becoming increasingly inevitable. Haley has vowed to stay in the race through at least the batch of primaries on March 5, known as Super Tuesday, but was unable to dent Trump’s momentum in her home state despite holding far more campaign events and arguing that the indictments against Trump will hamstring him against Biden.

He was speaking at a discussion which was held as part of the 2022 event of India's 2022 Risina Dialog 2024

You know that Sri Lanka faced racism in the middle of the 1980s- before the racism, we spent 0.5 more and less than safety expenses.

It increased to three percent in 1985 and increased to 5.9 percent in 1995 in ten years.

In 1985, our safety cost became $ 188 million in 2008, it became $ 1.5 million.

As for Sri Lanka, we should be concerned about majorityism, despite all we believe in democracy.

When the academic reform in Sri Lanka was carried out in the 1970s, it caused some communities to be discriminated against. This caused the community to carry arms.

### Colombo’s most popular caricaturist in a bygone era

*2024-02-25 03:18:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/colombos-most-popular-caricaturist-in-a-bygone-era/) · `en`

With the passing of time, Lorenz did not have the time he would like to dedicate to the arts as before. The demand on his time in other fields such as in law and politics necessitated him to mainly if not totally focus on those aspects. However, his pencil and sketchbook never left his side. When inspiration struck him, out came a fine caricature. It has been over 150 years since his death and most of his once famous caricatures have been lost. A few have been reproduced as plates in some important publications over the last 100 years and preserved for posterity.

Caricatures have always been endearing pieces of art which have commented on sophisticated matters. In the dynasty of Lankan caricature artists such as J. L. K. van Dort, Bevis Bawa, Aubrey Collette, W. R. Wijesoma and Gihan de Chickera, C.A. Lorenz can be safely positioned as the ‘pioneer’.

The Presidential Election of 1988 was held amid fear of disruption and death threats to campaigners. During the election period, a curfew was in force from 11 pm to 5 am throughout the month from Nomination to Polling Day while the forces of disruption were also enforcing fear psychosis, causing shops, government institutions, offices, and even court houses to close regularly.

From Nomination Day, the candidates Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa, Mrs. Sirima Bandaranaike and Mr. Ossie Abeygunasekara were conducting their election campaigns under heavy security. People were fearful of attending meetings, and attendance at most meetings was limited. The JVP did not run at this election.

### WHEN TIGER (RAY) HOLDEN MET DARA SINGH

*2024-02-25 02:52:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/when-tiger-ray-holden-met-dara-singh/) · `en`

Professional wrestling was introduced to Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) by Donovan Andree, a prominent organiser of sporting and musical events for the middle class. An entertainment starved nation was quick to lap up the fare so diligently selected by Donovan.

For a period of about two decades after the ceasing of hostiities in World War 2, Ceylon’s middle class woke up from a long war induced slumber to find that we were living in a virtual cultural desert. For the Sinhala speaking folk there was some relief from the emergence of Sunil Santha waxing lyrical on the joys and the beauty of the rural countryside through songs like “Olu Pipeela,” “Handapane” and “Bovitiya dhang palukam waray” For the English speaking Colombo centric middle class there was only Radio Ceylon and the Western movies and associated music like Jimmy Rodgers epic “Moonlight and Skies” and Doris Day’s “Que Sera “and the like.

### Relatives of  victims  of Sri Lanka’s Grisly Violence  Unlikely to  find closure until justice is served and those whose hands are bloodstained are held accountable for their actions.

*2024-02-25 00:54:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83683) · `en`

They lie buried in numerous mass graves, all evidence of Sri Lanka’s murderous recent past which has been punctuated by multiple civil conflicts.

Whatever remains is evidence of Sri Lanka’s grisly history of the extrajudicial executions of rebels in both Northern and Southern insurrections.

Most of the bodies remain in mass graves that stretch from Chemmani and Duraiappah Stadium in  Jaffna to burial sites in the Colombo and Matale Districts and the Southern and Central Provinces.

The dead could be anyone; captured rebels, those caught in crossfires and others who were deemed to be “inconvenient,” according to a report titled ‘Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s War Time Role’ released by the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) on 17 January 2024.

Sri Lanka’s recent blood-soaked history is replete with mass killings and many “disappearances” from the various incidents during the insurgencies of the JVP as well as the Tamil separatist war.

### Disregarding Court ruling on Bills has ominous consequences given that the Sri Lankan judiciary lacks the power to review enacted law.

*2024-02-25 00:45:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83680) · `en`

As much as lawyers, activists and civic conscious citizens, South Asia’s judges seem to be fighting with their backs proverbially against the wall in these extraordinarily fraught times.

At a forum of constitutional lawyers in Katmandu last week, a Nepali legal practitioner confessed deep standing concerns regarding executive interference into the judiciary. This was in a backdrop where the Supreme Court had been left with an acting Chief Justice for more than fifteen months last year at a time when key public interest litigation was pending.

Earlier, an unprecedented crisis had gripped the Court when judges and lawyers demanded the resignation of the Chief Justice for having ‘a close relationship’ with the executive. “The judicial institution does not recover from such a crisis quickly’ he told me. ‘Even when we have positive responses in some cases, we are concerned about systemic independence. There is a long way more to go.’

### The Academician and the Elephant: an adventure in the wilds of Wasgamuwa

*2024-02-24 22:11:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-academician-and-the-elephant-an-adventure-in-the-wilds-of-wasgamuwa/) · `en`

Accounts of conflicts in remote jungle areas between man and elephant appear in our newspapers regularly. They make sad reading – man and beast each fighting a never ending battle for survival under increasingly difficult circumstances. There are then accounts of people getting killed, seriously injured or narrowly escaping when on tour in parks, sanctuaries and even outside these while seeking entertainment from seeing animals in their natural habitat. And then, of course, we’ve been inundated with press articles about the two baby elephants taken forcibly from Pinnawela to Kandy.

With elephants so much in the news, an incident came to mind a few weeks ago listening to a brilliant academician at a seminar in Colombo. This academician, a friend of many years, had been living abroad for a long time excelling in his studies and profession. On his return he had an almost insatiable thirst for travel – off the beaten track – the more remote the better.
