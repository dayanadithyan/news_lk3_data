The army has 150,000 troops while the rebel strength is 20,000. It has  700 tanks, 2000 artillery pieces (big numbers for a poor country with no  external enemies)

What a turn of events in Myanmar–in  2021, the Generals seized power again from the legitimately elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, the second military coup staged since 1962. The Generals had total power for much of Myanmar’s post-independence period, then relinquished briefly only to seize it back a few months later. She was jailed for 33 years on trumped-up charges. Widespread protests were crushed by killing over 3000 people, imprisoning 20,000 and destroying 55,000 houses over the past two years. Thus, the junta hoped to silence her forever and crush the country’s hopes of ever returning to democracy.

### Those whom Gods wish to destroy, they first make mad - EDITORIAL

The saying “Whom the Gods would destroy, they first make mad” is  believed to have been made by the Greek Tragedian Euripides and has been used in English literature since the 17th century. Leon Tolstoy in his novel ‘War and Peace’ uses the phrase in reference to Napoleon.

Wikipedia quotes Sri Lankan Catholic Priest Father Simon Gregory Perera, SJ using the phrase about the belief of Portuguese colonialists that the loss of Sri Lanka to the Dutch was divine punishment.

Today, our country is gripped in election fever. We are witnessing the applicability of this phrase in many a political party and candidate. The dramatic twists and turns of our political establishment bear ample testimony to this. According to media reports the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has barred party members from commenting on whom that particular party may nominate as its presidential candidate!

The Citizen’s movement against fraud, corruption and waste has submitted a letter of demand to the Power and Energy Ministry Secretary, calling for Rs. 50 million in compensation.

They cited the adverse effects of the new Sri Lanka Electricity Bill on the citizens as the basis for their claim.

Led by its Chairman Jamuni Kamantha Thushara along with a few other members, the movement argued that the Bill violates Constitutional rights and has a detrimental impact on over 6 million electricity users countrywide.

On 17 April, the Government published the proposed electricity sector reforms in the gazette, which is now named the Sri Lanka Electricity Bill. The crucial legislation is now set to be presented to Parliament during the next sitting. It then allows the public a two-week window from the date of its submission in Parliament to challenge its legality in the Supreme Court.

### Exploring FDI and export potential of Sri Lanka under the new normal

This article captures the core insights from the recent webinar hosted by the Daily FT, Board of Investment, SLID, CIMA, ACCCA and the International Chamber of Commerce. The event fostered dialogue with the diplomatic community from crucial markets about the critical role of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in Sri Lanka’s growth trajectory.

As Sri Lanka works to recover from its recent economic crisis through robust macroeconomic and fiscal policies, its future growth prospects remain constrained. The country faces challenges such as underperforming exports, which are projected to increase by only 5.27% annually from 2024 to 2028, and structural economic weaknesses, including persistently low labour productivity that has grown at a mere 1.4% over the past decade. To foster sustainable economic growth, Sri Lanka must enter new markets through efficiency-enhancing free trade agreements (FTAs), simultaneously addressing domestic constraints to unlock its FDI and export potential.

### Rising from the Rubble: Sri Lanka’s economy roars back to life – fact or fiction?

The World Bank recently held a press briefing to discuss the future of Sri Lanka's economy. World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka Faris Hadad-Zervos stated: "Sri Lanka's economy is on the road to recovery, but sustained efforts to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on the poor and vulnerable are critical, alongside a continuation of the path of robust and credible structural reforms."

Currently, Sri Lanka's overall recovery path is becoming clearer, especially through policy-level measures and structural reforms, particularly concerning state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that have been incurring losses. The maintenance of loss-making SOEs poses a significant burden on the Government's Balance Sheet. In 2023, the cumulative net losses of SOEs amounted to 1,323 billion rupees, with some showing marginal profits. However, overall, these entities face challenges in overcoming historical cumulative losses.

### Prolonged West Asian instability re-shapes global system

The core problem, the Gaza war continues to shock and anger the world community, which is why world perspectives are shifting

Two hundred days after it began last 7 October, the terrible, system-shaking, Gaza war, is now a whole West Asian regional crisis. The very prolongation of the military onslaught on Gaza and the violence in the West Bank as well as its highly controversial and socially devastating nature has very quickly expanded it beyond Israel-Palestine’s borders. Given the current global systemic intimacy, it is actually a global crisis.

Today, we, in Sri Lanka, are directly affected by the West Asian war crisis that the Gaza war has become. Leave aside the simple danger of long-range missile mis-targeting in our neighbouring region of West Asia. Long range missiles possessed by some of the combatant states, carrying nuclear payloads, can, with a possible targeting failure, easily come in Sri Lanka’s direction.

### The Gandhi of Sri Lanka: Dr. Ari is the apostle of peace to the world and beyond

(KRAKOW, Poland): On the morning of 16 April, Dr. A.T. Ariyaratne’s family informed me that he was in critical condition. In the quiet of the evening, I was heartbroken to learn that “Ari Aiya” of Sarvodaya—as I affectionately called him for more than half a century—departed us peacefully.

With a clear and sharp mind until his last breath, the 92-year-old soul lived for others with his quintessentially Buddhist way of life as a compassionate servant-leader. Undeniably, Ari Aiya drew equal inspiration from the Gandhian philosophy of non-violence. When he received the Hubert H. Humphrey International Humanitarian Award from the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs in 1994, I hailed him as the “Gandhi of Sri Lanka.”
