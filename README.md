March 15 (CNN) -  Russia’s war machine is going to horrific lengths to try to erase Ukrainian identity and bolster its own military ranks – by deporting Ukrainian teenagers to Russia, indoctrinating them with propaganda, and attempting to conscript them into the Russian armed forces to fight against their own country.

Numerous credible firsthand accounts have emerged of Russian authorities transporting Ukrainian children without parents or guardians from occupied areas like Mariupol to cities across Russia.

### President hints at vehicle import resumption; importers warn of possible cost increase

*2024-03-15 07:08:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/President-hints-at-vehicle-import-resumption-importers-warn-of-possible-cost-increase/108-278885) · `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday hinted at a possible gradual resumption of private vehicle imports starting next year. However, local vehicle importers have warned that this development may not necessarily translate into positive news for buyers.

While the relaxation could breathe new life into the stagnant motor sector, importers have expressed concerns that duty structures for imported vehicles may see a significant increase.

In January, the government revised the duty structure, resulting in a significant rise in vehicle import costs. Despite the potential allowance for vehicle imports, importers caution that substantial restrictions may remain, implying it is too early to celebrate the statement made by the President.

The Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka’s survey indicates that local market prices are poised to climb alongside the resumption of imports.

Mr Porter did add that the US has yet not determined whether the new plans would break the law.

### Questions to those questioning Sri Lanka’s IMF program

Becoming an export oriented economy is a good solution but it is a long term solution as we cannot become an export oriented economy overnight either as that takes years to materialise.

The pause in repayment of external debt (except multilateral debt) for nearly 2 years is largely due to the creditors being reassured that the IMF is there.

There has been a lot of criticism about Sri Lanka’s 17th IMF program from people of various backgrounds. They have made all kinds of accusations against the IMF program and criticised it. I agree that the IMF program is not the perfect solution. But the question is, what is the alternative? I am yet to see anyone who has offered a sensible alternative to the IMF.

### Appointment of a tax ombudsman: The time is apt

Due to the current economic environment, it is understood that tax revenue collection should be enhanced to increase the Tax to GDP ratio. However, the Government should take precaution to ensure this endeavour to enhance tax revenue does not lead to harassment or unfairness to the taxpayer.

There are many knowledgeable tax officers who understand both sides of the fence and act professionally by respecting the Rule of Law and the Taxpayer Rights. However, due to heightened pressure from the Ministry of Finance and Parliamentary Committees one could lose track of respecting the rights of the other party. What is the recourse available to a taxpayer if tax officers transgress the Rule of Law to exercise their power without respecting the legal rights of the taxpayer?
