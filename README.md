### Vietnam debate on monetary or fiscal choices to target output recalls Sri Lanka choices

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Vietnam can grow 6.0 percent in 2024, with ‚Äòpolicy support‚Äô but there is a debate whether it should be done through fiscal (widening deficits/worsening debt or state spending) or monetary means, a top International Monetary Fund official said.

The IMF projects 6.0 percent growth for Vietnam in 2024 ‚Äúas it rebounds from a challenging 2023,‚Äù Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the Asia and Pacific Department told reporters during the Spring Meetings in Washington.

‚ÄúNow, in the case of Vietnam, I would say that there‚Äôs an issue about policy mix, whether you could get more support from the fiscal and rely less on monetary,‚Äù Srinivasan said.

‚ÄúSo there is an issue of policy mix which we‚Äôre talking, which we‚Äôve been engaging the authorities with.

‚ÄúI would say that policy support should be more favorable and that should, and along with external demand, help raise growth to 6 percent.‚Äù

### Some Thoughts for the New Year

*2024-04-21 02:55:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/some-thoughts-for-the-new-year/) ¬∑ `en`

Last week was the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Avurudu in Sinhala, Puththandu in Tamil. It marks the end of one harvest season and the beginning of another. Celebrated by Sri Lankans of all shades and stripes, of every class and background, it demonstrates, as does no other event, the multifaceted character of Sri Lankan culture.

As Sri Lanka lurches into a New Year three months after January 1, then, this is the time to reflect on what it is becoming and will become of us over the next 12 months. What shape will the country take by April 13 next year? Will the status quo ‚Äì political, social, economic ‚Äì stand, or will there be a rupture in the way things are? Will the present batch of leaders become politically irrelevant? Most crucially, how will the world around Sri Lanka change, and how can, and how should, Sri Lanka adapt itself to that brave new world?

Rupa Jayasena gazed intently on the vista below, as she sat in the front veranda of her home, high up on the hill of Hanthana, overlooking the Peradeniya University‚Äôs green campus scattered with trees and bushes in bloom. She could discern within the meticulously landscaped terrain the Peradeniya-Galaha road winding its way to Getambe and beyond. She would sit in the veranda all afternoon with frequent cups of tea and watch the young men and women walking between their residential halls and lecture rooms, clutching books and files. They were in happy groups; or couples absorbed with each other; or hurrying single students.

Sri Lankan cashews are highly sought after for their milky flavour, and the market for Rancrisp cashews continues to grow.

The cashew, Anacardium occidentale L., belongs to the Anacardiaceae or cashew family. Two related plants in this family are the mango and pistachio trees. Cashew nuts are kidney-shaped seeds that adhere to the bottom of the cashew apple, the fruit of the cashew tree, is native to the coastal areas of North-Eastern Sri Lanka, Brazil, and Peru.

In the 16th century, Portuguese explorers introduced cashew trees to other tropical regions such as India, Indonesia, some African countries and Sri Lanka, where they are now grown. The cashew tree was famous for its apple, which is hardly eaten in our country but is a delicacy in some countries. It is eaten ripe, mixed in fruit salads, or pickled. The trunk of the tree is also used as firewood.

### Green tea in Japan delicately plucked with gloved hands

*2024-04-21 02:33:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/green-tea-in-japan-delicately-plucked-with-gloved-hands/) ¬∑ `en`

In spite of its technological advancement, perhaps as in no other Asian country, modern Japan still maintains close links with simple things of its past in several enduring forms. The commonest, to mention a few, are the tatami mat-covered floors in homes, tiny goblets of hot sake in winter, cold sake in summer, bamboo chopsticks, delicious tempura and of course green tea with its subtle flavour and aroma.

The 121 million people in Japan are estimated to have consumed some 186 million kilograms of green tea in 1984 together with about 10 million kilograms of black tea imported from Sri Lanka, Indonesia and some other countries.

### Sri Lanka‚Äôs Easter Bombings:  A Preventable Tragedy

*2024-04-21 00:10:00* ¬∑ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-easter-bombings-a-preventable-tragedy-159516/) ¬∑ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Five years on, Sri Lanka‚Äôs Easter Sunday bombings has left us with more questions than answers.

Both the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government and now the Ranil Wickremesinghe tenure has been shown up poorly in terms of ensuring the masterminds and those who failed to prevent the bombings are bought to book.

As one sifts through various reports and discussions on the Easter Sunday bombings which took the lives of 315 and injured at least 600, one must, as Sunanda Deshapriya, activist and investigative journalist told a webinar recently, ask whether that tragedy was preventable.

The webinar was organised by the Solidarity Movement for Justice and Truth (SMJT).

One interesting fact that investigators discovered, Deshapriya said, was that a phone number used by one of the bombers, was amongst a series used by the infamous ‚ÄòTripoli Brigade‚Äô  that is alleged to be behind the Lasantha Wickrematunga murder.

Ravi Rudra, presenting a Q and A with Michael Tissera in mid-December 2023, entitled

Q 1: What was the major turning point in your cricketing career?

‚ÄúAt school [S. Thomas College], I hardly scored runs consistently. Those days the school matches were played over two half-days and you looked to push the game along to get results. I got one only hundred while playing for College. The lack of big scores¬† was more mental than technique.

However, in my first Sara trophy game for NCC (in 1958), which I was lucky to play because I was ill the whole week but captain Vernon Prins insisted that I play, I got a hundred against Saracens. That turned my whole career around. Following that century which gave me a lot of confidence I scored three or four centuries in that debut season and I got picked to play for Ceylon in December of that year against Peter May‚Äôs 1958 MCC team.‚Äù

Q.2: As a Junior at College, who would you give credit for refining your technique and shaping you into a top cricketer?

July 1983 saw the commencement of the darkest era in Sri Lanka‚Äôs modern history. Ethnic riots and the escalation of a hitherto low-intensity separatist insurgency caused widespread insecurity and instability, creating an atmosphere of anxiety and tension. The decade saw numerous attacks by the LTTE, the so-called ‚ÄòTamil Tigers, on public landmarks and infrastructure, including the destruction of several aircraft belonging to the national airline, Air Lanka. Tourism all but collapsed. Sri Lanka‚Äôs magnificent east coast was rendered nearly inaccessible as Tigers and a short-lived Indian ‚Äòpeacekeeping force‚Äô jockeyed for the upper hand.

Even though President Ranil Wickremesinghe has advised the tea plantation companies to increase the daily salary of plantation workers to Rs 1,700, they have refused to increase the salaries.

"The plantation companies have expressed their agreement to increase the amount of Rs. 400 in addition to the daily salary of Rs.1,000 currently paid to a plantation worker. It has been agreed to give the remaining Rs. 300 with conditions," the MP said.

MP Digambaram further said that under the Samagi Jana Balawega government led by Sajith Premadasa, they will distribute tea lands to the plantation workers and make them small tea plantation owners and increase the daily income of the plantation workers.

Their study, published this week in the scientific journal Mitochondrion, has revealed that the Vedda have a greater genetic similarity with these five tribes than with either Sri Lanka‚Äôs Sinhalese or Tamil populations with whom they have shared the island for centuries.

Most of the foreign debt was purchased from China, as the country is ineligible for loans from multilateral creditors such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after defaulting on repayments since the turn of the millennium.

Since the fall of long-time ruler Robert Mugabe six years ago, Zimbabwe has been struggling to reach an agreement with creditors to restructure its unsustainable debt.
