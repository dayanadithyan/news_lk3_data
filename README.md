The Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) says the SLEDB can support the exports of the construction industry to boost foreign exchange earnings.

“This is the best time for the Construction Industry to look for opportunities overseas. This is because; due to the economic crisis, over 60% of the construction industry in Sri Lanka has been halted,” CIOB President Dr. Rohan Karunaratne said.

“Many contractors are trying to accrue overseas projects and the main barrier for them is the Central Bank ruling which restricts cross-border guarantees and capital funding to establish abroad,” he added.

According to CIOB, the CBSL is allowing only $ 1 million for cross border guarantees which is severely insufficient and does not even begin to scratch the surface of contractors’ requirements.

### Sri Lankans should fight for economic freedom and not for economic independence

*2024-02-06 00:47:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lankans-should-fight-for-economic-freedom-and-not-for-economic-independence/4-758152) · `en`

It is the economic interdependence and not economic independence that matters

Sri Lankans’ fight for economic independence is futile since modern economies are interdependent. But they should aspire to win economic freedom since it helps them to become creative and win over those who are moving forward fast in the globe. That will necessarily require them to worship brain over belly

Sri Lanka as a matter of routine habit celebrated the anniversary of independence from Britain on 4 February. This relates to the political independence in which Sri Lankans are empowered to elect their own rulers. The exercise of this power has happened on numerous occasions in the past 76 years. As such, Sri Lanka has been branded as one of the longest surviving democracies in South Asia, next only to India which has done so for 77 years.

### Global digital operators have to pay VAT according to Sri Lankan tax laws

Following is an interview with Department of Inland Revenue former Deputy Commissioner General N.M.M. Mifly

Q: Digital company taxation local versus foreign has become a subject of concern in the COPF, where it has been pointed out that an unfair playing field is prevalent with the advantage going to foreign digital players operating in Sri Lanka. How do you think this has happened?

A: The digital economy allows room for tax evasion, avoidance, and double non-taxation of both direct and indirect taxes, by using loopholes in the domestic tax statutes. This is done, especially by non-resident digital service providers.

It goes without saying that the non-payment of due taxes by international digital service providers has a direct adverse impact on their local competitors/counterparts. Creating such an uneven playing field has resulted in a loss of confidence in the efficiency of our tax system.

“We reiterate that the Online Safety Bill poses a grave threat to fundamental rights and democratic principles enshrined in the Constitution of Sri Lanka and regret to note that the current Government’s adamant pursuit of this legislation is a clear indication of its intention to silence dissent and suppress civic activism during this critical time of economic reform and upcoming elections,” the statement read.

The March 12 Movement said it noted with grave concern that in addition to introducing an undemocratic law, Parliament outrageously acted in violation of the constitutionally guaranteed right to pre-enactment judicial review of legislation.

### Solution for Somali Piracy has to be found on Land, not at Sea

The SalamaFikira (FP) Group, a leading global security and risk management firm, warned in January, that despite a perceived decline in Somali piracy, recent incidents indicate that the menace has not been eradicated and remains a formidable challenge.

By January 2011, 736 people were taken as hostages and 32 ships were captured by pirates. Piracy impeded the delivery of shipments and increased shipping expenses, costing an estimated US $ 6.9 billion a year in global trade, according to Oceans Beyond Piracy (OBP).

According to the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), a veritable industry of profiteers also arose around the piracy. Insurance companies significantly increased their profits from the pirate attacks as these companies hiked premium rates in response.

### Sri Lanka needs to balance global powers for economic growth: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will have to manage and balance all the global powers to achieve its economic growth and thus the island nation’s foreign policy should aim for economic diplomacy instead of political diplomacy, State Foreign Minister Tharaka Balasuriya said.

Analysts say Sri Lanka has become the center of proxy geopolitical war between the country’s neighbour India and the World’s second largest economy China.

China’s increasing influence in Sri Lanka has raised security concerns to India and that has already led Colombo to suspend the arrival of Chinese research vessels to the island nation.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe government has promised a non-aligned foreign policy which was not followed by his predecessors. Successive Colombo governments’ foreign policy had leaned towards either China or the West in the past.

Sri Lanka expects to attract about US$5 billion in foreign funds in the next two years once it is able to finalise the restructuring of its overseas debt, the country’s foreign minister said on Monday (Feb 5).

The nation defaulted on its overseas debt in May, 2022 after a severe shortage of foreign exchange reserves triggered the worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948.

Sri Lanka has since made progress on about US$11 billion of bilateral debt restructuring and hopes to have agreements in place with all key creditors, including bondholders, by May at the latest, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry told Reuters.

It will then focus on kick-starting major infrastructure projects suspended during the crisis, including a highway, an expansion of the main airport near Colombo and a US$2 billion light railway project with Japan.

*2024-02-05 17:13:00* · [`newsfirstlk`](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/02/05/tisl-slams-outrageous-passage-of-online-safety-act/) · `en`

COLOMBO (News 1st); Transparency International Sri Lanka expressed its outrage at the government's passage of the Online Safety Act, despite failing to implement crucial amendments mandated by the Supreme Court.

In a statement, Transparency International Sri Lanka said: "We are appalled by the outrageous conduct of the Government, Parliament, Attorney General, and the Speaker in signing off on a version of the Online Safety Act that does not contain several of the amendments required by the Supreme Court in its determination on the bill."

The organization went on to criticize the move as a "blatant violation of the Constitutional safeguard" provided for citizens to seek the redress of the court against the attempts of the legislature to impose unconstitutional laws.

They condemned it as an "unprecedented abuse of power by the legislature" and demanded immediate corrective action.

Karunakaran Nitarshan, a university student at the Jaffna Regional Office of the Human Rights Commission, filed a complaint today (05).

A police officer in the Vaddukoddottai area led himself and contradicted me as to why he did not stop the motorcycle when he was forgotten.

For that I don't notice you. When I took them all the documents, I did not buy it, and the additional police summoned it.

At the time, more than 7 police officers who came in civil clothes, without any inquiries, put me on the street and severely attacked people while they were watching.. The incident that strikes me is also recorded in surveillance cameras at a nearby shop. And I took a video of me hitting me on my cell phone.
