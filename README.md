### Sri Lanka mulls forced charges for shopping bags in supermarkets only

*2024-05-18 08:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-mulls-forced-charges-for-shopping-bags-in-supermarkets-only-163506/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka may end the practice of supermarkets giving free shopping bags, as part of efforts to contain plastic use according to deliberations at a parliamentary committee following a supreme court decision.

Sri Lanka’s courts many years ago barred supermarkets from charging for plastic bags from customers after activists went to court.

However a Supreme Court ruled in March this year to overturn that.

The parliament Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development said it could not reverse the gazette issued under the Consumer Affairs Authority Act until it had received a copy of the ruling.

The committee said the ruling might prompt shoppers to bring their own bags, which would lead to a reduction in polythene waste.

It may only apply to supermarkets and not to smaller merchants, however. (Colombo/May18/2024)

*2024-05-18 02:48:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183829) · `ta`

He criticizes the current media landscape as lacking neutrality, contrasting it with the "faceless" media of the past. This stance reflects a shift towards a more controlled political culture, where the media's role is questioned. Political observers suggest this move could indicate uncertainty about electoral outcomes.

🟩

'' The media is currently not to work with neutrality. So there is no media meeting, ”Prime Minister Narendra Modi explained.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi who interviewed a private television channel.. ': Why not hold a press conference for ten years in charge of the regime? ”

Currently journalists are identified with their own self -interest. The media is not neutral.

The media that needs to work neutral is not doing so today. That is why the press conference was not held.

Previously the media was faceless. Who writes?What is its policy?No one was worried about it before. The situation is not the case today.

A new political culture that focuses on the media is not worried about the activities of politics.

I have no confidence in going on this path. I can also cut the ribbon at Vigyan Bhavan. I am traveling for a small project in a small district in Jharkhand, though.

I have come up with a new job culture. Do you agree with it?Don't want?The media must decide. ”

*2024-05-18 00:30:00* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/organic-agriculture-to-biodynamic-farming/) · `en`

Two epic developments which radically changed the face of Agriculture, took place in the latter part of the last century. The first was the technology for converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia by the Haber / Bosch process. This technology tapped the abundant (72%) atmospheric nitrogen to link with hydrogen to produce ammonia, which was further processed to produce Ammonium Sulphate and Urea fertilizers.

The second was the production of Calcium Superphosphate. The earliest sources of fertilizer phosphate were guano and bone meal. It was discovered that when bone meal was treated with concentrated Sulfuric acid, to produce the more readily soluble Superphosphate. Rock phosphate became the favoured raw material. The phosphoric product, also contained significant amounts of calcium and sulphur – also important plant nutrients.

### Who will benefit from an election boycott by Tamils?

Prediction of the results of the forthcoming Presidential election would be the most difficult one in Sri Lankan history, since almost all traditional attachments of the voters with the main political parties seem to have been shattered to the core by the economic crisis that brought millions of people to the streets in 2022.

The unprecedented economic hardships within their household and the agitations with slogans on the streets against all present and past rulers of the country for nearly four months seem to have shaped a new political mindset among the majority of people in the country.

The impact of these two factors – the economic hardships and the Aragalaya – has been such that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the party that bagged 52.25 percent of votes has been ranked at the bottom of some poll surveys since mid-last year, with not even 10 percent of voter preferences in favour of them. Interestingly, the SLPP has never challenged the results of such surveys either.

Media reports inform us that many MPs across the political divide have secured liquor permits in the names of their friends and relatives. These permits we all know will subsequently be sold for huge sums of money.

According to one report, the going price per permit is around rupees fifty million. The permit is for the establishment of new liquor shops in the country.

The recent video clip capturing a TV debate in Sri Lanka has ignited discussions surrounding the conduct and status of parliamentarians within the country. This video went viral and was commented on by several leading Youtubers. The footage reveals a factional dispute between members of the governing party and representatives from the JVP characterized by intense shouting matches, threats, warnings, and the use of indecent language.

Such heated debates are common, but it appears in this instance, that either these members in the debate were briefed to behave in that fashion or the Governing party does not have any spokespersons, leave alone decency and integrity.

Accessible through the provided link now available in many forms, the video shows a firsthand account of the intensity of the confrontation, shedding light on the underlying dignity and democracy  within Sri Lanka’s political landscape.

Who among those associated in an era of violence, values peace, the most; it is those who are immersed in it

The peace of a nation does not lie on the pulpit of the United Nations or any other international body. The long-term stability and sustainability of a country which has paid the price in blood for peace can only come, when like Japan, one revitalises the entire nation, in every sphere, from education to recreation, to sharpen a mind towards a peaceful and holistic mindset. One that is devoid of Mohaya (which can be interpreted as false pride or illusion) or Dweshaya (anger/spite). Such a nation will not have to face the consequences of these base qualities which is Dukkha

Recognising that any political structure thriving on division and unrest is a maniacal terror

Understanding that an arm or a limb or a life cannot be compensated

Comprehending the ego and attachment that begins the minds’ first riot

(Daily Mirror) - Dr. Rabindra D. Mehta, an India-origin Sports Aerodynamics Consultant, who, in 1980 used to open the bowling with Imran Khan for the Royal Grammar School in Worcester, and who has researched extensively on swing bowling, has been following the IPL from the USA, where he is now based at.

When the Indian cricket board is considering abolishing the tossing of the coin in local matches, the scientist has expressed his views on how the coin would be advantageous to the well-deserving higher ranking teams only.

"As we approach the end of the regular IPL season, all the teams in contention are vying for the first two spots (seed 1 and seed 2), and for good reason, since they get “two bites at the cherry”! However, what is the advantage of finishing first (as opposed to second)? NONE!! And, for that matter, there is no advantage in finishing third as opposed to fourth."

### ‘Interventions’: A book review

*2024-05-17 20:36:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Interventions-A-book-review/4-761923) · `en`

“Until they become conscious, they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled, they cannot become conscious.”

This is a review (perhaps imprecise) of the anthology “Interventions” – Selected Political Writings of Dayan Jayatilleka edited by Uditha Devapriya and Uthpala Wijesuriya with a forward by Kamaya Jayatissa, published by Neptune.

I say imprecise, because I wrote this review before reading the entirety of this collection of writings by Dayan J. When reading this missive I hope you will understand why I hurried to pen this review before digesting it in its whole.

Dayan Jayatilleka as a public intellectual has been rediscovered by two millennial opinion journalists – the type who seek the narrative that’s alternative to that of the mainstream.

I must declare my interest. I know Dayan since 1968 as the son of Mervyn De Silva who was my Editor at Ceylon Daily News. Mervyn was my friend and a mentor of sorts.

### What must Sri Lanka do to avoid a second default in the near future?

*2024-05-17 20:19:41* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-must-Sri-Lanka-do-to-avoid-a-second-default-in-the-near-future/4-761921) · `en`

A second default by Sri Lanka could be more devastating than Sri Lanka’s first default in 2022

Past evidence shows that most countries that default on their external debt, have a history of defaulting once again within the next 10 years. Going by this data, there is a probability that Sri Lanka can default once again.

A second default by Sri Lanka could be more devastating than Sri Lanka’s first default in 2022. In case of a second default Sri Lanka will have to go once again to the lender of last resort, the International Monetary Fund as a bankrupt nation. The conditions by the IMF if we default the second time will be much harsher and rightly so. The bilateral creditors and bondholders will also not be as kind if Sri Lanka goes for a second default. With harsher terms by the IMF, bilateral creditors and bondholders, Sri Lanka if it defaults again will have very little space to breathe.

BBC-The European Union is investigating Facebook and Instagram over whether they are so addictive that they are having "negative effects" on the "physical and mental health" of children.

This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission," it said.
