### Avoid walking or swimming in floodwaters - Health experts

*2024-06-04 19:14:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Avoid-walking-or-swimming-in-floodwaters-Health-experts/108-284088) ┬╖ `en`

Colombo, June 04, (Daily Mirror) - In the aftermath of severe flooding across Sri Lanka, health authorities urge people to avoid walking or swimming in floodwaters, as they may contain hazardous bacteria and debris causing complications.

The Health Ministry also advised people not to consume food that has been damaged by flooding; it should be discarded.

Further, it requests adults to keep children and pets away from contaminated water to prevent illness while to seek immediate medical attention if any symptoms of illness are experienced.

Meanwhile, health authorities are urging the public to remain vigilant against the spread of leptospirosis, commonly known as 'rat fever.'

As floodwaters recede, there could be a noticeable uptick in leptospirosis cases, particularly in regions where the disease was previously uncommon, an official from the Health Ministry said.

"We have instructed provincial health authorities to be extra vigilant during the post-flood period," the official stated.

### Train delays expected on main line

*2024-06-04 19:02:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99663/train-delays-expected-on-main-line) ┬╖ `en`

The Railway Department says that several office trains operating on the main line this evening could be delayed.

Speaking to the media, Deputy General Manager of Railways Mr. N.J. Indipolage stated that certain trains could experience delays owing to railway tracks being inundated in certain areas between Gampaha and Weyangoda.

He further said that the train delays are caused due to the presence of water on the railway track, causing hindrances to the railway signals.

Accordingly, the Deputy General Manager of Railways further mentioned that trains playing towards areas such as Rambukkana, Polgahawela, Kandy, Kurunegala and Mahawa could also be delayed.

### ChatGPT was down for hours, now recovered

*2024-06-04 18:50:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/ChatGPT-was-down-for-hours-now-recovered/108-284085) ┬╖ `en`

ChatGPT has now recovered from what OpenAI described as a "major outage" earlier today, which hit millions of users of worldwide.

Reports of the ChatGPT issues first started at around 2.30am ET / 7.30am BDT / 4.30pm AEST on June 4. OpenAI acknowledged that there was a big issue, with the company's status page reporting for several hours that "ChatGPT is unavailable for some users".

Fortunately, OpenAI pushed out a fix at around 7.30am ET / 12.30pm BST / 4.30pm AEST, and the service's status is now a healthier green color with "all systems operational". The problems were pretty widespread, both geographically and across platforms, hitting the web version, mobile app and new Mac app тАУ although they mostly appeared to affect logged in users.

OpenAI hasn't yet commented on what exactly caused ChatGPT's biggest outage of 2024, but we've asked it for comment and will update this page when we hear back.

### India coach Dravid to step down after T20 World Cup

*2024-06-04 18:00:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/India-coach-Dravid-to-step-down-after-T20-World-Cup/108-284080) ┬╖ `en`

(BBC) - India coach Rahul Dravid is to stand down when his contract expires after the T20 World Cup.

Former batter Dravid says he will not reapply for the position after it was advertised by governing body the BCCI last month.

The 51-year-old succeeded Ravi Shastri in 2021 and led India to the World Test Championship and 50-over World Cup finals last year, losing to Australia on both occasions.

"Unfortunately, the kind of schedules and where I find myself at this stage in my life, I don't think I'll be able to reapply," Dravid said.

"I love doing the job. I've really enjoyed coaching India and I think it's a truly special job to do."

As well as those two defeats by Australia Dravid oversaw a run to the semi-finals of the 2022 T20 World Cup, where India were beaten by eventual winners England.

They have not won any global tournament since the 2013 Champions Trophy.

### Imran Khan acquitted in state secrets case

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been acquitted of leaking state secrets but will remain in jail because of a conviction in another case.

In the run-up to elections in February, the 71-year-old - who was ousted as prime minister in 2022 - was hit with three prison sentences for cases he insists were politically motivated.

Khan was sentenced to 10 years in prison in January on charges of making public a diplomatic cable in 2022.

The Islamabad High Court upheld his appeal and cleared him in that case on Monday, but he is not expected to leave prison for now.

The former cricket star and his third wife Bushra are both serving prison sentences after a court ruled that their 2018 marriage had been un-Islamic and illegal as it came too soon after her divorce.

The couple were also found guilty of corruption over gifts received during his term as prime minister.

Even behind bars, the former cricket star remains a powerful force in Pakistani politics.

### India election results 2024: ModiтАЩs BJP may fall short of majority

One of the BJPтАЩs strongest hopes, K Annamalai, is trailing in Tamil Nadu's Coimbatore seat by more than 23,000 votes.

The party had high hopes that the former police officer would help them gain in a state that has traditionally rejected it.

PM Narendra Modi has a comfortable lead of over 98,000 votes in Uttar Pradesh's Varanasi seat, where he is the incumbent MP.

Prominent regional Samajwadi Party and the Congress have fielded Ajay Rai as their joint candidate.

Mr Modi won with a vote share of more than 63% here in 2019.

Despite the lower-than-expected numbers for the BJP, the party is still confident of forming the next government тАФ and under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has ruled for the past decade, and under whom the party fought this campaign.

### ModiтАЩs BJP may fall short of majority

The alliance helmed by Prime Minister ModiтАЩs BJP party is on track to win a majority in the Lok Sabha, although likely with less seats than five years ago.

That means US-India relations are unlikely to substantially change, at least in the short term.

India has increasingly emerged as a major lynch pin in the administration of president Joe BidenтАЩs policy in Asia, particularly as part of efforts to counter ChinaтАЩs influence.

That was on display last year when Biden hosted Modi for a state visit тАУ the highest form of US diplomacy. Biden hailed the two countries as one of the тАЬdefining relationships of the 21st centuryтАЭ.

It was a move that again put the US president on a tight-rope walk, with critics accusing Biden of normalising alleged rights abuses and discriminatory practices under ModiтАЩs government.

12.05 PM -┬аVeteran actor Raj Babbar is leading in Gurgaon seat on Congress ticket by over 30,000 seats

11.58 AM -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alliance raced to a majority in early vote counting trends in the general election, but the numbers were well short of the landslide predicted in exit polls. Opposition gains are higher than expected.

11.48 AM - When Narendra Modi launched his campaign with the slogan тАЬAb ki baar, 400 paar,тАЭ he aimed for more than 400 seats for his BJP-led NDA alliance. The most optimistic exit polls even predicted a clear 400 seats for them.

However, early trends indicate a much tighter contest with the Congress-led INDIA alliance, a centre-left coalition. Speculation is already rife about whether the BJP alone will reach the 272 seats needed for a majority in the 543-seat parliament.

The lead between the two coalitions appears narrower than expected, with early trends showing a difference of only 60 to 70 seats.

A party or coalition needs 272 seats to cross the majority mark in the 543-member Lok Sabha, the lower house of IndiaтАЩs parliament.

Exit polls show Modi is well on track to return to power for a third consecutive term, while the Indian National Congress party-led opposition bloc hopes to upstage him.

The Election Commission says a record-breaking 642 million voters cast their ballots in the staggered election as it dismissed opposition concerns over how the votes would be counted.

However, the voter turnout this year was 66.3 percent, about one percentage point lower than 2019.
