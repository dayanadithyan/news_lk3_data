### In Mayilathamaduwu

*2024-05-29 15:16:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184786) ¬∑ `ta`

In Mayilathamadu, Batticaloa, ongoing injustices against immigrants involve police complicity, livestock theft, and violence. This issue, rooted in a long history of livestock farming, escalated during planned settlements from 2013 to 2016. The Tamil National Alliance opposed these actions, leading to legal challenges. The situation worsened under Gotabhaya Rajapaksa's governance, with farmers resorting to hiding their livestock due to threats and inadequate food supply. Over 1400 cattle have died, and four departments allegedly deceive farmers. The government's economic crisis exacerbates the problem, risking the destruction of native breeds and potential importation of foreign cattle. This scenario is seen as a form of political manipulation aimed at fostering communal conflict for political gain. Efforts to address these issues, including international outreach and legal actions, have yielded limited results, with continued atrocities against the immigrants.

üü©

The President of the Batticaloa District Civil Social Operators Union said that the iniquities of the immigrants in the Mayilathamadu Madhavan area continue to be carried out to this day, with the help of the police, they carry out their injustice.

He made this statement during a conversation on the crisis faced by the Milky Ways at Batticaloa at the Colombo National Christian Society

He said that cattle are missing, killing them, putting ammunition into the food, killing them with sharp weapons and shooting fire.

Madhavan, Batticaloa, has been involved in livestock farming for more than five generations of long history.

From 2013 to 2016, similar planned settlements took place - these were carried out under the State Event.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that financial allocations have already been allocated.

Once a law passed in the England parliament, no one can interrogate. That was the foundation of the supremacy of Parliament. The Parliament is the Parliament.

American method is different. By the American methodology, when they drafted some law, they gave the executive powers to the executive powers and the Congress Congress and the Court of Justice.

We maintain the English method because our country does not follow a federal way.. But we are not a federal country. Parliament is the final powers of the country's legislation.

A week ago, Khan, the country's most popular opposition leader, was disqualified from being in office for 10 years. His party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was subjected to mass persecution and repression and its central offices were sealed by the police.

The contradictions against the party and its leader were fiercely. Yet Khanal was able to oppose them. Although allegations such as voting and military intervention and all races were supported by the government, PTI won 93 seats. The ruling party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN), won 75 seats and Pakistan People's Party (PPP), led by Benazir Bhutto's son Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, won 54 seats.

BBC - A US luxury real estate billionaire and a deep-sea explorer are planning to travel in a submersible to explore the Titanic.

Ohio tycoon and adventurer Larry Connor and Patrick Lahey, co-founder of Triton Submarines, say they want to take a sub to a depth of around 3,800m (12,467ft) to see the shipwreck in the North Atlantic Ocean.

The private submersible industry was rocked after five people were killed when a vessel built by OceanGate imploded en route to the Titanic last year.

A spokesman for Mr Connor‚Äôs company said on Tuesday that the proposed voyage would only take place once a vessel was fully certified by a marine organisation.

The pair plan to use a sub dubbed the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer ‚Äì the ‚Äú4000‚Äù refers to the depth in metres to which the craft can safely be deployed.

The Titan submarine built by OceanGate was constructed of carbon fibre and was only certified to 1,300m, far short of the depths of the ocean floor where the Titanic wreck lay.
