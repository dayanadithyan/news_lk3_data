Fifteen years post-conflict, Sri Lanka's war crimes remain unjudged. Lakshmi recounts the horrors of the final days in 2009, describing the aftermath of the 26-year civil war between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE. The conflict ended with alleged massacres, torture, and disappearances, impacting hundreds of thousands of civilians. Despite international calls for justice, including from the UN Human Rights Council, accountability remains elusive, contributing to ongoing economic challenges and societal unrest.

Lakshmi remembers the day when the guns finally silenced in May 2009.

He had taken refuge in the sand in the sand. Hundreds of thousands of civilians, which were called Bunker, have been refugees on the coast.

They faced a series of bombs for several weeks in the area announced by the Army Security Zone.

Luxmi told us at a recent meeting that many were struggling to save their lives.

We were inside the bunker.

We have seen the blood flowing out and the body- we can never forget it, ”he said.

The 26 -year war between the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Sri Lankan government is finally over on May 19, alleged that more than one hundred Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) surrendered.

The photos and videos of the state forces as their successes have shown the assassination of prisoners tied up by hands.

Lakshmi was taken to the interim camp where about 250 000 people were detained from suspected LTTE - he is still fearing his true name.

May 16 (Inside FMCG) - Fonterra Co-operative Group is considering options to divest some or all of its global consumer business and integrated businesses, namely Fonterra Oceania and Fonterra Sri Lanka.

Colombo, May 16 (Daily Mirror) - Monosodium glutamate (MSG), the main common food additive or flavor enhancer, has always come under scrutiny in Sri Lanka given its potential health effects. Is it really bad for your health?

While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers the addition of MSG to foods to be “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS), concerns persist over among consumers regarding its adverse reactions in the long run.

That’s why MSG has been a subject of controversy due to reported adverse reactions like headache, flushing, excessive sweating and chest pain.

However, researchers have found no clear proof of a link between MSG and these symptoms. Researchers admit, though, that a small number of people may have short-term and long-term reactions to MSG. The only way to prevent a reaction is to cut out foods that have MSG in them.

Over 70 international transitional justice and human rights scholars have urged the Sri Lankan Government to halt the establishment of a Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation (CTUR) as it has been rejected by victim groups and the broader national context is not conducive for such a process.

The statement signed by leading authors and researchers of transitional justice from across the world also highlights concerns over the Government’s lack of political commitment towards genuine truth-seeking that could lead to justice and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.

The statement said it recognises the right to truth as a key human right affirmed in UN treaties and other mechanisms and asserts that if conducted properly a truth-seeking process can contribute towards establishing the extent and the patterns of past violations, as well as their causes and consequences. In so doing, it can help reconcile deeply divided communities and help bring closure to victim-survivors, it said.
