*2024-07-25 04:21:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189308) · `ta`

Mahinda Amaraweera, Minister of State for Industry and Plantation Industries, announced an agricultural modernization program aimed at promoting domestic agriculture and preventing political manipulation of farmers. The initiative includes distributing 25 kg of seed pulses to each farmer and aims to produce 18,828 metric tons of harvest. Despite challenges like the fertilizer crisis in 2021 leading to insufficient rice supply, the government increased domestic paddy production in 2022 and 2023, achieving 3 million metric tonnes of rice production in 2023. The program also focuses on introducing new agricultural technologies to enhance crop yields and plans to double paddy yields in selected regions within five years. Additionally, the government is launching a lentil cultivation program, offering free seed pulses, and expects to produce 18,828 metric tonnes of lentils.

🟩

Minister of State for Industry and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera said that due to the planned agricultural modernization program launched by the current government to promote domestic agriculture, farmers can no longer be politicized.

The Minister said that the program of cultivating 18,828 metric tons of harvest has been implemented and a farmer will be given 25 kg of seed pulses to a farmer.

The Minister said that about 03 million metric tonnes of rice was produced by paddy yields through the successful program of 2023 and thereby maintaining additional rice in the country.

Minister Mahinda Amaraweera made this statement at a media briefing held at the Presidential Media Center on Wednesday (24).

“Paddy production was banned due to the majority of fertilizer crisis in 2021. So in 2022, there was not enough rice for the consumption of the people of this country. Some said at media meetings that the price of a kilo of rice would exceed 500 rupees.

### பொலிஸ்மா அதிபரின் பதவி நிறுத்தம் தேர்தலைப் பாதிக்காது சட்டம் தெளிவாகக் கூறுகிறது - எம்.ஏ.சுமந்திரன்

இது தொடர்பாக 9 மனுக்கள் தாக்கல் செய்யப்பட்டு பல நாட்கள் விவாதம் செய்யபட்டு இந்த வழக்கினை கொண்டு செல்வதற்கு அனுமதியினை வழங்குகின்ற அதே நேரத்தில் ஜனாதிபதியினாலே  நியமனம் பெற்ற பொலிஸ்மா அதிபருடைய நியமனம் சட்டபூர்வமானதாக இல்லை என்ற காரணத்தினாலே தேசபந்து தென்னக்கோன் என்ற பொலிஸ்மா அதிபரை அந்த பதவியில் இருந்து இடைநிறுத்தி உச்ச நீதிமன்றம் உத்தரவிட்டுள்ளது.

*2024-07-25 03:59:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189305) · `ta`

### Ranil’s Tamil Nadu obsession, comparative Anura-Sajith progressivisms, and North-East solutions

*2024-07-25 03:56:29* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Ranil-s-Tamil-Nadu-obsession-comparative-Anura-Sajith-progressivisms-and-North-East-solutions/4-764712) · `en`

“…key growth drivers along with greater integration with giant and prospering neighbour India. With regard to the latter, he [Wickremesinghe] singled out land connectivity between Sri Lanka and burgeoning South India as a critical development.”

Whatever the outcome, a Kamala Harris presidential run will have a powerful positive impact on the consciousness of Asian (especially South Asian) women and girls, and on women and girls of colour throughout the world, thereby acting as a progressive factor in history.

I hope Vice-President Harris picks Senator Bernie Sanders as her running-mate because Republican JD Vance is a formidable aspirant Veep with a compelling story. The US Democratic party establishment will probably block Bernie, though he is faring very well in public opinion polls.

### SOERU and insulation it provides against bad privatisations

*2024-07-25 03:49:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/SOERU-and-insulation-it-provides-against-bad-privatisations/14-764710) · `en`

For decades, Sri Lanka’s SOEs have been plagued by inefficiency, corruption, and a lack of transparency. Apart from the burden on the public purse, the consequences for citizens have included substandard medicines to exploding gas cylinders. Over the past 20 years vested interests have mushroomed around SOEs.

The opposition to privatisation in Sri Lanka stems from a mixture of ideology and vested interests. On the ideological front, there’s a lingering sentiment, rooted in post-independence nationalism, that views state ownership as a bulwark against foreign exploitation. This perspective sees SOEs not just as economic entities, but as symbols of national sovereignty and social welfare, regardless of how well these entities actually serve the purpose for which they were set up.

### Forty-one years after ‘83 July do prez candidates have answers for “TNQ”?

The continuing lack of a political leadership in the Sinhala South that accepts the Tamil and Muslim people as equals and as citizens with equal rights and dignity, is what denies a decent political solution to the TNQ

The Sinhala South and its leaders cannot for a moment leave all responsibility with Tamil leaders for all these sectarian and extremist developments that make solutions more and more difficult. Political leaders in Sinhala South even now avoid discussing political answers to post-war issues in North-East and for their long-standing issue of sharing political power. Everything belted out on Southern Sinhala political platforms are issues for Sinhala-Buddhist consumption, no different to Sinhala-Buddhist politics of Black July, 41 years ago. No political leader in the South can be heard here in the South saying his or her political party would negotiate power sharing for Sri Lanka with Tamil and Muslim political parties

### 41 years to Black July: Our voices towards meaningful reconciliation

*2024-07-25 03:35:37* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/41-years-to-Black-July-Our-voices-towards-meaningful-reconciliation/4-764707) · `en`

Successive regimes unsuccessfully tried to bury what happened during the war – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

A reconciled society respects and champions the rights of all citizens. Identifying issues that need to be addressed when working towards reconciliation becomes crucial. Achieving a just, equitable society requires equal life opportunities for all, regardless of anyone’s background.Effective reconciliation demands enlightened leaders addressing past crimes and rights violations. It transcends political classes, requiring genuine commitment

In Sri Lanka, fear is pervasive. Suppression of media and fundamental rights of people and repression of human rights defenders foster a climate of fear, silencing victims, and inhibiting reconciliation. Political and criminal interests threaten the justice system, putting lives at risk for exposing the truth.

### A real minimum wage can set ground for productivity gains

*2024-07-25 03:32:15* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/A-real-minimum-wage-can-set-ground-for-productivity-gains/14-764706) · `en`

Then what really is the living wage and how does one establish a common benchmark?

Wages in Sri Lanka have thrown up considerable debate, with local and international activists joining the chorus calling on Government and industries to honour a ‘living wage’.

Sri Lanka’s official minimum wage edged to just Rs. 17,500 ($ 59) in March this year. The ‘living wage’ for urban Sri Lankans in 2022 was listed at Rs. 84,231 ($ 281) by the Global Living Wage Coalition, during a year the country’s headline inflation touched its highest of 73.7% as per the Central Bank. For simpler discourse, let us place that figure now at $ 300.

Meet the jackfruit, a tropical treasure poised to revolutionise the global food industry

Imagine a fruit so versatile it can mimic the taste and texture of pulled pork and shredded chicken, so sustainable it thrives with minimal resources, and so nutritious it’s a powerhouse of vitamins and minerals. Meet the jackfruit, a tropical treasure poised to revolutionise the global food industry.

Native to Southeast Asia and boasting the title of the largest tree-borne fruit on Earth, jackfruit has transcended its Sri Lankan roots to become a global culinary sensation. Introduced to Sri Lanka by Arthur V. Dias, during the British colonial era, when rice scarcity threatened starvation, the jackfruit emerged as a crucial source of sustenance, with its rich carbohydrates and natural fats providing much-needed energy. This lifesaving role later earned the title “Rice Tree”.

Vadivel expresses regret over the withdrawal of the Gazette Notification regarding a Rs 1,700 salary for plantation workers, despite the Ministry of Labor issuing it amidst legal challenges from plantation companies.

🟩

It is sad that the Gazette Notification issued by the Ministry of Labor has been withdrawn for the salary of Rs.

The Ministry of Labor has issued two gazette notifications to pay a salary of Rs 1,700 for plantation workers. However, the plantation companies were suing the court, challenging the gazette notifications issued.

In this backdrop, the High Court recently issued an interim injunction against the Gazette, which conducted a second hearing of the Gazette case on a daily salary gazette case issued by the Ministry of Labor.

He also mentioned that only Sarath Fonseka and Rajitha Senaratne from the United People's Power would join the president.

United People's Power Parliamentarian Tushara Hindu said that Ranil Wickremesinghe would not contest the presidential election if he did not get the support of the Sri Lanka PA.

At the same time, he said that no one other than Sarath Fonseka and Rajitha Senaratne from the United People's Power would join the president.

Dushara Hindu said this while addressing the adjournment debate on the Artificial Intelligence Agency on Wednesday (24) in Parliament.

In artificial intelligence technology we are in the backlash of the world. It must be accepted that such technologies should be used in countries like us that are limited to resources. We need to improve technology with the world.

Our presidents make political promises of time. Previously, the tree climbing conditions continues in search of telecommunication signals for children. In this case, Sajith Premadasa is carrying out programs to create modern classrooms throughout the country.
