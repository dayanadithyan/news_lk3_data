A tanker carrying close to 1.5 million litres of industrial fuel has capsized and sank off the Philippine capital on Thursday, causing an oil spill, officials say.

Mr Bautista said an oil spill has been detected but strong winds and high waves were hampering the authorities’ response.

The incident comes a day after Typhoon Gaemi intensified seasonal monsoon rains, submerging large swathes of Metro Manila and its suburbs in deep floods.

Gaemi has made landfall in Taiwan, leaving three people killed and wounding hundreds more.

The MT Terra Nova was heading for the central Philippine city of Iloilo when it sank, leaving an oil spill stretching for several kilometres, authorities said.

It “capsized and eventually submerged,” the coast guard said in a report, adding they were investigating whether bad weather was a factor.

### Fitch confirms ‘A-(lka)’ domestic rating of National Development Bank Plc

*2024-07-25 10:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/fitch-confirms-a-lka-domestic-rating-of-national-development-bank-plc-173646/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings said it was confirming an A-(lka) rating on Sri Lanka’s National Development Bank Plc with a Stable outlook, amid an improvement in operating environment, indicated by headline macroeconomic indicators.

Fitch said it expects Sri Lanka’s stabilising macroeconomic environment to support NDB’s ability to generate and defend business volumes, but its business profile remains constrained by risks in the domestic operating environment which are still elevated.

“We expect NDB to benefit from the resumption in lending, albeit modest, thereby leading to an uptick in the share of net loans in total assets (end-1Q24: 57.5%), similar to peers.”

NDB’s risk profil remains tied to the credit and market risk of the sovereign, through its substantial exposure via the defaulted foreign-currency-denominated sovereign bonds (end-2023: 6.5% of assets) and a further 25.6% of assets in rupee-denominated treasury securities, the rating agency said.

Whatever the outcome, a Kamala Harris presidential run will have a powerful positive impact on the consciousness of Asian (especially South Asian) women and girls, and on women and girls of colour throughout the world, thereby acting as a progressive factor in history.

I hope Vice-President Harris picks Senator Bernie Sanders as her running-mate because Republican JD Vance is a formidable aspirant Veep with a compelling story. The US Democratic party establishment will probably block Bernie, though he is faring very well in public opinion polls.

### SOERU and insulation it provides against bad privatisations

*2024-07-25 03:49:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/SOERU-and-insulation-it-provides-against-bad-privatisations/14-764710) · `en`

For decades, Sri Lanka’s SOEs have been plagued by inefficiency, corruption, and a lack of transparency. Apart from the burden on the public purse, the consequences for citizens have included substandard medicines to exploding gas cylinders. Over the past 20 years vested interests have mushroomed around SOEs.

The opposition to privatisation in Sri Lanka stems from a mixture of ideology and vested interests. On the ideological front, there’s a lingering sentiment, rooted in post-independence nationalism, that views state ownership as a bulwark against foreign exploitation. This perspective sees SOEs not just as economic entities, but as symbols of national sovereignty and social welfare, regardless of how well these entities actually serve the purpose for which they were set up.

The continuing lack of a political leadership in the Sinhala South that accepts the Tamil and Muslim people as equals and as citizens with equal rights and dignity, is what denies a decent political solution to the TNQ

The Sinhala South and its leaders cannot for a moment leave all responsibility with Tamil leaders for all these sectarian and extremist developments that make solutions more and more difficult. Political leaders in Sinhala South even now avoid discussing political answers to post-war issues in North-East and for their long-standing issue of sharing political power. Everything belted out on Southern Sinhala political platforms are issues for Sinhala-Buddhist consumption, no different to Sinhala-Buddhist politics of Black July, 41 years ago. No political leader in the South can be heard here in the South saying his or her political party would negotiate power sharing for Sri Lanka with Tamil and Muslim political parties

A reconciled society respects and champions the rights of all citizens. Identifying issues that need to be addressed when working towards reconciliation becomes crucial. Achieving a just, equitable society requires equal life opportunities for all, regardless of anyone’s background.Effective reconciliation demands enlightened leaders addressing past crimes and rights violations. It transcends political classes, requiring genuine commitment

In Sri Lanka, fear is pervasive. Suppression of media and fundamental rights of people and repression of human rights defenders foster a climate of fear, silencing victims, and inhibiting reconciliation. Political and criminal interests threaten the justice system, putting lives at risk for exposing the truth.

Wages in Sri Lanka have thrown up considerable debate, with local and international activists joining the chorus calling on Government and industries to honour a ‘living wage’.

Sri Lanka’s official minimum wage edged to just Rs. 17,500 ($ 59) in March this year.

Imagine a fruit so versatile it can mimic the taste and texture of pulled pork and shredded chicken, so sustainable it thrives with minimal resources, and so nutritious it’s a powerhouse of vitamins and minerals. Meet the jackfruit, a tropical treasure poised to revolutionise the global food industry.

Native to Southeast Asia and boasting the title of the largest tree-borne fruit on Earth, jackfruit has transcended its Sri Lankan roots to become a global culinary sensation. Introduced to Sri Lanka by Arthur V. Dias, during the British colonial era, when rice scarcity threatened starvation, the jackfruit emerged as a crucial source of sustenance, with its rich carbohydrates and natural fats providing much-needed energy. This lifesaving role later earned the title “Rice Tree”.

India slashed import duties on gold and silver to 6 percent from 15 percent , a move that industry officials say could boost retail demand and help curtail smuggling in the world’s second-biggest consumer of bullion.

Higher demand for gold from India could boost global prices, which hit a record high this year, although that could widen India’s trade deficit and put pressure on the ailing rupee.

“To enhance domestic value addition in gold and precious metal jewelry, I propose to reduce customs duties of gold and silver to 6 percent ,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a budget speech on Tuesday.

She also announced an import duty exemption for 25 critical minerals, including lithium.
