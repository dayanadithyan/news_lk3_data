COLOMBO (News 1st); The Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) has expressed strong concerns regarding the recently enacted Online Safety Act (OSA) in Sri Lanka.

The CPA criticizes the "secrecy" surrounding the drafting process and the "rushed manner" of passage, raising questions about the government's intentions and potential disregard for constitutional principles.

They question the government's motives for pushing through a law with significant implications for freedom of expression and the rule of law.

The statement underlines the government's failure to fully comply with the Supreme Court's amendments concerning the Bill.

CPA says that concerns arise about the constitutionality of the OSA due to this selective implementation of the Court's decisions, and that this sets a dangerous precedent for the separation of powers and weakens the rule of law.

Meanwhile commercial banks have collected about 3.2 billion US dollars or repaid maturing credit lines in the period.

Large volumes of the collected cash are lying in various NOSTRO accounts, preventing a Lebanon style default on private forex bank accounts, preventing any loss of confidence, a run on bank dollar accounts and keeping the net open positions in balance.

Under Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe, banking stability has given first place, with reserve sales in September to support banks in a domestic dollar debt restructuring, according to observers.

Pinera often spent the Southern Hemisphere summers near the picturesque lakes that dot Chile’s south, and frequently piloted his own helicopter.

President Gabriel Boric declared three days of national mourning, while preparations have begun for a state funeral on Friday for the former leader, who served two non-consecutive terms between 2010 and 2022.

### India’s official invitation for Sri Lanka’s Marxists seen positive amid political concerns

ECONOMYNEXT – India’s unprecedented invitation to Sri Lanka’s Marxists Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) for an official visit is seen as positive to proceed with Delhi’s plans in the island nation without resistance but also has raised political concerns ahead of presidential polls this year.

The JVP-led coalition National People’s Power (NPP) has gained more popularity in the recent past after the 2022 mass protests that forced former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and his brother, ex-Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, to resign amid an unprecedented economic crisis.

Political analysts and diplomats say JVP has now become a formidable political force in Sri Lanka after the policies of two main parties with center-right and center-left thoughts have failed the nation in their 76 years of ruling since the 1948 independence.

### Consumer food makers witness margin growth amid decreasing input costs

*2024-02-07 05:28:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Consumer-food-makers-witness-margin-growth-amid-decreasing-input-costs/108-276476) · `en`

Consumer food manufacturers are experiencing a gradual increase in profit margins as raw material and ingredient prices decline, coupled with a slight strengthening of the rupee.

This has made imported supplies more affordable compared to a year ago, contributing to the margin expansion.

Since late 2021, companies, especially manufacturers, have been grappling with increasing prices driven by surging global commodity prices, fuelled by heightened post-pandemic demand that has outpaced supply.

These conditions exacerbated in Sri Lanka due to its sharp depreciation in the rupee in 2022, sending the supplier prices by over 100 percent and consumer prices by nearly 70 percent higher.

But it appears that the conditions have begun to improve, according to the performance of Ceylon Cold Stores PLC, one of the largest consumer foods companies which gave a glimpse of how the activities have been during the last three months of 2023.

### Has The JVP Come Of Age Or Is It Bluffing? - EDITORIAL

Anura Kumara Dissanayake is presently in India. The head of the JVP/NPP alliance is actually on an official visit to India, at the invitation of the Indian government. Believe it or not, AKD – as he is popularly known – has in addition to holding discussions with Indian External Affairs Minister, Jaishankar, also held meetings with Indian Defence Advisor, Ajit Doval!

The JVP has come a long way from its initial foray into international analyses where in 1971 it saw Lanka’s only real proletarian worker group (the Indian Tamil estate workers) as Indian fifth columnists; it spoke of uprooting tea bushes and replanting these areas with potatoes.

In the late 1980s, the JVP warned the Sinhala electorate of Indian expansionism, and led a bloody revolt based on its opposition to the establishment of the Provincial Councils system. Today, the JVP has embraced Provincial Councils.

No matter the context – in this case, the Israeli military campaign on Gaza in response to the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7th – such protests held on a special day of the collective memory are an affront to the majority, insensitive and provocative.

### Plans to ship human ashes, drink container to Moon spark legal debate

An array of unconventional, privately funded plans to exploit the moon, including as a site for human ashes and sports-drink containers, has gathered steam in recent years as NASA pushes to make Earth’s natural satellite more accessible.

Concerns about possible gaps in U.S. oversight and legal questions about proper use of the moon have rocketed to the forefront.

Landers built by private companies and emerging space powers are expected in the next few years to join the U.S. flag and other vestiges of past programs to the moon. Other initiatives could include using the moon as a site for capsules of human remains, advertising sports drinks, and maybe even a two-story-tall Christian cross made of the moon’s own dirt.

“We’re just at the beginning of exploring the moon, and ... we need to be careful we’re not contaminating it - not just with biological and chemical contamination but with litter,” said Leslie Tennen, an attorney practicing international space law.

Colombo (News 1st) – Donald Trump’s hopes of avoiding a trial over alleged attempts to falsify the results of the 2020 presidential election that he lost, were dealt a serious blow on Tuesday (6th) when a Federal Court of Appeal handed down a scathing ruling that the former president does not have presidential immunity for such actions, U.S. media reported.

The federal appeals court in the District of Columbia, the nation’s capital, said his immunity claims would reject "the most fundamental check on executive power."

In addition, they said that Trump's stance "would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the President beyond the reach of all three Branches."

The all-female 3-judge bench also gave Trump very little time to appeal to the highest court in the land, with a deadline of next Monday (12th) to approach the Supreme Court to suspend their ruling. Trump’s attorneys said they would appeal.

### Tech horizons: Expanding markets via Singapore and India

*2024-02-06 23:05:03* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Tech-horizons-Expanding-markets-via-Singapore-and-India/4-758191) · `en`

India has rapidly emerged as an economic giant and a technology hub in the past two decades, while Singapore has solidified its position as a regional hub for businesses. Fortunately, Sri Lanka finds itself in close proximity to India and not far from Singapore. Yet, the key lies in leveraging these two economic powerhouses for enhanced collaboration to attract business, investments, and crucially, for market access.

Should Sri Lanka cultivate stronger ties with these hubs, as it stands to position itself as a crucial point in the value chain? Beyond considerations of South Asia and Southeast Asia, looking at the broader Asia Pacific region underscores the significance of partnering with Australia. However, the geographical distance may pose challenges.

Many MPs have spoken to us in the past. The resolution was taken on Monday (5) that he could come to the country as no objection was made on behalf of the Ministry of Defense.

So you can discuss this with the Deputy High Commissioner and provide the appropriate facilities. He has no problems with coming to the country. It is not mandatory for this to be granted exclusively. If he has a passport, he can come to the country.

### Thermal power generation increased to 57%: CEB Engineers’ Union

*2024-02-06 22:59:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Thermal-power-generation-increased-to-57-CEB-Engineers-Union/108-276445) · `en`

Colombo, Feb 06 (Daily Mirror) -  With the advent of dry weather conditions and insufficient rainfall in hydro catchment areas, thermal power generation has risen to 57 percent, leading to a reduction in hydropower generation, the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers' Union (CEBEU) said.

The union told the Daily Mirror that the water capcity of reservoirs were initially at full, reaching 100 percent. However, with the commencement of dry weather conditions, the water capacity has now decreased to 87 percent.

Accordingly, thermal power generation accounted for 56.7 percent, with 45 percent of this generated through the use of fuel, while the remaining power generation was attributed to furnace oil.

Additionally, the Lakvijaya Power Station, commonly referred to as the Noracholai Power Station, plays a crucial role in contributing to Sri Lanka's overall electricity production, generating a substantial 900 MW.

In a democracy, voters too bear responsibility for the governance that results – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

If the true purpose of the Online Safety Act is protecting people, sections 12, 14, 15, and 16 would not be necessary. The purpose of those sections is the protection of vested interests and powerful political and religious groups. The inclusion of such crimes as promoting ‘ill-feeling and hostility between different classes of people by communicating a false statement’, ‘disturbing a religious assembly by a false statement’, and ‘insults or attempts to insult a religion or religions’ indicate that the Government is using a real problem (online crimes) to further a different agenda

### Motion filed against NPP’s registration as a political party

*2024-02-06 22:46:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97063/motion-filed-against-npps-registration-as-a-political-party) · `en`

A motion was filed before the Supreme Court today (Feb.06) challenging the registration of the National People’s Power (NPP) by the Election Commission.

Vinivida Foundation’s secretary Attorney-at-Law Nagananda Kodituwakku has put forward the motion pertaining to a petition filed against the Election Commission’s decision to reject the registration of ‘Vinivida Foundation’ as a political party.

Kodituwakku claims that the registration of NPP, which is part of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), as a political party is completely against the law.

Pursuant to Article 103(2) of the Constitution, registering different branches of one party as separate political parties is in violation of the election laws, he alleges.

It also violates the right to free and fair elections guaranteed by the Constitution, Kodituwakku pointed out further, seeking permission from the Supreme Court to make submissions in this regard.

### Sri Lanka: What is in store for us?

Political leaders lacked wisdom to bring about an all-embracing national revival, but a Sinhala Buddhist revival

To consider what the future holds for Sri Lanka, a glance at its past and present should prove useful as we could thereby contextualise and perhaps begin to understand what that likely future could be. Unless we look at our past mistakes dispassionately, attempt to learn from them and take meaningful steps to re-chart our national course, we are most likely to continue to allow history to repeat itself.
