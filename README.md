Russians are enjoying themselves mocking America and the West: “When has your President ever won 87% of the vote in a poll where 77% of the electorate participated?” Actually, never since 1904 has the turnout at a US election exceeded 66% and, in any case direct comparison in not possible because of the American “Electoral College System”.

### Russian Presidential Election Results

*2024-03-30 18:39:19* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/russian-presidential-election-results/) · `en`

Russia is exultant about the outcome of the Presidential election. The poll was 77% of the electorate and Putin secured 87% of the votes cast; a landslide on both counts. The voting was not rigged; why upset the show when you have this kind of triumph to your credit? To what extent Russia is democratic is a separate matter that I will discuss later on. Russians are enjoying themselves mocking America and the West: “When has your President ever won 87% of the vote in a poll where 77% of the electorate participated?” Actually, never since 1904 has the turnout at a US election exceeded 66% and, in any case direct comparison in not possible because of the American “Electoral College System”.

Colombo, March 30 (Daily Mirror)- India remains unresponsive to the request by Sri Lanka to allow an innocent passage through the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for its fishermen to enter the Arabian Sea, a top source said.

Currently, Sri Lankan fishermen get detained by the Indian Coast Guard when they unlawfully enter Indian waters on their way to the Arabian Sea for fishing activities.

The President embarked on a two-day visit to India in July last year, his first since taking office last year after a tumultuous period that saw the island nation’s economy tank, and protests erupt on its streets leading to ouster of former leaders.

### Baltimore bridge collapse: Insurance loss could hit $3 billion

The collapse of a bridge in the US city of Baltimore will result in the largest single marine insurance loss ever, a British insurance marketplace said.

Six people were presumed dead after a ship crashed into the bridge, and divers have recovered two bodies.

Experts say the damages could cost as much as $3 billion (£2.3 billion).

“I would say it’s certainly going to be one of the largest marine losses in history,” said John Neal, chief executive officer of Lloyd’s of London.

“Of that there is little or no doubt,” Mr Neal told the BBC. “But genuinely the good news is it’s insured.”

Mr Neal said the port and the ship that crashed into the bridge are also insured.

“So from a financial point of view, there is a process that will allow for financial compensation to be made and for the claim to be settled,” he said.

The Maryland Department of Transportation has so far asked the Biden administration for $60m in emergency funds to help clear debris and clean up after the incident.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will replace a ‘special commodity levy’ with a new protectionist tax from January 01, State Minister Ranjit Siyambalapitiya said, which will give extra profit to farmers and keep food prices high.

“The special commodity levy, which was used to protect domestic farmers and domestic producers, will be removed from January 01,” Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

The special commodity levy was advocated by then trade minister Bandula Gunawardana, as the US fired a commodity boom ahead of the collapse of a US housing bubble in a bid to reduce the tax on tax effect of duties, para-tariffs and make food taxes more transparent, according to some analysts.

However, the tax came under fire due to being slapped at midnight as tax payers and the hungry were sleeping and its alleged manipulation to give profits to some importers.
