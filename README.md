### Israeli strike on Gaza school kills 30 people; Military claims it was being used by Hamas

An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed more than 30 people, including 23 women and children, according to local health officials. The Israeli military said Hamas militants were operating from within the school.

The strike came after the military announced a new ground and air assault in several refugee camps in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. ItтАЩs the latest instance of troops sweeping back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite IsraelтАЩs nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.

Witnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.

Despite post-war efforts, land issues persist in Northern and Eastern provinces due to protected forest boundaries and government land releases causing disputes. Traditional agricultural lands lost in areas like Ampara, Moneragala, and Trincomalee remain unrecovered despite government promises. Environmental activists argue for protecting both wildlife and agriculture, highlighting the need for balanced land use policies.

ЁЯЯй

Even after the war in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, the land use issue to maintain the livelihood of the people living in those areas is still an unresolved issue.

This is due to the fact that most of the areas around the settlements are a protected forest. Similarly, the opposition leader said that the government's actions in the release of land for the people would also cause many problems.

The Opposition Leader said this while questioning the North -East Land issue in Parliament on Thursday (06) under the Standing Orders (2).

According to the 1985 Land Scale Map, the protected forest and the rest of the forests will be released. Accordingly, what is the amount of land that has been identified or released by Divisional Secretaries to release?

"I mean, they've put in the work, they've put in such a shift. And to get a win for their country at the World Cup is very, very special."
