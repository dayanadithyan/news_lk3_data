Colombo, April 23 (Daily Mirror) - Some MPs from both Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) have reportedly brokered liquor licences from the government for their cronies for hefty commissions involved, Daily Mirror learns.

The matter came to light after the religious leaders of some districts like Kandy inquired about the purported plans to set up liquor shops and those who helped securing licenses.

In one instance, the prospective businessmen have cited the names of a few SJB MPs who helped them in getting licences. Incensed by the move, the matter has been brought to the notice of SJB leader Sajith Premadasa who has reportedly promised to look into it.

Also, the matter is likely to be raised at the parliamentary group meeting this evening.

Recent statistics paint a stark picture of alcohol-related challenges facing Sri Lanka, with an alarming 83% of deaths attributed to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Alcohol consumption emerges as a prominent risk factor for NCDs, exacerbating health costs and contributing to issues such as road accidents and domestic violence.

Despite its perceived economic benefits, the economic toll of alcohol-related conditions surpasses any revenue generated. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2015 alone, the economic cost of alcohol-related conditions amounted to a staggering $ 885.86 million, equivalent to 1.07% of Sri Lanka’s GDP for that year.

### Why bring science into Buddhist discourse?

Unfortunately, the same mysticism and beliefs that Buddha dispelled two and a half millennia ago have crept back into Buddhism. It is true that some of it has cultural, artistic, or sentimental values. But if the human affliction for beliefs and mysticism, or the shortcomings in our sensory apparatus, are used to exploit the innocent and waste valuable resources that could be put into better use, that would be an insult to Dhamma, its author, and purveyors. The preferred outcome of comparing Buddhism and science would be to enable science savvy young generations to relate to Buddha Dhamma and prevent falling prey to mysticism

The Leader of the Opposition (LoO) having a public debate with Anura Kumara Dissanayaka (AKD) is simply a mismatch and an insult to the office of the LoO.

It is a globally accepted practice that an argument, debate or a discourse on an important issue or subject has to be conducted between two equal individuals, groups or societies. Otherwise, it will become a joke or useless exercise that fails to meet the expected objectives.

The office of the LoO is a statutorily established legislative body headed by the leader of the second largest political party in Parliament and not affiliated to the government in a parliamentary democracy according to Thomas Erskine May (1815 – 1886).

The Leader of the Opposition is the Prime Minister-in waiting in a Westminster form of governance or in any other legislature that practices a form of parliamentary democracy. He or she has a responsibility to safeguard the honour, dignity and statutory obligations of himself and his office.

### Controls on Political Rights and Civil Freedom in Sri Lanka

*2024-04-22 20:26:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181717) · `ta`

Freedom House assesses Sri Lanka's political rights and civil freedom, scoring 54/100 for political rights and 32/100 for civil freedom. The report highlights limitations in media freedom, religious freedom, and expression. The government's handling of post-war issues and economic crises have been criticized. Political rights include formal elections and justified election laws, while civil freedoms include freedom of religion and expression.

🟩

In the International Organization of 'Freedom House', the International Organization of 'Freedom House' states that the media freedom in Sri Lanka, the freedom to follow the desired religion, the freedom of expression and the freedom of gathering is limited.

The 'Freedom House', the NGO, which is based on the United States, has released its assessment report on the freedom of the world this year, in the world, promising human rights and democracy.

In the case of Sri Lanka's assessment, the country's 'independence' has been awarded 54 points for political rights, 40 to 22 for political rights and 32 for civil independence.

“After the 2015 elections, President Maithripala Sirisena's regime appeared in political rights and civil rights in Sri Lanka.. However, the Maithripala Sirisena government has acted as a slowdown in dealing with the aftermath of the war that ended in 2009.

### A Tale Of Shifting Sentiments & Political Chess

*2024-04-22 20:23:15* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/a-tale-of-shifting-sentiments-political-chess/) · `en`

As Sri Lanka prepares for both Presidential and General elections, the political scene is filled with anticipation and speculation. With three leading presidential candidates already announced and the SLPP, or Pohottuwa, yet to name theirs, the stage is set for a compelling contest.

The known presidential candidates are Sajith Premadasa of the SJB, Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the NPP, and Ranil Wickremesinghe of the UNP (TBA?). The potential SLPP candidates range from Basil Rajapaksa, Dhammika Perera, Dilith Jayaweera, to Namal Rajapaksa, or perhaps a wild card pick. Additionally, Janaka Ratnayake is running as an independent candidate, though his motives remain unclear.

Given the current situation, the most strategic move for Pohottuwa would likely be to ally with Ranil Wickremesinghe by merging SLPP and UNP during the campaign to save face. However, the party’s image requires significant transformation to regain trust of the people without using Marcom tactics.

Their presence here confirms that the deep connection between the people of two countries goes back several centuries into antiquity. A time when people and ideas were moving across seamlessly and without the modern impositions that sometimes constrain and restrict easy travel and connections between our peoples. We were reminded of this connect recently by His Excellency President Ranil Wickremesinghe who mentioned that even as we launch the Universal Payments Interface or the UPI in Sri Lanka, which will allow Indian tourists to make payments in Indian rupees in Sri Lanka, there is evidence of the use of each other’s coins or ancient currencies in both India and Sri Lanka deep into our antiquity.
