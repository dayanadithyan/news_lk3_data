As Sri Lanka gets closer to the elections that are supposed to be held at the end of this year, a fierce contest seems to have occurred between the two main opposition parties, the Samaji Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Jathika Jana Balawegaya (NPP). Representatives of the SJB Economic Policy Committee, such as Eran Wickramaratne and Harsha de Silva, seem to have launched a strong attack on the NPP questioning the latter on economic policy matters.

One of the significant themes recurring in this attack is frequent references made to terms such as Socialism and Marxism. Addressing a press conference last week, MP Harsha de Silva stated that if the NPP Economic Council is not willing to come for a debate, the SJB economic committee trio would like to have the debate at the Galle Face Green, with cutouts of Marx, Engels, and Lenin in the opposing side.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has said that this time in the election year, we should fulfill the responsibility of building a government that is responsible for the entire people of the country to stand on their own feet.

He said this in a statement on International Labor Day.

For many years, the people of our country have been celebrating May Day. Without any change in this terrible misery, this year is celebrated by the entire population of our country's workers.. Through the bogus wave, the country put an incompetent president in office.

The rest is being carried out by the shadow of the people who lost the people's decree. In this case, even when May Day is celebrated this year, our working people face huge challenges.

*2024-05-01 02:20:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/182370) · `ta`

"International Labor Day 2024 highlights the struggle for workers' rights amidst global crises. The text emphasizes the need for a new socioeconomic system, criticizing the current regime for its corruption and destruction of the economy. It calls for the establishment of a new people's rule, focusing on a fair, multi-faceted economy based on production, and the eradication of corruption. The message is a call to action for a profound societal, economic, and political change."

🟩

At this moment, celebrating 2024 International Labor Day, the national people's power joins hands with the general public, including working people around the world.

International Labor Day is one of the most loud voice of the working people who are martyred by the working rights of the working class for the rights of the ruling class when the ruling class suppresses the struggle for 8 hours of work.

The general public, including working people around the world, celebrates International Labor Day amidst the greatest crises and pressure of history.

The imperialist regime, the bankruptcy, and the unjust neo -liberal regime and the people of the working people, have been a tradition and a state of distress and disaster.

Although the world is traveling in the 21st century, the majority of the world's population has been transformed into poor people.

The number of people who die all over the world is hungry and the number of people who die. Children are expelled from education around the world.

Tourism Minister Harin Fernando has pledged to address technical issues  of the new visa system by May 7. This comes amid concerns of potential losses of 230,000 tourist arrivals and US$ 425 million in tourism earnings for the year.

Sri Lanka shifted to a platform operated by IVS-GBS and VFS Global mid this month from the electronic travel authorisation system operated by Department of Immigration & Emigration. Under the new platform, a multiple entry visa was introduced at a cost of US$ 75, with each stay limited to maximum of 60-days.  However, single entry visa which was earlier offered by ETA was not among the options.

An additional US$ 18.5 fee also charged as a service fee to the operator.

“We do have a slight problem since we changed the visa system. We are clearly feeling the heat. On a personal level, I am very disappointed that this happened, but I have a collective responsibility as a cabinet minister,” he said.

Inflation measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) fell after declining 1.9 percent in March, but the prices measured annually recorded a 1.5 percent increase.

The inflation measured annually declined to 0.9 percent in March due to both lower prices and higher base effects last year.

As a result, there were expectations for slightly higher prices in April from the level recorded in March.

Food prices rose by 2.9 percent in April from a year ago, cooler than 3.8 percent in March while non-food prices rose by 0.9 percent, after declining by 0.5 percent a month ago.

However, measured on a monthly basis, food prices have been on a deflation for the third month in a row. In April food prices fell by 1.0 percent.

### May Day: Not capitalism, but dogmatism has almost killed trade union movement

Rarely any other time,  save the campaign rallies, would the politicians speak so passionately about labour rights as they would today, the International Workers’ Day. But, in this quirky interest reeking of opportunism, there is a sense of irrelevance of what May Day was supposed to be.

Consider today, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa and a horde of Ministers who would ride their Pajeros to the podium while the party members who are bused from four corners of the country march under the scorching sun to mark the historic gains of the labour movement born out of a campaign for eight- hour work day.

### Are doctors’ unions making threats again? - EDITORIAL

The doctors in our country seem to be girding up their loin cloths for a possible fight with the government in the aftermath of a government decision to set up a medical faculty at the ‘National School of Business Management (NSBM) and at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU).

A study by ‘The National Library of Medicine’ shows currently around 1,450 doctors enter the health system annually and the national doctor-to-patient ratio is 1:671 to 1,000 patients. Not surprisingly there is a shortage of doctors in the country.

According to the 2019 GCE (A/L) Examinations Analysis Book 20,287 students sat for the biology science (medical stream). In 2023, 40,329 students took the Bio Science stream. Of this number only 23,178 were able to gain entry to the available facilities in the country.

In other words we have a huge gap between the number of candidates attempting to enter the medical faculties of the university in the country and the numbers they are able to absorb.
