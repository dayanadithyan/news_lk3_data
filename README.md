### Two UK teens get life sentence for ‘sadistic’ killing of trans girl

*2024-02-02 22:17:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96960/two-uk-teens-get-life-sentence-for-sadistic-killing-of-trans-girl) · `en`

Two British teenagers were ordered to be detained for life on Friday for the “sadistic” knife murder of a 16-year-old transgender girl that shocked the country.

Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both 16, killed Brianna Ghey in Warrington, northwest England, in February last year, in what the judge called a planned “frenzied and ferocious” assault.

Ghey was stabbed 28 times in the head, neck, back and chest after believing she was going to meet a friend. Her body was discovered by dog walkers in a park.

“You both took part in a brutal and planned murder which was sadistic in nature,” judge Amanda Yip told the pair as she handed down the sentence at Manchester Crown Court.

Yip said that Jenkinson’s “primary motivation” had been a desire to kill, but the pair had also been motivated in part by Ghey’s transgender identity.

The judge ruled that Jenkinson must serve a minimum of 22 years before being considered for release, while Ratcliffe must serve at least 20 years.

Ahead of elections next week, Pakistan’s caretaker administration is making binding plans for a new government to sell loss-making Pakistan International Airlines, according to the minister in charge of the process and other officials.

But Pakistan, in deep economic crisis, agreed in June to overhaul loss-making state-owned enterprises under a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $3 billion bailout.

The government decided to privatise PIA just weeks after signing the IMF agreement.

The caretaker administration, which took office in August to oversee the Feb. 8 election, was empowered by the outgoing parliament to take any steps needed to meet the budgetary targets agreed with the IMF.

Actor Vijay has launched a new party called "Tamil Nadu Victory Corporation". He has registered his party's name with the New Delhi Election Commission.

You all know that the "Vijay People's Movement" has been doing various people's welfare programs, social services and relief assistance for many years.. However, it is impossible for a voluntary organization to bring in complete social, economic and political reforms. It requires political power.

You all know about the current political environment. Administrative disorders and “corrupt political culture”

On the one hand, on the one hand, on the other hand, the "divided political culture" that is trying to divide our people through caste and religious religions, on the other hand, is full of obstacles for our unity and progress.

It is a real fact that everyone in Tamil Nadu, especially in Tamil Nadu, is longing for the basic political change in a selfless, open, casteist, visionary, bribery and corrupt management.
