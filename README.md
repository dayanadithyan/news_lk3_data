More than a fifth of the world’s migrating species are at risk of going extinct as a result of climate change and human encroachment, according to the United Nation’s first-ever report on migrating animals published on Monday.

Billions of animals make journeys across deserts, plains or oceans every year to breed and feed, and “unsustainable” pressures put on migratory species could not only see their populations dwindle, but also disrupt food supplies and threaten livelihoods, the report said.

Of the 1,189 species covered by a 1979 U.N. convention to protect migratory animals, 44% have seen numbers decline, and as many as 22% could vanish altogether, the report added.

The numbers were based on assessments and data provided by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as well as the Living Planet Index, which collates population numbers for more than 5,000 species from 1970 onwards.

### Central Bank continues to collect foreign exchange from domestic market

*2024-02-13 00:13:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Central-Bank-continues-to-collect-foreign-exchange-from-domestic-market/108-276901) · `en`

Continuing its months-long streak, the Central Bank purchased another US $ 245.3 million in foreign exchange from the domestic banking system and sold nothing in January, ending as a net purchaser of foreign currency to begin the year.

This is a sign of improving foreign currency liquidity in the domestic banking system further into the new year, when the Central Bank ended up purchasing US $ 1,895.87 million in 2023, reaching a record level, given the trying conditions prevailed in foreign currency conditions for most part of the year.

The Central Bank recently said these substantial net absorptions contributed immensely for it to be able to rebuild the reserves to US $ 4.4 billion by the end of 2023.

A month later, the reserves further rose by just shy of US $ 100 million to US $ 4,491.0 million by the end of January 2024.

*2024-02-13 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Living-Happily-Off-Loans/172-276861) · `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe presented his latest policy statement while opening the new Parliament session on February 7. Contrary to his previous policy statements and special statements on the economy it did not contain so many plans that his government is going to implement, yet it has much food for thought.

Wickremesinghe at the outset painted a rosy picture on the situation. He said that the inflation, which stood at a daunting 50.6 per cent last year, has dramatically decreased to a mere 6.4 per cent, today. Food inflation, previously at an alarming 54.4 per cent, has seen a remarkable decline to just 3.3 per cent. The exchange rate has shown positive movement, with a dollar worth Rs. 362 in the past and now valued at Rs. 314. The current situation is vastly improved, with foreign exchange reserves standing at $ 4.4 billion by the end of

### Putting Fetters on Live-In Relationships

*2024-02-13 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Putting-Fetters-on-Live-In-Relationships/172-276862) · `en`

It is feared that an Indian State’s restrictive law on live-in relationships may be replicated by other conservative State governments in India

Earlier this month, the Legislative Assembly of Uttarakhand, a North Indian State at the foot of the Himalayas, passed a Uniform Civil Code (UCC). While most of the provisions were progressive, there were some which put fetters on “live-in” relationships, to the extent of criminalizing them. These provisions have come in for much criticism on the grounds that they invade privacy and individual liberty guaranteed by the Indian constitution.

The law defines living-in as a “relationship between a man and a woman who cohabit in a shared household through a relationship in the nature of marriage.”

### Electing the next President; our Hercules to clean the Augean stables

If you vote for corrupt reasons, you will elect corrupt leaders and you will be their eternal slaves – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

We must be confident that the President we choose can be trusted with extraordinary powers in situations where the safety, or the liberty, of our country is truly in grave danger. We must also be confident that in giving such powers, which must be limited in scope and time, we do not leave room for an opportunistic leader to violate human rights and not abide by the constitution under the pretext of saving the country from imminent, inescapable, and mortal danger. Who among the candidates can we trust with extraordinary powers?

### Rescheduling of debt expeditiously is key to recovery

*2024-02-12 23:27:27* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Rescheduling-of-debt-expeditiously-is-key-to-recovery/4-758402) · `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe said the finalisation of debt restructuring could be completed by the first half of the year, which is going beyond the earlier anticipation for it to be completed within the first quarter

President Wickremesinghe said in Parliament last week that “Sri Lanka expects to implement a debt restructuring framework within the first six months of 2024, expressing confidence that the nation was recovering from its worst financial crisis in decades.” The Sri Lankan economy is clearly showing signs of recovery from the severe economic crisis, with improvements in our foreign exchange positions and current account deficits. But a significant challenge remains in managing the country’s large sovereign debt and inequities of the partial coverage of the domestic debt optimisation program. Therefore we need to show some tangible progress in the debt rescheduling.
