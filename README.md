Gotabhaya Rajapaksa faces legal action for crimes, including allegations of war crimes and human rights violations. His book reveals a conspiracy to remove him, but lacks evidence. Critics argue the military did not suppress civilians, and Gotabhaya misunderstood the roles of the police and military. Despite allegations, the judiciary may not provide justice for victims.

As the name of the book, this book creates some interesting reading, though everything is revealed by the leader who has been removed from the post.

This is not the approval to enrich the unworthy person to make money and thereby make the tragedy that has caused this trivial issue

Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has no definitive evidence that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has no conclusive evidence to prove these allegations, except for the exit of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, except that the struggle of thousands of people landed on the streets of thousands of people went to the military and the military's military.

As far as Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is under war crimes, the military has not intervened to suppress civilians.

In his book, Gotabhaya emphasizes that Defense Secretary Kamal Gunaratne and the Chief of Staff Savendra Silva have not taken decisive action against the demonstrators.

In 2018, тАЬEUROPOLтАЭ headquartered in Hague, Netherlands, a key organization established to prevent and combat serious internationally organized crimes, cybercrime and terrorism, had clearly defined the difference between cyber-dependent crimes and cyber-enabled crimes . As defined by them, any crime that can only be committed using computers, computer networks or other forms of information communication technology was named as cyber-dependent crimes and traditional crimes facilitated by the Internet and digital technology were categorized as cyber-enabled crimes. So, there are two categories of cybercrimes and these definitions are internally accepted.

Illicit intrusion and hacking into computer networks, disruption of computer functionality with the spread of viruses or other malware and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks which can paralyze service delivery by computers are some examples for cyber-dependent crimes.

### Sri Lanka тАУ WHITHER GOES THOU?

*2024-03-11 13:16:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lanka-whither-goes-thou/) ┬╖ `en`

I plagiarized the title of this article from a Latin quote тАЬQuo VadisтАЭ. It was an immensely popular movie in the 50s starring Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr. According to the film, Quo vadis (Whither Goes Thou) were the words exchanged between God and St Peter. The first apostle was fleeing from Rome along the Appian Way to Brindisi to take a boat and escape to Palestine. Peter went back to Rome where he was crucified. Today there is a small chapel on that road where Peter turned back. It is called the Church of Domine Quo vadis.

Now you know I admitted I plagiarized. DonтАЩt throw stones at my aeroplane. I have already said my mea culpa.Times have become difficult and often impossible to cope with. Whatever winds blow across our paradise isle, they are all filled with maelstroms that have so many manifestations. I do not think I am wrong if I say that even the winds are deceitful. We have been in turbulence for more years than we can recall.

### The Election-Economy Nexus and the Politics of JVP Apology

*2024-03-11 13:15:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-election-economy-nexus-and-the-politics-of-jvp-apology/) ┬╖ `en`

The economy is the base; everything else is superstructure. That is the old Marxian concept, simply put. The base ultimately determines what goes on in the superstructure, which includes among other things the state and its institutions, as well as their processes and functions. Included are the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, and their elections and appointments. Over time, there have been modifications to the old concept.

Borrowing from FreudтАЩs psychoanalysis, Louis Althusser, the French Marxist, used the concept of over-determination to suggest that there are multiple causes producing an effect, i.e., political outcomes are тАШover determinedтАЩ by many causes besides the economy, although the economy could be singularly significant. Neo-Marxists have provided another angle in that just as the base could determine the goings on in the superstructure, what goes on in the superstructure also have implications for the base.

Both chairmen were elected to their positions, and the SLPP, with its majority representation in the committees reflecting that of the parliament, was able to secure the election of their candidates. The election of COPA chairman MP Lasantha Alagiyawanna didnтАЩt spark as much controversy, as he had previously held the position.

March 11- (CNN) John Cena bared it all at the Oscars on Sunday while presenting the award for best costume design.

The actor appeared on stage during the telecast to present the award for best costume design hilariously appearing to wear nothing at all.

No really, Cena appeared on the stage at the yearтАЩs most prestigious event in HollywoodтАж almost entirely naked.

The showтАЩs host Jimmy Kimmel set up the bit by sharing a little bit of Oscars history, nodding to the 1974 Academy Awards when a streaker ran across the stage. Kimmel jokingly said, тАЬCan you imagine if a nude man ran across the stage today? WouldnтАЩt that be crazy?тАЭ

From the corner of the stage, Cena peeked his head out and told Kimmel he didnтАЩt want to тАЬdo the streaker bit anymore.тАЭ

тАЬItтАЩs an elegant event. Honestly, you should feel ashamed right now for suggesting such a tasteless idea,тАЭ Cena complained. тАЬThe male body is not a joke!тАЭ
