Comets are made up of dust, frozen gases, ice and rocks bound together following the formation of the solar system, NASA says.

### Don’t cry for me Sri Lanka, if wrong people are elected - EDITORIAL

Elections have been the main focus among frontline political parties these days with the Presidential election scheduled for this year.

According to the Sri Lankan Constitution “the poll for the election of the President shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office.”

Since the incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe is holding office “only for the unexpired period of the term of office” of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the term in this case is considered to be the term of President Rajapaksa who was sworn in on November 18, 2019. Hence the next Presidential election should be held between September 18 and October 18 this year.

### African debt crisis and lessons for Lanka

In the last two decades since Arrighi wrote his seminal article, Sri Lanka and many African countries have been on the same path of commercial borrowing. The process has resulted in the extraction of more wealth and further exacerbated balance of payment problems, even as the elite in these countries sprawl in luxurious consumption.

Crisis and despair push us to learn rapidly and that is true of debt crisis as well. But whom do we learn from and whom do we work with to find solutions to the crisis?

The IMF team in all their pomp are again visiting Sri Lanka. Their tutelage continues to be the same for us as many other countries in debt distress—austerity, repaying creditors and promoting free markets.

Patients who went to the hospital for treatment at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital Cancer Division gathered in front of the hospital on Monday morning (18), accusing the hospital of the hospital.

It is customary for more patients to treat the disease from Trincomalee, Ampara and other parts of the country for the treatment of the hospital.

In this case, the radiation engine is often damaged and the person who is not here is unable to get treatment on the day since it is not here from Jaffna or Colombo.

As a result, the hospital has to go to the hospital in the morning and wait till night and get treated for the night.

Therefore, the machine should have been appointed here as the machine is often damaged and the patients have to wait until the engineer is dark or three days later.

Therefore, the hospital administration focused on this and obtained a solution to this.
