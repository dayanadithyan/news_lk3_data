Israel has no intention to slow down its genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip, even after a series of blows it suffered this week in the form of the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor seeking arrest warrants for its leaders and the recognition of Palestine as an independent state by three European countries: Ireland, Norway, and Spain.

There is no letup in IsraelтАЩs killer intent. The Gaza Strip has been made uninhabitable. It is heartbreaking to watch on Al Jazeera the wounded, the sick, the elderly, and little children running for cover in search of not-to-be-found safety amid a severe shortage of food, fuel, and medicine, among other essentials.

### On a тАШdividedтАЩ road and heading for trouble - EDITORIAL

The Sri Lanka Police has caused a stir in the motoring scene by making great efforts to strictly follow an old law that relates to the ownership of vehicles. What stirred a hornetтАЩs nest in social media was when a female police officer checked a vehicle recently and demanded to know details of vehicle ownership.

Now we come to know that the police have powers vested in them to check vehicle registration details courtesy a law passed in Parliament many years ago. This law was possibly passed to prevent unlawful activities linked to vehicles; example theft and unlawful assembling of vehicles.

However, the incident made motorists wake up to the requirement of keeping the ownership details of vehicles in order. In the past there was a habit of delaying the updating of the vehicle registration book when ownership of the тАШmachineтАЩ changed. Now new owners of vehicles have to be more responsible in having vehicle registration documents in order.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs cabinet of ministers had given approval to develop grid scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) to maintain power system stability as variable renewable power plants expand, a government statement said.

Sri Lanka is expecting to connect large volumes solar and wind power between 2024-2030 to meet a 70 percent renewable electricity target, but due to variability of wind and solar (non-firm energy), the system stability is undermined.

As a result, the power grid has to be able to absorb the shocks from non-firm energy.

Battery energy systems storage (BESS) is one of the solutions identified in a long-term generation plan, the statement said.

A committee appointed to study the issue had recommended building battery banks.

The cabinet had approved the development of battery storage system as public private partnerships or private projects. (Colombo/May24/2025)
