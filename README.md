On September 6, 2023, the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights castigated Sri Lanka saying that the country suffers from a continuing accountability deficit- be it for war crime atrocities, more recent human rights violations, corruption, or abuse of power- which must be addressed for the country to move forward.

In Sri Lanka‚Äôs near three decade-long civil war, around 40,000 Tamil civilians reportedly died of military attacks. Thousands of others were wounded, while some were critical. Women suffered the most, and it is alleged that rape was used as a weapon of war.

Hundreds of Sinhalese civilians too were killed by armed Tamil militant groups -mainly the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)- during the course of the three decade-long war.

Since the civil war ended, there has been no credible government mechanism set up to apprehend these different merchants of death.

In a recent column, I discussed the worsening American economy and dire forecasts of a looming recession. I said too, that there is more to the health of a country than money and economics. In fact, when the going is good and the sun is shining, countries and people get carried away and start making mistakes that lead to their downfall and hard times.

Political analyst Ian Bremmer has much that is enlightening to say about the socio-political malaise that troubles the US. In a YouTube interview with Tom Bilyeu, he said that the biggest threat to the US comes not from Russia or China but from within‚Äì the US is waging war against itself.

### A time to remember: the therapeutic power of emotion recollected in not-quite tranquillity

Beaten, broken and bruised: but carrying on with courage and compassion ‚Äòbeyond checkpoints‚Äô

In a nation notorious for not remembering many matters of importance beyond the news cycle, remembering right becomes a sacred trust and duty. Sri Lanka has faced many challenges as a country and a people in its chequered history since independence, and forgetfulness must not be added to its woes.

Thus a poignant memoir of episodes still not out of mind comes as a welcome reminder that once upon a time in our erstwhile island paradise, there was ‚Äòsomething rotten in the state‚Äô. It was not a people, political party or government, or even a separatist movement that escalated into terrorism, which were solely to blame for the phenomenon we ironically recall as a ‚Äòcivil war‚Äô.

### Citizens should be aware of the burden of total Government expenditure

Higher the Government expenditure, greater the burden being borne by people

American economist William A. Niskanen, writing to the American Economic Review in 1968 (available at: https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~jkbrueck/course%20readings/Econ%20272B%20readings/niskanen.pdf) presented a model in which the governments and government agencies have incentives to enlarge their budgets. He called this the budget maximising behaviour of bureaus ‚Äì spending units in the governments ‚Äì to enhance the personal benefits for themselves rather than for the citizens. This model, further developed by him, was published later in 1971 in book form under the title ‚ÄúBureaucracy and Representative Government‚Äù and in 1973 as a Hobart Paperback edition under the title ‚ÄúBureaucracy: Servant or Master?‚Äù.

Sylhet, March 24 (ICC) - Sri Lanka's Dhananjaya de Silva and Kamindu Mendis became just the third pair to partner in two 150-plus run stands in the same Test.

Bangladesh achieved early success on day three of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Sylhet, when they sent back night watchman Vishwa Fernando for merely four.

However, just like the first innings, Sri Lanka skipper Dhananjaya de Silva and Kamindu Mendis came together and helped Sri Lanka out of the trouble.

When their partnership hit the 150-run mark in the 77th over, it was only the third time in the history of the game that two 150-plus stands had been achieved in the same Test by the same pair.
