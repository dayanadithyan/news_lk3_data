Colombo, April 18 (Daily Mirror) - The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) arrested two suspects, including a retired Major of the Sri Lanka Army for fraudulently obtaining money from individuals promising employment in the Russian army.

The arrest came in the wake of reports on rackets involving the trafficking of Sri Lankans for military service in Russia, all without government oversight or intervention.

Earlier, it was reported that 17 Sri Lankans had returned home after fleeing military camps in Russia. It was reported that several other Sri Lankans still remain trapped in similar military camps, unable to return to the country.

In March, Al Jazeera reported that hundreds of Sri Lankans are serving with the Russian military in Ukraine, with casualties among them. Many were enticed by lucrative salaries and the prospect of Russian citizenship.

### IMF ready to support Sri Lanka‚Äôs discussions with bondholders

April 18 (Reuters) The International Monetary Fund (IMF) stands ready to support Sri Lanka's discussions with international bondholders and will provide a formal assessment after the parties reach a tentative agreement-in-principle, an IMF spokesperson said on Thursday.

"We hope an agreement consistent with the parameters of the IMF-supported program and official creditors' Comparability of Treatment requirements can be reached soon, ahead of completing the second review under the program," the spokesperson said.

Sri Lanka said it failed to reach an agreement with bondholders to restructure about $12 billion debt earlier this week, raising concerns there could be a delay in the island nation receiving a third tranche of its $2.9 billion IMF program in June.

The government said one of the main stumbling blocks had been that the "baseline parameters" of the bondholders' plan had not matched those embedded in its IMF program.

Colombo, April 18 (Daily Mirror) - Strict measures will be taken against anyone causing inconvenience to foreigners visiting the country. She expressed concern over a group of individuals engaging in such indecent behavior, labeling them as disgraceful, Tourism State Minister Diana Gamage said.

"These individuals show no respect towards foreigners. Their actions pose a threat to our country's reputation and cannot be tolerated," she stated.

The State Minister highlighted that modern-day tourists are well-informed and not easily misled. She stressed the importance of maintaining Sri Lanka's reputation for friendliness and hospitality.

"With nearly 700,000 foreigners having visited by April, it's crucial to prevent such actions from tarnishing our image and damaging our economy," Gamage warned.

Recently, there have been two reported incidents in Kalutara and the Aluth Kade area of Colombo where tourists were treated poorly and charged excessively for meals.
