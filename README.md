එලෙස නීතිවිරෝධී ලෙස රන් ආනයනය කළ ආයතන 5ක් මේවනවිට හඳුනාගෙන ඇති බවද මුදල් රාජ්‍ය අමාත්‍යවරයා වැඩිදුරටත් සඳහන් කළේය.

අමාත්‍යවරයා වැඩිදුරටත් පවසා ඇත්තේ එම ආයතන අතරින් එක් ආයතනයක් සඳහා රුපියල් මිලියන 179ක දඩයක් ගෙවීමට නියම කර ඇති බවය.

මින් ඉදිරියට රන්භාණ්ඩ ආනයන සිදුකරන බලපත්‍රලාභී සියලු ආයතන මෙම නීති විරෝධී ක්‍රියාවන් වෙතින් මිදිය යුතු බවද එහිදී අමාත්‍යවරයා අවදාරණය කර සිටී.

එසේම අදාළ ආයතන ඍජුව රන් ආනයනය නොකර තුන්වැනි පාර්ශ්ව වෙතින් මිලදීගන්නා රන් සඳහා ද නිෂ්පාදන වාර්තා සළකාබලා දඩ මුදල් අය කරගන්නා බවද අමාත්‍යවරයා පවසයි.

නීතිවිරෝධී ලෙස රට තුළට රන් ආනයනය කිරීම සම්බන්ධයෙන් පසුගිය වකවානුව තුළ අනාවරණය වූ සිදුවීම් සැලකිල්ලට ගෙන මෙරට රන් ජාවාරම වැළැක්වීමේ අරමුණින් ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතාගේ උපදෙස් මත රන් භාණ්ඩ ආනයනයේ දී හඳුනාගත් සීමා පනවමින් අතිවිශේෂ ගැසට් නිවේදනයක් ද පසුගිය වර්ෂයේ මාර්තු මාසයේ දී නිකුත් කර තිබේ.

Preliminary findings released on Wednesday of an investigation into a Singapore Airlines flight hit by severe turbulence last week showed that a rapid change in gravitational force and a 54-metre altitude drop caused injuries.

A 73-year-old passenger died of a suspected heart attack and dozens were injured after flight SQ321, flying from London to Singapore, encountered what the airline described as sudden, extreme turbulence while flying over Myanmar.

The May 21 flight on a Boeing 777-300ER plane carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew diverted to Bangkok for an emergency landing after the plane was buffeted by turbulence that flung passengers and crew around the cabin, slamming some into the ceiling.

“The aircraft experienced a rapid change in G (gravitational force) … This likely resulted in the occupants who were not belted up to become airborne,” the Singapore Transport Ministry said in a statement.

### US billionaire plans submersible trip to Titanic wreck

BBC - A US luxury real estate billionaire and a deep-sea explorer are planning to travel in a submersible to explore the Titanic.

Ohio tycoon and adventurer Larry Connor and Patrick Lahey, co-founder of Triton Submarines, say they want to take a sub to a depth of around 3,800m (12,467ft) to see the shipwreck in the North Atlantic Ocean.

The private submersible industry was rocked after five people were killed when a vessel built by OceanGate imploded en route to the Titanic last year.

A spokesman for Mr Connor’s company said on Tuesday that the proposed voyage would only take place once a vessel was fully certified by a marine organisation.

The pair plan to use a sub dubbed the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer – the “4000” refers to the depth in metres to which the craft can safely be deployed.

The Titan submarine built by OceanGate was constructed of carbon fibre and was only certified to 1,300m, far short of the depths of the ocean floor where the Titanic wreck lay.
