Judges at the top U.N. court on Wednesday found that Russia violated elements of a U.N. anti-terrorism treaty, but declined to rule on allegations brought by Kyiv that Moscow was responsible for the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014.

In the same ruling, judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found that Russia had breached an anti-discrimination treaty by failing to support Ukrainian language education in Crimea after its 2014 annexation of the peninsula.

The decisions were a legal setback for Kyiv. The court rejected Ukraine’s requests to order reparations for both violations and only ordered Russia to comply with the treaties.

Ukraine had filed the lawsuit at the ICJ, also known as the World Court, in 2017, accusing Russia of violating an anti-terrorism treaty by funding pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine.

### The easy way with Aloe Vera

*2024-01-31 21:02:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-easy-way-with-aloe-vera/) · `en`

This week I’m touching on beauty tips, connected with aloe vera, as most homes have aloe vera plants, in their garden, and so you don’t need to stretch your budget to buy expensive veggies to enhance your beauty. Moreover, aloe vera is a medicinal plant with antioxidant and antibacterial properties.

Cut an aloe vera leaf and scoop out the transparent, fleshy part, with a spoon. Apply this gel on your face, focusing on the affected area. Leave it on overnight and then rinse it off in the morning. Repeat every day until the lesions heal.

two tablespoons of pure aloe vera gel with four tablespoons of honey and half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder or oil. Apply the mixture to the affected area and wash it off after 10 minutes. Do this every alternate day.

¼ teaspoon of lemon juice with 02 tablespoons of fresh aloe vera gel and apply the mixture to the affected area. After it dries, wash if off. If you are going out, use a sunscreen as lemon makes your skin photosensitive.

Batik shirts, dresses, sarees, handbags, etc., have always had a special place in the fashion scene here.

However, of late, I’ve noticed a new trend in the local fashion scene…with the younger generation making batik outfits their priority.

Probably with the awful heat we are now experiencing, batik dresses are cool and comfortable.

Maneka Liyanage, who is very much in the news these days with her Beauty Tips column in the Thursday Island, which has turned out to be very popular with readers, did a modelling session recently with batik dresses, courtesy of INCHDesigner.

She says she fell in love with the outfits, the moment she saw them, and decided to do a modelling session for readers of The Island.

In addition to her weekly Beauty Tips column, Maneka has also taken the spotlight in Glam Scene and was featured as a fashion model, as well, in the Thursday Island, in November 2023.

Written for International Day of Education on 24 January 2024.

This blog explores how technological resources can help fill gaps in access and reduce inequalities in education in Sri Lanka.

Despite the recent uptake of educational technology (edtech) in Sri Lanka, it does not cater to the needs of diverse groups of vulnerable children in the country.

Evidence from MENA and Asia reveals the importance of targeted edtech initiatives in ensuring inclusiveness in education in Sri Lanka.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing economic crisis have resulted in over two years of learning loss in Sri Lanka, with its effects being more on vulnerable children due to the gaps in inclusiveness in education.

Access to inclusive and equitable quality education is a fundamental human right. It is crucial for achieving developmental goals like ending poverty and helping people move up in society.

Not only the rights were awarded to the company after significant delay but the company which got the rights was not ranked lowest in the financial bid.

The company holding the broadcast rights in the technical bid was disqualified.

The ARY / IPG, which has broadcast rights with the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) for the Lanka Premier League (LPL) had given a bid lower by 1.5 million US dollars. Translate Group, which ironically has TPT as 178/180 in technical bid. SSV is a leading production company and has more experience in televising the matches but could not meet the success.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s inflation in the 12-months to January 2023 by the widely watched Colombo Consumer Price Index was 6.5 percent, higher than the statutory 5 percent target but below the 2.0 percent variation allowed.

The index rose 2.9 percent in the month, with a 3 percent hike in value added tax hitting most goods and services and some that did not have value added tax earlier.

The CCPI index was up 6.0 percent since September 2022, when monetary stability was reached.

The central bank has been conducting broadly deflationary policy, triggering a balance of payments surplus and had also allowed the exchange rate to appreciate, which helps reduce prices measured in Sri Lanka rupees.

Food prices rose 3.8 percent during the month, with some vegetables seeing steep increases after floods. Non-foods rose 2.5 percent. (Colombo/Jan31/2023)

*2024-01-31 18:13:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-trade-minister-opts-for-drastic-caa-restructuring-149410/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Trade Minister Nalin Fernando has opted for drastic changes in the Consumers Affairs Authority (CAA) after repeated failure of the state-owned firm to protect the customers from higher prices and ensuring fair market competition in the island nation.

The CAA fixed prices as a knee jerk reaction to price fluctuations under the direction of ministers in successive governments, but the moves only resulted in black market and exorbitant profits for sellers, economists and analysts have said.

Minister Fernando admitted that the objectives of the CAA, which comes under the purview of his ministry, has not been met.

“There are a lot of female graduates appointed to CAA and they are unable to do the raids to control the market manipulation,” including hoarding, selling at higher prices, and healthy competition, Fernando told EconomyNext.

### Health workers to resort to another strike

*2024-01-31 18:10:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Health-workers-to-resort-to-another-strike/108-276055) · `en`

Colombo, Jan 31 (Daily Mirror) - In a decisive move set to reverberate across the nation's healthcare landscape, at least 72 trade unions within the health sector have announced plans for an island-wide strike commencing at 6:30 a.m. tomorrow (01).

The primary demand fueling this action is the long-standing dispute over the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance.

Despite assurances from the highest levels of government, including promises of dialogue upon the President's return from official overseas duties, healthcare workers remain disillusioned by the lack of substantive engagement.

The trade unions assert that no formal discussions have materialized since the President's return, exacerbating the brewing discontent among healthcare professionals.

However, the All Ceylon Nurses' Union, a prominent voice in the healthcare arena, has opted not to takepart in the scheduled strike.

### Online bill sends negative signal on Sri Lanka reforms and recovery: US envoy

ECONOMYNEXT – A law to control Sri Lanka’s online discourse labelled the Online Safety Bill will send a negative signal on the island’s reforms and recovery, the US ambassador to Colombo, Julie Chung has said.

The controversial bill on which many provisions were struck down by the Supreme Court as violating the constitution was passed amid strong protests by opposition legislators.

Civil society organizations have said it has a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech, and global tech companies also raised serious concerns.

“When major global tech companies characterize the bill as “unworkable” and stifling innovation and democracy, instead of actually addressing online crimes, frankly this sends a negative signal in Sri Lanka’s path towards reform and recovery,” Chung told members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka according to the text of her speech.

### Sri Lanka insurers to be hit by directive to remit all riot, terrorism income to state re-insurer

ECONOMYNEXT – Profits of Sri Lanka insurers will be hit by a directive to remit 100 percent of premiums for strike, riot, civil commotion and terrorism cover to state-run National Insurance Trust Fund from an earlier 12 percent, Fitch Ratings said.

The segment has generally been highly profitable in recent years due to relatively low claim incidence, though there were significant claims in May 2022 as a result of anti-government protests, Fitch said.

“However, the effect on non-life insurers’ profitability and risk-based capital adequacy ratios could be reduced if they are able to raise premium pricing,” the rating agency said.

“The impact will also depend on the level of commissions motor insurers receive from NITF for providing SRCCT cover.”
