For about two years, I also studied using [kerosene] oil lamps. Why do you need to iron clothes? Wear linen [clothing].”

### ’’Better if he did another job’’ - Hasaranga lashes out at umpire

Dambulla, Feb 22 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka's T20 captain lashed out at the umpiring during the third and final T20I against Afghanistan at Palekelle on Wednesday, claiming that a missed no ball call in the final over influenced his team's three-run defeat.

With 11 runs needed in the final three balls for Sri Lanka to win, a full toss from Afghanistan's fast bowler Wafadar Mohammad soared above the waist of all-rounder Kamindu Mendis, as he stepped out of the crease and attempted to heave the ball onto the leg side.

With the no ball not signaled, Kamindu Mendis pleaded with umpires Ravindra Wimalasiri and square leg umpire Lyndon Hannibal to review the call, but the umpires chose not to.

"To be honest, this is not something that can happen in an international cricket match. If it was just above the waist, then it's understandable, but had that gone a little higher, it would have hit the batsman on the head!" a visibly annoyed Hasaranga told journalists after the match.

What is a time-tested truism when it comes to any form of colonization? A deep desire to exercise maximal control. The British imperial project, for example, was full of many structures and laws that were precisely meant at reaching this objective – controlling the lives of the colonized, to the best possible extent. Sex-segregated school systems, developing a herd mentality among the local populace, brutal repression of resistance movements, ecocide, genocide, indentured labour, the denigration of centuries-old local languages, literatures, and knowledge systems – to name but a few – were among the strategies they deployed everywhere in their empire. In many countries, it goes without saying that we are still grappling with the long-term consequences of this highly exploitative project.

On a monthly basis, as measured by the National Consumer Price Index, the prices rose by 3.0 percent in January, from 1.4 percent a month ago, reaching the highest increase recorded in more than a year.

The prices measured by the broader consumer price index followed the closely watched Colombo Consumer Price Index released three weeks ago, which also had a reading of 6.4 percent for January, from 4.0 percent in December.

The recent price pressures aren’t surprising, as the authorities were expecting the price gauges to reach in the neighbourhood of 7.0 percent in both January and February.
