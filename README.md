Many have been my blessings over the past 15 years after a fresh lease of life afforded me in 2008. Spending quality time with my family including my grandchild more recently as well as attending spiritual retreats, with the latest ending on Australia Day long weekend, have been standouts.

Retreats are a time to reflect on life and the mysterious workings of God in one’s life. It was definitely the mercy of God that afforded me a fresh lease of life after my abductors were hell-bent on literally silencing me after torture. God works on earth through angelic as well as human beings through their acts of goodness – the essence of God. At Christmas, the angels announced, “Glory to God on high and peace to men of goodwill”. Hence, a good person irrespective of their faith is already inclined towards God.

### The easy way with Aloe Vera

*2024-01-31 21:02:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-easy-way-with-aloe-vera/) · `en`

This week I’m touching on beauty tips, connected with aloe vera, as most homes have aloe vera plants, in their garden, and so you don’t need to stretch your budget to buy expensive veggies to enhance your beauty. Moreover, aloe vera is a medicinal plant with antioxidant and antibacterial properties.

Cut an aloe vera leaf and scoop out the transparent, fleshy part, with a spoon. Apply this gel on your face, focusing on the affected area. Leave it on overnight and then rinse it off in the morning. Repeat every day until the lesions heal.

two tablespoons of pure aloe vera gel with four tablespoons of honey and half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder or oil. Apply the mixture to the affected area and wash it off after 10 minutes. Do this every alternate day.

¼ teaspoon of lemon juice with 02 tablespoons of fresh aloe vera gel and apply the mixture to the affected area. After it dries, wash if off. If you are going out, use a sunscreen as lemon makes your skin photosensitive.

### Batik…back in fashion

*2024-01-31 20:59:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/batikback-in-fashion/) · `en`

Batik shirts, dresses, sarees, handbags, etc., have always had a special place in the fashion scene here.

However, of late, I’ve noticed a new trend in the local fashion scene…with the younger generation making batik outfits their priority.

Probably with the awful heat we are now experiencing, batik dresses are cool and comfortable.

Maneka Liyanage, who is very much in the news these days with her Beauty Tips column in the Thursday Island, which has turned out to be very popular with readers, did a modelling session recently with batik dresses, courtesy of INCHDesigner.

She says she fell in love with the outfits, the moment she saw them, and decided to do a modelling session for readers of The Island.

In addition to her weekly Beauty Tips column, Maneka has also taken the spotlight in Glam Scene and was featured as a fashion model, as well, in the Thursday Island, in November 2023.

### Edtech for marginalised children in Sri Lanka: Insights from MENA and other Asian countries

Written for International Day of Education on 24 January 2024.

This blog explores how technological resources can help fill gaps in access and reduce inequalities in education in Sri Lanka.

Despite the recent uptake of educational technology (edtech) in Sri Lanka, it does not cater to the needs of diverse groups of vulnerable children in the country.

Evidence from MENA and Asia reveals the importance of targeted edtech initiatives in ensuring inclusiveness in education in Sri Lanka.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing economic crisis have resulted in over two years of learning loss in Sri Lanka, with its effects being more on vulnerable children due to the gaps in inclusiveness in education.

Access to inclusive and equitable quality education is a fundamental human right. It is crucial for achieving developmental goals like ending poverty and helping people move up in society.
