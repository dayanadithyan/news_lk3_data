Political turmoil ensued within the United National Party (UNP) as its general secretary's comments on the presidential election were met with rejection by parliamentary parties. Opposition MPs called for clarity, leading the President to distance himself from the remarks, assuring no election postponement plans exist. Senior UNP members were tasked with conveying the President's stance, while insiders dismissed the general secretary's statement as personal, denying any intention to delay the election.

üü©

Political sources were in great disturbance yesterday after the UNP general secretary Palitha Ranga Bandara commented on the presidential and the presidential election in Parliament.

The parties in Parliament completely rejected the announcement of the General Secretary of the United National Party and appealed for the president to immediately respond.

Mandatory reserve ratio for banks was also left at 2.00 percent

Says the Board observed the need for a further reduction in market lending rates

As widely expected, the Central Bank left its key policy rates unchanged at the policy meeting¬†held this week.

This was largely to provide the previous rate cuts to do their work in bringing down the rest of the market lending rates further as inflation expectations remain well anchored.

At the third monetary policy board meeting held on Monday, the Central Bank decided to keep the current Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) and the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) unchanged at 9.50 percent and 8.50 percent respectively.

At least 45 people were killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, while hundreds more were treated for severe burns, fractures and shrapnel wounds.

Mr Netanyahu said the strike was a ‚Äútragic mishap‚Äù but added: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt intend to end the war before every goal has been achieved.‚Äù

He said it was vital that Israel took ‚Äúevery precaution possible‚Äù to protect civilians, and insisted that the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) were using their ‚Äúbest efforts not to harm those uninvolved‚Äù in the conflict.

The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday, at Algeria‚Äôs request, to discuss the Rafah strike.

In a statement on Monday, UN secretary general Ant√≥nio Guterres said the strike had ‚Äúkilled scores of innocent civilians who were only seeking shelter from this deadly conflict‚Äù.

Spain, Ireland and Norway have formally recognised a Palestinian state, in what they say is an attempt to refocus attention on efforts to find a political solution to the war in the Middle East.

They hope by acting together they will encourage other European countries to follow suit, in a diplomatic push that could help secure a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages held by Hamas.

The symbolic decision has provoked a furious row with Israel‚Äôs government which has accused all three countries of rewarding terrorism.

Israel has withdrawn its ambassadors from Ireland, Norway and Spain and formally reprimanded their envoys in Tel Aviv. All three were summoned to Israel‚Äôs foreign ministry last week to be shown footage of the 7 October attacks in front of the media.

The visionary visionary who claim to be leaders of non -academic associations are responsible for this condition. This situation should be condemned by non -academic staff and university administration.

Legal action should be taken against the leaders of the non -academic union. Otherwise, we, as a dean, will become part of this human rights violation.

Some accuse people that they have no peace of mind to celebrate festivals. But the government, led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, has created an environment where Vesak and Poson are celebrated only to celebrate the festival.. So I would say that those who make the accusations compare the current status last year. The peace of mind that people have lost have been restored.

### Tea and lack of empathy

For years, even before our country received independence, it was the income from the tea industry which formed the backbone of our country‚Äôs economy. Even after independence, it was the income from tea that provided the main export earnings that kept the economic wheels of the country turning.

Even today tea provides the third highest portion of the Lankan economy behind the earnings of expatriate workers and the textile trade.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs tea export earnings crossed US $ 1 billion for the first time in history in 2008. Sri Lanka is the first country to achieve this feat.

During the financial year 2022 to 2023, according to the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, export earnings from tea made up 12% of merchandise exports, an increase of 3.57 % year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to US$ 111.12 Mn in December 2023 compared to December 2022.

This is despite a drop in production in 2022 because of the industry being hit by a fertiliser shortage caused by an ill-advised agrochemical ban.

To end the intergenerational degradation of the country‚Äôs youth, the government should create 250,000 university and vocational training opportunities. Else, we are doomed as a nation

For a country that takes pride in its free education system, Sri Lanka has done a miserable job in putting its human capital to productive work.

That is the story since the independence, but let‚Äôs leave the first three decades defined by quasi-socialist policies and skyrocketing fertility growths, which created enormous pressure on the state. But the story has not changed much since the economy was liberalized, and population growth is well under control- fertility growth now is barely at replacement level or less.

### Corporate head office ‚Äì creator or destroyer of value in a conglomerate

The corporate centre of a conglomerate can be value accretive or value destructive to the conglomerate

The best parent companies are those which create more value than any other rival if they owned the same business. Such businesses are deemed to have parenting advantage. In the same way that business strategy gives rise to competitive advantage, it is the corporate level strategy of a conglomerate which gives life to the parenting advantage of a constituent subsidiary. A business will enjoy a parenting advantage only if a parenting opportunity exists. When a corporate parent identifies such opportunities and addresses them with actions which give a positive net present value it will improve the value of the business and, subject to the idiosyncrasies of the market, improve the market value of the parent‚Äôs share too

Former Cabinet Minister, Nuwara Eliya district Parliamentarian and Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) leader Arumugan Thondaman would have celebrated his 60th birthday on 29 May, if he were alive today. Thondaman passed away due to a cardiac arrest four days before his 56th birthday four years ago on 26 May 2020. He was serving as a Minister in the cabinet of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa at the time of his death. This week‚Äôs ‚ÄúPolitical Pulse‚Äù ‚Äì with the aid of my previous writings ‚Äì focuses on Arumugan Thondaman to denote his 60th birth anniversary.

Let me begin with two points about his name and pet name. Thondaman‚Äôs first name Arumugan is spelled with an N at the end. However it is frequently misspelled by the media as Arumugam with an M instead of N. I too have been guilty of this error at times. I remember his illustrious grandfather Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman gently admonishing me once ‚ÄúHe is Arumugan not Arumugam‚Äù.

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has roots that stretch back decades, to a time when the geopolitical landscape of Europe was dramatically shifting. In the aftermath of the Cold War, as the Soviet Union disintegrated, new alliances and understandings were formed. Among these was an untold agreement between Russia and NATO, which plays a crucial role in understanding the current crisis.

As the Berlin Wall fell and the Iron Curtain was lifted, the world witnessed a remarkable transformation. The Soviet Union‚Äôs collapse left the United States as the sole superpower, with the promise of a new era of peace and cooperation. However, this period of optimism was underpinned by delicate negotiations and promises, many of which were not formally documented but were significant in shaping international relations.
