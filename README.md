Lion Brewery (Ceylon) PLC, in its latest Annual Report, has reported achieving a significant 20% growth in its international business and a substantial 28% revenue growth in USD year-on-year.

This achievement is particularly noteworthy given the challenging global economic conditions. The international business has not only been a significant driver of revenue for the Company but also a notable source of foreign exchange for Sri Lanka. This success was largely attributed to the restructuring of the international business strategy, focusing on key growth regions such as Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, while exiting less profitable regions.

The Brewery’s decision to streamline its market presence from 35 to 17 countries has allowed for concentrated investment and effort in markets with the highest growth potential.

To do so development banking plays a major role and if this ETB was serious about it, development banks should have been one of those institutions created, within the bill. Therefore, development banking should be a major focus and not just an afterthought. All this would come up when developing a plan, which does not seem to be on the table
