ECONOMYNEXT – Two-time Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s less-than-expected win at the India’s parliamentary election may not change its foreign policy towards Sri Lanka, but aggressive push for connectivity and infrastructure projects in the island nation could be slowed, analysts say.

Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost its outright majority in the election and found itself reliant on support from regional parties.

Broader coalition National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 293 seats in the 543-member lower house of parliament, where 272 constitutes a simple majority.

However, Modi’s BJP won only 240, less than outright majority, making two regional parties’ leaders kingmakers in the alliance with their 28 seats in total.

India has been pushing for land, oil, gas, and power grid connectivity in Sri Lanka along with securing lucrative renewable energy and port projects in partnership with Indian private sector.

### The government should stop issuing liquor permits in public places

*2024-06-08 07:57:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185577) · `ta`

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa criticizes the government for issuing liquor licenses in non-tourist areas, arguing it contradicts national development goals. Religious leaders, civilians, and civil organizations also oppose these permits, especially near schools. The government is urged to cancel such permits and halt political bribery related to alcohol distribution, focusing instead on appropriate locations near the tourism industry.

🟩

The government distributed liquor license is against the policy of creating an inadequate nation. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said that permission has been granted within the villages that are not carried out in the tourism industry.

The government has rapidly launched a plan to issue a liquor license in the past. This is against the principle of creating an inadequate nation. Providing these facilities focusing on the tourism industry is part of the tourism industry, but permits have been granted within the villages that are not carried out.

Other religious leaders, civilians and civil organizations have expressed their opposition to this.. Therefore, if these permits are issued in areas where the tourism industry is not carried out in areas where the schools are adjacent to the schools, the government should take steps to cancel the liquor permits issued in the absence.

### Sri Lanka May 2024 remittances rise 13.5-pct to $544mn

*2024-06-08 06:32:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-may-2024-remittances-rise-13-5-pct-to-544mn-167007/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s remittances coming through official channels gained 13.5 percent to $544.4 million in May 2024 compared to the same month last year, helped by more expatriates using the official banking channels.

The remittances in the first five months were $2,624.4 million, 11.8 percent up from the same period last year, the official data showed.

The remittances have risen continuously after the central bank gave up a parallel exchange rate regime, which compelled most expatriates to switch informal Undiyal and Hawala money transfer methos.

The island nation witnessed a 57 percent jump in remittances coming through formal banking channels to $5.97 billion in 2023, from $3.8 billion a year earlier, helped by elimination of parallel exchange rate.

Sri Lanka’s external sector has now recovered after the central bank started to run balance of payments surpluses following a decision to end money printing to sterilize interventions made with Indian Asian Clearing Union money.

*2024-06-08 03:33:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84130) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s political stage was enlivened last week by the solo performance of  United National Party (UNP) general -secretary Palitha Range Bandara. Addressing a media briefing on 28 May, the policeman turned politician came out with a suggestion that the presidential election due this year and the Parliamentary election scheduled for next year should be postponed while the terms of office for both should be extended by two more years. The former Puttalam district and ex-state minister wanted a resolution passed by Parliament to that effect and ratified by the people at a referendum.

The essence of what Palitha Range Bandara proposed was this -. Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the country’s leadership at a time of a great economic crisis. Considerable progress  has been achieved by the  Wickremesinghe Govt to remedy the situation. A degree of economic stability has been established but more time is needed to ensure greater economic stability.
