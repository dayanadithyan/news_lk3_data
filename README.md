The US has approved plans for a series of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials have told the BBC’s US partner CBS News.

The strikes will take place over a number of days, officials said, and weather conditions will likely dictate when they are launched.

It comes after a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday.

The US blamed an Iranian-backed militia group for that attack.

That group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards force. It has said it was responsible for Sunday’s strike.

Iran, meanwhile, has denied any role in the attack which injured 41 other US troops at the military base, known as Tower 22.

US officials have said that US intelligence believes that the drone used to attack the facility was manufactured by Iran - and is similar to the drones Iran has been sending to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

### Efficient public sector operations possible with fully digitalized workforce of 200,000: Suresh Shah

*2024-02-02 06:24:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Efficient-public-sector-operations-possible-with-fully-digitalized-workforce-of-200-000-Suresh-Shah/108-276176) · `en`

The public sector can smoothly run with a workforce as low as 200,000 persons through digitalization, against the current public sector workforce of 1.3 million, according to the Head of State-Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit (SOERU) Suresh Shah.

He noted that even without digitalization, the public sector workforce can be cut by half and the public services can be maintained efficiently.

Sri Lanka’s bloated public sector shrunk by 135,000 to 1.393 million by the end of 2022 from 1.401 million in 2021 and from 1.528 million in 2020 as the government started to reduce the excess cadre while freezing recruits.

Shah claimed that if the public service is fully digitalized, the public sector cadre could be brought down to 200,000 people.

However, Shah was quick to rule out any radical move to reduce employment in the public sector.

The forthcoming general election holds promise for Sri Lanka’s impoverished majority – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

As the spectre of a general election looms over Sri Lanka, the political elite and the economically powerful are gripped with panic. Recent newspaper articles have been rife with speculations about the potential upheaval that such an election could bring. However, amidst their apprehension, it’s crucial to recognise that elections present a beacon of hope, particularly for the impoverished masses of Sri Lanka.

The anticipation of a general election has sent shockwaves through the corridors of power, primarily because it threatens to dismantle the entrenched privileges enjoyed by a select few. Despite the prevailing economic and debt crises plaguing the nation, a significant segment of society continues to benefit from a system riddled with corruption, mismanagement, and poor governance.

BANGKOK (Reuters): Thailand’s central bank chief, under fire from the prime minister for not cutting rates, said slower-than-expected economic growth was not a crisis as portrayed by the government, nor would it be revived by its quick-hit stimulus measures.

The Bank of Thailand’s current policy rate is broadly neutral, Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput told Reuters on Tuesday ahead of the central bank’s next rate meeting on 7 Feb. adding that the country was not facing a deflationary situation.

His comments came after Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin – a real estate mogul and political newcomer – urged the central bank to cut the policy rate, which is at a decade-high of 2.50%, to help revive the economy.

“If you want to raise the long-term potential growth rate, you’ve got to do the structural stuff. You’ve got to get productivity up. But the way to get there is not just by engaging in short-term stimulus type measures,” Sethaput said.
