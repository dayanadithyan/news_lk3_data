ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s key state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have reversed its 2022 losses and made profits in 2023, State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said after the government was forced to remove all the subsidies on energy following an International Monetary Fund deal.

Sri Lanka’s state-owned enterprises in 2022 made big losses as currency depreciation hit dollar loans, posting a loss of 743 billion rupees in 2022. Semasinghe said the same SOEs will report a profit of 456 billion rupees in 2023.

Such losses in the past have led the government to borrow more before an unprecedented economic crisis in 022.

“The Minister stated that the reason for recording this profit was the setting of cost-based prices at institutions such as the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC),” the Finance Ministry said in a statement.

### Sri Lanka bans corporal punishment for children

*2024-04-30 12:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-bans-corporal-punishment-for-children-160605/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will ban corporal punishment in all spheres, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.

“The Cabinet approved amendments to the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code to prohibit corporal punishment in all spheres,” Wickremesinghe said on X.

This “Paves the way for legal protections to ensure that no child in Sri Lanka suffers physical or mental violence, aligning with our commitment to safeguard the rights and well-being of every child.”

Sri Lanka allows corporal punishment under section 341 of the Penal Code which makes exceptions for a schoolmaster while section 82 of the Penal Code makes exceptions for an ‘act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or person of unsound mind, by or by consent of guardian.’

However, this has long been considered as a violation of human rights with article 19 of the United Nations Conventions of the Rights of the Child, prohibiting all forms of violence towards children. (Colombo/Apr30/2024)
