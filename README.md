Speaking at a press conference held in Colombo, Rajkumar Rajiv Khan said this

In May 2009, the three decades of Sri Lanka ended in the worst of the Sri Lankan government.

The Tamils were killed and killed as a bomb without being known as the citizens of their country.

Due to lack of food, they drank rice mixed with water and died.

After 15 years of 15 years, the government has not given any justice to them.

It is the right to provide drinks during the process of violating fundamental rights.

In this country, the state of Tamil Nadu is in a state of disrepair.

We appeal to ensure that the commemoration events are held across the country during the week of Mullivaikkal.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe‚Äôs government has been implementing IMF-led pricing policies on utilities and the Water Supply Ministry has already come up with a formula.

However, the formula developed with the help of the Asian Development Bank, has yet to be implemented.

The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS & DB) increased the water tariff sharply in August 2023, claiming that the operating cost had been increased owing to high interest payment for bank loans and increased electricity prices.

‚ÄúThe biggest cost that we had was the energy cost. That is the cost we have been working on with and just to be transparent, according to the current formula, there was a 14% increase three months ago in the price of water,‚Äù Thondaman told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo.

### Would you stop the events of the Vesak festival, just as the porridge was disrupted due to the infection?- The Question of the Blessed

*2024-05-13 13:10:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183395) ¬∑ `ta`

The Vesak festival events are at risk due to police blocking porridge distribution to prevent infection spread. Aruttanda Ma Sathivel, a social justice activist, questions if the National Organization for the release of political prisoners should halt these events. The Sampur police have issued an injunction against sharing Mullivaikkal with salt porridge, fearing infection risks. This situation is likened to the challenges faced during the Corona period. The Tamil homeland commemorates the historical bargain and seeks justice for the unjustly killed and missing, using salt as a symbol of their voice for justice. The arrest of Tamil National People's Front (TNA) Assistant Secretary Harihara Kumar and female social activists, including a schoolgirl, is condemned. The Mullaitivu Police Station is urged to support the Mullivaikkal commemoration events, aiming to raise awareness among the international community.

### All Blacks captain Cane to retire from international rugby

*2024-05-13 10:36:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/All-Blacks-captain-Cane-to-retire-from-international-rugby/108-282471) ¬∑ `en`

Sydney (AFP) - New Zealand captain Sam Cane will retire from Test rugby at the end of 2024, the side said Monday, calling time on a World Cup winning 12-year international career.

"Having played 95 Tests - 27 as captain - the 32-year-old has decided to focus on spending more time with family and sign a long-term contract with Suntory Goliath in Tokyo," New Zealand Rugby said in a statement.

The All Blacks haven't played since they were defeated in the Rugby World Cup final by South Africa last year and Cane was already on a sabbatical in Japan.

Cane said the prospect of a three-year deal with the high-spending Tokyo club was too good to pass up.

"I had to weigh up everything and, in the end, with a young family, it seemed like the best decision to help set up our future," he said.

"It was a very hard one because I love the teams that I represent here in New Zealand."

The number of people killed by flash floods and cold lava flow from a volcano in western Indonesia over the weekend has risen to 41 with 17 more missing, a local disaster agency official told AFP Monday.

Hours of heavy rain caused large volcanic rocks to roll down one of Indonesia‚Äôs most active volcanos into two districts on Sumatra island Saturday evening, while flooding inundated roads, homes and mosques.

‚ÄúData as of last night, we recorded 37 dead victims... But from this morning it has grown again, the figure reached 41 (dead),‚Äù Ilham Wahab, West Sumatra disaster mitigation agency official, told AFP.

Rescuers were searching for 17 still missing, three in Agam district and 14 in Tanah Datar, both the worst-hit areas of the flood and home to hundreds of thousands of people, he said.

Ilham could not confirm the number of locals evacuated because officials had encouraged ‚Äúpeople to evacuate to relatives‚Äô places, which are safer‚Äù than tent shelters in heavy rains.

The Parliamentary Committee has approved a proposal to issue vehicle permits at concessionary prices to MPs, despite economic challenges. This decision, aimed at meeting the demand for such permits, follows similar practices in public service sectors. Over 100 MPs from various parties have requested Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to allow them to import vehicles. The Speaker will likely forward this request to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who, as Finance Minister, can pass the resolution. This comes after MPs elected in the 2020 general election were affected by a ban on vehicle imports due to the economic crisis. The government is considering lifting this ban, which could benefit MPs once implemented.

The main evidence reveals that the Parliamentary Committee has approved the proposal to issue a vehicle permit at concessionary prices, despite the rise of living costs and bankruptcy.

The committee, which examines the needs of MPs, said that the decision was taken advantageous of the demand for such permits in accordance with similar facilities provided to the administrative standards in various sections of the public service.

More than 100 MPs have represented various parties and submitted a letter to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to grant permission to import their useless vehicles.

The Speaker is expected to write a letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has been authorized to pass the resolution as the Finance Minister after the approval of the Council Committee.

May 13 (Reuters) - Kuwait formed a new cabinet headed by Sheikh Ahmad Abdullah Al-Sabah, according to a royal decree issued Sunday.

Emad al al-Atiqi, Anwar Ali al-Mudhaf and Abdullah Ali al-Yahya retained their posts as oil, finance and foreign ministers respectively, according to the decree from the Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.

Sheikh Ahmad is the emir's nephew and was previously appointed prime minister in April.

"The Prime Minister and the ministers must implement this decree," stated Sheikh Mishal in the decree.

The new government comes shortly after the emir dissolved parliament indefinitely on Friday, after a prolonged period of bickering between the government and the elected parliament.

The emir also suspended some articles of the constitution, including those stating that a new parliament must be elected within two months of a dissolution and that laws must be approved by the parliament and the emir.
