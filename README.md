The average person does not give sufficient, or worse still, any thought to the need for conservation of water in the home, in agriculture, in industry or in its other uses. Conservationists say that a dangerous situation is looming ahead of us, individuals, nations and the world itself as the demand is increasing at an alarming rate while water supplies remain near constant.

*2024-03-16 22:15:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-greatest-comeback-story-never-told/) ┬╖ `en`

President Biden gave the final State of the Union speech of the first term of his presidency on Thursday, March 7, 2024. It was probably the most important speech in his long and distinguished career in public service, which spans over half a century. Biden represented Delaware in the Senate from 1973 to 2009, served as Vice-President in the administrations of President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017, and the incumbent 46th President since January, 2021.

President Biden is certainly no stranger to one of the most hallowed annual rituals in America, the State of the Union Speech, a ceremonial occasion to illustrate U.S. democracy in action. He was completely at ease in an environment most familiar to him, and his fiery performance in this vital speech tended to lay to rest immediate misgivings about his advanced age and ability to run for a second term.

India, March 16 (BBC) - India's general election will take place in seven phases over April and May, the Election Commission says.

More than two dozen opposition parties, including the Congress, have formed a coalition bloc - called the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance or INDIA - to take on the BJP at this election.

India's lower house has 543 elected seats and any party or a coalition needs a minimum of 272 MPs to form a government.

The BJP, led by Mr Modi, had won a staggering 303 of the 543 seats in the 2019 election. This year, the party says its target is to win at least 370 seats.

Colombo, March 16 (Daily Mirror) - A recent survey conducted by the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) has unearthed concerning trends regarding democratic governance in Sri Lanka.

The survey, titled тАШSurvey on Democracy and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka,тАЩ involved 1,350 participants across 25 districts in January, shedding light on shifting attitudes toward authoritarianism and declining trust in democratic institutions.

According to the findings, approximately 1 in 10 Sri Lankans expressed a preference for authoritarian rule, marking a significant increase since 2018.

The CPA, a prominent policy think-tank based in Colombo, emphasized that the spike in support for authoritarianism coincided with the political upheaval during the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government in 2018.
