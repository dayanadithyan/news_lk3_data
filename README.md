The NUA expressed serious concerns regarding the government's recent endeavours to sell the beleaguered national carrier, shedding light on the staggering debt exceeding USD 1 billion that plagues the airline.

Attributing these financial woes to years of mismanagement exacerbated by political interference, the NUA underscored the pivotal role played by the tenure of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Specifically, the NUA recalled the appointment of Rajapaksa's brother-in-law to the chairmanship of SriLankan Airlines, despite lacking any pertinent experience or expertise in aviation management. The result, according to the NUA, was nothing short of a disastrous mishandling of the national airline's affairs.

### Sri Lanka private credit down in Jan 2024

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs private credit fell 52.2 billion rupees in January 2024, after climbing 97.5 billion rupees in December and 62.9 billion in November, while central bank credit was overall deflationary, supporting monetary stability and reserves, official data shows.

Sri LankaтАЩs private credit spiked in December amid anecdotal evidence that import containers also surged ahead of a value added tax hike.

If the credit surge was linked to consumption imports, the loans will be liquidated as goods are sold.

Before the тАШage of inflationтАЩ and chronic balance of payments deficits (aggressive outright purchases through open market operations to maintain a bureaucratically decided policy rate), some classical economists (including Adam Smith, in line with the the so-called тАШreal bills doctrineтАЩ) supported limited note issue banking on a similar principle, analysts say.

Before the 1860s, Bank of England customers were bill brokers and discount houses, not banks which gave investment credit.

Putin, a former KGB lieutenant colonel who first rose to power in 1999, made it clear that the result should send a message to the West that its leaders will have to reckon with an emboldened Russia, whether in war or in peace, for many more years to come.

The outcome means Putin, 71, is set to embark on a new six-year term that will see him overtake Josef Stalin and become RussiaтАЩs longest-serving leader for more than 200 years if he completes it.
