### கங்கையில் யாரும் குளிக்க வேண்டாம்

*2024-02-29 16:02:01* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/கங்கையில்-யாரும்-குளிக்க-வேண்டாம்/175-334001) · `ta`

இந்தியாவின் புனித நதிகளில் ஒன்று கங்கை. இமயமலையில் இந்த நதி உருவாகி பல மாநிலங்கள் வழியாக கடந்து சென்று மேற்கு வங்க மாநிலத்தில் கடலில் கலக்கிறது. கங்கை நதியில் நீராடினால் அனைத்து பாவங்களும் போகும் என்பது இந்துக்களின் நம்பிக்கை. இதனால் ஒவ்வொரு ஆண்டும் பல கோடி பேர் கங்கை நதியில் நீராடுகிறார்கள்.

இந்நிலையில் மேற்கு வங்கத்தில் பாயும் கங்கை ஆறு பொதுமக்கள் குளிக்க தகுதியில்லாத இடமாக மாறியுள்ளதாக தேசிய பசுமைத் தீர்ப்பாயம் அறிவித்துள்ளது. மேலும், ஒருநாளைக்கு 258 மில்லியன் லிட்டர் சுத்திகரிக்கப்படாத கழிவுநீர் நேரடியாக ஆற்றில் கலக்கிறது. இதனால் பாக்டீரியா வைரஸ் பரவல் அதிகம் இருப்பதால் பொதுமக்கள் யாரும் கங்கை நதியில் குளிக்க வேண்டாம் என எச்சரிக்கை விடுத்துள்ளது.

தெற்கு சீனாவின் குவாங்டாங் நகரில், நடை பயிற்சி சென்று கொண்டிருந்தார் லின் என்ற பெண். அவர் கையில் பிடித்திருந்த நாய், ஒரு கடைக்கு அருகே வந்தபோது திடீரென அவரது பிடியில் இருந்து நழுவி கடைக்குள் ஓடியது. அங்கு வைக்கப்பட்டிருந்த லொட்டரி டிக்கெட் ஒன்றை கவ்விப்பிடித்தது. இதையடுத்து அவர் அதை வாங்க வேண்டிய கட்டாயம் ஏற்பட்டது.

இறுதியில் அந்த சுரண்டல் லொட்டரிக்கு 139 டொலர் பரிசு விழுந்திருந்தது. இதனால் லின் மிகவும் மகிழ்ச்சி அடைந்தார். இதனால் மறுநாள் அவராகவே தனது நாயை மீண்டும் கடைக்கு அழைத்துச்சென்று ஒரு லொட்டரியை கவ்வச்செய்தார்.

அப்போது, அவருக்கு 4 டொலர் பரிசு விழுந்தது. அதிர்ஷ்டத்தை தேடித்தந்த நாய்க்கு பரிசுத்தொகையில் ஒரு பகுதிக்கு உணவு வாங்கிக் கொடுத்ததாக லின் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

அரசியலமைப்பு பேரவையின் தீர்மானம் ஜனாதிபதிக்கு அறிவிக்கப்பட்ட பின்னரும் தேசபந்து தென்னகோனை பொலிஸ் மா அதிபராக நியமிப்பதற்கு சபாநாயகர் அனுமதி வழங்கியதாக அவர் செய்தியாளர் சந்திப்பில் தெரிவித்தார்.

”தேசபந்து தென்னகோனை ஐஜிபியாக நியமித்த விவகாரத்தில் சபாநாயகரின் நடவடிக்கை அரசியல் சாசனத்தை மீறும் செயலாகும். சமநிலை ஏற்பட்டால் மட்டுமே சபாநாயகர் வாக்களிக்க முடியும். அரசியலமைப்பு சபைக் கூட்டத்திலும் சபாநாயகர் வாக்களிக்கவில்லை. சபையின் முடிவு ஜனாதிபதிக்கு அறிவிக்கப்பட்ட பின்னர் அவர் தனது ஒப்புதலை அளித்துள்ளார் " என்று அவர் கூறினார்.

பொலிஸ் மா அதிபரை நியமிப்பதில் சிக்கல் எழுந்துள்ளதாகவும், அதனை உயர் நீதிமன்றம் சரி செய்யும் என நம்புவதாகவும் சில்வா தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

An organiser of a “white party” in Sri Lanka has apologised after the event sparked a backlash online.

The event’s advertisement specified a white dress code, but also had a line saying “Face control: White” - which was largely interpreted to mean the event was open only to white people.

An organiser later said the event was “a bad idea”, adding that it was meant to bring together expatriates.

The party, which was due to take place last Saturday, was cancelled.

Backlash against the event was swift, with many on social media calling it “disgusting” and “racist”.

“I know not all expats are like this... but this sort of thing should be stopped fast and stopped hard,” said one local restaurant owner.

“How dare they come to a brown country and ban the people of that country,” another social media user said on Facebook.

Writing on Instagram under the handle geo_ecstatic, a man who said he was an event organiser, said there was “no malice or racism” in planning the party.

### Trump is disqualified from Illinois ballot, judge rules

(Reuters) -An Illinois state judge on Wednesday barred Donald Trump from appearing on the Illinois’ Republican presidential primary ballot because of his role in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but she delayed her ruling from taking effect in light of an expected appeal by the former U.S. president.

Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter sided with Illinois voters who argued that the former president should be disqualified from the state’s March 19 primary ballot and its Nov. 5 general election ballot for violating the anti-insurrection clause of the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment.

The final outcome of the Illinois case and similar challenges will likely be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard arguments related to Trump’s ballot eligibility on Feb. 8.

Porter said she was staying her decision because she expected his appeal to Illinois’ appellate courts, and a potential ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court.

Colombo, Feb 28 (Daily Mirror) -  In the wake of disquieting findings on the health risks associated with certain COVID-19 vaccines, the Sri Lankan health authorities seem to be turning a blind eye as they go unresponsive to the queries.

Despite Daily Mirror's efforts to prompt the authorities to articulate their position on the recent findings, responsible officials have failed to respond, leaving the masses in dilemma.

Since the breakout of Covid-19, sceptics around the world expressed their doubts about the Covid infection to Covid Vaccine, putting forward so many “conspiracy” theories.

However, looking back, many people now seem to see a coercing tactic in making people accept the vaccine, which was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the highest authority in the current medical industry- at the time of administering. Pfizer was approved in 2021 while Moderna was approved by the FDA in 2023.
