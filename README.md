### Plantation workers' salary increase -Harini Amarasuriya

*2024-05-10 02:14:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183101) · `ta`

Harini Amarasuriya criticizes the government's plan to increase plantation workers' daily wage to 1700 rupees, arguing it's a deceptive move. She suggests changing the basic salary instead. The government's gazette notification, she claims, is a ploy to mislead workers, as plantation companies are likely to challenge it. She also criticizes an amendment aimed at protecting night-shift women workers, arguing it fails to address their real issues like transport facilities.

🟩

Gazette Notification on Plantation Workers' Salary Increase Action. National People's Power Member Harini Amarasuriya said the government should change their basic salary if they need to carry out a salary increase.

He said this while addressing the debate on the Parliament on Thursday (9).

The government has issued a gazette notification to increase the daily salary of plantation workers to 1700 rupees. This is the play that deceives workers. If the government is increasing the salaries of plantation workers, they must change their basic salary and thereby convert the base salary to 1700 rupees.

On the contrary. Salary Increase is a play -labeled play by the president on May 1st. Everyone, including the President and the Minister of Labor, know that plantation companies go to court against the gazette notification. They know that this cannot be implemented.

So the salary increase for plantation workers is a gazette notification to mislead the plantation workers and deceive them.

### How filmmakers and lawmakers view people’s trust - EDITORIAL

*2024-05-10 01:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/How-filmmakers-and-lawmakers-view-peoples-trust-EDITORIAL/172-282288) · `en`

Sri Lankans may be wary of trusting their instincts given their bad experiences with politicians. This is a country where the majority of the citizenry hasn’t had the fortune of receiving a university education. Hence, for some of them, trust must be built on instinct.

This instinct is the tool people relied on when electing Gotabaya Rajapaksa as president. He was the last Executive of this country who was elected through the vote of the people. The instinct in people that this president would deliver proved the former horribly wrong.

This is a country where its regime initiates programmes in a hurry and then repents. The latest is the new visa system where users are subject to paying higher fees. The new visa portal- which operates online- replaces the old system where visas were issued more efficiently through an Electronic Travel Authorization system. Now there is all-round criticism aimed at the new visa system.

With or without a ceasefire deal, Israel has vowed to launch its grand invasion into Rafah, the Gaza Strip’s southernmost 64-square-kilometre area, where more than 1.5 million repeatedly battered and displaced Palestinians are crammed. Israeli troops have moved into Rafah and are now controlling the eastern part of the Rafah border with Egypt.

Those who closely follow Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza know that Rafah has been under regular Israeli bombardments almost from the beginning of the war, even though the Benjamin Netanyahu government had declared southern Gaza, including Rafah, a safe zone and urged the people in northern Gaza to move there.

Dr. KK Arulanandan warns that prolonged high sea temperatures could destroy Sri Lanka's coral reefs, threatening marine life. Coral reefs require a stable 27-28°C to form, and excessive heat causes them to lose color and bleed, indicating destruction.

🟩

It is reported that if the current increased sea temperature lasts a month, the coral reefs around Sri Lanka will be at risk.

The newly appointed Director General of the National Water Research Research Development Management (Nara), Dr. KK Arulanandan, said this to an English media.

The temperature of the sea should be fluctuated at 27-28 degrees Celsius for the formation of coral reefs.

He pointed out that if the current increased temperature lasts a month or more, coral reefs are expected to be destroyed.

When the heat of seawater increases more than usual, corals lose their color and begin to bleed. This will help you know the destruction of coral reefs. If the coral reefs are destroyed, a large number of marine life, including fish, will be affected. ”. Remble

The legality of a non-citizen serving as a political party secretary in Sri Lanka is unclear due to the lack of legal reference requiring party officers to be citizens. The Elections Commission hasn't verified citizenship status, suggesting that the situation of Diana Gamage, a non-citizen secretary, doesn't significantly impact the party's legality.

🟩

A non-citizen of Sri Lanka is the secretary of a political party, how is the legal situation?Former Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya made this statement to the question.

"The Elections Commission has not been able to check whether officers of political parties are Sri Lankan citizens. There is no legal reference to that it is needed. I do not think that the post of Mrs. Diana Gamage is a serious interruption to the legalization of the party. "

### Ignoring The Whale, While Hooking The Sprat

Every Party manifesto and every government statement, solemnly vows to eradicate poverty, but have not done so, for seventy six years, since Independence in 1948. The performance of the present government is no better. Since we are hailed (mostly by ourselves) as a “Star Class Democracy,” that has changed governments peacefully. Despite the record of (language riots of 1958), the attempted (coup of 1962) youth insurrections of (1971 and 1988 to 1989) and the civil war (1983-2009).

Changes of government “by the ballot, and not by the bullet”. One hopes that the failures are indicative of poor planning, and not the lack of skill in handling explosives. The fact that there have been repeated changes of governments, means that all political parties have to share the blame. I do not believe that any Party has “won” an election, but rather that the preceding one was kicked out by a disappointed electorate.

Pre-1978, Sri Lanka upheld economic independence through stringent controls on trade and capital, fostering a production-based economy and eschewing foreign indebtedness. However, the victory of the United National Party in 1978 marked a pivotal shift, embracing free market ideology and neoliberal policies. This shift has brought forth a multitude of economic challenges. Certain individuals often labeled as economic parasites have taken advantage of free market ideology to infiltrate critical sectors such as finance, health, education, energy, media, agriculture, and land. Their primary focus is personal gain, disregarding the nation’s overall welfare. Through regulatory manipulation, this elite class exploits both public and private wealth, masking their actions as societal advancement while prioritizing their own interests.

### From Socialism To Success: Sweden’s Economic Evolution

*2024-05-09 18:58:50* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/from-socialism-to-success-swedens-economic-evolution/) · `en`

Both Sweden and Sri Lanka profess to follow Democratic Socialism. But Sweden has seemingly produced a more successful economy. This has led to the popularly held belief that Sweden is an example of Democratic Socialism done right. In this article a brief economic history of Sweden is provided (as published in “The Power of Capitalism” by Rainer Zitelmann). The details show that this popular belief is in fact incorrect.

In the early 19th century Sweden was a very poor country. This was due to the existence of guilds which hindered the freedom of trade and imposed price controls. However, in 1846 the guilds were abolished, and in 1865 complete freedom of trade resembling a free-market with low taxes was introduced. This led to 100 years of tremendous growth. This growth significantly exceeded other European countries such as Germany, Italy and France. Globally it was the second highest in per capita GDP, exceeded only by Japan, and twice as high as in the UK.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s stance on Palestine in the face of Israel’s offensive push with human rights violations has helped the island nation to regain its reputation among the countries in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) after strong criticism over forced cremation of Muslim Covid victims, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said.

The government of former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa led by current ruling party Sri Lanka Podujana Peremuna (SLPP) forced Muslims and Christians to cremate the dead bodies of those who died of Covid-19 in 2020.

The OIC raised the forced cremations issue at the 46th United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in February 2021 after the SLPP government rejected repeated requests by local and global Islamic bodies.

The policy was later reversed, but the move hit diplomatic ties with Middle Eastern and OIC nations which is the highest source of employment for Sri Lankan expatriates.
