### Polar ice is melting and changing EarthтАЩs rotation

*2024-03-29 10:48:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Polar-ice-is-melting-and-changing-Earths-rotation/108-279823) ┬╖ `en`

CNN - One day in the next couple of years, everyone in the world will lose a second of their time. Exactly when that will happen is being influenced by humans, according to a new study, as melting polar ice alters the EarthтАЩs rotation and changes time itself.

The hours and minutes that dictate our days are determined by EarthтАЩs rotation. But that rotation is not constant; it can change ever so slightly, depending on whatтАЩs happening on EarthтАЩs surface and in its molten core.

These nearly imperceptible changes occasionally mean the worldтАЩs clocks need to be adjusted by a тАЬleap second,тАЭ which may sound tiny but can have a big impact on computing systems.

Plenty of seconds have been added over the years. But after a long trend of slowing, the EarthтАЩs rotation is now speeding up because of changes in its core. For the first time ever, a second will need to be taken off.

South Africa, March 29 (BBC) - Forty-five people have died in South Africa after the bus they were in plunged some 50m (165ft) off a bridge into a ravine, authorities say.

The bus crashed through a barrier and caught fire when it hit the ground in the north-eastern Limpopo province.

The passengers were pilgrims travelling from Botswana's capital Gaborone to an Easter service in the town of Moria.

The vehicle lost control and went off a bridge on the Mmamatlakala mountain pass between Mokopane and Marken, around 300km (190 miles) north of Johannesburg, according to South African public broadcaster SABC.

Rescue operations went on late into Thursday evening, with some of those killed reportedly hard to reach amid the debris.

### Rise in hand-foot-and-mouth disease among children

Colombo, March 29 (Daily Mirror) - Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) Consultant Pediatrician Dr. Deepal Perera said today that there is an increase in the spread of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) among schoolchildren these days.

He said this disease spreads every year, especially between March and April.

If children have symptoms like small, oval, red or white blisters on the palms and soles of the feet, as well as in the mouth, if there is a red skin rash with a brown scale on it, or if the rash appears on the outer arms, then parents should keep in mind not to send their children to schools, daycare centres or public places.

HFMD is most commonly caused by the Coxsackie virus. The main way HFMD spreads is through contact with the fluid from inside the blisters or with the droplets spread from sneezing and coughing.

The virus can also be present in bowel movements (excrement) for up to several weeks after the person has recovered.

### No mea culpa

ItтАЩs almost comedic in its simple-minded analysis of complicated issues

In the end there was no conspiracy. The book proves once more that GR is a person so na├пve and so completely out his depth in either running a country, or writing a book. Alas, itтАЩs the truth though he may have had success as defence secretary once upon a time. There may have been others who may or may not have conspired against him, but certainly it wasnтАЩt a foreign power and the book he trots out to prove otherwise is the greatest testimony underlining the fact that he had to leave because of his own folly, and not due to the machinations of some sinister foreign force. Folly, to be sure, seems to be his calling card

Former President Gotabaya RajapaksaтАЩs book titled тАЬConspiracy to oust me from the presidencyтАЭ does in no way live up to its title. If anyone thinks this is a page turner that gives a blow by blow about how a conspiracy unfolded to destroy his presidency, donтАЩt waste your time or your money on the work.

The former president merely insults those who donтАЩt believe there was a conspiracy to get rid of him. This writer read the Sinhala version of the book. The author writes that only the extremely na├пve, тАШbolandaтАЩ, would believe that there wasnтАЩt a foreign conspiracy to oust him.

That statement is typical of the way Gotabaya Rajapaksa (GR) ruled the country. He seemed to be so aloof that he was constantly seen to be out of touch when in power. Added to that was his rather supercilious attitude which seemed to make him think he knew more than the rabble he ruled over.

Birth and death have no special merit except that they both re-enact and perpetuate the separation notwithstanding the entry into or the exit of the lower state of vibration. Life in the physical plane manifests as though thought has no power or causal effect. We are buffeted and bruised by everything external and the impact of them is experienced by the body where it тАЬperceptuallyтАЭ witnesses to this schema. Thus, from a state of mindfulness to a state of mindlessness, the descent which reflects the separation from God, the body becomes the hallmark of all who тАЬhave sinned and come short of his glory.тАЭ But the resurrection, on the other hand, is one of great importance since it restores the function of Causation to cause in the mind

### Easter and the Roman Centurion: A Symphony of Redemption

*2024-03-29 04:30:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/easter-and-the-roman-centurion-a-symphony-of-redemption/) ┬╖ `en`

Easter, the cornerstone of the Christian faith, is universally described as a celebration of penance, hope, renewal, and the triumph of life over death. Central to this profound narrative in history is the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, a pivotal moment that unfolded on the cross; an instrument known, and well-recognised, as an emblem of condemnation, retribution, and shame. However, on that fateful day of the crucifixion, amidst the anguish and agony of the execution of the Son of God, one figure emerges from the pages of history; the Roman Centurion who stood at the foot of the cross. His coincidental encounter with divinity and spirituality transformed a moment of despair into a guiding light of redemption.

Colombo, March 29 (Daily Mirror) - Minor staffers at the National Hospital Colombo (NHC) have chosen not to wear their uniforms, despite receiving an annual allowance for them, according to an official from the hospital.

These staffers,both male and female, are provided with specific white uniforms for their duties at the hospital to make them easily identifiable. However, instead of wearing these uniforms they allegedly opt for casual attire and behave more like clerical staff or office assistants.

Although they receive an annual uniform allowance of Rs.9,500, they claim this allowance and continue to wear casual clothes. Many of these staffers argue that they cannot perform their duties effectively while wearing uniforms and have reportedly informed the hospital's management about their concerns.

Furthermore, they claim to have received a letter granting permission to wear casual attire while on duty at the hospital.

Sri Lankan Christians also conveyed a similar and strong message when their kith and kin were brutally blown to pieces inside three churches chose to stay calm and collected as a community.

This calmness was preserved largely due to the instructions issued by the head of the Catholic Church, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith.

Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and investors of his now-bankrupt firm.

The ruling cements the downfall of the former billionaire, who emerged as a high profile champion of crypto before his firm's dramatic collapse in 2022.

The 32-year-old was later found to have stolen billions from customers of the exchange ahead of its implosion.

But he was convicted by a New York jury in November on charges including multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

During the sentencing hearing on Thursday, Judge Lewis Kaplan provided a harsh assessment, saying it was clear Bankman-Fried was motivated by a drive to be politically influential.

Despite "protestations of sorrow" about customer losses, Judge Kaplan said, Bankman-Friend had expressed "never a word of remorse for the commission of terrible crimes".
