### South Asia air pollution fell in 2022, but remains major killer: report

*2024-08-28 10:14:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101560/south-asia-air-pollution-fell-in-2022-but-remains-major-killer-report-) ┬╖ `en`

A surprise improvement in air quality in South Asia in 2022 drove a decline in global pollution, with favourable weather a likely factor, a new report said Wednesday.

But the region continues to breathe the worldтАЩs most-polluted air, with its residents losing more than 3.5 years of life expectancy on average, the annual Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) warned.

And globally, most countries have either no pollution standards or are failing to meet what they have set, subjecting their citizens to air quality that causes a broad range of health problems.

For two decades, air pollution has increased annually in South Asia, but satellite data for 2022 -- the most recent year available -- showed a surprise 18 percent fall.

The declines were recorded in every country in the region apart from Sri Lanka, according to the report, produced by the University of ChicagoтАЩs Energy Policy Institute (EPIC).

### UkraineтАЩs Zelenskiy to present plan to Biden to end war with Russia

*2024-08-28 10:05:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101559/ukraines-zelenskiy-to-present-plan-to-biden-to-end-war-with-russia) ┬╖ `en`

UkraineтАЩs Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that the war with Russia would eventually end in dialogue, but that Kyiv had to be in a strong position and that he would present a plan to U.S. President Joe Biden and his two potential successors.

The Ukrainian leader, addressing a news conference, said KyivтАЩs three-week-old incursion into RussiaтАЩs Kursk region was part of that plan, but that it also comprised other steps on the economic and diplomatic fronts.

тАЬThe main point of this plan is to force Russia to end the war. And I want that very much - (that it would be) fair for Ukraine,тАЭ he told reporters in Kyiv of the war launched by RussiaтАЩs full-scale invasion in February 2022.

He did not elaborate further on the next steps, but said he would also discuss the plan with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and probably also with Republican Donald Trump, the two nominees for the U.S. presidential election

Six candidates contested the first election in 1982, and the number went down to three in 1988. Since then, the numbers have been in ascendency. In 2019, 35 candidates were in the field. This time around, a total of 39 candidates are in the fray. Most of them are proxies strategically fielded to divide the votes of one of the leading candidates. Some proxy candidates are in the contest to mobilize resources for their favorite leaders. Although hardly noticed, some of the candidates have contested several elections. For example, Battaramulle Seelaratne Thera, who contested the 2010 election, endorsing Mahinda Rajapaksa, withdrew at the eleventh hour. Sri Lanka Labor PartyтАЩs A. S. P.

### Knowing When To Step Aside: Mark Of True Leadership

*2024-08-27 19:04:43* ┬╖ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/knowing-when-to-step-aside-mark-of-true-leadership/) ┬╖ `en`

Presidential aspirant WickremesingheтАЩs recent appeal to Sri Lankans to vote for the Gas Cylinder symbol, with the ominous warning that failure to do so will result in long queues for essentials, reflects a troubling mindset.

This statement, which seems to equate the temporary resolution of gas shortages with his qualification to lead the nation, is out of touch and a poor Marcom strategy. It suggests that Wickremesinghe and his advisors believe that merely avoiding crises is enough to secure the presidency, ignoring the deeper, more pressing needs of the country.

WickremesingheтАЩs approach is similar to his previous attempts to appeal to the masses with shallow gestures, such as his infamous offer of chewing gum to farmers, a tone-deaf proposal that highlighted his disconnection from the realities of rural life.
