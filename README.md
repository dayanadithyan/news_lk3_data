ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s budget deficit has collapsed to 361 billion rupees up to April 2024 from 824.2 helped by higher tax revenues and a falling interest bill, official data show.

Revenues surged 48 percent to 1,216 billion rupees to April 2024, ahead of the 35 percent annual growth projected in a budget, with higher value added and income tax rates as well as economic activity recovering close to previous levels.

Sri Lanka is emerging from the worst case of ‘policy support’ deployed by macroeconomists since the central bank was set up in 1950 where the usual inflationary rate cuts which trigger currency crises and IMF programs, was also backed up tax cuts.

Giving policy support and denying monetary stability has become mainstream in the age of inflation and ‘age of external defaults without a war’ due to so-called Saltwater-Cambridge doctrine, critics say.

I say this because we Tamils have been reduced to nobodies in Sri Lanka through persistent discrimination and state violence amounting to genocide. But now suddenly the conversation is different as all three likely Presidential Candidates –  Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajit Pemadasa – are bidding for our Tamil votes, even promising the 13th Amendment and more.
