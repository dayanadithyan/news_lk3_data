### Increasing dissatisfaction in the North and East amidst storytelling on reconciliation

*2024-03-26 14:35:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179749) ┬╖ `ta`

Growing dissatisfaction in the North and East due to the government's failure to address Tamil grievances. Tamil MPs are protesting peacefully against the government's refusal to address their complaints, including the detention of citizens during a religious ceremony. The opposition leader has called for the release of the detainees and the right to religious freedom. The Archaeological Department has imposed restrictions on visiting Hindu temples, causing confusion and concern among the local population. President Wickremesinghe has been active in addressing land issues and supporting the 13th Amendment, aiming to devolve powers to provincial councils.

ЁЯЯй

The dissatisfaction among the Tamil political community takes a new twist in Parliament because the government fails to treat themselves honestly and solve their grievances.. Tamil MPs are embarking on a peaceful struggle instead of talks, as it is impossible to understand the majority of votes.

It is rare for political parties that represent ethnic and religious minority communities to confuse parliamentary activities. One reason for this is that their number is inadequate. But the confusion of the council is that the ruling party MPs and the opposition MPs often behave like their privacy.. President Maithripala Sirisena's postponement of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in the October 2018 constitutional conspiracy without any precautions

The 1.6-mile (2.57 km) long Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, USA collapsed in the early hours of Tuesday after a container ship hit it, and as many as seven people may be in the water, officials said.

A live video posted on YouTube showed a ship hitting the bridge, after which several of its spans collapsed into the Patapsco River. Unverified videos posted on social media X also showed the impact and collapse. Reuters could not immediately verify the videos.

The Baltimore City Fire Department described the collapse as a mass-casualty incident, and said workers were searching for seven people in the river.
