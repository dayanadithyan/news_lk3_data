Until 1978, Sri Lanka’s economy was mainly agriculture-based. In the 1970s, industrialization began to grow due to government and bilateral investments. However, the economy faced high inflation and product shortages due to supply-side shocks from the OPEC oil embargo. Despite these challenges, Sri Lanka remained free of foreign debt in the early 1970s due to strict trade and capital controls and policies focused on production.

*2024-06-17 04:01:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/adani-wind-farms-in-mannar-and-procedural-challenges-in-swiss-auction/) · `en`

India’s Adani Group, which has committed SL’s single largest FDI in the power sector by committing to invest over a billion dollars in setting up ~500MW wind projects in Mannar and Pooneryn region, is facing resistance from a lobby group. The reason is unclear, says Vinayak Maheswaran – an equity and economic analyst at an equity markets platform who was also a former analyst at Wells Fargo Advisors.

“Initially they said the project harms the environment. This when the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) was done by a renowned professor and the government promised to implement the suggestions made in it and by public to minimize environmental impact. Several other Renewable Energy Organizations, Climate Organizations, environment organisations like the National Environment Caucus, Youth for Renewable Energy Organization, Sri Lanka Blue Green Alliance too conducted their own studies and have decided to back the project.”

While the cost of lubricant oil has decreased significantly since last September, affecting overall fuel prices, the situation remains complex.

According to the government -approved purchases, fuel prices should be carried out in Sri Lanka.

The refined fuel is imported according to the Singapore Business Index. Accordingly, the secretary also stated that fuel supply should be supplied in Sri Lanka in accordance with the prices that are determined there.

Sulakshana Jayawardena also said that about 35 per cent of the country's total demand is imported and refined, and that the prices of refined fuel in accordance with world market prices cannot be corrected.

However, Professor Vasantha Attukorala of the Economics University of Peradeniya University said that the price of lubricant oil fell by 27 per cent compared to last September.

He said this during a media briefing held at his party headquarters in Jaffna on Sunday (16).. In this regard, he said ..

In fact, I see this as an attempt to keep the problems of the Tamil people as long -standing problems.

Although they are all tied together in a potato bundle, they are scattered like a rolling in every direction, as Prabhakaran is not in the absence of today.

In this case, where is unity among them. What did you get for many years. Is it possible to control the destruction?Is there any improvement?In the absence of the election, they are talking about that again.

### Why Sri Lanka needs new leadership

Wickremesinghe’s track record suggests a pattern of governance that prioritises personal and political survival over genuine public service

In the complex and turbulent political landscape of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe has emerged as a figure of significant controversy. Despite holding the office of Prime Minister six times and now serving as President, his tenure has been marked by a series of strategic manoeuvres that have often sidelined democratic principles and prioritised political expediency over national interest.

Wickremesinghe’s political career is a study in resilience and opportunism, akin to a chameleon that changes its colours to blend with its surroundings. The leader of the United National Party (UNP), the oldest political party in Sri Lanka, he has managed to stay relevant through numerous political storms. However, his methods and motivations raise serious concerns.

The IMF second review has not properly guided the Government to execute its first responsibility of ensuring macroeconomic stability and its continuing efficacy

The IMF issued a Press Release No. 24/214 on 12 June completing the second review under the Extended Fund Facility for Sri Lanka.

The economy is a system. The way we understand any system might be different. We understand the economy as a system having a cause-and-effect relationship. In such a system, as Buddhism preaches, nothing will happen without necessary conditions. When we look at the IMF second review, economic vulnerabilities just arise not knowing proper causes. Take the very first paragraph of IMF report. It says as follows:

Sri Lankans are finally ready to bid farewell to the three major parties. They are fed up with the old guard who have been cris crossing parties like leaches to remain in power, and eventually led our beloved homeland to financial ruin. It is widely believed and hoped that AKD will be elected to be our next President. I personally hope he will. Not so much know their agenda and policies but there is no other option.

But like thousands more, I am confused why Anura Kumara Dissanayake has not revealed his platform. Sri Lankans are screaming for a wholesale system change. They expect AKD and his team to deliver.

People are not expecting a change of face, but a change of the political structure that will create proper checks and balances, ensure independence of our criminal justice system, restore the rule of law and more.  With this in mind, here are my questions for AKD and his team

### Will  the current positions taken by Sajith Premadasa and Anura  Dissanayake Regarding the 13th Amendment  help bring about a positive change in the misconceptions among Sinhalese society about devolution of power?

*2024-06-16 21:09:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84206) · `en`

Although many amendments have been brought to the Sri Lankan Constitution during a period of more than four-and-a-half decades, which were detrimental to democratic governance, no major controversy has been raised against them.

However, the 13th Amendment (13A), which has a relatively democratic dimension, has been in the Constitution for more than three-and-a-half decades but has been controversial for a long time.

The 13A, introduced following the July 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord to introduce the system of Provincial Councils (PCs) has not been properly implemented by any government in office so far. Political controversies arise from time to time regarding that amendment. As the country looks ahead to the Presidential Election, there is another possibility of controversy raging regarding the 13A.

### The proposal by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to grant a six months extension to Sri Lanka’s Attorney General has put the hapless holder of that office in the centre of a vicious political whirlwind

*2024-06-16 21:00:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84201) · `en`

The proposal by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to grant a six months service extension to Sri Lanka’s Attorney General has put the hapless holder of that office in the centre of a vicious political whirlwind that further damages the already badly battered public reputation of the chief law officer of the land.

This must be said clearly and categorically. Absent that extension, the incumbent Attorney General will retire later this month. This controversial proposal has been placed with his customary aplomb by the President before the Constitutional Council (CC) sans any reflection on the grievous impact that this may have on constitutional propriety.

That proposal is now being tossed like a red hot coal by the CC from one week to the next. All this hot air comes in the backdrop of a looming national poll (presidential or parliamentary as the case may be) and in the wake of the President’s favourites in the United National Party (UNP) declaring that polls should be postponed.
