*2024-06-28 16:27:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187194) · `ta`

Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe's announcement of a debt agreement with bilateral creditors is seen by many as a pre-election strategy to boost support amid the country's ongoing economic challenges. The deal, aimed at restoring economic stability, is set to be discussed in Parliament on July 2nd. Critics, however, view it as a political maneuver rather than a genuine solution, especially considering the upcoming October elections. Political analyst Professor Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri suggests Wickremesinghe's speech is an attempt to counter his political opponent Sajith Premadasa, highlighting the divided support within the United National Party. Despite the potential for Wickremesinghe to leverage his economic recovery vision against Premadasa, the effectiveness of such strategies remains uncertain amidst widespread public discontent and skepticism towards austerity measures imposed by the IMF.
