### Israel and Hezbollah in major missile exchange as escalation fears grow

Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel early on Sunday, as Israel‚Äôs military said it struck Lebanon with around 100 jets to thwart a larger attack, in one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare.

Missiles were visible curling up through the dawn sky, dark vapour trails behind them, as an air raid siren sounded in Israel and a distant blast lit the horizon, while smoke rose over houses in Khiam in southern Lebanon.

On Sunday evening, sirens sounded in Rishon Letsiyon, central Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said, and added that one projectile had been identified crossing from the southern Gaza Strip and falling in an open area. The armed wing of Hamas said it had fired an ‚ÄúM90‚Äù rocket at Tel Aviv.

Any major spillover in the fighting, which began in parallel with the war in Gaza, risks morphing into a regional conflagration drawing in Hezbollah‚Äôs backer Iran and Israel‚Äôs main ally the United States.

### Transitioning from takaran-sheet giveaways

As long as the people keep asking for giveaways as against conditions for life improvement, the takaran era will not end ‚Äì Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

It is because of this increased literacy that people are asking politicians making promises to also state how the money will be found. The politician who some time back promised to zero out VAT, has now retreated to saying that VAT will be removed for educational and healthcare services (leaving aside the fact that most of these services are already exempt from VAT). Even then, he is being challenged to explain how the shortfall is going to be covered

‚ÄúWe all know what to do, but we don‚Äôt know how to get re-elected once we have done it‚Äù ‚Äï Jean-Claude Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg 1995-2013

Handing out roofing sheets used to be a thing in Sri Lankan elections. It was thought that giving tangible things to people would motivate them to vote for the giver. Now we use the term metaphorically, hopefully.

A country interested in creating a creative economy should put all the four essential ground conditions in place if it is to succeed in its attempt. First, knowledge must be created by its universities and research institutions. Then, such knowledge should be made available to prospective entrepreneurs for use in commercially viable productions known as innovation. Once the initial entrepreneurs become successful, that knowledge, both invention and innovation, should be disseminated or diffused across the economy to facilitate others to imitate the original inventors and innovators

In the high-stakes world of trade and logistics, corruption at Sri Lanka‚Äôs customs, IRD, ports, and airports is not just an inconvenience‚Äîit‚Äôs a crisis that‚Äôs crippling the nation‚Äôs export sector. Outdated, manual systems have become breeding grounds for corruption, where bribery and inefficiency rule, bleeding exporters dry and stifling economic growth. The country stands at a critical juncture, where the only viable path forward is the digitalisation of customs and trade operations.

These antiquated, paper-based customs processes are no match for the demands of the modern global economy, where speed, accuracy, and transparency are paramount. Instead, they are plagued by errors, deliberate delays, and a lack of accountability, allowing corrupt practices to thrive unchecked. As global trade standards become stricter, the need for transparent, secure, and efficient customs operations has never been more urgent.

Article 94 of the Constitution outlines the process for selecting a winner should no candidate cross the halfway mark. If necessary, candidates may have to resort to their calculators to determine how many votes they need to secure victory.

The UN mission in Afghanistan said on Sunday it was ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù about a morality law recently ratified by the Taliban authorities, criticising in particular restrictions on women.

The Taliban authorities on Wednesday announced the codification of a law with 35 articles detailing wide-ranging behaviour and lifestyle restrictions based on their strict interpretation of Islamic law.

The law sets out graduated punishments for non-compliance ‚Äî from verbal warnings to threats, fines and detentions of varying lengths ‚Äî imposed by the morality police under the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.

‚ÄúIt is a distressing vision for Afghanistan‚Äôs future, where moral inspectors have discretionary powers to threaten and detain anyone based on broad and sometimes vague lists of infractions,‚Äù said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama).

### Why Most Current Political Leaders Are Unsuitable For The Presidency

*2024-08-25 18:43:47* ¬∑ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/why-most-current-political-leaders-are-unsuitable-for-the-presidency/) ¬∑ `en`

Sri Lanka has reached a crossroads where it could save for future generations as a prosperous country or become a permanently underdeveloped nation like some debt-ridden African nations. Voters can and must change direction, but they must be educated based on facts. With the declaration of the elections in September 2024, political leaders are playing games to leap forward deceptively, misleading and disregarding voters.

The current political landscape in Sri Lanka is fraught with issues that render the existing politicians unsuitable for the presidency. How can people trust members of parliament who become politicians purely to make money, sell their duty-free car permits, and abuse power? Honesty, integrity, transparency, and following the election promises are essential. None of the current leaders can pass this est. Here are ten more reasons why the current political leaders (and presidential nominees) are unsuitable for running the country.
