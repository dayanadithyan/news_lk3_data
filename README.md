Badulla District Parliamentarian Vadivel Suresh said that if the plantation companies do not change the salary of plantation workers, we will change the livelihood of the people.

He said this while addressing a debate in Parliament on Wednesday (10).

The people of the hill country are suffering from various hardships and are suffering from a salary for corruption. While the salary increase of these people is legally published in the gazette notification, the power to oppose it is surprising.

If the court goes against the salary hike in the hill people who are carrying the country's economy as a backbone, it is understood that the plantation companies are in a state of disrepair.

Plantation Company owners if you don't change we will change you ‚Äù. Meanwhile, we are also telling the government that we will change the livelihood of the plantation people immediately.

### Expo Property gets land in Kollupitiya for long-term lease

*2024-07-11 02:33:23* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/Expo-Property-gets-land-in-Kollupitiya-for-long-term-lease/34-764130) ¬∑ `en`

The Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved a proposal to transfer a 52-perch plot of land in Kollupitiya to Expo Property Developers Ltd., under a 99-year lease.

The decision comes following complications in transferring a previously allocated 40-perch plot due to unauthorised occupants.

The land, owned by the Urban Development Authority (UDA), was initially approved for disposal in 2007 under a 50-year lease with 25% of the land‚Äôs value charged. However, due to the presence of unauthorised residents, the transfer could not be completed.

Expo Property Developers requested an additional 12 perches adjacent to the original plot to facilitate a housing project, making the total requested area 52 perches. The Board of Management of the UDA has approved this request.

The Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal presented by the Urban Development and Housing Minister Prasanna Ranatunga to lease the land for 99 years based on the current valuation by the chief assessor.

Hi! Thought of giving you something different, this week, for you to try out.

Like me, I know all the lovely ladies like to keep their face‚Ä¶always beautiful.

You will need 01 tablespoon ground flaxseed, 01 tablespoon white flour, 01 teaspoon olive oil, and 02 tablespoons non-sugar yoghurt‚Ä¶yes, plain yoghurt.

In a small bowl, combine the ground flaxseed with the white flour. Then add the olive oil to the mixture. Next, gradually mix in the 02 tablespoons of non-sugar yoghurt (plain yoghurt). Stir well until you achieve a smooth paste-like consistency.

(You can adjust the consistency of the mask by adding more yoghurt if it‚Äôs too thick, or more flour if it‚Äôs too runny.)

Wash your face thoroughly with a gentle cleanser and pat dry with a towel.

Apply the mask evenly to your face, avoiding the eye area, and allow the mask to sit on your face for about 15-20 minutes.

Once the time is up, rinse your face with lukewarm water to remove the mask completely.

The stock market turned out to be in a recovery stage yesterday after the market saw an oversell of shares due to a dip in the market for two consecutive sessions. Only 27 Index points were secured in trading as against 160 points down during the last two sessions, market analysts said.

The market was dominated by two crossings; especially that of Agalawatte Plantations, but retail investor participation was significantly low. Out of the 801.2 million turnover only Rs 450 million had come from retail investors, due to political uncertainty, which resulted in the market becoming lacklustre.

Amid those developments both indices moved upwards. The All Share Price Index went up by 27 points while S and P SL20 rose by 14.47 points. Turnover stood at Rs 801.2 million with two crossings. Those crossings were reported in Agalawatte Plantations, which crossed 10.9 million shares to the tune of Rs 350 million; its shares traded at Rs 32 and Sampath Bank 300,000 shares crossed for Rs 23.25 million.
