### Curbing spam, scam and fraud in Sri Lanka

*2024-01-24 05:23:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Curbing-spam-scam-and-fraud-in-Sri-Lanka/4-757704) · `en`

The Sri Lankan Government is said to have approved the creation of an international A2P SMS centre to curtail fraud and spam. A private company, Infobip, has submitted a proposal to the Cabinet in this regard. The President has proposed appointing a committee with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Technology and the TRCSL to evaluate this proposal.

The need for such a centre to be set up at this time, approved at Cabinet-level, and run by an international private messaging aggregator raises multiple questions.

Spam, scam, and fraudulent communications are a valid cause for concern.

However, we have no publicly available information on how significant the issue of scams and frauds are in Sri Lanka. It would be good to start off with knowing how bad is the spam, scam, fraud situation in Sri Lanka? Do we have numbers and statistics, gathered by the Government or independent researchers, to go by?

They initially announced the seizure of millions of rupees in cash and the confiscation of assets belonging to drug peddlers/dealers.

Media reports of drug raids continue to regale the public with a plethora of statements issued by the Public Security Minister and the acting IGP on how well the operation is progressing. Daily we hear of hundreds of persons being taken into custody.

What is concerning however is that the Minister and the Acting IGP seem to be acting outside the law in their efforts to rid the country of the drug menace.

### What is the JVP’s Economic Policy?

Hats off to the JVP lady who promised that when the JVP/NPP comes to power, it will legalize prostitution! If Sri Lanka is to undergo the next phase of social revolution, which the JVP promises, the archaic and discriminatory laws should be discarded to build a system where every citizen, irrespective of race, religion, income, gender or sexual orientation, could exercise the full scope of liberties. But there is a glitch that the JVP’s ideologues and their busloads of supporters fail to admit - or they simply don’t comprehend: social liberalism cannot be achieved, nor could it be sustained in the long run, without economic liberalism.

### Sri Lanka’s Proposed Internet Law Threatens Upcoming Elections

*2024-01-23 18:56:43* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/sri-lankas-proposed-internet-law-threatens-upcoming-elections/) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s Proposed Internet Law Threatens Upcoming Elections; Government Body Could Impose Sweeping Censorship, Prosecute Offenders

A repressive new internet law that Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe is trying to rush through parliament this week would create broad and vague new speech-related offenses punishable by lengthy prison terms. The law would seriously threaten the right to freedom of expression as Sri Lanka prepares for parliamentary and presidential elections later this year.

The proposed law, the Online Safety Bill, purportedly provides protections against online harassment, abuse, and fraud. Instead, it is mostly concerned with creating a new “Online Safety Commission,” appointed by the president, that can decide what online speech is “false” or “harmful,” remove content, restrict and prohibit internet access, and prosecute individuals and organizations.

It may sound heretical and ridiculous, but I boldly say, that it is only the last word in my title (“Abuse,”) is real, all else is piffle, confusion, and deceit and quite meaningless. Agreed? Of course not, – don’t be crazy!

Let me explain. More and more that I see happening around me, seems to validate this apparent heresy. I take a perverse delight in witnessing the demolition of myths and untenable yet popular, beliefs. It is astonishing to see the extent to which we allow ourselves to be so easily fooled. Often we seemed to be wired to accept more readily, thoughts couched in complicated verbiage. How often do we unknowingly accept concepts, merely because we feel ill-equipped to understand them? The lament at the end of a speech, “What he said must be mighty important, because I could not understand a word of it” is a telling truth. “Faith” they say is “acceptance of something you know to be false”.  So, on to this implicitly authorized heresy.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka might lose access to international platforms such as Google and Meta (formerly Facebook) with the introduction of the Online Safety Bill, Member of Parliament Eran Wickremeratne said in parliament.

“Once this law is introduced, they will review the offences they would be accused of and most likely close up its access to users in Sri Lanka. Further, if the Sri Lankan government requests for certain information from Google, they will most likely not comply anymore as it may be self incriminating,” Wickremeratne said on Tuesday (22) when the bill was  being debated.

He was responding to the opening statement to the bill presented by Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles.

### Sri Lanka CB warns against using personal bank accounts for business

ECONOMYNEXT – The Central Bank said that it was considering legal action against registered limited liability companies that were using personal bank accounts to conduct business for the purpose of tax evasion.

The Central Bank issued a warning against the misuse of personal accounts for ‘illegal activities’, last week (15).

“The reason for that was that we received complaints from banks that clients who had registered a business were conducting transactions not through the account established for that purpose, but through their personal accounts. This could most probably be for tax evasion purposes,” Enoka Mohotty Director of the FIU said.

“We have written to the Finance Ministry, and are in discussions with the Inland Revenue Department and the Registrar of Companies on what possible legal action can be taken,” Mohotty said in reply to question by a journalist at the central bank’s Monetary Policy Review No. 01 of 2024, held on Tuesday (23).
