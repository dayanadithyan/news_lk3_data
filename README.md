### Sri Lanka’s economy shows signs of stabilization, but poverty to remain elevated – World Bank

*2024-04-02 15:50:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98373/sri-lankas-economy-shows-signs-of-stabilization-but-poverty-to-remain-elevated-world-bank) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s economy is projected to see moderate growth of 2.2% in 2024, showing signs of stabilization, following the severe economic downturn of 2022. But, the country still faces elevated poverty levels, income inequality, and labor market concerns, says the World Bank’s latest bi-annual update.

Released today, the Sri Lanka Development Update, Bridge to Recovery, highlights that Sri Lanka saw declining inflation, higher revenues on the back of the implementation of new fiscal policies, and a current account surplus for the first time in nearly five decades, buoyed by increased remittances and a rebound in tourism.

However, poverty rates continued to rise for the fourth year in a row, with an estimated 25.9% of Sri Lankans living below the poverty line in 2023. Labor force participation has also seen a decline, particularly among women and in urban areas, exacerbated by the closure of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

Colombo, April 2 (Daily Mirror) - Cabinet approval has been granted to import 1,000 vehicles only for the tourism industry to transport tourists, Cabinet spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.

Addressing the weekly media briefing to inform Cabinet decisions, he said this was after taking into consideration that vehicles in the tourism sector engaged in transporting tourists cannot be used for more than six years.

It is apparent that the condition of the vehicles used in the tourism industry is not satisfactory and sufficient, and the fame earned by Sri Lanka as a prominent tourist destination is tarnished due to the use of old vehicles as a result of the limitations of vehicles and essential spare parts, the Minister said.

"Therefore, the requirement of importing vehicles essential for enhancing the industry has been recognized considering the contribution to the tourist industry within the economic revival process of Sri Lanka.

ඔහු පෙන්වා දුන්නේ මෙම ආර්ථික ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ ආපසු හැරවීමට කිසිම කණ්ඩායමකට නොහැකි බවය.

"ඊට අදාළ කෙටුම්පත පාර්ලිමේන්තුවට ඉදිරිපත් කරනවා. ඉන් බලාපොරොත්තු වෙන්නේ ලබාගත් ආර්ථික ස්ථාවරත්වය ශක්තිමත්ව ඉදිරියට ගෙනයෑමත්.. අර්බුද හමුවේ රට නැවත කඩානොවැටෙන රටක් බවට පරිවර්තනය කිරීම."

"ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණවල යම් වේදනාකාරී බවක් ඇති වුණා කෙටිකාලීනව. ඒවා අද යම් ආකාරයකින් සමනය වෙලා තිබෙනවා."

Sri Lanka's milk consumption has slightly increased post-crisis, but overall, it's less than before. Economic recovery has seen over a million families return to the market, but the dairy industry needs at least two years to reach pre-crisis levels.

🟩

Following the economic crisis, a senior industry representative said the use of Sri Lanka's monthly milk, which has been reduced by almost half of the price rise, has seen a slight increase.

Consumption of 7,000 metric tonnes of milk powder in the last three years has declined to 3,000 metric tonnes in the last three years due to the rise in US dollar prices, milk prices in the world market and government tax hikes.

However, with the slightest improvement of economic conditions, more than one million families have returned to the market, although the overall consumption is less than the previous level, said Ravi Jayawardena, CEO of the Maliban Group.
