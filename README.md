The Treasury is aware that the country is in a difficult place. But that difficulty is not visible on the surface. Fuel is available, electricity is available and public and private transportation is in place. It’s the mirage that seems to matter to most rather than reality

“At the Treasury we are aware that the country is in a difficult place. But that difficulty is not visible on the surface. Fuel is available, electricity is available and public and private transportation is in place. As public servants, we got our salaries because the government didn’t impose pay cuts like in Greece during the bailout program of the International Monetary Fund. That’s a good thing. But we still pay the salaries with difficulty” – Mahinda Siriwardana, Secretary to the Treasury and the Ministry of Finance (https://island.lk/treasury-secretary-urges-public-to-have-a-pragmatic-view-of-economy-and-fiscal-discipline/)

### Imputed rental income tax: Gateway to corruption on a massive scale

*2024-07-01 23:21:49* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Imputed-rental-income-tax-Gateway-to-corruption-on-a-massive-scale/4-763721) · `en`

This flawed system provides the assessor a great deal of authority and gives them the opportunity to pocket a buck for themselves

By 1 April 2025 the Government proposes to implement a wealth tax by way of an “imputed rental income” on property as a precursor to a land tax. In simple terms the meaning of “imputed rental income” is the estimated rental income of a property if it were rented. The mere assumption of a rental income is very much subjective and cannot in any effect be a guide to govern taxes.

In reality, imputed rent is exactly what the Local Councils are already obtaining from property owners by way of Municipality Rates. Hence the new “imputed rental income” is just a facade to re-tax the citizen who is already taxed twice over on the same income, first by the Municipality on the imputed rent and secondly by the Inland Revenue based on actual income of the same property.

### When one thing leads to nothing

*2024-07-01 23:07:07* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/When-one-thing-leads-to-nothing/4-763718) · `en`

In the late 1970s, during the rising tide of neoliberal globalisation, many countries in the Global South opened up their economies to foreign capital in order to build a so-called export-oriented economy. The ethos that drove such reforms can be divided into two camps:

In China, pragmatism prevailed, with Chairman Deng Xiaoping stating, “To cross the river, feel for the stones.”

In Sri Lanka, there was an ideological faith in markets and foreign capital, with then President J.R. Jayewardene stating, “Let the robber barons come.”

Today, one of these countries has defaulted on its external debt and is undergoing its 17th IMF program. The other is the world’s factory, contributing to over 35% of global manufacturing value-added and expected to lead the next business cycle. No prizes for guessing which is which.

### Palestinian militants fire rockets into Israel, tanks advance in Gaza

The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday as fighting raged in Gaza and Israeli tanks advanced deeper in parts of the enclave, residents and officials said.

The armed wing of Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas, said its fighters fired rockets towards several Israeli communities near the fence with Gaza in response to “the crimes of the Zionist enemy against our Palestinian people”.

The volley of around 20 rockets caused no casualties, the Israeli military said. But the attack showed militants still possess rocket capabilities almost nine months into an offensive that Israel says is aimed at neutralising threats against it.

Violence also flared on Monday in the Israeli occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian health ministry said a woman and a boy were killed in the city of Tulkarm during an operation by Israeli forces. A day earlier, an Israeli strike in the same area killed an Islamic Jihad member.

The People's Movement Front has today held talks with the Commissioner of Elections on the government's conspiracies to postpone the elections

Social political activist Rajkumar Rajeevkan said that the meeting was also investigated on the registration of the people's struggle and the preparation for elections.

Ranil Wickremesinghe has continued to investigate the registration of the coalition and consistently made an attempt to continue as a people's ungodly president. We suspect that he was doing the full job of disregarding the elections and doing a democratic improper action.

When there is a matter of fact that the president has come into parliament without a public order, he is acting in the hope that he should continue to hold power without holding any election.

Not only that, but we have formed this alliance with three parties from the South.
