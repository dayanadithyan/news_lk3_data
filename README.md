Official reserves in February reach US$ 4,517 mn, up from US$ 4,496 mn in January

In February, official foreign currency reserves inched up as the Central Bank maintained its efforts to shore up reserves by accumulating foreign currency from banks. This accumulation comes at a time when demand for foreign currency remains subdued compared to the ample supply from remittances, tourism, and robust exports.

Latest figures reveal that by the end of February, the Central Bank held US$ 4,517 million in official reserve assets, a modest increase from US$ 4,496 million reported in January.

With the absence of large-scale demand for foreign currency from the importers, and also the absence of substantial foreign currency, debt repayments have provided more wiggle room for the Central Bank to collect dollars from the market and rebuild its reserve buffer.

Earlier this month, the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) once again took up the issue of its resolution on тАЬPromoting Reconciliation, Accountability and Human Rights in Sri LankaтАЭ. We also heard for the umpteenth time representatives of western nations pontificate on how wars should be conducted with minimum loss to civilians, women and children.

Believe it or not, it is we Lankans who have undergone civil conflicts on three or more occasions. It was after all our men and women (brothers, sisters, husbands, wives and children) who paid the price in blood, sweat and tears. It was we who suffered the pain of inquisition. We have seen it all and still feel the pain.

War means killing and being killed. The rules of war тАУ the protection of women, children and non combatants тАУ are often ignored during armed conflicts. However, the cold-blooded killing of civilians is not only a war crime, but a crime against humanity and cannot be tolerated.

(Reuters) - Palestinians prepared for Ramadan in sombre mood with heightened security measures by Israeli police and the spectre of war and hunger in Gaza overshadowing the normally festive Muslim holy month as talks to secure a ceasefire stalled.

Thousands of police have been deployed around the narrow streets of the Old City in Jerusalem, where tens of thousands of worshippers are expected every day at the Al Aqsa mosque compound, one of the holiest sites in Islam.

The area, considered the most sacred place by Jews who know it as Temple Mount, has been a longstanding flashpoint for trouble and was one of the starting points of the last war in 2021 between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls Gaza.

That 10-day conflict has been dwarfed by the current war, which is now in its sixth month. It began on Oct. 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, by Israeli tallies.

Colombo, March 10 (Daily Mirror)- President Ranil Wickremesinghe is opting to hold the Presidential election first while the Rajapaksas want the General Elections held first, National People's Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.

Speaking at the Colombo District Women's Convention, he said the President prefers the Presidential election held first than to the General Elections as he has no strong support at the grassroots level.

He said the Rajapaksas prefer the General Elections first as they deem that going for a Presidential election is disadvantageous to them as they have no strong candidate to contest for the Presidency.

"The SLPP knows Rajapaksas cannot be brought in again as a leader. Basil came to the country recently. But, he has no chance to contest for the Presidency. So, they think that the General elections is more advantageous to them," he said.

Ukrainian and allied officials criticized Pope Francis for saying that Kyiv should have the тАЬcourageтАЭ to negotiate an end to the war with Russia, a statement many interpreted as a call for Ukraine to surrender.

The foreign minister of Poland, a vocal ally of Kyiv, and UkraineтАЩs ambassador to the Vatican, both used World War II analogies to condemn the popeтАЩs remarks.

And a leader of one of UkraineтАЩs Christian churches on Sunday said that only the countryтАЩs determined resistance to MoscowтАЩs full-scale invasion, launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 24, 2022, had prevented a mass slaughter of civilians.

In an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI and partially released on Saturday, Francis used the phrase тАЬthe courage of the white flagтАЭ as he argued that Ukraine, facing a possible defeat, should be open to peace talks brokered by international powers.

Mar. 10 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka secured a thrilling series win over Bangladesh on Saturday when they clinched the third T20 courtesy of a stunning hat-trick from Nuwan Thushara, but the brilliant performance from the visiting Sri Lankan team was probably overshadowed by the split opinions on the 'timed-out' celebration.

Sri Lanka captain Wanindu Hasaranga, after lifting the T20 trophy at the end of the post-match presentation on Saturday, handed it to Dhananjaya de Silva, who seems to be the designated trophy holder for the team when they pose for photographs, and then, in a surprising turn of events, the whole Sri Lankan squad, including Niroshan Dickwella, who didn't even get a game, appeared to be pointing their fingers towards an imaginary watch they were wearing.
