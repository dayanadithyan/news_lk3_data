"Every Bishop is bound to inform the Pope that he has reached the retirement age when they become 75. Therefore, Cardinal Ranjith informed one and a half years ago that he had completed his 75th year. However, the Pope had told him to continue as the Archbishop of Colombo for some more time as he is still lively. In the meantime, a Cardinal can remain active and can vote at a conclave to elect a new Pope until he reaches the age of 80. This is the tradition of the Catholic Church," he added.

### Ratnam - Review

*2024-04-29 17:16:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/182259) · `ta`

"Ratnam" stars Vishal, Priya Bhavani Shankar, and others. It's a sequel to "Tamirapparani" and "Pooja," featuring a coalition between Hari and Vishal. The story revolves around Ratnam, who loses his mother early, becomes a legislator, and falls in love with Mallika, facing enemies who threaten her. The film lacks the usual Hari's stressful and strong sentimental scenes, and Vishal's pronunciation in emotional scenes is criticized. Despite this, performances by Samudrakani and Priya Bhavani Shankar stand out. The film includes political satire and a renewed comedy track, but lacks novelty in its scenes. Cinematographer Sukumar and composer Devi Sri Prasad contribute positively.

### Scotland’s Humza Yousaf resigns as country’s leader

Scotland’s leader Humza Yousaf resigned on Monday, further opening the door to the UK opposition Labour Party to regain ground in its former Scottish heartlands in a national election expected later this year.

Yousaf quit as head of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) after a week of chaos triggered by his scrapping of a coalition agreement with Scotland’s Greens.

He then failed to secure enough support to survive votes of no confidence against him expected later this week.

Resigning little over a year after he replaced Nicola Sturgeon as first minister and SNP leader, Yousaf said it was time for someone else to lead Scotland’s devolved government.

The SNP’s fortunes have faltered over a funding scandal and the resignation of Sturgeon as party leader last year. There has also been infighting over how progressive its pitch should be as it seeks to woo back voters.
