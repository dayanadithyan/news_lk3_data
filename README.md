From his home in Delaware, Biden tersely announced that he was withdrawing from the race and endorsing his Vice President Kamala Harris to be the nominee of the Democratic Party for the November presidential election. If that was stunning, the even greater shock and awe is the speed and manner in which Kamala Harris has rolled out her campaign; secured her nomination within hours; energized the Party at every level; enthused the youth in their own network worlds; raised millions of dollars by the minute; and served notice to Trump that she is the prosecutor, he is the felon, and she knows his type.

### Old Dogs, New Tricks: The Ongoing Battle Against Age-Related Mental Decline

Growing up in Sri Lanka in the 60s and 70s, our ambition was to secure a government job, retire by age 55, and enjoy a good pension. I often saw my male relatives doing just that, reclining in easy chairs with their legs propped up‚Äîa common and comfortable sight. However, the 80s brought dramatic changes. We scattered across the globe, embracing diverse cultures and values. In the USA, particularly, we‚Äôve been conditioned to believe that age is just a number and that life is endless, with us as the Energizer Bunnies, going on forever.

This optimistic view was suddenly upended last week with President Joe Biden‚Äòs announcement of his campaign termination following his disastrous debate performance. Suddenly, age-related mental decline and dementia were thrust into the spotlight, challenging the notion that we can defy the effects of aging indefinitely.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs Supreme Court issued an interim order suspending Tennakoon from his office and suggesting that an acting appointment be made. The Court gave this verdict after granting leave to proceed for nine fundamental rights petitions filed against Tennakoon‚Äôs appointment as IGP.

However, Tennakoon remains in office, as there are no legal provisions for President Ranil Wickremesinghe to make an acting appointment now that polls have been declared, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardana has said.
