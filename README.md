### Could you believe crabs killing giant guitarfish?

*2024-06-12 01:16:58* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Could-you-believe-crabs-killing-giant-guitarfish/14-762951) · `en`

Guitarfish, also known as shovelnose rays, are a species of ray that are named because of their guitar-shaped bodies. They belong to the order Rhinopristiformes, along with the wedgefish and sawfish. This group are also called shark-like rays due to their flattened body with pectoral fins fused to the sides of the head and a hind body that resembles a shark, with two dorsal fins and a caudal fin.

The Rhinopristiformes exhibit slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity, like many other rays and sharks. Such characteristics, alone or in combination, make fishes in this group vulnerable to extinction. The global IUCN Red List of threatened species reveals that species in the order Rhinopristiformes are amongst the most threatened marine fishes and over 70% of guitarfish are either threatened or data deficient.

### The many faces of impunity

*2024-06-12 00:32:18* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-many-faces-of-impunity/4-762932) · `en`

Such impunity is possible because an absolute majority of victims are the most discriminated against people in Sri Lanka: Upcountry Tamils

Ten years: that was how long three State institutions didn’t pay EPF and ETF monies to their retired and deceased employees.

Most victims of this act of criminal injustice suffered and died in silence. A few (about 2,000) filed court cases. The larger society, including the media, political parties and the labour movement, didn’t know, didn’t care.

This injustice happened in the only place it could have been perpetrated with legal, political, and societal impunity: the plantation sector. The culprits were the three State-owned plantation companies. The excuse was that these companies made losses. How many state-owned enterprises make profits? Do the loss-making ones (which include CEB, CPC, and Air Lanka) deny their employees EPF and ETF payments? What would happen if they even tried?

### On system change

“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has”

It was only after the 2022 Aragalaya that the need for system change was felt among different quarters of Sri Lanka’s intelligentsia and opinion makers. In his Independence Day address to the nation even President RW casually referred to system change without any elaboration. One or two outspoken members from the opposition parties also, without much details, described the shortcomings of current administration as systemic. But it was NPP that adopted system change as its central pillar of reforms if it were to come to power.

The Madras High Court has directed the Indian Home Ministry to process an application filed by a Sri Lankan refugee, who has been reportedly residing in India since 1990, for Indian citizenship and pass a speaking order, either accepting or rejecting his plea.

### Sri Lanka to promote sea cucumber hatcheries due to demand: Minister

*2024-06-11 19:00:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-promote-sea-cucumber-hatcheries-due-to-demand-minister-167502/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will establish more sea cucumber hatcheries to accommodate growing demand for the marine animal in the export market, Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda said.

“There are three hatcheries established in Jaffna peninsula. Very soon we will establish in the other areas,” Devananda told reporters on Tuesday.

“They are like black gold,” Devananda said. There are “a lot of farms, especially in the Northern Province. We are getting foreign exchange too.”

The invertebrate found on the sea floor is not commonly consumed by Sri Lankans, so they are being exported to countries like China, Devananda said.

“Sea cucumber, especially our people, they are not eating, it is in China, they are eating.”

Last year the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources told EconomyNext that a kilo of sea cucumber is valued at 20,000-30,000 rupees.

Devananda proposed the establishment of hatcheries as an alternative to catching wild sea cucumbers. (Colombo/Jun11/2024)

Ranil Wickremesinghe may extend his term and Parliament's lifespan by one year due to a constitutional loophole not addressed since the 19th Amendment in 2015 aimed at democratic reforms. Despite amendments reducing terms to five years, Article 83(D) allows him to extend it without parliamentary approval for extensions over six years, enabling an 11-month extension without constitutional violation. Political analysts suggest he deserves more time as the country isn't ready for elections.

Ranil Wickremesinghe has issued his term of office and the lifetime of parliament for a further year, according to the Emanami Next website said

Ranil Wickremesinghe may use a mistake of the political system that has not been paid since the 19th Amendment in 2015.

The 19th Amendment sought to ensure democratic reforms and to ensure the nation and reduce the term of the parliament and the president.

Although all the references to the six -year term of the Parliament and the President of the Parliament, in accordance with the 19th Amendment have been changed to five years, Article 83 (D) has given President Wickremesinghe to extend his tenure.

Any Bill to extend the five -year tenure of the President or Parliament must be approved by a two -thirds majority in Parliament.

However, under Section 83 (D), the universities are only needed if they are extended for more than six (6) years, not five (5) years

### India should act strictly on fishermen poaching, bottom trawling in Sri Lankan sea: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – India and its Southern Tamil Nadu state should take strict actions against their fishermen who encroach into and involved in illegal fishing in Sri Lankan seas with the usage of banned bottom trawler methods, the island nation’s Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda said.

Sri Lanka has seen bottom trawling by Indian fishermen during the peak fishing season in Sri Lanka’s northern waters off Jaffna. Bottom trawling is banned by Sri Lanka and is a punishable offense, which has led to arrest of a raft of Indian fishermen along with their bottom trawlers.

Depletion of fish resources in the Northern sea in the face of continuous Indian bottom trawling, a method of banned fishing that involves dragging heavy weighted nets across the sea floor, has pushed some Northern fishermen to take up Chinese funded sea cucumber farming.

Sri Lanka’s North is just 27 km from the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

### Risk of diarrhea, viral infection with increased flies

*2024-06-11 15:53:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185824) · `ta`

Floods in Sri Lanka have led to a fly infestation, exacerbating the spread of diarrhea and viral infections due to the presence of organic matter in flood waters. Flies mature quickly and proliferate, spreading pathogens from feces and contaminated surfaces. This increases the risk of diseases like diarrhea and viral fever, causing symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, and fever. To combat this, it's crucial to use covered containers, manage waste, ensure clean water, and seek immediate medical attention to mitigate the impact of these diseases.

🟩

Deepal Perera, a specialist on the children's disease of the Children's Hospital in Colombo, said that the floodwaters in the country are increasing the proliferation of flies and the spread of diarrhea and viral infection.

The presence of a large number of organic substances in flooded areas accelerates the maturity of the eggs and leads to the rapid increase in the number of flies when flooding is reduced.

These newly fried flies, searching for food resources, often go to feces, debris and contaminated surfaces and further enhance the health crisis.

He pointed out that the effects of increasing flies are scary and that flies bring pathogens, including diarrhea and viral fever, etc.

"If you eat contaminated food and water, you can lead to many symptoms, including abdominal pain, cramps, nausea and relaxed feces," he said.

He also said that the risk of viral infection, characterized by symptoms such as fever, headaches and nausea, also increases in areas where flies are high.

### Constitutional Error Could Give Ranil and Parliament Another Year

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s constitution could allow President Ranil Wickremesinghe to extend his tenure by almost a year due to a mistake in the constitution that has been overlooked since the 19th Amendment in April 2015.

The sweeping 19th Amendment sought to establish democratic reforms, ensure good governance, and shorten the terms of both the president and parliament to five years. However, it neglected to ensure consistency regarding tenure.

While all references to the six-year terms of both the president and parliament were changed to five years in line with the 19th Amendment, Article 83(b) was overlooked and left unchanged, giving President Wickremesinghe a loophole to extend his term.

Any bill to extend the five-year term of the president or parliament requires approval in parliament with a two-thirds majority, followed by endorsement at a referendum.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka-based apparel manufacturer MAS Holdings has signed a three-year agreement with Los Angeles-based materials company Ambercycle to buy its recycled material.

Ambercycle’s polyester material, cycora®, is made from post-consumer and post-industrial textile waste.
