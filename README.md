### US House passes bill that could ban TikTok nationwide

BBC - The US House of Representatives has passed a landmark bill that could see TikTok banned in America.

It would give the social media giant's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, six months to sell its controlling stake or the app would be blocked in the US.

While the bill passed overwhelmingly in a bipartisan vote, it still needs to clear the Senate and be signed by the president to become law.

Lawmakers have long held concerns about China's influence over TikTok.

TikTok is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, founded in 2012.

The Beijing-based firm is registered in the Cayman Islands, and has offices across Europe and the US.

If the bill does manage to secure approval in the Senate, President Joe Biden has promised to sign it as soon as it lands on his desk, which could prompt a diplomatic spat with China.

### Eliminate taxes for menstrual use, including Saturni Nabkins - Emphasizing the Government

*2024-03-14 09:01:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178676) ¬∑ `ta`

The Sri Lanka Family Association calls for the government to eliminate taxes on menstrual products, including Saturni Nabkins, to address 'menstrual poverty' impacting women's health. This issue was discussed at an International Women's Day event, aiming to pressure the government to restructure taxes on menstrual materials. Internationally, 'Period Poverty' highlights the inability of women to afford essential menstrual products, affecting over half of Sri Lanka's population. The association argues that taxing menstrual products, especially for large-income families, negatively impacts women's hygiene and social inclusion. The recent Value Service Amendment has increased the tax on Saturni Nabkins, raising prices by 92%. MP Harsha de Silva supports eliminating these taxes, suggesting they raise minimal income and proposing free distribution to school children.

üü©

The Sri Lanka Family Association, which has pointed out that 'menstrual poverty' is the most impact on the physical and psychological health of women nationwide, has urged the government to completely eliminate taxes on menstrual use, including Saturni Nabkins.

A discussion was held last week at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall in Colombo on the International Women's Day. The main objective of the investigation was to put pressure on the government to restructure the policy reorganization of all taxes on menstrual material, including Saturni Nabkins, to ensure the menstrual health of women nationwide.

The number of children globally who died before their fifth birthday dropped to a record low of 4.9 million in 2022, but that still represents one death every six seconds, according to new United Nations estimates.

While the mortality rate for under-5s has roughly halved since 2000, the world is still behind in the goal of reducing preventable deaths in that age group by 2030, and progress has slowed since 2015, the report, released on Wednesday, found.

The numbers represent ‚Äúan important milestone‚Äù, said Juan Pablo Uribe, director for health nutrition and population at the World Bank, one of the partners that put together the report alongside Unicef, the U.N. population division and the World Health Organization.

The picture is varied. Some countries, like Cambodia, Malawi and Mongolia, have reduced under-5 mortality rates by more than 75% since 2000.
