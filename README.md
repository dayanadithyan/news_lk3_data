*2024-04-19 08:26:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Israeli-missiles-hit-site-in-Iran-explosions-heard-in-Isfahan-Report/108-280957) ¬∑ `en`

(Aljazeera) - Israeli missiles have hit a site in Iran, according to the US broadcaster ABC News, which cited an unnamed senior US official.

There have also been reports of explosions in Syria and Iraq.

The United States and a number of European countries had been calling on Israel not to respond to the Iranian attack.

### India heads to the polls in world‚Äôs biggest election

(CNN) - Polls opened Friday for the first and largest phase of India‚Äôs marathon general election, kicking off a vote in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to win a rare third consecutive term.

About 969 million people are eligible to vote in the biggest election in human history, with polling taking place in seven phases over the next six weeks in the world‚Äôs most populous country.

The nationwide vote is considered among the most consequential in decades as Modi‚Äôs powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) aims for an outright majority and a mandate to widen its development and Hindu-nationalist policies established during its 10-year rule.

Those policies have transformed India economically and culturally, and BJP rule has been defined by a pull away from India‚Äôs secular foundation, toward Hindu majoritarianism.

Under Modi‚Äôs leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world‚Äôs fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power.

### Party leaders to shoot down MPs request for concessionary duty free vehicle permits

*2024-04-19 08:17:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Party-leaders-to-shoot-down-MPs-request-for-concessionary-duty-free-vehicle-permits/108-280954) ¬∑ `en`

Colombo, April 19 (Daily Mirror) - A request by some MPs across the political divide for concessionary vehicle permits is likely to be shot down by the party leaders given the dire economic situation of the country, Daily Mirror learns.

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne brought to the notice of the Business Committee last week that a letter is being signed by the MPs for such a request.

He said such a request would tarnish the honorary services of the MPs and therefore such facility should not be granted to them in adherence to due protocols as in the case of other public servants and judicial officers.

However, SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella said at the same meeting that such a request should not be entertained at all due to what they called bankruptcy of the country.

Claims agreement with bondholders fell through due to Govt.‚Äôs refusal to set up anti-corruption framework

Says failure to tackle corruption is delaying IMF second tranche and deal with bondholders

He noted that this has caused a delay in the disbursement of the second tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and in reaching an agreement with international sovereign bondholders.

These are days when politicians in the country are getting ready for upcoming elections, hence there are thoughts about whether anyone of them would use schools and education to promote their cause.

Some of the candidates have already started mingling with students and presenting them with opportunities to ask questions on hot topics that are bothering them. One of the probable candidates in the presidential elections is seen offering material goods to students. He dare not present the opportunity for students to ask questions because he would then be putting himself in a very uncomfortable position. There is one other election candidate who offers this opportunity to students and by doing so makes the questioner lose his way in a temporary world of stardom; because the student loses focus of the existing world when he or she gets to question the highest authority in the country. These are all political gimmicks.

Since Netanyahu became Israel‚Äôs prime minister for the first time in 1996, his main foreign policy objective has been to get the United States to attack Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities and prevent the Islamic Republic from achieving nuclear power parity vis-√†-vis Israel.
