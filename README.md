Colombo, April 2 (Daily Mirror) - India has no intention to reverse the agreement that ceded the Katchatheevu Island to Sri Lanka despite the political debate in India that is primarily meant for domestic consumption in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Daily Mirror learns.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday targeted the DMK over the Katchatheevu island issue, alleging the ruling party of Tamil Nadu did nothing to safeguard the state's interests. New details emerging on the issue of India handing over the Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka have unmasked the DMK's double standards totally, he said on X.

It is apparent that the current Indian ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is not in favour of the position taken by the then Indian National Congress government. However, the agreement has now been signed, and an informed source said the current debate in India has nothing to do with Sri Lanka.

Monthly milk powder consumption dropped from 7000 MT to 3000 MT over last few years

Sri Lanka’s monthly milk powder consumption, which almost halved following the economic crisis, due to the price escalation, is witnessing a slight increase, a senior industry representative said.

The monthly milk powder consumption, which was about 7,000 MT pre-Covid, dropped to about 3,000 MT over the last three years, due to the price increases caused by the increase in the US dollar, an increase in global market milk prices and a hike in government taxes.

However, with the economic conditions slightly improving, over one million households have returned to the market, although the overall consumption remains lower than the pre-COVID levels, Maliban Group Chief Executive Officer Ravi Jayawardena said. He shared his views while addressing a panel discussion hosted by Capital Alliance Limited, which delved into the current trends in consumer spending and post-crisis outlook in Sri Lanka.

As businesses navigate complex challenges and pursue growth opportunities in a turbulent environment, it is imperative to recognise that the true engine driving success lies in effectively harnessing and optimising human resources. It is people who drive all other resources, thus becoming the central force. Gone are the days when success was solely measured by financial metrics or technological competence. While money, machinery, and markets undoubtedly play crucial roles, they are merely tools in the hands of people. The real value lies in the talent, creativity, and dedication of individuals who comprise the workforce

The UNP has always operated on a centre-right economic policy maxim, remaining on a continuum of Thatcherite or Reaganite low tax, small government, pro-business, pro-market foundations

Peter Breuer of the IMF’s visiting delegation made some interesting comments specifically related to alternatives or alterations to the current program. He stated that any alternative proposals must be realistic before repeating the urgency for improving revenue and meeting Intended Targets (ITs) and noting the “commitment in the (IMF) program to not grant any more tax concessions. Tax concessions are a missing component of tax revenues”.

The given graphs extracted from ADB and IMF reports reiterate Breuer’s point that Sri Lanka’s tax revenues are inadequate in terms of value and imbalanced in terms of revenue source.

A stable government is imperative for garnering the confidence of FDI and engaging with international financial institutions

Pre-electoral alliances and post-election coalitions among political parties have emerged as significant features in contemporary politics.

An examination of this political phenomenon is crucial for understanding election dynamics and the processes of government formation and sustainability. It is heartening to observe a relative increase in studies dedicated to alliances and coalitions over the past decade.

S. Ramanujam, a retired former Senior Administrative Officer of the Indian government at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research reveals that Tamil Nadu was ruled by the Indian National Congress in the 1950s and up to 1966. In 1967 DMK under the leadership of late C.N. Annadurai came to power. Thereafter, only the DMK and AIADMK have ruled Tamil Nadu (TN).

### “A single window for all investments that simplifies investment”

Board of Investment (BOI) and Port City Economic Commission Chairman Dinesh Weerakkody in this interview responds to some of the questions posed covering the investment challenges facing the country.

Q: Why does Sri Lanka get less FDI than most regional neighbours?

A: According to most credible surveys carried out, the main drivers of investment decisions are political and macroeconomic stability and the country’s regulatory and business environment. Excluding the civil conflict and the pandemic, policy inconsistency has impacted Sri Lanka’s investment climate significantly. Even prior to the recent economic crisis, Sri Lanka had a tendency of changing key policies. This has resulted in investors facing practical difficulties in running their businesses, especially with respect to the tax regime of the country.

### Sri Lanka exporters protest rupee appreciation, forced conversion rules

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s export associations have protested the recent sharp appreciation of the rupee saying forex conversion rules have been forced on them and some costs are not falling in line with rupee gains, leading to a loss of cost competitiveness.

Sri Lanka’s central bank is operating a de facto pegged exchange rate where the agency’s domestic assets are being reduced against dollar purchases (reversing ‘money printing’), triggering a balance of payments surplus, allowing the exchange rate to be appreciated if the agency wishes, analysts have shown.

There is however a widespread belief that suspending debt repayments have helped appreciate the rupee, though the financial account turned into a deficit in the last quarter of 2022, just as monetary stability was restored allowing out payments to be made and reserves to be collected.
