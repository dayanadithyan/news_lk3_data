### Gaza ceasefire talks show no sign of progress, US says onus on Hamas

Hamas on Thursday left Gaza ceasefire talks in Cairo where there was no sign of progress just days before the start of Ramadan, while the U.S. said the onus was on the Palestinian militant group to strike a deal on Israeli hostages.

Israel and Hamas blamed each other for the lack of agreement after four days of talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt about a 40-day ceasefire amid fears violence could escalate during the Muslim fasting month.

Egyptian security sources said talks, taking place without an Israeli delegation in Cairo, would resume on Sunday, the expected start of Ramadan.

Senior U.S. administration officials said the onus was on Hamas to complete a hostage deal and attributed the delay to what they described as Hamas so far not agreeing to release sick and elderly hostages.

A Hamas official told Reuters the United States was in partnership with Israel and that such comments were misleading. Hamas has insisted that a ceasefire deal include a process toward ending the war altogether.

With the disappearance of queues for essential items, and the steadfast repression of any descent, it appears as if most of us have settled down to the realities of economic hardships with resignation and despondency. This being a society that was dominated by colonisers for centuries and shaped by beliefs in fate and mystic powers for millennia that kind of thinking can be expected. But giving up any hope of overcoming this adversity and bracing things to get worse as if we are in an inescapable bondage of sort is inexcusable.

### Economic concerns surrounding salary increases at Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Reports of substantial salary hikes at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) raise concerns regarding the economic implications of these decisions. Led by Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, the CBSL has defended these raises as lawful under the Central Bank Act, citing the need for competitive salaries to retain skilled personnel. However, several economic arguments suggest that these salary increases may not be in the best interest of economic stability in the nation.

n The salary hikes at the CBSL could set a precedent for similar demands across the economy. Trade unions have already seized upon this case to press for wage increases for their members. As the public sector often sets the tone for wage-setting practices, the CBSLтАЩs actions risk undermining its primary mission of maintaining price stability. Widespread wage increases could fuel inflationary pressures, ultimately eroding the purchasing power of consumers and destabilizing the economy.
