### Five reasons why Ranil must be superseded in 100 days

*2024-07-04 02:50:07* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Five-reasons-why-Ranil-must-be-superseded-in-100-days/4-763821) · `en`

Whatever option you pick as your choice for President, the process of deliberation leading to that choice must entail the initial methodological step of ruling out.

I argue that the candidate we should rule out as a preliminary step is the unelected incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe. As a political scientist I shall give five fundamental reasons why. But before that, here’s a personal note.

I’m in my 60s. We are governed by someone in his 70s. Most of our leaders have been in their 60s or 70s. For the first time, those who seek to govern us are in their 50s. My gut-instinct is to help take leadership from the clutches of those a decade older than me and transfer it to the generation a decade younger than me. That’s political evolution, social progress.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe claims that it is his economic diligence that has prevented the scenes from Nairobi, Kenya— dead bodies in the streets and parts of the Parliament ablaze-- from being re-enacted in Colombo.

Sampanthan could never overlook the ethnic divisions that have plagued Sri Lanka for decades – before, during and after the war

Sampanthan, one among the few TNA leaders who Western diplomats in Colombo continued to respect despite his political predicament, tried to come on to his own after the LTTE was militarily crushed. Now minus the armed campaign to break up Sri Lanka, the TNA leader made some bold statements, making it clear that he wanted to be a part of the island nation. A section of the TNA, which fragmented over the years, sided with him. After the war, he played a major role in highlighting internationally the horrific price the ordinary Tamils had to pay in Sri Lanka simply for being at the wrong place at the wrong time

### Sri Lanka strikes restructuring agreement with bondholders

*2024-07-04 00:27:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100278/sri-lanka-strikes-restructuring-agreement-with-bondholders) · `en`

(Reuters) - Sri Lanka has secured a deal to move forward on restructuring about $12.5 billion of international bonds, the government said on Wednesday, a major step in the island nation’s fragile recovery from a severe financial crisis.

The South Asian country defaulted for the first time on its foreign debt in May 2022 after its economy was driven to the brink by a slump in foreign exchange reserves.

Restructuring international bonds was one of the key conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a $2.9 billion bailout programme that helped Sri Lanka tame inflation, stabilise its currency, and improve public finances.

The deal with selected bondholders, who cover about 50% of Sri Lanka’s bonds, is contingent on confirmation by the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) made up of bilateral creditors and the IMF to ensure it is in line with the global lender’s debt sustainability analysis for the country.

### Sri Lanka strikes restructuring agreement with bondholders - report

(Bloomberg) -- Sri Lanka and creditors reached agreement on the terms for a $12 billion bond restructuring, bringing the South Asian nation closer to completing its debt overhaul two years after it defaulted.

Bondholders and the nation agreed to a framework for a deal that includes notes linked to economic performance and a governance-linked structure as part of plain vanilla instruments, according to a statement released Wednesday at the conclusion of the second round of restricted talks.

The deal marks the culmination of more than a year of difficult negotiations between Sri Lanka and its bondholders as officials took steps to rehabilitate the nation’s fiscal health. It will help restore access to international capital markets after the island nation fell into a default in 2022, and help Sri Lanka tap further funding from the International Monetary Fund.

### Kamala Harris top choice to replace Joe Biden if he steps aside, sources say

Vice President Kamala Harris is the top alternative to replace U.S. President Joe Biden if he decides not to continue his reelection campaign, according to seven senior sources at the Biden campaign, the White House and the Democratic National Committee with knowledge of current discussions on the topic.

Biden’s fumbling, sometimes-incoherent and widely-panned first-debate performance against Republican rival Donald Trump last week set off a wave of panic within the Democratic party over concerns that he may not be fit enough to serve a second term, and prompted calls for top aides to resign.

Some influential Democrats have floated alternatives to Biden besides Harris, including popular cabinet members and Democratic governors like Gavin Newsom from California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. But trying to sidestep Harris is wishful thinking and would be nearly impossible, these sources, who did not wish to be named, said.
