### Organiser of ‘white party’ in Sri Lanka apologises after backlash

An organiser of a “white party” in Sri Lanka has apologised after the event sparked a backlash online.

The event’s advertisement specified a white dress code, but also had a line saying “Face control: White” - which was largely interpreted to mean the event was open only to white people.

An organiser later said the event was “a bad idea”, adding that it was meant to bring together expatriates.

The party, which was due to take place last Saturday, was cancelled.

Backlash against the event was swift, with many on social media calling it “disgusting” and “racist”.

“I know not all expats are like this... but this sort of thing should be stopped fast and stopped hard,” said one local restaurant owner.

“How dare they come to a brown country and ban the people of that country,” another social media user said on Facebook.

Writing on Instagram under the handle geo_ecstatic, a man who said he was an event organiser, said there was “no malice or racism” in planning the party.

### Trump is disqualified from Illinois ballot, judge rules

*2024-02-29 08:06:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97609/trump-is-disqualified-from-illinois-ballot-judge-rules) · `en`

(Reuters) -An Illinois state judge on Wednesday barred Donald Trump from appearing on the Illinois’ Republican presidential primary ballot because of his role in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but she delayed her ruling from taking effect in light of an expected appeal by the former U.S. president.

Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter sided with Illinois voters who argued that the former president should be disqualified from the state’s March 19 primary ballot and its Nov. 5 general election ballot for violating the anti-insurrection clause of the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment.

The final outcome of the Illinois case and similar challenges will likely be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard arguments related to Trump’s ballot eligibility on Feb. 8.

Porter said she was staying her decision because she expected his appeal to Illinois’ appellate courts, and a potential ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court.

Colombo, Feb 28 (Daily Mirror) -  In the wake of disquieting findings on the health risks associated with certain COVID-19 vaccines, the Sri Lankan health authorities seem to be turning a blind eye as they go unresponsive to the queries.

Despite Daily Mirror's efforts to prompt the authorities to articulate their position on the recent findings, responsible officials have failed to respond, leaving the masses in dilemma.

Since the breakout of Covid-19, sceptics around the world expressed their doubts about the Covid infection to Covid Vaccine, putting forward so many “conspiracy” theories.

However, looking back, many people now seem to see a coercing tactic in making people accept the vaccine, which was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the highest authority in the current medical industry- at the time of administering. Pfizer was approved in 2021 while Moderna was approved by the FDA in 2023.
