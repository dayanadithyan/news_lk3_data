Meanwhile, Izmaly Haney, the leader of the political wing of the Hamas organization last week in Iran, was killed. Israel announced that the organization's military leader Mohammed Daif was also killed.. Yehya Sinwar has been appointed as the new leader of Hamas's political wing.

### Are MPs use parliamentary powers and privileges to repress media repression?

*2024-08-07 04:25:30* ¬∑ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c9844n023lxo) ¬∑ `si`

MPs in Sri Lanka have used parliamentary privileges to address perceived media bias and misinformation, but concerns arise over potential misuse to stifle criticism. The Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act allows MPs broad freedoms of speech, yet there's controversy over how these rights intersect with press freedom. Instances of MPs questioning journalists before parliamentary committees and allegations of journalists being targeted for their reporting highlight the delicate balance between parliamentary immunity and media accountability.

üü©

Are MPs use parliamentary powers and privileges to repress media repression?

Members can express any idea in the Chamber of Principles of Parliament. It does not matter whether it is in court. It is a unique privilege of parliamentarians regarding freedom of speech. However, the citizens of the country have interrogated the slandeasures of the Sri Lankan Parliament by using that privilege.

MP Namal Rajapaksa once said that the laws should be amended to ensure that the problem was effectively targeting various individuals using parliamentary privileges.
