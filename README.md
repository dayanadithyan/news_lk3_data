ECONOMYNEXT тАУ In South Asia, women face similar hurdles when breaking into the male-dominated political arena, a webinar on Empowering Voices: Exploring the Political Landscape for Women in South Asia heard.

Across the region, more often than not, women are nominated to fill a seat falling vacant by the death of a male family member, as the party leadership made up of men is confident of winning on the тАШsympathy vote,тАЩ or simply to fill a quota, and not for their qualifications and capabilities.

In Sri Lanka, despite a hard-won battle for a 25 per cent quota for women at the Local Government level six years ago, the drive to have more women at decision making levels continues. It is yet to be seen if the new electoral system at the provincial level will yield the results women seek. Representation of women in the Sri Lankan Parliament is a dismal 5.3 per cent (only 12 of the 225 MPs are women), Dr Sudharshani Fernandopulle, MP pointed out.

CNN - One day in the next couple of years, everyone in the world will lose a second of their time. Exactly when that will happen is being influenced by humans, according to a new study, as melting polar ice alters the EarthтАЩs rotation and changes time itself.

The hours and minutes that dictate our days are determined by EarthтАЩs rotation. But that rotation is not constant; it can change ever so slightly, depending on whatтАЩs happening on EarthтАЩs surface and in its molten core.

These nearly imperceptible changes occasionally mean the worldтАЩs clocks need to be adjusted by a тАЬleap second,тАЭ which may sound tiny but can have a big impact on computing systems.

Plenty of seconds have been added over the years. But after a long trend of slowing, the EarthтАЩs rotation is now speeding up because of changes in its core. For the first time ever, a second will need to be taken off.

### Rise in hand-foot-and-mouth disease among children

*2024-03-29 05:57:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Rise-in-hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-among-children/108-279814) ┬╖ `en`

Colombo, March 29 (Daily Mirror) - Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) Consultant Pediatrician Dr. Deepal Perera said today that there is an increase in the spread of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) among schoolchildren these days.

He said this disease spreads every year, especially between March and April.

If children have symptoms like small, oval, red or white blisters on the palms and soles of the feet, as well as in the mouth, if there is a red skin rash with a brown scale on it, or if the rash appears on the outer arms, then parents should keep in mind not to send their children to schools, daycare centres or public places.

HFMD is most commonly caused by the Coxsackie virus. The main way HFMD spreads is through contact with the fluid from inside the blisters or with the droplets spread from sneezing and coughing.

The virus can also be present in bowel movements (excrement) for up to several weeks after the person has recovered.

### No mea culpa

ItтАЩs almost comedic in its simple-minded analysis of complicated issues

In the end there was no conspiracy. The book proves once more that GR is a person so na├пve and so completely out his depth in either running a country, or writing a book. Alas, itтАЩs the truth though he may have had success as defence secretary once upon a time. There may have been others who may or may not have conspired against him, but certainly it wasnтАЩt a foreign power and the book he trots out to prove otherwise is the greatest testimony underlining the fact that he had to leave because of his own folly, and not due to the machinations of some sinister foreign force. Folly, to be sure, seems to be his calling card

Former President Gotabaya RajapaksaтАЩs book titled тАЬConspiracy to oust me from the presidencyтАЭ does in no way live up to its title. If anyone thinks this is a page turner that gives a blow by blow about how a conspiracy unfolded to destroy his presidency, donтАЩt waste your time or your money on the work.

Former President Gotabaya RajapaksaтАЩs book titled тАЬConspiracy to oust me from the presidencyтАЭ does in no way live up to its title. If anyone thinks this is a page turner that gives a blow by blow about how a conspiracy unfolded to destroy his presidency, donтАЩt waste your time or your money on the work.

The former president merely insults those who donтАЩt believe there was a conspiracy to get rid of him. This writer read the Sinhala version of the book. The author writes that only the extremely na├пve, тАШbolandaтАЩ, would believe that there wasnтАЩt a foreign conspiracy to oust him.

That statement is typical of the way Gotabaya Rajapaksa (GR) ruled the country. He seemed to be so aloof that he was constantly seen to be out of touch when in power. Added to that was his rather supercilious attitude which seemed to make him think he knew more than the rabble he ruled over.

Our purpose in this world is to choose the resurrection where we join with Christ and seek his power of thought to restore our minds to its original glory

Birth and death have no special merit except that they both re-enact and perpetuate the separation notwithstanding the entry into or the exit of the lower state of vibration. Life in the physical plane manifests as though thought has no power or causal effect. We are buffeted and bruised by everything external and the impact of them is experienced by the body where it тАЬperceptuallyтАЭ witnesses to this schema. Thus, from a state of mindfulness to a state of mindlessness, the descent which reflects the separation from God, the body becomes the hallmark of all who тАЬhave sinned and come short of his glory.тАЭ But the resurrection, on the other hand, is one of great importance since it restores the function of Causation to cause in the mind

### Easter and the Roman Centurion: A Symphony of Redemption

*2024-03-29 04:30:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/easter-and-the-roman-centurion-a-symphony-of-redemption/) ┬╖ `en`

Easter, the cornerstone of the Christian faith, is universally described as a celebration of penance, hope, renewal, and the triumph of life over death. Central to this profound narrative in history is the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, a pivotal moment that unfolded on the cross; an instrument known, and well-recognised, as an emblem of condemnation, retribution, and shame. However, on that fateful day of the crucifixion, amidst the anguish and agony of the execution of the Son of God, one figure emerges from the pages of history; the Roman Centurion who stood at the foot of the cross. His coincidental encounter with divinity and spirituality transformed a moment of despair into a guiding light of redemption.

### Getting back to that peaceful Easter Sunday - EDITORIAL

*2024-03-29 00:02:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Getting-back-to-that-peaceful-Easter-Sunday-EDITORIAL/172-279813) ┬╖ `en`

Easter Sunday is an important day in the Sri Lankan calendar as this day has become the talking point as never before due to the┬а 2019 тАШEaster Sunday bombingsтАЩ.

Christians would never compare manтАЩs sufferings with the agony Jesus went through on the cross. According to Rev. Frs. Sanjeewa Mendis and Sriyananda Fernando-who spoke on the meaning and message of Easter on ITNтАЩs Pini Viyana programme on March 28-the message conveyed by the Son of God is to spread тАШloveтАЩ even during the toughest of times.

Sri Lankan Christians also conveyed a similar and strong message when their kith and kin were brutally blown to pieces inside three churches chose to stay calm and collected as a community. They had forgiven the assailants, but demanded justice for the affected families. This calmness was preserved largely due to the instructions issued by the head of the Catholic Church, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith.

### Gaza genocide, ISIS and the tailpiece of Moscow terror

An injured man is helped outside Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City: The United Nations says the Gaza StripтАЩs health system is collapsing. AFP

The Moscow terror attack, conveniently claimed by the so-called Islamic State, a.k.a. ISIS, and the diplomatic circus at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday in passing a Gaza┬аceasefire resolution may appear disconnected at first glance. But there is enough interconnection between the two tragedies.

First, letтАЩs discuss the ISIS connection. The Friday evening terror attack at the Crocus City Hall on the outskirts of Moscow has revealed the mercenary character of ISIS. Questions have always lingered about the Islamic credentials of ISIS since its birth from the ashes of Abu Musab al-ZarqawiтАЩs Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in 2011.
