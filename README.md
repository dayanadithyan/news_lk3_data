### Former SLFP MP Tissa Karaliyadda joins SJB

*2024-05-28 02:11:23* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Former-SLFP-MP-Tissa-Karaliyadda-joins-SJB/56-762258) · `en`

Veteran politician and former Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Anuradhapura district MP Tissa Karaliyadda officially joined the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) over the weekend.

Karaliyadda joined the SJB after meeting with party leader Sajith Premadasa in Polonnaruwa on Saturday. Premadasa was in town for a party rally when he welcomed Karaliyadda into the SJB. The event was also attended by SJB MP Rohana Bandara.

Karaliyadda entered Parliament representing the Anuradhapura district and has served as the Cabinet Minister for Child Development and Women’s Affairs, as well as the Minister of Indigenous Medicine.

The veteran politician found himself embroiled in controversy in 2015 when a photograph of him alongside underworld figure Iron Ranasinghe, alias SF Loku Malli, a prime suspect in the murder of nightclub owner Wasantha de Zoysa, went viral. At the time Karaliyadda denied any connection to Ranasinghe and the murder of de Zoysa in Anuradhapura.

Says SJB is open to hold leadership debate first only if dates for economic council debate are provided

Stresses people will not accept NPP economic policies which have not been penned down and are limited to rhetoric

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar yesterday said no one in the country will be willing to accept National People’s Power (NPP) party’s economic policies which appear to be limited to rhetoric and have not been penned down as a comprehensive plan.

Speaking at a press briefing, Marikkar emphasised that the primary concern in Sri Lanka is the economic crisis. He noted that the SJB has therefore proposed dates for debates involving both the Economic Councils and Leadership to the NPP. However, he expressed disappointment that the NPP has yet to respond to the request for the Economic Council debate.

### 2,000 people feared buried under Papua New Guinea landslide

*2024-05-28 02:03:53* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/2-000-people-feared-buried-under-Papua-New-Guinea-landslide/56-762253) · `en`

The landslide occurred in the mountainous Enga region in northern Papua New Guinea on Friday and the latest figure is a sharp rise from earlier estimates.

Soon after the disaster occurred, the United Nations said as many as 100 may have died. That was later revised up to 670, according to estimates from the Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the country.

But that may now be a major underestimate according to the latest projection from Papua New Guinea’s disaster agency.  “The landslide buried more than 2000 people alive and caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country,” National Disaster Centre Acting Director Lusete Laso Mana said in a letter to the UN.

SJB’s Tissa Attanayake condemns Govt. move to target ordinary citizens for revenue while allowing tax evaders to escape

Raises concerns over nation’s foreign exchange earnings, being held abroad due to political instability and business reluctance

Stresses importance of collecting taxes owed by wealthy persons who have evaded their tax obligations

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) National Organiser Tissa Attanayake asserted yesterday that, considering the significant drop in Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) in Sri Lanka, it is misleading to suggest that the economy is in a good state.

Addressing a press conference in Colombo, Tissa Attanayake said the latest Central Bank Economic Review revealed a stark decline in FDIs, dropping from $ 884 million in 2022 to just $ 172 million in 2023.

### Debt and taxes: Can we hide our heads in the sand?

*2024-05-28 01:51:50* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Debt-and-taxes-Can-we-hide-our-heads-in-the-sand/4-762249) · `en`

Unless we ask more and better questions of those who want to rule us, history may repeat

A few days ago, I attended the launch of a policy platform by an organisation called Piripun Deshayak where the audience included at least one Presidential Candidate. I was quite surprised that the document (and the presentations) made no mention of debt or taxes.

Saubhagyaye Dakma, the policy platform developed for Gotabaya Rajapaksa by Viyath Maga was a disaster, but it addressed both debt and taxes. That was in the good old days of 2019.

In these darker times how could anyone propose actions, including significant public investments, to make Sri Lanka a developed nation by 2040 without addressing these key issues, I wondered. Where was the money, once the debts were serviced?\

### Economic stability with SOE reforms need system change

Is there a more fundamental reason that permitted SOEs to operate without accountability, burden public finance, contribute to economic crisis and misallocation of resources?

The Head of Emerging Market Economies Johanna Chua, when commenting recently on Sri Lanka’s emerging economic stability under IMF direction made a crucial point that “people” should “feel” the stability after paying a heavy price for it. But she failed to identify those people she was referring to. IMF being an institution created by and for the affluent never cared for the poor and downtrodden. It is a class biased institution predominantly interested in maintaining the stability of the capitalist system with its financial structure.

### Israel reportedly agrees to  resume talks

Under international pressure Israel has reportedly agreed to resume talks on a solution to the Gaza crisis. Widespread support for Palestine, the ruling of the ICJ, arrest warrants sought by the ICC and US prodding have forced Israel to bend, even if only slightly.

Times of Israel (TOI) reported last week that Israel, the United States and Qatar have agreed to renew talks on a hostage deal and truce with Hamas, the paper said. Talks were suspended in April.

TOI further said that the fresh negotiations will be based on a new outline negotiated in Paris by CIA Director William Burns, Mossad Chief David Barnea, and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani.

In line with this, the Israeli war Cabinet expanded the mandate of the team negotiating a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas, TOI said.

Did the Constitutional Council, President and the CIABOC Commissioners follow due process in reappointing its DG?

The gravity and importance of transparency and effectiveness of CIABOC for the very existence of the country cannot be lost on the Government and its officers; nor can the Opposition parties, big or small, especially those fielding “Presidential” candidates claim ignorance of this situation. Remarkably, none of the political parties or even the public officers who run to the Supreme Court at the slightest hint of an appointment against their expectations, have even raised a query on this crucial appointment made without any transparency. One can only wonder then, if they were all in collusion

Orders will be fulfilled on a first-come, first-served basis within each coverage area.

Earlier, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that Elon Musk had sent an application to launch the Starlink service in Sri Lanka and preliminary work to bring Starlink to Sri Lanka has been completed.
