### Absolute independence is the bane for CBSL enhanced salary revision

The enormous independence given to the CBSL in the determination of salaries of its employees has been the bane for this unethical and anomalous situation

The famous dictum made by John Acton, a British jurist (1887) that absolute corruption corrupts absolutely comes to my mind when I read the unilateral decision taken by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in granting an obnoxious salary revision (70%) to its employees across the board, behind the cover of the unfettered autonomy and independent status given to the CBSL by Act No. 16 of 2023. One could argue whether the CBSL‚Äôs sense of morality has lessened to such a low ebb with the discretionary powers it has secured with the new Act at a time when the CBSL itself had declared the country as a bankrupt state in terms of economic and financial terms.

### Meeting in Court; COPE; poem read at Oscar Awards 76

*2024-03-22 05:54:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/meeting-in-court-cope-poem-read-at-oscar-awards-76/) ¬∑ `en`

One of two headlines in The Island of Monday March 18 was ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs meet in court, JVP tells Rohitha.‚Äù The proposer JVP will be represented by former COPE Chairman Sunil Handunetti and Vijitha Herath and of course Rohitha is Abeygunawardena, always in the news. The challenge is consequent to the newly appointed Chairman/COPE threatening to bring legal action against Vijitha Herath who, Rohitha accuses, made a defamatory statement against him. Handunetti states: ‚ÄúWe accept the challenge and dare Abeygunawardena to go before the courts. We will get an opportunity to prove all allegations against him.‚Äù

Will Rohitha A institute legal action against these two stalwarts of the JVP? Cassandra places a sure bet: he won‚Äôt. Our politicians usually threaten to go to courts but definitely fight shy of doing so. If they are as white as their kapati suits, they need not fear appearing in any court or public forum. But many have skeletons rattling in their cupboards. And they rattle loud and clear.

### Economic recovery must become more broad-based

President Wickremesinghe with China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) Chairman Wang Tongzhou. CCCC through CHEC Port City Colombo, has invested $ 1.4 billion on Port City Colombo and committed a further $ 300 million. FDI and exports are key to Sri Lanka‚Äôs economic recovery

Sri Lanka is now clearly emerging from an unprecedented economic crisis that imposed significant hardships on its people, especially the most vulnerable. There are now some clear signs of recovery. The IMF has projected that the economy will expand in 2024 and that growth will accelerate. Tight borrowing conditions and reduced disposable income still holds back domestic consumption whilst the reform momentum is hurting the poor in some ways.

### Elections and the economy

*2024-03-22 05:42:24* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Elections-and-the-economy/4-759808) ¬∑ `en`

The next election if it were to be dominated by economic issues would be a contest between NPP‚Äôs system change with a market model cleansed of its rigidities and the IMF path embraced by its opponents ‚Äì Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Election fever is gripping Sri Lanka. It appears that a General Election could precede the Presidential Election mainly because of Ranil Wickremesinghe‚Äôs (RW) rising unpopularity largely due to his IMF led economic recovery path.

IMF for its part has no choice but to slow down its program after completing its second review, because election fever demands more time and energy from parliamentarians outside the legislature than inside, and consequently it would not be possible for the Parliament to pass the necessary reforms required for the recovery. Economy therefore is destined to take the back seat and allow politics to dominate national attention for the rest of the year.

### Interesting tales from a country of mixed fortunes - EDITORIAL

Sri Lanka is a country of mixed fortunes to a total outsider. There is news of doctors leaving the shores in numbers and also tourists arriving in droves to enjoy the scenic beauty of the country.

According to health sector sources as many as close to 450 medical professionals had left the country during recent times because they were not satisfied with what it had to offer them.

On the contrary tourists from overseas are landing here in large numbers because they are happy with what Sri Lanka can offer them in the paradise island. The government has countered claims by the medics and said that a good many of them returned to their homeland. But those in the medical profession here have rubbished the claims stating that only five specialists returned. The government must verify its news before releasing statements because this is an era where the public and visiting tourists are well-updated about happenings here and abroad on the topics mentioned in this column.

### Biggest mysteries in Aviation history

*2024-03-22 01:05:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/biggest-mysteries-in-aviation-history/) ¬∑ `en`

Humans, for generations, would have been envious of birds as the freedom of the skies was entirely theirs. Born with abilities of terrestrial pursuits, humans soon took to water and mastered the art of transport in water too but attempts at flying like birds were in vain, most ending in disaster! However, myths abound. Daedalus, the engineer and his son, Icarus, are supposed to have flown with wings of wax and feather, according to Greek legend.

Though Daedalus flew successfully from Crete to Naples, overambitious Icarus, who flew too high got close to the Sun and fell to his death in the ocean due to wax wings melting. Persian King Kaj Kaoos is supposed to have flown around his kingdom with eagles attached to his throne and Alexander the Great is supposed to have done the same in a basket powered by four Griffins. If Valmiki‚Äôs Ramayana is to be believed, as many Indians do, our King Ravana ought to be considered the pioneer aviator!

But in their previous Test series, against New Zealand in November-December, Bangladesh won the first match in Sylhet before losing the second in Dhaka after a close fight.

"We have high expectations," Bangladesh coach Chandika Hathurusingha told reporters in Sylhet ahead of the first Test, part of the 2023‚Äì25 World Test Championship cycle.

Hathurusingha warned however that he was expecting a tough challenge from his home nation Sri Lanka, calling them a "formidable, very experienced side".

The shock departure of Varadkar, who became the first gay prime minister of the once-staunchly Catholic country in 2017 and returned to the premiership just 15 months ago, does not trigger a general election. A vote must be held by March 2025.

### Wanindu Hasaranga Test ban: Sri Lanka cricket denies use of any loopholes

Sri Lanka Cricket has denied that they exploited any loopholes after the Wanindu Hasaranga Test ban fiasco has grabbed the headlines in recent times.

Hasaranga, who had retired from the longest format of the game in August last year, performed a U-turn and was subsequently selected for the Test series against Bangladesh. However, in a major turn of events, the ICC would slap him with a ban on Tuesday, March 19.

This meant that he would be unable to play the series against Bangladesh, but meant that he would be available for the T20 World Cup 2024 and the upcoming season of the IPL with his new franchise, Sunrisers Hyderabad.

While there has been speculation among fans and pundits that the Sri Lanka cricket board has exploited a loophole in the ICC rules, the governing body has strongly rejected this claim. The SLC claimed that Hasaranga had informed them via e-mail on March 16 about his desire to play Test matches and said that his fitness levels had improved.
