அவர்களில் ஒருவர் 26 வயதுடைய மலர்மதி ராஜேந்திரன் என்றும் மற்றவர் 39 வயதான ஜெயக்குமார் தருமராசா என்றும் தெரிவிக்கப்படுகின்றது.

கடந்த ஜனவரி 30, 2023 அன்று குறித்த இருவரும் மலேசியா செல்வதற்காக கொழும்பு துறைமுகத்தில் நிறுத்தி வைக்கப்பட்டிருந்த 'மெர்க்ஸ் யூனிகார்ன்' கப்பலில் ஏற்றப்பட்ட வெற்று கொள்கலனுக்குள் இரகசியமாக நுழைந்துள்ளனர்.

ஆனால் குறித்த கப்பல் மலேசியாவிற்கு வந்தபோது, ​​கொள்கலனில் மறைந்திருந்த இரு சந்தேக நபர்களையும் மலேசியா ஏற்றுக்கொள்ள மறுத்ததால், அதிகாரிகள் சந்தேக நபர்களை ஏற்றிக்கொண்டு பல நாடுகளுக்குச் சென்று இறுதியாக சீனாவிற்கு சென்றுள்ளனர்.

Parliament’s lower house, or Bundestag, backed the legislation, a prominent reform project of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s socially liberal governing coalition, by 407 votes to 226. There were four abstentions.

Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said the government’s aim is to “fight the black market” and better protect young people. He said current laws in the European Union’s most populous nation have failed, with consumption rising and increasing problems with contaminated or overly concentrated cannabis.
