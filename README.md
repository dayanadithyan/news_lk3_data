### Anti -Religious Minority Activities in Sri Lanka with the support of state authorities

*2024-06-27 17:51:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187115) ¬∑ `ta`

In Sri Lanka, state-supported anti-religious minority activities have escalated, with police involvement. The U.S. highlighted these issues in its 2023 religious freedom report. Local majority communities claim state backing for violent incidents against religious minorities, especially Christians and Muslims. Christian groups allege harassment and restrictions on religious practices, with the National Christian Swiss Coalition Organization (NCEASL) reporting police and state official interference. Civil activists and media report arrests of Tamil National People's Front supporters for peaceful protests and ongoing surveillance and harassment of Muslims post-2019 Easter Sunday attacks. The government is accused of viewing Muslim and Christian communities as threats to Sinhala Buddhist dominance, leading to legal controls and arrests under the ICCPR law. Religious transaction registrations are criticized for being arbitrary, with NCEASL reporting nine incidents against Muslims and 13 against Hindus. Concerns also arise over the Presidential Secretariat for Archaeological Traditional Management potentially leading to land grabs in Tamil and Muslim areas.

Anti -Religious Minority Activities in Sri Lanka with the support of police officials

The United States has said that the US has said that state officials have received support for these measures.

The United States made this statement in the annual report on religious independence in 2023.

Members of the local majority community said that the religious people who said they were involved in violent incidents, said state officials supported them.

Researchers who analyzed the violence against Christians said that the state authorities acted in support of those who appealed to Christians to stop their activities in Buddhist villages or to obtain the permission of the Ministry of Buddhism for religion.

Christian groups have continued to say that the National Christian Swiss Coalition Organization (NCEASL) of Sri Lanka has accepted this and that the police and state officials have been involved in the harassment of minority community and their religious transactions.

Sri Lankan officials in Paris inked the agreement with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) co-chaired by Japan, India and France that have lent a combined $5.8 billion.

The committee is now awaiting details of a separate agreement that was signed with China EXIM Bank to rework $4.2 billion to be shared with them to ensure comparability of treatment, OCC said in a statement.

Former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez was sentenced by a U.S. judge on Wednesday to 45 years in prison for his conviction on drug and firearm offenses.

The sentence means Hernandez, 55, will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, unless his expected appeal succeeds.

A Manhattan jury found him guilty in March of accepting millions of dollars in bribes to protect U.S.-bound cocaine shipments belonging to traffickers he once publicly proclaimed to combat.

Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, while defense lawyers said a 40-year term, the mandatory minimum under federal law, was enough.

U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel said the 45-year sentence should send a message to well-educated, seemingly personable defendants who may believe they are insulated from prosecution.

He also said jurors saw through Hernandez‚Äôs ‚Äúpolished demeanor‚Äù during the two-week trial, where he took the stand in his own defense.
