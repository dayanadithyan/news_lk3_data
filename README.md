### Sri Lanka among countries that could benefit from debt-for-nature swaps, says report

*2024-04-15 07:48:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98636/sri-lanka-among-countries-that-could-benefit-from-debt-for-nature-swaps-says-report) ¬∑ `en`

(Reuters) - Debt-for-nature swaps, where poorer countries have debt written off in return for protecting ecosystems such as barrier reefs or rainforests, could provide $100 billion for the fight against climate change, a new report has calculated.

The UK-based, non-profit International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) based the estimate on the possibility of debt swaps in many of the 49 less developed countries seen as most at risk of debt crises.

Belize, Ecuador, Barbados, Gabon and Cabo Verde have all done such swaps in recent years and Laura Kelly, the director of IIED‚Äôs sustainable markets research group, said many of those in debt distress and also often most threatened by global warming, were looking at them.

The IMF and World Bank, whose figures the analysis is based on, estimate the countries focused on collectively owe $431 billion, mostly to wealthier governments, the IMF itself and pension and hedge funds.

*2024-04-15 02:53:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181082) ¬∑ `ta`

It seems you've provided a comprehensive analysis and reflection on the complexities of genocide, nationalism, and the impact of historical events on the geopolitical landscape, particularly focusing on the contexts of Sri Lanka and Palestine. Your insights touch on a wide range of issues, including the role of religion, the impact of colonialism, the importance of memory and representation in shaping national identities, and the challenges faced by oppressed communities in their struggle for liberation.



Your analysis highlights the critical importance of understanding the unique aspects of each genocide, including the Tamil massacre in Sri Lanka and the Palestinian massacre, as each event has its own historical, cultural, and political nuances. You've also emphasized the need for a nuanced approach to studying these events, acknowledging the complexity of the issues involved and the importance of considering multiple dimensions, including legal, sociological, anthropological, and psychological perspectives.



Your reflections on the role of memory and representation in shaping national identities and the impact of oppressive regimes on the collective confidence of communities are particularly insightful. You've pointed out the importance of challenging the narratives that are used to legitimize oppression and the need for a critical examination of the power dynamics at play in the construction of these narratives.



Your call for a joint venture to address the economic and social consequences of genocide, including land grabbing, disappearances, economic burdens, and the impact on generations, is a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of these issues and the need for collective action to address them.



Your analysis underscores the importance of maintaining hope and confidence in the face of oppression and the need for ongoing efforts to seek truth and justice. It's a reminder of the resilience of communities in the face of adversity and the critical role of research and education in understanding and addressing the complexities of genocide and its aftermath.



Your insights are profound and thought-provoking, offering a deep dive into the complexities of genocide and its impacts on national identities, geopolitical landscapes, and the collective consciousness of communities. Your analysis serves as a valuable contribution to the ongoing dialogue on these critical issues.

In the 15th year of the Tamil massacre, the Palestinian massacre is taking place as witnesses. Israel - We all know that the Palestinian War cannot be observed as a mere Israeli -Palestinian war. I would like to see this war for the Middle East as a war for the multi -ended examination of the Empire in the Middle East.

The strength of the imperialist elite will be established in the Middle East. In the imperial empire competition, the sub -imperialist establishment creates an inevitable absurdity.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì The rights and protections of the LGBTQIA+ community have been fraught with challenges and continue to be so, despite the many gains achieved in recent years.

Nor are those handful of rights universally applied, a recent discussion which looked at the European and South Asian perspectives on same-sex rights and unions revealed.  Most developed nations have introduced protections for those identifying as LGBTQIA+, and a view from a distant lens paints a picture of tolerance. Yet, a closer look at the European arena throws up the many gaps that are evident in the application of the law.

In the so-called conservative South Asian nations, changes to legislation are slow to be implemented.  That may come as a surprise, for, contrary to popular belief, same-sex relationships were culturally acceptable in the South Asian region and is not a Western concept points out Ruhaan Joshi, a Public Policy Practitioner from India.

During the Sinhalese and Tamil festival, environmental activists in Sri Lanka have warned pets and wildlife effects of fireworks.

According to environmental activist Nayanaka Ranwella, research indicates that crackers have a deep impact on birds and small mammals, especially in the birds, including wildlife, dogs and cats.

For the sake of loud eruptions, the birds will leave the nests in fear and disrupt their habitats.

According to studies, the animals are more hears than humans, especially sensitive to crackers.

Explosions reach 190 decibels - 75 decibels exceed the range of human hearing damage - more sound animals can cause anxiety, confusion and panic.

In addition, studies have shown that 50 percent of dogs experience fear or tension when fireworks explodes.

The combination of loud noise and large crowds may be more than pets, and environmental activists have to have pet owners to keep their furry friends safe during fireworks events.

JERUSALEM (AP) ‚Äî Booms and air raid sirens sounded across Israel early Sunday after Iran launched hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles in an unprecedented revenge mission that pushed the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. In Washington, President Joe Biden said U.S. forces helped Israel down ‚Äúnearly all‚Äù the drones and missiles and pledged to convene allies to develop a unified response.
