### Stalin clashes with Modi

*2024-04-03 13:49:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180311) ¬∑ `ta`

It seems you've provided a detailed narrative on the historical and political context surrounding the Kachchativu issue, including the involvement of various political figures and parties. This issue has been a point of contention for many years, involving territorial disputes, fishing rights, and the broader geopolitical landscape of India and Sri Lanka.



Given the complexity and the historical depth of the issue, addressing all the points you've raised would require a comprehensive analysis that goes beyond the scope of a single response. However, I can provide a brief overview and some insights based on the information you've shared:



1. **Tax and Flood Relief**: The specifics of why Tamil Nadu's tax proposal was met with a 29-penny return by the Union Government and the absence of a one-rupee flood relief during natural disasters are likely tied to broader political and economic considerations. These decisions would involve evaluating the financial implications for the Union Government, the strategic importance of Tamil Nadu's resources, and the overall budgetary constraints.



2. **BJP's Ten-Year Rule in Tamil Nadu**: The impact of the BJP's rule in Tamil Nadu over the past decade would depend on various factors, including policy implementation, governance, and the party's approach to development and welfare. The effectiveness of the BJP's policies in Tamil Nadu would be a subject of debate among political analysts and the public.



3. **Kachchativu Issue**: The Kachchativu issue is deeply rooted in historical and territorial disputes between India and Sri Lanka. The transfer of Kachchativu to Sri Lanka in 1974 was a significant event that has had lasting implications for the fishing communities in Tamil Nadu. The controversy surrounding this decision and its aftermath has been a point of contention among various political parties and has influenced the broader political landscape in Tamil Nadu.



4. **DMK's Relationship with Congress**: The relationship between the DMK and Congress, especially in the context of the Kachchativu issue, reflects the complexities of Indian politics. The DMK's stance on the issue, as well as its alliance with Congress, has been influenced by a range of factors, including historical grievances, political strategy, and the broader dynamics of power in Indian politics.



5. **Kachchativu's Geography and Historical Context**: Kachchativu's geographical location and its historical significance as a fishing ground for Tamil Nadu's fishermen have been central to the dispute. The island's strategic importance and the rights of its inhabitants have been at the heart of the controversy, with various political actors and international bodies involved in the resolution of the issue.



In summary, the Kachchativu issue and its broader implications for Tamil Nadu's politics and governance are multifaceted and deeply intertwined with the region's history, geopolitical dynamics, and the strategic interests of India and Sri Lanka. Addressing these issues requires a nuanced understanding of the historical context, the political dynamics at play, and the broader geopolitical implications.

When the Indian parliamentary election begins to warm up, people and candidates will be alerted. Free, cash banknotes will start chasing people.It is only the political leaders of the party, as they awakened from deep sleep. Many things that have been forgotten will be remembered. The electoral field will be heated by the right rivalry. That is the case in Tamil Nadu.

Voting for the 39 constituencies in Tamil Nadu will be held on April 19, and the counting of voting will begin on June 4.

Tamil Nadu ranks fifth in terms of Lok Sabha places. In the 2019 election, the DMK -led secular progressive Alliance won 38 seats of a total of 39 seats.

### Tamil votes will not split up if Tamil general candidate is fielded: CV Vigneswaran

*2024-04-03 12:52:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180313) ¬∑ `ta`

Vajira Abeywardena suggests Tamils won't split votes if a Tamil general candidate is fielded, but CV Vigneswaran disagrees, arguing against a Tamil candidate to avoid dividing Tamil votes. Vigneswaran criticizes the majority community's neglect of Tamil issues post-election, highlighting the unresolved political and social issues faced by Tamils in Sri Lanka. He emphasizes the need for a Tamil general candidate to address these issues, arguing that a good Tamil candidate could unite Tamil votes, despite the historical context of Sinhalese dominance and the challenges of electing a Tamil president.

üü©

If a Tamil general candidate in the upcoming presidential election, as Vajira Abeywardena says, the votes of the Tamils will not be split, but all the Tamils who voted for the majority candidates will come together and vote for the Tamil general candidate.

Wickeswaran, who has clarified his position on the UNP Member of Parliament, Vajira Abeywardena's statement, said that the Tamils should not field a Tamil general candidate in the upcoming presidential election and divide the Tamil votes:

My friend Vajira Abeywardena is the UNP. So what else can he say to the success of the post of President?But if we look at the problem we face from the angle of being Tamils, he will not say this.

As Tamils, we have so far voted for a candidate from the majority community. They all promised to provide a solution to our political issue.

Colombo, April 3 (Daily Mirror)- Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith never received any prior warnings on the Easter Sunday attacks, the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka said today.

Church Spokesman Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando, responding to a question raised by journalists at a media briefing said speculations that Cardinal Ranjith had received prior warnings of the Easter Sunday attacks were totally false.

"The story that Cardinal Ranjith did not participate in an Easter service on the fateful year of 2019 is also false as he did hold an Easter Vigil on April 20, 2019. The Archbishop of Colombo traditionally participates in the Easter service on Saturday night and does not participate in any service on Easter Sunday," Fr. Fernando said.

The Essential Importers and Traders Association warns that removing the special freight tax on imported goods in Sri Lanka could lead to higher prices due to corruption. The government plans to abolish this tax from January next year, a move that was initially imposed in 2007 to combat corruption. The association argues that this tax, which charges based on the value of goods, helps reduce corruption by making it more difficult for importers to bribe customs officials. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has suggested replacing this tax to increase government revenue, but the association believes that advanced customs procedures will mitigate corruption.

üü©

The Essential Importers and Traders Association said that if there is no mechanism to control corruption in Sri Lanka, the removal of special freight tax on imported goods will be a price hike.

The Cabinet has decided to abolish the 17 -year -old tax law from January next year.

A spokesperson of the association told Daily Mirror that it was imposed by its members in 2007 for the sake of increased corruption when assessing the items.

‚ÄúThen, the imported goods were rated for these charges to be imposed. Then, dishonest importers bribed the customs officials to lower their imported goods so that they could pay less on tax -basis. This has affected the real importers. So we asked the then government that this special freight tax should be imposed.

It charges on the amount of imported goods and leads to lower corruption. When the value of the goods is charged, it can lead to corruption. ‚Äù

He also said that the cost of imported goods consumed by the people can ensure stability.

### Gnanasara Thera‚Äôs bail application denied

*2024-04-03 05:43:00* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Gnanasara-Thera-s-bail-application-denied/56-760240) ¬∑ `en`

The Colombo High Court rejected the bail application filed by the counsels representing the recently imprisoned Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera yesterday.

Colombo High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige rejected the bail application, stating that the counsels had failed to present any special circumstances before the Court that would warrant the release of Gnanasara Thera on bail.

The defence counsels urged the court to grant bail to Gnanasara Thera pending appeal, considering the extended delays in concluding appeal hearings at the Court of Appeal and his health condition as grounds for release.

On 28 March, the Colombo High Court sentenced Gnanasara Thera to four years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 100 000 over a contentious statement made by him about Islam and Muslims in 2016.

### New Director General for Bribery Commission

*2024-04-03 05:42:46* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/New-Director-General-for-Bribery-Commission/56-760239) ¬∑ `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed W. K. D. Wijerathne as the Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), the President‚Äôs Media Division (PMD) said.

The appointment was made in accordance with the provisions of the new Anti-Corruption Act.

Wijerathne has held the same position before, but this new appointment is under the new Anti Corruption Act, which was passed in the Parliament in September last year with wide powers.

The new Act gives CIABOC broader ability to investigate and prosecute incidents of bribery and corruption. The commission has previously examined claims of bribery and corruption but has failed to meet expectations because most complaints have not resulted in prosecution.

### The creations of Mary Shelley and that of Lord Balfour ‚Äì are there lessons to be learnt?

The creations of Mary Shelley and Lord Balfour; the former being fiction and the latter being played out in 4K ultra-HD resolution today, are separated by time and space, but offer lessons for the enquiring mind.

The vote taken on 29th November 1947 to create the state of Israel, was rejected by all Arab States. On 30th November, the very next day, the first phase of the Arab-Israeli war began and ended with thousands dead and the forcible expulsion of more than 700,000 Palestinians from their homeland.

World leaders refused to accept the ominous beginning as a harbinger of darker, more dangerous times ahead.

### When ‚ÄúAiyo‚Äù Sirisena accused India‚Äôs RAW of plotting to assassinate him

There is a salient point that needs to be emphasised. If the media reports about Sirisena‚Äôs accusations against India are correct, then I must assert strongly that I do not believe ex-president Sirisena at all. I am no fan of the RAW or any other intelligence agency but linking the RAW to the Easter bombings is highly improbable and totally absurd

‚ÄúPutting your foot in your mouth‚Äù is a figurative expression about a person saying or doing something that should not be done or not have been said, especially if it embarrasses the person concerned or someone else.

### Countering NPP‚Äôs rise: Emerging political alliances and election strategies

Issues related to content such as defamation, harassment, misinformation, impersonation occur not only through online means but also through the use of other traditional means (electronic or print media). Hence, such things fall under cyber-enabled crimes. Sri Lanka has adequate laws for such cyber-enabled traditional crimes. If not, the relevant legislation should be amended accordingly. It is not appropriate to make separate laws for such crimes considering only internet media, and doing so becomes very suspicious. Hence, the objective of preparing the Online Safety Act itself is problematic

### Election on shifting sands

*2024-04-03 05:14:01* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Election-on-shifting-sands/4-760228) ¬∑ `en`

The meeting was Basil Rajapaksa‚Äôs way of telling President Wickremesinghe and his lotus-bud backers that the SLPP will not be Comet Ranil‚Äôs tail. Basil Rajapaksa wants a parliamentary election first. The only way to mitigate the SLPP‚Äôs impending defeat is gaining a handful of parliamentary seats, therewith some bargaining power. Having the presidential election first would not work as well for the SLPP. Even in the extremely unlikely event of Ranil Wickremesinghe winning, that victory will lift not the SLPP boat; only the UNP boat. Even in his current SLPP-dependent state, Ranil Wickremesinghe is no puppet of the Rajapaksas. A President Wickremesinghe with a popular mandate would be totally beyond not just Rajapaksa control but also Rajapaksa influence

### Technical overview on Online Safety Act of Sri Lanka

This Online Safety Act will have a huge impact on the freedom of expression of Sri Lankan citizens

In 2018, ‚ÄúEUROPOL‚Äù headquartered in Hague, Netherlands, a key organisation established to prevent and combat serious internationally organised crimes, cybercrime and terrorism, had clearly defined the difference between cyber-dependent crimes and cyber-enabled crimes. As defined by them, any crime that can only be committed using computers, computer networks or other forms of information communication technology was named as cyber-dependent crimes and traditional crimes facilitated by the Internet and digital technology were categorised as cyber-enabled crimes. So, there are two categories of cybercrimes and these definitions are internally accepted.

‚ÄúI have no information to say that it happened due to international forces,‚Äù Abeywardana told the parliament on Tuesday (02).

‚ÄúI did not see a threat that you mentioned. I only saw a threat where they all came here (to the parliament) and threatened our lives,‚Äù he said referring to hundreds of local protesters including ‚ÄúBuddhist monks and other religious leaders‚Äù.
