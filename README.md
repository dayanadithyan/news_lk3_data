### ஊடகங்களை சந்திக்காதது ஏன்? பிரதமர் நரேந்திர மோடி விளக்கம்

*2024-05-18 02:48:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183829) · `ta`

''நடுநிலையுடன் பணியாற்ற வேண்டிய ஊடகங்கள் தற்போது இல்லை. அதனால் ஊடகவியலாளர்கள் சந்திப்பு எதையும் நடத்தவில்லை'' என பிரதமர் நரேந்திர மோடி விளக்கமளித்திருக்கிறார்.

தனியார் தொலைக்காட்சி ஒன்றுக்கு நேர்காணல் அளித்த பிரதமர் நரேந்திர மோடியிடம்.. ':ஆட்சிப் பொறுப்பேற்று பத்தாண்டு காலமும் ஊடகவியலாளர்கள் சந்திப்பை நடத்தாது ஏன்?'' என்று வினா தொடுக்கப்பட்டது.

தற்போது பத்திரிக்கையாளர்கள் அவரவர் சுய விருப்பத்துடன் அடையாளம் காணப்படுகிறார்கள். ஊடகங்கள் பக்க சார்பற்று நடுநிலையாக இல்லை.

நடுநிலையுடன் பணியாற்ற வேண்டிய ஊடகங்கள் இன்று அவ்வாறு செயல்படுவதில்லை. அதனால் தான் பத்திரிக்கையாளர் சந்திப்பு எதனையும் நடத்தவில்லை.

முன்பெல்லாம் ஊடகம் முகமற்றவையாக இருந்தது. யார் எழுதுகிறார்கள்? அதன் கொள்கை என்ன? என யாரும் அதைப்பற்றி முன்னர் கவலைப்பட்டதில்லை. இன்று நிலைமை அவ்வாறில்லை.

அரசியலில் செயல்பாடுகள் பற்றி கவலைப்படாமல் ஊடகங்களை கையாள்வதை மையப்படுத்தி செயல்படுகின்ற புதிய அரசியல் கலாச்சாரம் உருவாகி இருக்கிறது.

War is not a victory, it is a major defeat to the country or mankind.. In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, mothers lost their children. Similarly the children lost their parents.

We have divided the Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims on the basis of ethnicity. I lost my eyes because of this war.Al many losses. Today, we will share love instead of hatred in the day, remembering the end of the final war.

Today we will pledge to sorry instead of revenge, to establish God instead of the demons and to transmit comfort to each other.

### Who will benefit from an election boycott by Tamils?

Prediction of the results of the forthcoming Presidential election would be the most difficult one in Sri Lankan history, since almost all traditional attachments of the voters with the main political parties seem to have been shattered to the core by the economic crisis that brought millions of people to the streets in 2022.

The unprecedented economic hardships within their household and the agitations with slogans on the streets against all present and past rulers of the country for nearly four months seem to have shaped a new political mindset among the majority of people in the country.

The impact of these two factors – the economic hardships and the Aragalaya – has been such that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the party that bagged 52.25 percent of votes has been ranked at the bottom of some poll surveys since mid-last year, with not even 10 percent of voter preferences in favour of them. Interestingly, the SLPP has never challenged the results of such surveys either.

Media reports inform us that many MPs across the political divide have secured liquor permits in the names of their friends and relatives. These permits we all know will subsequently be sold for huge sums of money.

According to one report, the going price per permit is around rupees fifty million. The permit is for the establishment of new liquor shops in the country.

Such heated debates are common, but it appears in this instance, that either these members in the debate were briefed to behave in that fashion or the Governing party does not have any spokespersons, leave alone decency and integrity.

The peace of a nation does not lie on the pulpit of the United Nations or any other international body. The long-term stability and sustainability of a country which has paid the price in blood for peace can only come, when like Japan, one revitalises the entire nation, in every sphere, from education to recreation, to sharpen a mind towards a peaceful and holistic mindset. One that is devoid of Mohaya (which can be interpreted as false pride or illusion) or Dweshaya (anger/spite). Such a nation will not have to face the consequences of these base qualities which is Dukkha

### ‘Interventions’: A book review

*2024-05-17 20:36:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Interventions-A-book-review/4-761923) · `en`

“Until they become conscious, they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled, they cannot become conscious.”

This is a review (perhaps imprecise) of the anthology “Interventions” – Selected Political Writings of Dayan Jayatilleka edited by Uditha Devapriya and Uthpala Wijesuriya with a forward by Kamaya Jayatissa, published by Neptune.

I say imprecise, because I wrote this review before reading the entirety of this collection of writings by Dayan J. When reading this missive I hope you will understand why I hurried to pen this review before digesting it in its whole.

Dayan Jayatilleka as a public intellectual has been rediscovered by two millennial opinion journalists – the type who seek the narrative that’s alternative to that of the mainstream.

I must declare my interest. I know Dayan since 1968 as the son of Mervyn De Silva who was my Editor at Ceylon Daily News. Mervyn was my friend and a mentor of sorts.

### What must Sri Lanka do to avoid a second default in the near future?

*2024-05-17 20:19:41* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-must-Sri-Lanka-do-to-avoid-a-second-default-in-the-near-future/4-761921) · `en`

A second default by Sri Lanka could be more devastating than Sri Lanka’s first default in 2022

Past evidence shows that most countries that default on their external debt, have a history of defaulting once again within the next 10 years. Going by this data, there is a probability that Sri Lanka can default once again.

A second default by Sri Lanka could be more devastating than Sri Lanka’s first default in 2022. In case of a second default Sri Lanka will have to go once again to the lender of last resort, the International Monetary Fund as a bankrupt nation. The conditions by the IMF if we default the second time will be much harsher and rightly so. The bilateral creditors and bondholders will also not be as kind if Sri Lanka goes for a second default. With harsher terms by the IMF, bilateral creditors and bondholders, Sri Lanka if it defaults again will have very little space to breathe.

This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission," it said.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka farmers and fresh water fishermen had complained to the island’s human rights commission against a plant to set up a floating solar plant in Chadrika Wewa (reservoir) and Kiriibbanara Lake at Embilipitiya.

Floating solar plants, depending on how much of the area it covers, can reduce sunlight and plant growth in waterbodies, reducing food for fish and other organisms.

“We urge the authorities to consider these risks and explore alternative locations or methods for the solar power project that would not compromise the health and livelihoods of the local communities,” Monlar Media, a civil society organization that promotes farmer rights said.

The coalition of organizations, including the Walawa Farmers Rights Protection Organization, said they do not oppose the development of solar power plants in principle, but they have grave concerns about the potential threats to their livelihoods posed by the construction of these plants on the two reservoirs.
