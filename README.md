98 percent of the people have protested against the Ceremony Backup Bill. This bill will be completely abolished in our regime. United People's Power MP Harsha de Silva said that it is clear whether democracy is within parliament or outside.

We accept that we should protect the democratic rights of the nation and that 225 members should cooperate with it. The government has not taken care of the national and international level organizations on the Foundation Bill.

In a poll, 98 percent of the polls on the Celebration Bill, opposed the bill.. So is democracy in Parliament?Or you can understand whether it is outside.

We agree that social media should be monitored. This bill is the main objective of repression instead of monitoring, so this law will be completely abolished in our government and will be legalized.

### Turkey’s parliament approves Sweden’s NATO membership, lifting a key hurdle

*2024-01-24 16:21:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96699/turkeys-parliament-approves-swedens-nato-membership-lifting-a-key-hurdle) · `en`

Turkish legislators on Tuesday endorsed Sweden’s membership in NATO, lifting a major hurdle on the previously nonaligned country’s entry into the military alliance.

Lawmakers ratified Sweden’s accession protocol 287 to 55, with ruling party members saying the Nordic country’s tougher stance on Kurdish militants was key to winning approval. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also previously has linked the ratification to Turkey’s desire to buy fighter jets from the U.S.

The ratification comes into effect after its publication in the Official Gazette, which was expected to be swift.

Hungary then becomes the only NATO ally not to have ratified Sweden’s accession.

“Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO,” Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. In Washington, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan welcomed the news, saying having Sweden in the alliance will make it “safer and stronger.”

ECONOMYNEXT – A planned bill to regulate micro-finance organizations has been challenged in the Supreme Court by traditional community organizations which provide savings and credit, according to a statement.

The proposed bill  is “intrusive and violate the autonomy of community organisations such as Death Donations and Welfare Societies, Sarvodaya Shramadana Societies and Women’s Organisations engaged in community savings and credit providing activities for generations before modern micro-finance began,” they say.

The community based organizations have also complained that larger finance companies which also provide micro-finance and where concerns have been raised about “predatory lending”, appear to be excluded.

Regulating for the sake of regulating will harm these community-based initiatives and trample on low-income people’s autonomy and traditional rights to organise their credit services, petitioners have said.

You have said that you have set up another school instead of a school where a military camp has been set up in the Morakottan army.

The newly built school is found in a river area. This is not what village parents or children do not want.

Even if the school is used through a temporary alternative, it is unable to continue to be used.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rulers are trying to curb the freedom of speech of people after bankrupting the country, opposition chief whip Lakshman Kiriella told parliament in a debate over a controversial law to control online speech.

The UN and several international companies have opposed this Bill, Kiriella said. “The international community will be against us if we bring this law.”

“Lajjayi (shame), instead of going home you are trying to bring this law.”

Ruling party legislator Ajith Rajapakse said there were people who mis-used social media.

Former President Donald Trump easily won New Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday, seizing command of the race for the Republican nomination and making a November rematch against President Joe Biden feel all the more inevitable.

The result was a setback for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who finished second despite investing significant time and financial resources in a state famous for its independent streak. She’s the last major challenger after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his presidential bid over the weekend, allowing her to campaign as the sole alternative to Trump.

Speaking to supporters, she intensified her criticism of the former president, questioning his mental acuity and pitching herself as a unifying candidate who would usher in generational change.
