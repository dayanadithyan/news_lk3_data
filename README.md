President Joe Biden is hosting Jordan’s King Abdullah II in Washington Monday and the two leaders are expected to discuss the ongoing effort to free hostages held in Gaza, and growing concern over a possible Israeli military operation in the port city of Rafah.

It is the first meeting between the allies since three American troops were killed last month in a drone strike against a U.S. base in Jordan. Biden blamed Iran-backed militias for the fatalities, the first for the U.S. after months of strikes by such groups against American forces across the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.

The meeting with King Abdullah II comes as Biden and his aides are working to broker another pause in Israel’s war against Hamas in order to send humanitarian aid and supplies into the region and get hostages out. The White House faces growing criticism from Arab-Americans over the administration’s continued support for Israel in the face of growing casualties in Gaza.

### Apologetic Marxists:  Yanis Varoufakis and Techno-Feudalism

In 2015, Yanis Varoufakis was appointed Finance Minister of Greece by socialist Premier, Alexis Tsipras. The Euro debt crisis crippled Greece six months later, giving the once popular Premier the stark choice of a painful IMF bailout or being forced to quit the EU and facing economic and diplomatic isolation.

An academic and Marxist by orientation, Varoufakis vehemently opposed the IMF route, insisting on finding a solution locally. Initially, Premier Tsipras backed him, but opposition was overwhelming and he was forced to back down and opt for IMF.

Varoufakis quit in protest. Unlike in Sri Lanka, he didn’t join the opposition or try to exploit the vacuum for personal gain. A former academic who foresaw the banking crisis of 2008, he began writing provocative and insightful books analyzing how and where the world order went wrong. Today, he is hailed as one of the most radical, daring and innovative thinkers around.

### An Election’s A Brewing, Will We See JVP Policy Changes? - EDITORIAL

India’s invitation to the JVP/NPP and its leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake – popularly known as AKD – has made political watchers put on their thinking caps. Many seem to believe the Indian action indicates its belief that the JVP/NPP combine is in a position to capture power at the next General Election or even at the Presidential Poll.

The reality however is, that it is customary for the Indian government to extend such invitations to major political players of nations in its neighbourhood.

What is almost vulgar however is that some of our major political parties have gone a running to ask India to extend similar invitations to them as well!

### Generals & General Elections: Retired Military Officers in the Politics of SJB and JVP

“The follower is always far behind the winner” emphasizes the idea that those who follow, copy or imitate are usually not as successful or accomplished as the original trailblazer. This sentiment suggests that true success often comes from innovation, leadership, and being at the forefront of progress, rather than simply mimicking the actions of others.

When faced with the opportunity to assume leadership in government, Sajith Premadasa exhibited a hesitant approach. His initial reluctance to take over the reins became evident, creating a perception of indecisiveness. In contrast, when Ranil Wickremesinghe appeared poised to accept the responsibility, Sajith swiftly changed course, making a hurried message to the President’s House. However, his attempt was futile as he arrived too late to alter the unfolding events.

The third case is interesting. The two were sentenced to seven years in prison in the case of a lawsuit filed by Imran and his wife, because it was wrong for the Islamic man to marry.

On the other hand, the court, which sentenced Imran to imprisonment, removed the sentence of Nawaz Sharif, who had been convicted of the Panama Papers corruption affair.

Nawaz Sharif cannot be involved in politics throughout the life span. The coalition government led by the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistan Muslim League, which toppled Imran from the regime, passed a law that would lead to a political disqualification of a politically disqualified law and created a situation where Nawaz Sharif could contest the election.

Another trick was that when Mahinda and Ranil clashed, Ranil Wickremesinghe's victory was prevented by boycotting the election.

These two tricks have been handled by the Tamil side in the past. It is important to note that CV Wigneswaran suddenly depends on Ranil, as the Tamil party is not going to decide what kind of tactic the Tamil party is going to handle in the coming presidential election.

Ranil is the one who can handle all the ways to defeat his enemy. Therefore, there is justification for the question of whether or trying to roll or divide the Tamil votes through Vigneswaran.

### Sri Lanka to introduce India’s digital payment system UPI amid tax evasions

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will introduce India’s Unified Payment Interface (UPI), a revolutionary digital payment move to achieve a cashless economy, which may help to tighten loopholes that have allowed for tax evasion in the island nation.

The UPI will help the public to use their smartphone as a virtual debit card.

In other words, people do not need any cash or card to carry out transactions. They can simply use the smartphone as a debit card and send and receive money through it. The UPI is an interface that allows the user to link more than one bank account in one smartphone app and transfer funds without having to share any account number.

Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe will witness the launch of Unified Payment Interface (UPI) services in Sri Lanka and Mauritius along with Prime Minister of Mauritius, Pravind Jugnauth and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday 12 via video conferencing, the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka said.

### Sri Lankan rupee is more overvalued now than before the crisis

The value of the rupee will have to be at least partially restored if the country is to avoid stagnation and another currency crisis further down the road

One of the important issues that appears to have gone under the radar since the debt crisis of April 2022 is the overvaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee. This is in spite of the fact that many commentators argued that the overvaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee was an important contributor to the debt crisis (see CBSL, 2023; Athukorale and Wagle, 2023). To the extent that they pay any attention at all to the exchange rate, they argue that the sharp depreciation of the currency following the foreign debt default in April 2022 restored the competitiveness of the currency such that its value is presently “supportive of the country’s trade competitiveness” (CBSL, 2023, p. 194).

Social market economy, or in other words ordoliberalism, is not a new ideal for either of the two warring parties in Sri Lanka.

He made a distinction in his social market economy ideology calling it a ‘highly competitive social market economy’. This addition was necessary to take care of the important role played by the export of goods and services in creating wealth for people

Australia became a team in South Africa as the ICC men's under -19 World Cup cricket match.

This has led to the Senior Team of Australia in the World Cup cricket match.

It is noteworthy that Australia won India in both World Cup finals.

Australia became a world champion in Ahmedabad last year's ICC men's World Cup (Senior Division) final.

The half -century of Indian -origin Harjaz Singh, Heri Dixon, Team Leader Hue Weijen, Olivar Peak, and the skilled bowls of Maly Beardman and Rabayal McMmilon helped Australia become a global champion.

In response to Australia's 254 -run win, India lost all the wickets in 43.5 overs and lost only 174 runs.

The Indian batsman's faulty choices made wickets for its failure.

This is the first time India's all -wickets were taken in this year's World Cup cricket match. Australia made that glory.

A potential bumper harvest of soybean in South America and the USA in 2024 would see a significant drop in soybean import prices, and it could help countries like Sri Lanka that imports the commodity from the U.S.A. as a key poultry feed, Jim Sutter, CEO at U.S. Soybean Export Council (USSEC) told The Island recently.

“Apart from that, as we now directly collaborate with Sri Lankan poultry farmers, they are exposed to the latest technologies that enhance productivity. This would also help bring down the price of chicken in Sri Lanka,” Jim Sutter said.

Meanwhile, USSEC Chairman, Stan Born said that soybeans Sri Lanka imports from the USA have intrinsic benefits that soy from other sources can’t give.

“We provide a high-quality product that will put on flesh faster and more economically. Quicker turnover of animals should have a positive impact on price and a positive impact on availability,” he said.
