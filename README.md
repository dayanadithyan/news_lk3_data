The major film awards ‚Äì the 96th Oscars or Academy Awards ‚Äì were awarded at a glittering event last weekend. Christopher Nolan directed Oppenheimer won eight Oscars, being nominated for 13. In all it has won 30 trophies. Record for most Oscars is jointly held by Ben Hur, Titanic and Lord of the Rings, each winning 11 Oscars. This global interest in films gave me the reason to write about an impression that has grown in me after seeing Netflix films. The selection offered in different areas of the world appears to be different. We in this geographical area seem to be having more eastern films, Hindi and Tamil mostly. My son in the US advises me to watch this or that film ‚Äì not available in my Netflix streaming.

It is made worse by the resulting needs of the people in the production of industrial and agricultural goods which in turn require water for production. This is the second most pressing problem the world is faced with the rising population being the first.

The average person does not give sufficient, or worse still, any thought to the need for conservation of water in the home, in agriculture, in industry or in its other uses. Conservationists say that a dangerous situation is looming ahead of us, individuals, nations and the world itself as the demand is increasing at an alarming rate while water supplies remain near constant. Consider for instance the following recent findings of the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF).

Little did William Alfred Goone Tilleke know when he stepped ashore Siam in 1890 that he would create a law firm that would endure for over 130 years.

In 1890, William Alfred Goone Tilleke, a 31-year-old Singhalese solicitor, came to Siam (now Thailand) to build his legal career. Within four years, Tilleke made an international name for himself through his successful defense of the Siamese military commander Phra Yod Muang Khwang, whose prosecution for killing a French officer was demanded by the Franco-Siamese treaty.

(This chapter on Goolbai Gunasekera‚Äôs Jaffna experience is excerpted from her book on her mother, Clara Motwani, Chosen Ground. The first chapter published last week was a response to ACB Pethiyagoda‚Äôs memoir of his time at Jaffna College.)

Mrs. Visaladhy Sivagurunathan, a philanthropic Hindu lady, had gifted the property of Hindu Ladies‚Äô College to the school in 1943. Mother was the school‚Äôs fifth Principal. Under her, the first Past Pupils‚Äô Association was formed, with Mrs. Jeevaratnam Rasiah as its first President. Miss Thambu (Mother‚Äôs long suffering Tamil tutor) was its Secretary. Just recently, I was invited to speak to the Colombo branch of the HLC alumni.

I met a former HLC teacher there ‚Äî Mrs Navaratna, formerly Leela Ponniah ‚Äî along with many old friends. The reverence in which Mother was held was very heart- warming, and it was a moving experience to hear the stories they related of instances in which Mother had touched ‚Äî and sometimes directed ‚Äî their lives.

At first I did not believe this, but having prayed with him and personally experiencing the results of such prayer, I finally became convinced that Nissanka was indeed a man with a special gift or spiritual power.

President Biden gave the final State of the Union speech of the first term of his presidency on Thursday, March 7, 2024. It was probably the most important speech in his long and distinguished career in public service, which spans over half a century. Biden represented Delaware in the Senate from 1973 to 2009, served as Vice-President in the administrations of President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017, and the incumbent 46th President since January, 2021.

President Biden is certainly no stranger to one of the most hallowed annual rituals in America, the State of the Union Speech, a ceremonial occasion to illustrate U.S. democracy in action. He was completely at ease in an environment most familiar to him, and his fiery performance in this vital speech tended to lay to rest immediate misgivings about his advanced age and ability to run for a second term.

Colombo, March 16 (Daily Mirror) - A recent survey conducted by the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) has unearthed concerning trends regarding democratic governance in Sri Lanka.

The survey, titled ‚ÄòSurvey on Democracy and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka,‚Äô involved 1,350 participants across 25 districts in January, shedding light on shifting attitudes toward authoritarianism and declining trust in democratic institutions.

According to the findings, approximately 1 in 10 Sri Lankans expressed a preference for authoritarian rule, marking a significant increase since 2018.

Despite the majority favoring democratic governance, the survey highlighted a worrying sentiment that "In certain situations, a dictatorial government can be preferable to a democratic one."

The CPA, a prominent policy think-tank based in Colombo, emphasized that the spike in support for authoritarianism coincided with the political upheaval during the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government in 2018.

Colombo, March 16 (Daily Mirror) - 'World Consumer Rights Day' is relevant to countries like Sri Lanka, where there are no policies or rights for consumers, presidential candidate Janaka Ratnayake said.

Addressing the media, he said Consumer Rights Day was declared to protect the rights of consumers around the world.

"But in Sri Lanka, there is no such rights for consumers. The country cannot manage the prices of fuel, electricity, water and other essential commodities and goods," he said.

"We are living in a country with poor management. The current government cannot manage even the price of an egg in the local market. Every week, there will be a topic to be discussed regarding essential commodities. During the past few weeks, discussions have been held on egg prices; during the last week, it was about big onions. I cannot imagine what will be the topic next week," Ratnayake said.
