“Tonight people here and around the country have spoken, and they’re ready for change,” Starmer told supporters in his constituency in north London, as the official count showed he’d won his seat. “You have voted. It is now time for us to deliver.”

### Why parate is so hot these days

The Parate is not that draconian as most of the people see it. Firstly it applies only for loans of which the capital is Rs. 5 million or above. In practice, no bank will exercise the Parate Right until a borrower fails to repay 7/8 instalments or more. The bank as much as possible negotiates with the borrower and carefully listens to the reasons of the borrower’s failure. Banks will in the first instance endeavour to understand whether the default is due to the own negligence of the borrower or due to something beyond his control. Even in the case of own negligence the bank will warn the borrower and try to correct him, leaving aside the Parate. When the default is beyond the control of the borrower, banks give them sound concessions based on case by case

Once the parate is abolished as proposed, the borrowers who are repaying satisfactorily will also, without thinking twice, refrain from repaying their loans
