### Sri Lanka look to bounce back in second ODI

*2024-03-14 22:11:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Sri-Lanka-look-to-bounce-back-in-second-ODI/108-278867) ┬╖ `en`

Mar. 14 - Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will clash in the second One Day International (ODI) at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattogram, tomorrow.

The visitors would aim to square the series 1-1 after losing the opener by six wickets on Wednesday at the same venue.

Bangladesh chased down their target of 256 runs successfully in the first ODI with Skipper Najmul Shanto and Mushfiqur Rahim getting them home.

It remains to be seen if the series goes into the decider as Sri Lanka will be determined to bounce back.

Defending a subpar target of 256, Sri Lanka did well to reduce Bangladesh to 23 for three but then a pair of partnerships - first between Shanto and Mahmudullah and then Shanto and Mushfiqur - took the game away from the visitors.

They were assisted by the fact that their bowlers had earlier done extremely well to reel the Lankans in after a fast start and eventually bowl them out inside 49 overs.

March 14 - A criminal law expert has shed light on the potentially lengthy legal journey ahead for the case involving Febrio De-Zoysa, the 19-year-old Sri Lankan national accused of a brutal attack in Barrhaven, Ottawa.

Daphne Gilbert, a professor of criminal law at the University of Ottawa, suggests that the legal proceedings could span two to three years as they wind through the complexities of the court system.

Gilbert emphasizes the likelihood of extensive psychiatric evaluations for the accused, aimed at determining his mental fitness to stand trial. Given the seriousness of the charges, it's crucial to assess De-Zoysa's capacity to comprehend the legal proceedings and assist in his defense.

The 19-year-old Sri Lankan national currently sits in OttawaтАЩs Innes Road jail, facing six charges of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.

### JapanтАЩs same-sex marriage bar is unconstitutional, high court says

TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - Japan's bar on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, the high court in the northern city of Sapporo said on Thursday, the first such ruling by an appeals court on a matter that has divided the lower levels of the judiciary.

Japan is the only Group of Seven nation without legal protection for same-sex unions. Although backed by 70% of the public, they are opposed by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

Japanese civil code rules that limit marriage to those of opposite sexes are "unconstitutional" and "discriminatory", the Sapporo High Court said in its ruling, but dismissed the plaintiffs' claim for damages from the government.

"Enacting same-sex marriage does not seem to cause disadvantages or harmful effects," the court said.

"I thought the ruling might be a conservative one, but it ended up exceeding my expectations," one plaintiff, who did not disclose his name, told reporters after the ruling. "I couldn't help but cry."
