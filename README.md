### Democratic path

*2024-02-04 17:36:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175518) · `ta`

There is no doubt that the two great ideological sides are interested in ensuring that the strength of the Tamil people is going to be a Western force with a democratic strength, or that the Maldives is going to be a democratic face -like autocratic ideology.. It is very important that political leadership take advantage of this position in favor of the concept of their homeland theory.

It is inevitable that every political party in the world has different ideas and positions. It is not forgotten that the best characteristic of a political party is to solve all of them independently.

At the same time, other political parties and organizations are working through their general conferences through internal election democracy and their democratic values transparency.. Also, thinkers, civil organizations, journalists and writers are felt that they should continue to act as the guards of national sovereignty.

### International Court and Gaza genocide!

*2024-02-04 17:34:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175513) · `ta`

The verdict does not deal with South Africa's main allegation of Israeli genocide in Palestine. On the contrary, the actions demanded by South Africa are aimed at protecting the rights of the Palestinian people under the genocide.

Temporary measures demanded by South Africa are demands to be put before the final judgment of the main case, and it may take years to the final judgment.

It is true that the rulings of the International Court of Justice are controlled by all sides, but there is no way to implement them.

### Anurakumara and calling

*2024-02-04 17:31:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175549) · `ta`

Anuragumara Dissanayake has used India to express its pro -Indian status by welcoming the country through national unity.

It is noteworthy, however, that his party is providing China's relief packages in the North.

Creating conflict on the island of Sri Lanka may be rulers. The JVP was also the cause of those conflicts.

Especially in 2006, the role of the JVP in pushing the country into war was not underestimated by anyone.

It is only through those who have felt the mistakes of the past, and those who accept those mistakes and provide remedy justice can be embraced by the Tamil people.

The United States and Britain launched strikes against 36 Houthi targets in Yemen, in the second day of major U.S. operations against Iran-linked groups following a deadly attack on American troops last weekend.

The strikes late on Saturday hit buried weapons storage facilities, missile systems, launchers and other capabilities the Houthis have used to attack Red Sea shipping, the Pentagon said, adding it targeted 13 locations across the country.

They are the latest blows in a conflict that has spread into the Middle East since Oct. 7, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed Israel from the Gaza Strip, igniting a war that has drawn in an array of armed groups backed by Tehran.

Residents said the strikes shook buildings in Houthi-controlled Sanaa. The group’s military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said the U.S. strikes “will not pass without a response and consequences.” The group did not announce any casualties. Houthi-run media called these “the most violent” strikes yet.

### Will the unity of evolving?

*2024-02-04 17:28:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175553) · `ta`

India is in a state of confusion as to whether the Tamils are excluded to handle Colombo - whether to handle the Tamils and handle the Tamils.

India has not yet moved towards the choice of handling Tamils with Tamils.

Until that situation is created, India will keep the 13th Amendment and the time to create a united position among the Tamil national parties.

However, the Tamil issue has not resolved and the blame for India has abandoned them.

### What is the line?

*2024-02-04 15:03:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175517) · `ta`

These arguments often notice the key role in financing to essential public services such as health, education, infrastructure and social security nets.. To ensure adequate funds for public services and balance the need for economic growth, Sri Lanka and many countries are facing a complex challenge.

Of course, there are arguments against taxation. Some argue that taxes are high and they are free of economic growth. Others argue that the taxes are unfair and that they are burdened with proportions for the poor.

The debate on taxation will continue for many more years. However, one is clearly. Taxes are essential in any modern society, and they play an important role in financing the public goods and services we all believe in.

### Ceremonial Security Act: For whom?

*2024-02-04 14:59:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175525) · `ta`

In any case, the bill has been passed as most of our MPs voted in favor of the deepest and widths of the status law.. The law has come into effect with the similarity of the Speaker. So people need to understand this reality and act very carefully.

What is important here is that the issue in Sri Lanka is a law or legalization;Is not about. Its proper implementation is on. Whatever the laws are written, it is not properly implemented. We have repeatedly condemned the law that the law does not go on all.

Therefore, the government should not forget that if the new law is implemented in that way or against freedom of expression, its consequences may not be predicted.
