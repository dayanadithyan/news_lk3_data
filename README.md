Ms Begum left London nine years ago aged 15 to travel to Syria and join Islamic State group, or IS.

The ruling by three appeal judges was unanimous. It could still be challenged in the Supreme Court by Ms Begum.

Her solicitor, Daniel Furner said that her legal team was "not going to stop fighting until she does get justice and until she is safely back home".

However the judges wholly dismissed all of Ms Begum's arguments - a highly significant rejection that could affect her ability to gain a full appeal at the Supreme Court.

The international team from National Museums Scotland revealed their discovery -- found in Guizhou Province in southern China -- of the Dinocephalosaurus orientalis, a 5-meter-long aquatic reptile from the Triassic period dating back an estimated 240 million years.

‘With 32 separate neck vertebrae Dinocephalosaurus orientalis had an extraordinarily long neck that draws comparison with that of Tanystropheus hydroides, another strange marine reptile from the Middle Triassic of both Europe and China,’ scientists said announcing the discovery.

‘Both reptiles were of similar size and have several features of the skull in common, including a fish-trap type of dentition,’ officials continued. ‘However, Dinocephalosaurus is unique in possessing many more vertebrae both in the neck and in the torso, giving the animal a much more snake-like appearance.’

Indians travel to Sri Lanka and make it easier to make the Indian rupee.

Question: Indian Foreign Minister appealed to Indians to visit Sri Lanka?How do you consider the tourist attraction for Indians?

Colombo, Feb 23 (Daily Mirror) - The name 'spa' has to be changed and people should not be allowed to merely use the name spa, Tourism State Minister Diana Gamage said.

Addressing the media, she said the use of the name 'spa' is not appropriate as it implies a high level of professionalism and denotes a wellness center. Therefore, it is imperative to cease using that name.

"The utilization of the name'spa' disrespects the professionalism of individuals working in such establishments. It is important to refrain from using this name to uphold the dignity and respect associated with the spa industry," she said.

"If a lady has to work as a masseur in a spa or in a hotel, and if she goes and says to someone that she is working in a spa, people look at her as if at a prostitute. Because the name spa is being used like that," the State Minister said.

Therefore, the name 'spa' has to be changed and they should not be allowed to use the name spa, she said.
