Russia has had strong ties with India since the Cold War, and New Delhi‚Äôs importance as a key trading partner for Moscow has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that shut most Western markets off to Russian exports.

Are we taking the right measures to address the debt problem?

After a disastrous handling of the economy during and in the immediate aftermath of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021, the then President was unceremoniously (and possibly justifiably) removed from office. But is the economy on the right track since then?

The relative stability of the economy since mid-2022 was broadly due to the following:

2. Increase in rainfall in mid-2022, which eased the power cuts. As the rainfall reduced towards the end of 2022, electricity tariff was increased sharply which reduced demand.

3. Halt of service of foreign debt which decreased foreign currency outflows.

4. Exorbitant increase in interest rates and depreciation of currency in mid-2022 which plummeted demand for imports and eased foreign currency outflows. While interest rates have fallen sharply in recent months, Rupee has also strengthened to an extent.

Instead of protesting against an RE project, which will contribute to Sri Lanka‚Äôs much needed energy security and take us a step forward towards freedom from fossil fuels, why aren‚Äôt these protestors doing some real environmental work on the ground?

Recently a group of environmentalists and a religious leader approached the Supreme Court against a renewable energy project to come up in the country‚Äôs north.

Environmentalists rallying against a renewable energy project is odd. As they should be against fossil fuel-based projects and push for a quicker energy transition for Sri Lanka to achieve its goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.
