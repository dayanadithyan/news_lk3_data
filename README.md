The JVP misread the invite as the Indians had acknowledged that the party would be the next government in waiting and Anura Kumara, the prospective president.

That is an achievement for the party that languished on the sideline. Their luck has changed since the Indians showed a sudden interest and invited the JVP leadership to New Delhi, where they met, among others, Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, and travelled to ModiтАЩs home turf, Gujarat to learn the Gujarati model of development.

Says softer than expected inflation provided space to resume cuts

The Central Bank yesterday resumed cuts by further reducing key policy rates by 50 basis points as inflation remains anchored. The move was also to further ease the financial conditions┬аwith a view to support and accelerate the expansion of the economy.

The rates cut came after a four months hiatus since November 22 last year, when the Central Bank said they would pause any more reduction until both, the government securities yields and the lending rates, fall broadly in line with the policy rates.

Although both yields and rates eased thereafter, quite notably the yields showed some reversal in the last four weeks while the softening in lending rates slowed, the Central Bank said.

In 1989 Kumar Gunaratnam operating under the nom de guerre тАЬGemunuтАЭ led the JVP/DJV against the Indian army in the Trincomalee District. Under his command, the DJV-JVP in Trinco accomplished a few military strikes against the Indian Army but these incidents did not gain much publicity due to the concerted efforts of the Sri Lankan and Indian authorities to deliberately suppress information. They did not want the JVP to gain publicity and political credit through these operations. Besides most incidents of that nature in Trincomalee were believed to have been committed by the Tigers then. Although the mass media of the day have not publicised this phase, there is some important material available in books, monographs and research papers

### Hot air over elections and Commissioner of Elections - EDITORIAL

The Commissioner of Elections made it clear to all Lankans that the presidential elections would be held in a timely manner in keeping with Constitutional requirements.

To him we owe a vote of thanks. Many a citizen had begun to doubt whether elections -presidential or general elections- would be held at any time in the near future, given the number of elections postponed via sleight of hand over the years.

Even as we pen these lines, our country is going through one of the hottest periods weather-wise. As though this were not bad enough, political party leaders and their followers are also breathing fire at their opponents, adding to the heat.

We continue witnessing intra-party squabbles in the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and dirty linen being washed in public. The тАШNational PeopleтАЩs Power is gaining in popularity. But in the past it has not been able to turn this into actual votes.

The year 2024 is already seeing a turnaround for private equity deals with Sri Lanka expecting deals amounting up to USD 250 million, says the Hong Kong-based merchant banking firm MCM Partners.

Speaking to Bloomberg Markets Asia on Monday (March 25), Managing Director of MCM Partners Jahnavi Bhagwati explained as to why she sees a turnaround for private equity deals in 2024 as opposed to a sluggish 2023.

According to her, countries like India and Sri Lanka, which is a turnaround story, are going to present opportunities in the private space this year after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates in March, ending the countryтАЩs historic era of negative interest rates in a move that marked a historic shift in monetary policy.

Bhagwati mentioned that the stock markets in the region are already seeing a pickup as inflation has been curbed, adding that investment activity will spur when rate cuts kick in.

### The Forgotten Guardians Of The Seas; Reviving Sri LankaтАЩs Naval Power

In the annals of history, the figure of Sir Walter Raleigh stands as a beacon of exploration and adventure. Yet, beyond his gallant exploits, lies a deeper narrative of maritime dominance and strategic prowess that shaped nations and empires. During RaleighтАЩs era, explorers were not mere cartographers, but rather daring adventurers who sailed the seas under state patronage, seizing goods and treasures from maritime trade routes.

These audacious exploits werenтАЩt just acts of piracy; they were the seeds of national wealth and diplomatic influence. By enriching their coffers through maritime plunder, these seafaring knights ascended to diplomatic status, eventually earning knighthood and securing a lasting legacy for their descendants. This narrative, often overshadowed by tales of piracy, underscores the pivotal role of naval power in shaping the course of history.
