Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he will step down in September, ending a three-year term marred by political scandals and paving the way for a new premier to address the impact of rising prices.

### Double Trouble for Namal as Sri Lanka Nominations Set to Close

ECONOMYNEXT – The heir apparent of the Rajapaksa dynasty will face an unusual challenge in the September 21 presidential election, with his loyalists confronted by another Namal Rajapaksha on the ballot paper.

With 36 candidates having paid their deposits to get on the ticket by Tuesday evening and one more day left to pay, the 2024 ballot paper is set to be the longest yet.

Adding two Namals with the same last name makes the voting slip potentially the most confusing—at least for Namal’s loyalists. Fielding candidates with names similar to main contenders has been a tried-and-tested tactic before, notably by the Rajapaksas themselves.

In 2015, the Rajapaksas not only fielded another “Sirisena” in an attempt to confuse voters of Maithripala Sirisena—the opposition’s common candidate—but also gave him a makeover to resemble the man from Polonnaruwa.

Adani Group, the Indian conglomerate rocked by a Hindenburg Research report last year, has faced another heavy share selloff after the short seller accused the head of India’s market regulator of having links to offshore funds also used by the group.

About $2.43bn, or 1 percent, was wiped off the market value of Adani companies by the end of the trading day on Monday although that was a substantial recovery from earlier losses of more than $13bn.

The battle between Hindenburg Research and Adani Group began 18 months ago  when the United States-based short seller alleged Adani improperly used tax havens, accusations the group denied again on Sunday, saying its overseas holding structure was fully transparent.

Citing whistleblower documents, Hindenburg said on Saturday that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson of the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) since 2022, has a conflict of interest in the Adani matter due to previous investments.
