That puts them ahead of ex-PM Nawaz Sharif’s PMLN who won 75 and it is unclear who will form a government.

As wrangling continues, independent candidates who did not win have flooded courts with vote-rigging allegations.

Both the PTI, which was blocked from taking part in the election, and Mr Sharif’s PMLN say they want to form the next government.

The result was a surprise as most observers had expected Mr Sharif’s party - widely seen as having the powerful military’s backing - to win, given Mr Khan had been jailed on charges ranging from corruption to having married illegally and his party was barred from the ballot sheet.

The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) has warned that the quality of air in parts of the island has dropped further to unhealthy levels.

Accordingly, the NBRO highlighted that apart from Nuwara Eliya, the air quality in all other districts is at an unhealthy level, with Colombo, Kandy and Jaffna recording particularly high levels of unhealthy air quality.

The NBRO further warned that according to the US Air Quality Index (AQI), the quality of air recorded in Colombo, Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Badulla, Kurunegala, Kandy and Matale is likely to cause adverse health effects.

The NBRO says that an influx of dust particles contaminating Sri Lanka’s air space through strong winds from neighbourng countries and the extreme dry weather are likely causes for this alarming drop in air quality.

Thus, the NBRO urged for those suffering from respiratory or cardiac diseases, and elderly persons and children to wear face masks when outdoors.

### Anura Kumara Dissanayake in India

*2024-02-11 14:36:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/anura-kumara-dissanayake-in-india/) · `en`

Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s recent visit to India, on an invitation extended by the Indian government, underlies a tectonic shift in Sri Lankan politics, a sign of things to come. It hints at what may happen at upcoming elections. More than anything, it shows that India is taking the JVP-NPP seriously. We should be, too.

The responses to the visit by other parties have, so far, been lukewarm. The UNP’s Vajira Abeywardena, for instance, welcomed the move, and stated that his party hoped the JVP-NPP would contribute towards national policies which would “revive the nation”, adding that he looked forward to seeing the party work with the UNP, just as it had worked before with Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa.

### Hungarian President resigns over child sexual abuse pardon

(Reuters) - Hungarian President Katalin Novak resigned on Saturday after coming under mounting pressure for pardoning a man convicted of helping to cover up sexual abuse in a children’s home.

Novak, a close ally of conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orban, resigned a week after her presidential pardon was first reported by local news site 444.hu.

The revelation caused a public uproar and demands from the opposition for her and former Justice Minister Judit Varga to quit. Varga, who has been a rising star in Orban’s ruling Fidesz party, resigned as a lawmaker on Saturday.

The scandal was a rare setback for Orban, who has been in power since 2010, and who faces European parliament elections just as the country emerges from an inflation crisis.

Orban has for years campaigned to protect children from what he has described as LGBTQ activists roaming the nation’s schools. This has been one of several issues over which Orban has clashed with the European Commission.
