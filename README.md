### Nation building, Zen and art of Motorcycle maintenance’ - EDITORIAL

*2024-03-15 02:20:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Nation-building-Zen-and-art-of-Motorcycle-maintenance-EDITORIAL/172-278889) · `en`

These are days when parents have to motivate children with positive thoughts and help them envisage victory after being engaged in a struggle. We are in an era where we have to make a struggle to live, study, find food, retain jobs and stand up for what’s right. For this we must ensure that our loved ones engaged in the struggle to live and prosper emerge as victors.

But there can be people out there who dedicate some time from their lives to defeat evil. There are citizens of this country who would want to defeat this ‘unelected’ regime; where its present president came to power not through the vote of the citizens, but from support inside the parliament. There are citizens in this nation who’d want to change this regime and install a new one after an election. And those who contribute to that change might not even stand in public with the winners, but prefer to play watchdog because ‘power’ has the potential to corrupt lawmakers.

### Gaza famine: Food aid before the slaughter

*2024-03-15 02:17:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Gaza-famine-Food-aid-before-the-slaughter/172-278888) · `en`

Displaced Palestinians gather to collect food donated by a charity before an iftar meal, the breaking of the fast, on the first day of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan in Rafah. AFP

Just as the people sentenced to death are fed their best meal before they are executed, the Gaza Strip’s people, in the midst of a deadly famine, are being fed meals sent by the United States before they are slaughtered by Israel. Whatever is sent is not the best. But taste is not an option when survival is at stake.

The United States is completing a pier in the seas off the Gaza coast to send much-denied food aid. Its genocide-committing ally, Israel, also says it is trying to “flood” Gaza with aid, unable to withstand mounting international pressure, including some harsh criticism from its hardcore allies. Among them is the European Union, which stands by Israel and stomachs its war crimes with a high tolerance bar that is not seen in its human rights witch hunt against countries like Sri Lanka.

### Sri Lanka look to bounce back in second ODI

Mar. 14 - Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will clash in the second One Day International (ODI) at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattogram, tomorrow.

The visitors would aim to square the series 1-1 after losing the opener by six wickets on Wednesday at the same venue.

Bangladesh chased down their target of 256 runs successfully in the first ODI with Skipper Najmul Shanto and Mushfiqur Rahim getting them home.

It remains to be seen if the series goes into the decider as Sri Lanka will be determined to bounce back.

Defending a subpar target of 256, Sri Lanka did well to reduce Bangladesh to 23 for three but then a pair of partnerships - first between Shanto and Mahmudullah and then Shanto and Mushfiqur - took the game away from the visitors.

They were assisted by the fact that their bowlers had earlier done extremely well to reel the Lankans in after a fast start and eventually bowl them out inside 49 overs.

During my journey to Mizoram, I had a layover at New Delhi airport for approximately five hours, providing me with an opportunity to peruse the latest book authored by India’s External Affairs Minister, Honourable Jaishankar, titled “Why Bharat Matters”. This brought back memories of my visit to Delhi in 2015, when I served as the Minister of Power and Energy alongside our President, Excellency Maithripala Sirisena. During that visit, we engaged in fruitful bilateral discussions with Excellency the Prime Minister Modi, External Affairs Secretary Mr. Jaishankar, and other esteemed ministers. Reflecting on India’s economic growth from USD 2.1 trillion to USD 3.4 trillion over nine years, I realized the potential impact of a pragmatic foreign policy, as outlined in Honourable Jaishankar’s book, on this impressive growth trajectory.

“The party that wins the presidential election may secure unlimited power. I don’t think that’s a good situation.

“No one will be washed away or disappear. This was why the proportional representation system was introduced. We showed that that was of no use,” he added.

### Japan’s same-sex marriage bar is unconstitutional, high court says

TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - Japan's bar on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, the high court in the northern city of Sapporo said on Thursday, the first such ruling by an appeals court on a matter that has divided the lower levels of the judiciary.

Japan is the only Group of Seven nation without legal protection for same-sex unions. Although backed by 70% of the public, they are opposed by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

Japanese civil code rules that limit marriage to those of opposite sexes are "unconstitutional" and "discriminatory", the Sapporo High Court said in its ruling, but dismissed the plaintiffs' claim for damages from the government.

"Enacting same-sex marriage does not seem to cause disadvantages or harmful effects," the court said.

"I thought the ruling might be a conservative one, but it ended up exceeding my expectations," one plaintiff, who did not disclose his name, told reporters after the ruling. "I couldn't help but cry."
