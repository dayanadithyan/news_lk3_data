### Frog species endemic to Sri Lanka rediscovered in India after 200 years

*2024-05-19 11:28:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99310/frog-species-endemic-to-sri-lanka-rediscovered-in-india-after-200-years) ┬╖ `en`

Researchers from the Zoological Survey of India, in partnership with the Andhra Pradesh Biodiversity Board, rediscovered the Sri Lankan golden-backed frog (Hylarana gracilis) after two centuries in the Koundinya wildlife sanctuary in the Chittoor district, the southernmost point of the Eastern Ghats in Andhra Pradesh. With this finding, the number of freshwater frog species in India rises to 20.

Bharath Bhupathi from the Zoological Survey of India, Hyderabad, encountered frogs of this species near a pond in the forest and suspected that it could be a new species. However, after consulting taxonomic experts and utilising morphological and DNA barcoding tools, the species was confirmed to be the Sri Lankan golden-backed frog Hylarana gracilis.

Mr. Bhupathi emphasizes that rediscovery is more significant than the discovery of a new species, as it provides evidence for the historic land bridge between India and Sri Lanka.

Puttalam, May 19 (Daily Mirror) - Over 280 kgs of narcotics were destroyed using a new high-powered incinerator built at a cost of over Rs. 11 million at Vanathavilluwa in Puttalam yesterday.

Police said that a total of 251 kgs of heroin and 38 kgs of Methamphetamine (ICE) were destroyed in the presence of Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles and IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon.

Previously, the government had to spend a significant amount of money to destroy seized stocks of drugs due to the lack of a permanent facility for this purpose. As a permanent solution, the new high-powered incinerator has been installed on 20 perches of land in the Lactose Garden area of Vanathavilluwa, owned by the STF. The Sri Lanka Navy prepared the site for the installation of the incinerator with the Sri Lanka Police spending Rs. 6.34 million for the preparation.

This was partly due to the decrease in dollar-denominated expenses such as Annual Maintenance Cost (AMC), international settlement, and internet backbone charges due to the rupee appreciation.

### Judges and judgments of the past

(Excerpts from the speech mde by Ranjan Gooneratne at the launch of his book, Before Justice awakes: Birth of the jury in the Island of Ceylon)

To the Romans, Justice was a goddess whose symbols were тАШa throne that tempest could not shake, a pulse that passion could not stir, eyes that were blind to any feeling of favour or ill will and a sword that fell on the offender with equal certaintyтАЩ.

Judges and lawyers from the nineteenth century were votaries of that goddess. They were blessed with the gift of grace, nobility of mind and intellectual humility.

In the early nineteenth century, we had Alexander Johnstone as our Chief Justice. He emancipated the slaves, introduced trial by jury to our country. Lord Grey in the House of Lords said, тАЬHis contribution to the advancement of the social and cultural life of the people of Ceylon has immortalized his nameтАЭ.

In 1840, we had William Rough, a Sargent-at-Law, a classical scholar as our Chief Justice. He was the son-in-law of John Wilkes.
