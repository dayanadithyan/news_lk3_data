Sri Lanka‚Äôs banks were hit by bad loans from Coronavirus pandemic and the currency crisis and default.  Banks also had to provide for sovereign bond restructuring, though they were spared of rupee bond restructuring. As a result bond yields are now falling.

A global leader in responsible tourism raised concerns on lack of focus on sustainability in the tourism sector, which in turn could impede the current growth momentum in the medium term.

Intrepid Travel Chairman and Co-Founder Darrell Wade, who was recently in Sri Lanka, said the current status of the tourism industry, in terms of sustainability, is worrisome, primarily because of the¬†drive for growth.

‚ÄúWe understand that it‚Äôs good for the economy, jobs, balance of payments, all sort of things. But if the growth is too fast and doesn‚Äôt factor sustainability, then that‚Äôs a major problem. We haven‚Äôt seen enough attention on sustainability (in Sri Lanka),‚Äù Wade told Mirror Business during his recent visit¬†to Sri Lanka.

Although Sri Lanka may sustain the current growth momentum for the next two to three years, he expressed concern that it would not be sustainable beyond four to six years, if sustainability is not factored into the tourism strategy now.

### Hopes of peace dashed as confused US faces dogged Netanyahu

With public opinion that is increasingly supporting a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, in March, both US President Biden and his Republican challenger Trump appeared to be toeing a softer line on Gaza

A survey done in February found that around two-thirds of voters supported the US calling for a permanent ceasefire and a de-escalation of violence in Gaza

The US is blowing hot and cold on its policy on the Gaza war and is showing inconsistency in its actions. In contrast, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doggedly pursuing his uncompromising line on the war, disregarding rising opposition and even a revolt by the ultra-orthodox Jews in his homeland.

The net result of all this is that the prospects of peace in Gaza have receded further. And with Netanyahu bent on attacking Rafah, with a¬† huge population of locals and refugees from other parts of Gaza, more deaths and destruction are on the cards.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs public health service is facing one of its worst crises since independence. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna government need to give much more priority to help the public health service recover; because as the clich√© goes: ‚Äúhealth is wealth‚Äù.

With public health trade unions staging regular strikes during the past two years, poor people have had to travel a long way to a public hospital only to be told that the nurses, attendants and other paramedical staff are on strike and that the people need to go back without treatment. The crisis involving former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella made the situation worse with the importation of substandard drugs from fictitious companies. The tragedy is that this is happening in the country which produced Prof. Senaka Bibile who was widely regarded as a prophet of modern medicine, and proposed a solution to the drug crisis.

There is a school of thought that the clergy must also be represented in parliament. And so must be people involved in education, health sector, power and energy, agriculture and, very importantly, sports

It is really amazing to note that the zakath system, which came into effect 14 centuries ago, is still compatible with the modern tax system

Zakath is the direct tax that Islam has imposed upon every Muslim who has annual net wealth exceeding a threshold. Income tax is also a direct tax that the Government imposes on every person who has an annual net income exceeding a threshold.

It is clearly evident from the definition that both zakath and tax have similarities as well as differences. The purpose of this study is to give the readers a comparative understanding of zakath and the tax system as the Muslims traditionally pay their zakath during this month of Ramazan, which is the ninth month of the Muslim (lunar/Hijri) calendar, which is 354 days while the Gregorian calendar is 365 days.

It is underlined here that the laws and practices were taken from the Sri Lankan context in authoring this article.

The dire need to conduct a proper investigation by the Education Ministry on alleged financial malpractices at The Royal College Primary has been raised by vocal and activist old boy Padmasena Dissanayake.

‚ÄúThe Royal College Primary, Nation‚Äôs premier Primary School, is flouting the Ministry‚Äôs clear instructions on refraining collecting funds from parents.

### The Royal College that nurtured me

The author of this letter Lorenz Pereira with Ranil Wickremesinghe during Royal College‚Äôs 125th anniversary

I applaud the ex-Principal of Royal College R.M.M. Rathnayake for his subject article (https://island.lk/a-former-royal-college-principal-defends-maintenance-of-secular-values-in-the-school/) that partly contributes to us old Royalists becoming aware of current ‚Äúhappenings‚Äù at Royal. I believe that I can confidently assume that Rathnayake is a devout and respected Buddhist and an educationist and Principal par excellence.

As such he has the credentials to be seriously considered. On the other hand, I being so remote from the scene am really not in a position to be ultra-judgemental.

I strongly believe that these issues of concern must be brought to the notice of old Royalists. It is then up to each one of us to make our own judgements and respond accordingly, if need be.

For the continued betterment of Royal, they can no longer be swept under the carpet.

Let me commit the Kalama Sutta of the Venerable Buddha to be considered when such controversies arise.

The spirit of the Sutta signifies a teaching that is exempt from fanaticism, bigotry, dogmatism, and intolerance. Any attempt at deviating from the secularism that has been practiced for quite some time at our alma mater would only lead to the downfall of this hallowed institution. Royal is not Ananda nor Nalanda. It is not St. Thomas nor St. Joseph‚Äôs. It has always been secular but interested in learning all the religions of the world.

### At least 9 dead, 800 injured in Taiwan earthquake; dozens still trapped under rubble

Rescue efforts are under way in Taiwan after a 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck the island‚Äôs eastern coast, killing at least nine and injuring more than 800.

Some 127 people are trapped in collapsed tunnels and on mountainous roads along the rugged coastline.

The epicentre was 18km (11 miles) south of Hualien city, but strong tremors were felt all the way in the capital Taipei, more than 100km away.

It also triggered tsunami alerts earlier in the day in nearby Japanese and Philippine islands which were later retracted.
