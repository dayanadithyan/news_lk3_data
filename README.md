### Is there not even the 'grassed' control over Sri Lanka's food prices?

*2024-06-24 11:47:18* ¬∑ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/cn000e2nm45o) ¬∑ `si`

Sri Lanka faces significant challenges with food pricing, especially in major cities like Colombo. High costs and limited facilities force many to spend a substantial portion of their wages on food, often leading to malnutrition despite increased spending. Inflation exacerbates the issue, with prices rising faster than wages. Despite government efforts to stabilize the economy, consumers struggle to afford adequate nutrition. Informal sectors like hotels see minimal wage increases, contributing to the problem. Quality and affordability issues persist, with some resorting to cheaper, less nutritious options. Online food ordering platforms add to the burden with high service charges. Economists suggest regulating food prices is challenging due to the nature of food consumption and the variety of products available. However, some praise small shops for maintaining quality. The situation highlights the need for effective regulation and consumer protection measures.

A boy with severe epilepsy has become the first patient in the world to trial a new device fitted in their skull to control seizures.

The neurostimulator, which sends electrical signals deep into his brain, has reduced Oran Knowlson‚Äôs daytime seizures by 80%.

His mother, Justine, told the BBC he was happier and had a ‚Äúmuch better quality of life‚Äù.

The surgery was carried out in October as part of a trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London when Oran - who is now 13 - was 12.

Oran, from Somerset, has Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a treatment-resistant form of epilepsy which he developed at the age of three.

Since then he has suffered several daily seizures ranging from two dozen to hundreds.

When we first spoke to Oran‚Äôs mum last autumn, prior to surgery, she explained how Oran‚Äôs epilepsy dominated his life: "It has robbed him of all of his childhood."

She told us Oran had a range of different seizures, including those where he fell to the ground, shook violently, and lost consciousness.
