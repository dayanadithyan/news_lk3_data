### If the Kalmunai North is the Eastern Balance of the East - Kanakaratnam Sukash

The Tamil nation is rallying for justice, with protests continuing for 14 days. The Tamil National Alliance has filed a lawsuit, and the struggle will continue until justice is served.

If the Kalmunai North is lost, the eastern balance will go into question. Ampara will be removed from the Tamil nation map. The Tamil National People's Front media spokesman Kanakaratnam Sukash said that the people should think.

He was speaking at a special press conference as the public on Sunday (07) is carrying out a protest rally against the continuous administrative repression of the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat in Ampara District.

Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat has been an independent Divisional Secretariat for 34 years. But here is not a separate Divisional Secretary. This is one of the surprises of Sri Lanka. There is no one who is an accountant. The Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat is in line with the illegal order of the Kalmunai South Divisional Secretary. This is the state's power.

The report, however, stated that during the period under review (March 29- April 5), crude oil prices exhibited an increasing trend. Crude oil prices increased owing to optimism on demand with the expansion in manufacturing activity in China and the US, coupled with the concerns about tight supply stemming from escalating geopolitical tensions and major producers keeping output cuts in place. Overall, both Brent and WTI prices increased by more than US dollars 3.00 per barrel during the review period.

The situation, therefore, appears to remain ambivalent for Sri Lanka as the cost of incoming shipments of oil could jump in the coming weeks.

Ex-President Sirisena is once again in the news for all the wrong reasons. Hardly had the ink dried on news stories of his sudden firing of three senior Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members, we learned that a court order has barred him from performing duties as chairman of that party.

The court order was based on a complaint to the court by Chandrika Kumaratunga for the removal of Sirisena from the post of SLFP Chairman, on the grounds he was unsuitable for the role. Among the reasons for his ouster were charges he was unlawfully holding the Chairmanship of the party in violation of the Party Constitution.

Additional charges arose from Sirisena‚Äôs actions during the constitutional crisis of 2018 being deemed incorrect. He was also found guilty of having violated the fundamental rights of people in the case of the Easter Sunday bombings.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine in February 2022, many including myself expected it to be over in weeks. In my case, this was because, as much as I dislike Putin‚Äôs dictatorship, Russian superiority in armour, artillery, aircraft and manpower was so big it was hard to see how Ukraine could stop all those tanks rolling over the country‚Äôs eastern steppes and advancing into the country, encircling and destroying outnumbered Ukrainian forces.

### Racist policy of forced cremation

*2024-04-08 02:28:19* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Racist-policy-of-forced-cremation/4-760427) ¬∑ `en`

The whole issue of forced cremation that shook the Muslim community in 2020/21 was entirely rooted in racism.

It is the Gotabaya Government which both piloted and enforced to the full measure this racist policy, aided by experts whom the President himself effectively appointed.

Now that it has been demonstrated, after a series of international setbacks for the Government and the erosion of public trust in Government leaders and experts, the question of tendering an open apology to the Muslim community and to those who opposed the policy tooth and nail as it was ruthlessly enforced has now come up.

As admitted, Thondaman‚Äôs Ministry of Water Resources has found out that the COVID-19 virus doesn‚Äôt spread through ground water. Perhaps, Ali Sabry‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs may have found out that the damage that this racist policy implemented by the Government, of which he remained an integral part (as Justice Minister), heaped on the country internationally was avoidable but horrendous.
