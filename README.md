*2024-04-25 05:42:11* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Imposing-costs-on-business-disregarding-ability-to-enforce/4-761009) · `en`

If this bill is not amended at the committee stage, it will impose significant costs of compliance on small businesses who are already under stress from the crisis

The Gender Equality Bill has been gazetted. It requires every public institution and private institution to appoint a senior official to be responsible for gender mainstreaming and gender equality (“Gender Focal Point”). That person is legally required to prepare a plan of activities targeting their areas of responsibility and report directly to the Council on a quarterly basis with a copy to Women Parliamentarians Caucus in Parliament (section 17).

If this bill is not amended at the committee stage, it will impose significant costs of compliance on small businesses who are already under stress from the crisis. It will also impose costs on State entities and large corporations, but the focus here is on small business which are least capable of meeting unfunded mandates.

### Dissecting digital disruption: The imperative of digital literacy for today’s CEOs

*2024-04-25 05:35:58* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Dissecting-digital-disruption-The-imperative-of-digital-literacy-for-today-s-CEOs/4-761008) · `en`

A golden rule for leaders embarking on digital transformation is to educate themselves. This education is not merely academic; it is a necessary step in becoming conversant in the language of technology, a prerequisite for the formulation and execution of effective digital strategies – adapted from Rewired, McKinsey, 2021.

We have never seen change like we experience today. In today›s VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world, corporate leaders find themselves rowing not in the calm waters but in the turbulent rapids of white-water rafting. The calm predictability of the past has given way to a landscape where constant change is the only constant.

Amidst this turbulence, one of the most significant drivers of change has been technology, whose capabilities are expanding at a staggering rate. There are three factors that create these ‘disruptive’ trends, which need to be understood in the right magnitude and scale.

Stories have been a primary means of transmitting knowledge and cultural values across generations. Community reading in the Temple in Sri Lanka circa 1923 from a hand etching by Charles W. Bartlett

The thirst for stories is evidenced in how people attended book fairs through the pandemic and economic restrictions. So much so, that we wonder whether our collective appetite for stories is only heightened in crises. Photo by B.Ganguly.

*2024-04-25 05:25:55* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Hambantota-Port-s-container-services-will-make-Sri-Lanka-a-key-logistics-hub-in-Indian-Ocean/4-761006) · `en`

Sri Lanka is an island nation situated in a strategically important location in the Indian Ocean Region at the centre of maritime trade routes in between East and West, as well as in the middle of Africa, the Arab, and Eastern worlds and is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.

Sri Lanka’s location enables the country to provide quick and efficient global and regional connectivity to move cargo to and from Asia to the rest of the world. More than 60,000 ships ply this route annually, carrying two-thirds of the world’s oil and half of the global containerised traffic.

Sri Lanka, also located very close to all major ports in the Indian subcontinent, especially those of India, with the rising middle class, makes it a prime location that is able to provide fast and easy connectivity to the Indian subcontinent through its feeder network.

### We need a revisionist president, not merely a reformist one

*2024-04-25 05:21:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/We-need-a-revisionist-president-not-merely-a-reformist-one/4-761005) · `en`

SJB presidential campaign manager Sujeewa Senasinghe and live-wire SM Marikkar accuse President Wickremesinghe of refusing the SJB its request of venue for May 1st and switching that preferred location to the JVP-NPP instead.

Meanwhile, six SJB MPs including shadow Finance Minister Dr Harsha de Silva accept decentralized funds from President Wickremesinghe allegedly without obtaining party permission. (https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/SJB-embroiled-in-controversy-after-its-MPs-secure-funds-from-Govt-without-party-approval/108-281121)

Is Ranil already a shareholder of the SJB, while simultaneously undermining it? Is he patronizing policy proxies in the SJB?

Little wonder then, as Prof Charitha Herath noted, that the SJB challenges the JVP-NPP to a debate on economics, but doesn’t challenge the incumbent and his administration with its austerity policies, to any such debate.

### Austerity, dispossession and injustice: Facets of the debt crisis in Sri Lanka

*2024-04-25 05:19:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Austerity-dispossession-and-injustice-Facets-of-the-debt-crisis-in-Sri-Lanka/14-761004) · `en`

The widespread and ongoing debt crisis today is a wakeup call

Sri Lanka defaulted on its external debt for the first time in its postcolonial history in April 2022. The International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led process of recovery that followed has not only been disastrous in terms of the economic policy package proposed by the Government. The underlying analysis of the causes of the debt crisis itself is also flawed. Sri Lanka provides lessons about both the broken global financial system and the widespread consequences of an unjust debt resolution architecture affecting other countries in the Global South.

The Colombo District Court issued an interim injunction against Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from performing duties as the Acting Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) yesterday.

A similar injunction was also issued against the SLFP Acting General Secretary Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala.

The injunctions, in effect until 8 May, were granted considering a case filed by SLFP office bearers Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Duminda Dissanayake, and Mahinda Amaraweera.

Chandaka Jayasundara PC representing the plaintiffs told the courts that it is illegal and against the party’s constitution for the defendants to hold the positions.

Jayasundara noted that Rajapakshe’s membership status disqualifies him from holding any position within the SLFP, citing constitutional illegality in having a member of another party in such a role.

Additionally, Jayasundara highlighted that the Executive Committee convened on 21 April to appoint Rajapakshe was unlawful.

Former President Gotabhaya Rajapakse has stated in his book that he has chased himself Tamil and Muslim people.

Speaking at the first day's debate on the first day of the House of Representatives on the Sunday bombing of the 2019, 2019, which will not be held in Parliament on Wednesday (24).

In his book Gotabhaya Rajapakse, he noted that minorities, including Muslims and Tamil people, chased himself.. He wants to know history. From the time of the Sinhala kings, the Muslim people have not been treated to betray the kings. This is the intrigue of the minority people. These are a lie that Gotabhaya says to wash his sin.

He came to power by spreading racism by exposing ideas against the minority people on the 2019 platform.. He eventually scored in the stomach of the Sinhalese people. This was followed by the struggle started. The people fought with fuel and gas problems. The minority people also attended. But he said he did not only chase the minority people.

At a commemoration event at St. Anthony’s Shrine in Kochchikade, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjit, maintained that The Roman Catholic church- in the majority Buddhist nation- no longer trusted the authorities to expose those behind the bombings

The National People’s Power of the JVP issued a seven-point agenda that it said would be implemented if it comes to power to hold accountable those responsible for the tragedy and serve justice to the victims

The politicization of the Easter Sunday attack is not only undermining the Sri Lankan state, but it also distracts the security agencies from the real threat of Islamist extremism

The whole discourse of the Easter Sunday attack is degenerating into a sordid freakshow

Islamization and the Arabization of some quarters of the Muslim community, leading up to the Easter Sunday attack, created permissive conditions for the Easter Sunday attacks

Sri Lanka-Iran ties began long ago as 1961 when the latter had an embassy in Islamabad and over the years, Iran has funded a number of development projects in Sri Lankaining financial help from Israel’s enemy Iran for development work

Iran, like other ambitious nations, would want to sow seeds of their interests here in this island, as no nation with military might would wish to see their interests being absent in a country which is followed by so many nations in the world

Sri Lanka’s latest news in the international scene is generated with its dealings with Iran, a nation considered as a super power in tactical ballistic missiles and UAVs. Iran’s President Dr. Ebrahim Raisi was in the island on Wednesday (April 24) to declare open the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project along with Ranil Wickremesinghe, the President of Sri Lanka.

He called for independent and transparent investigations into the deaths, saying that “given the prevailing climate of impunity, this should include international investigators.”

### Road closures spark public outcry during Iranian President’s visit

Colombo, April 24 (Daily Mirror)- The closure of roads in Colombo without prior notice during evening rush hours as part of security arrangements for the visit of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi inconvenienced the public and motorists alike.

Incensed by the notice of road closures, they vented their anger by honking horns. The government made tight security arrangements in view of the visit of the Iranian leader for the inauguration of the Uma Oya project.

The roads were closed to facilitate the movement of his convoy without any prior notice as a security measure, but the motorists’ protest amounts to kind of an embarrassment for the government during the visit of a friendly country that has stood by Sri Lanka during its trying times. Iran and Sri Lanka have enjoyed excellent ties for decades and cooperated with each other in numerous international forums.

Colombo, April 24 (Daily Mirror) - Chamari Athapaththu's historical 195 against South Africa last week saw her claiming the top spot of ICC Women's ODI Batting Rankings on Tuesday.

It was in fact the second time she achieved the feat in her ODI career which has now opened up a debate whether she'd go down as the greatest Sri Lankan cricketer in both men's and women's game in terms of the pure impact.

Hailing from a modest family in Kurunegala, Chamari's greatest supporter in cricket was her late father who used to accompany her for practices in Colombo, but sadly passed away in 2008 - a year before her international debut. However, her cricketing journey never stopped there, and after 15 years at the top level of women's cricket, Chamari has now reached the twilight of her career.

Following the cracking 195 against South African women's team, Chamari told the media that her 'retirement is very soon.'

Five years ago, on Easter Sunday, a group of local Islamists carried out coordinated suicide attacks targeting three churches and tourist hotels, killing over 270 worshipers and tourists and wounding 500 others.

The fifth anniversary of that heinous crime, which fell last Sunday (April 21), turned out to be a sordid display of politicking by the political parties, the catholic clergy and other usual culprits, who claim to campaign for justice for the victims.

The National People’s Power of the JVP issued a seven-point agenda that it said would be implemented if it comes to power to hold accountable those responsible for the tragedy and serve justice to the victims.

Sajith Premadasa, the Leader of Samagi Jana Balawegaya, also made a similar pledge in Parliament, promising to launch a fresh commission of inquiry, with the participation of local and international experts within two months of his election.
