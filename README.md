*2024-03-11 13:19:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/technical-overview-of-online-safety-act/) · `en`

In 2018, “EUROPOL” headquartered in Hague, Netherlands, a key organization established to prevent and combat serious internationally organized crimes, cybercrime and terrorism, had clearly defined the difference between cyber-dependent crimes and cyber-enabled crimes . As defined by them, any crime that can only be committed using computers, computer networks or other forms of information communication technology was named as cyber-dependent crimes and traditional crimes facilitated by the Internet and digital technology were categorized as cyber-enabled crimes. So, there are two categories of cybercrimes and these definitions are internally accepted.

Illicit intrusion and hacking into computer networks, disruption of computer functionality with the spread of viruses or other malware and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks which can paralyze service delivery by computers are some examples for cyber-dependent crimes.

### Sri Lanka – WHITHER GOES THOU?

*2024-03-11 13:16:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lanka-whither-goes-thou/) · `en`

I plagiarized the title of this article from a Latin quote “Quo Vadis”. It was an immensely popular movie in the 50s starring Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr. According to the film, Quo vadis (Whither Goes Thou) were the words exchanged between God and St Peter. The first apostle was fleeing from Rome along the Appian Way to Brindisi to take a boat and escape to Palestine. Peter went back to Rome where he was crucified. Today there is a small chapel on that road where Peter turned back. It is called the Church of Domine Quo vadis.

Now you know I admitted I plagiarized. Don’t throw stones at my aeroplane. I have already said my mea culpa.Times have become difficult and often impossible to cope with. Whatever winds blow across our paradise isle, they are all filled with maelstroms that have so many manifestations. I do not think I am wrong if I say that even the winds are deceitful. We have been in turbulence for more years than we can recall.

### The Election-Economy Nexus and the Politics of JVP Apology

*2024-03-11 13:15:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-election-economy-nexus-and-the-politics-of-jvp-apology/) · `en`

The economy is the base; everything else is superstructure. That is the old Marxian concept, simply put. The base ultimately determines what goes on in the superstructure, which includes among other things the state and its institutions, as well as their processes and functions. Included are the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, and their elections and appointments. Over time, there have been modifications to the old concept.

Borrowing from Freud’s psychoanalysis, Louis Althusser, the French Marxist, used the concept of over-determination to suggest that there are multiple causes producing an effect, i.e., political outcomes are ‘over determined’ by many causes besides the economy, although the economy could be singularly significant. Neo-Marxists have provided another angle in that just as the base could determine the goings on in the superstructure, what goes on in the superstructure also have implications for the base.

Shortly after the announcement of the new chairmen for the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA), there was a surge of criticism on social media regarding the appointment of Kalutara District SLPP MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena as the head of COPE.

Both chairmen were elected to their positions, and the SLPP, with its majority representation in the committees reflecting that of the parliament, was able to secure the election of their candidates. The election of COPA chairman MP Lasantha Alagiyawanna didn’t spark as much controversy, as he had previously held the position. However, Abeygunawardena’s appointment drew significant backlash, with many questioning his qualifications to lead a parliamentary watchdog committee.
