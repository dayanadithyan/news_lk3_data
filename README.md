Spikes are activity by neurons, which the National Institute of Health describes as cells that use electrical and chemical signals to send information around the brain and to the body.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had given the company clearance last year to conduct its first trial to test its implant on humans, a critical milestone in the startup's ambitions to help patients overcome paralysis and a host of neurological conditions.

In September, Neuralink said it received approval for recruitment for the human trial.

### Power disconnected due to non-payment of 18 cents

*2024-01-30 06:11:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Power-disconnected-due-to-non-payment-of-18-cents/108-275959) · `en`

The electricity supply to a residence in Galvadugoda, Galle was abruptly cut off due to non-payment of a mere 18 cents in the electricity bill. The resident, Visum Mapalagama, said that Lanka Electricity Private Company Limited (LECO), the electricity provider for the city of Galle and its surroundings, had disconnected his house’s electricity supply.

Mapalagama recounted his visit to the LECO office to settle his electricity bill, which amounted to 6650.18 rupees. Curious about the 18 cents, he inquired with the cashier, who assured him that such a small amount would not result in a power disconnection. Consequently, Mapalagama paid Rs. 6650.00, leaving the remaining 18 cents unpaid.

To his dismay, a few days later, Mapalagama discovered that LECO had disconnected the electricity supply to his house. A power cut notice was left behind, stating that a reconnection would require an additional fee of Rs. 1,231, along with the outstanding amount of 18 cents.

### රිය අනතුරු: මිනිස් ජිවිතයකට හානියක් සිදුවිය හැකි මාරක වේගය කොපමණද ?

*2024-01-30 05:19:12* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/ckkvddn2rl5o) · `si`

රිය අනතුරු: මිනිස් ජිවිතයකට හානියක් සිදුවිය හැකි මාරක වේගය කොපමණද ?

වාහන අධික වේගයෙන් ධාවනය කිරීම සහ මාරක රිය අනතුරු සම්බන්ධයෙන් පසුගිය දිනවලදී මෙරට සමාජය තුළ විශාල කතාබහක් විය.

එයට හේතු වූ එක් ප්‍රධාන සිදුවීමක්  වුයේ පසුගිය ජනවාරි මස 25 වෙනිදා කොළඹ - කටුනායක අධිවේගී මාර්ගයේ සිදුවූ රිය අනතුරකින් රාජ්‍ය අමාත්‍ය සනත් නිශාන්ත සහ ඔහුගේ ආරක්ෂක නිලධාරියා ජිවිතක්ෂයට පත්වීමේ සිදුවීමයි.

එම අනතුර සිදු වී දිනකට පසුව එනම් පසුගිය ජනවාරි මස 26 වෙනිදා දක්ෂිණ අධිවේගී මාර්ගයේ දී සිදු වූ තවත් රිය අනතුරකින් ඕස්ට්‍රේලියානු ජාතිකයෙකු ජිවිතක්ෂයට පත්විය.

එමෙන්ම ඉකුත් ජනවාරි මස 27 වෙනිදා නාරම්මල ප්‍රදේශයේ දී ත්‍රිරෝද රථයක් ලොරියක ගැටීමෙන් සිදුවූ රිය අනතුරකින් පුද්ගලයින්  තිදෙනෙකු ජිවිතක්ෂයට පත්විය.

රිය අනතුරු සම්බන්ධයෙන් රියැදුරන් මෙන්ම සාමාන්‍ය ජනතාවගේ අවධානයට ලක්විය යුතු කරුණු පිළිබඳ බීබීසී සිංහල සේවය විසින් විශේෂඥ දැනුම සහිත පුද්ගලයින්ගෙන් තොරතුරු විමසීමක් සිදුකරන ලදී.

බොහෝ රියැදුරන් තමන් ධාවනය කරන වාහනයේ තිබෙන වේග මාපකයේ පෙන්වා තිබෙන උපරිම වේගයට වාහනය ධාවනය කිරීමට උත්සුක වනවාදැයි ප්‍රශ්නාර්ථයක් සමාජයේ මතුව ඇත.

Every few years, Sri Lanka’s weakness in manufacturing comes up as the cause of our economic malaise. Economic growth through services is not real, they argue. In the most recent iteration, the slogan is that of a production economy, code for manufacturing.

It will be interesting to make an assessment of what Sri Lankan leaders have been demonstrating vis a vis the ideals and objectives of the World Economic Forum

Sri Lankans need to be told the truth by all political parties. Their credibility will hinge on this. Solutions to address this truth might be different, but they need to be based on the true situation the country is in. What is the true situation? It is that the country is in debt to the hilt, its current GDP growth would not allow it to repay the debts, and if they are not honoured, the country will not be able to borrow any more even for development work, let alone for consumption

The Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum for the year 2024 is held from 15-19 January in Davos, Switzerland, under the theme ‘Rebuilding Trust’. It aims to restore collective agency, and reinforce the fundamental principles of transparency, consistency, and accountability among leaders.

### The Contribution of Siam and Burma to Buddhism in Sri Lanka

It is well known that monks from Siam and Burma (as Thailand and Myanmar were called earlier) helped stem a decline in the practice of Buddhism, and contributed to its democratization in Sri Lanka during certain periods in the island’s history.

The circumstances which necessitated help from Siam and Burma, the process of securing such help, the role of the Dutch in it, and the  results of foreign involvement are vividly described by Auckland University sociologist Kitsiri Malalgoda in his book Buddhism in Sinhalese Society 1750-1900 (Tambapanni Academic Publishers, Colombo, 2023).

The hills are alive in Davos, with the sounds of failure. Conversations used to be about taking advantage of the global playing field that US presidents and their allies were seeking to build after World War II and after the end of the Cold War. Companies now, and countries themselves, are seeking to understand how to ameliorate the risks of a new, emerging, seemingly chaotic world order.

Yes, it was recently that time of year, as corporate chieftains, policy makers, NGO “warriors”, so-called journalists and self-styled intellectuals went invading the Swiss Alps for the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. Their anthem was “rebuilding trust.” After devastating trust on so many fronts this was a bold aspiration.

The Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka Bill was published on January 1, 2024, following limited consultations in 2023 and government pledges to investigate human rights violations and war crimes committed during the 1983-2009 civil war with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and in its aftermath.

The U.N. fired nine of the 12 accused workers and condemned “the abhorrent alleged acts” of staff members.

The accusations come after years of tensions between Israel and the agency known as UNRWA over its work in Gaza, where it employs roughly 13,000 people.
