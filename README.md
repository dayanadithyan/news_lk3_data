The first day of the Trinity - Antonian 105th (Mountaineer) sapphire at the Asgiriya Ground in Kandy is moving towards the uninteresting decision.

St. Anthony's team, who played the entire day in the match, started the match on Friday (15) and scored 232 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in the first innings when the game was stopped due to inadequate lighting.

Often the St. Anthony's team is expected to hold their first innings and give the Trinity team a chance to bat on the second day (16).

St. Anthony's team faced a stumbling block as the opening player Dinura Kanegoda (0) was playing in the first over of Trinity team man Manula Gularatne.

However, team captain Dissanayake Kaushika Kumarasinghe, both of them, shared 66 runs in the 2nd wicket.

Subsequently, Ekanayake shared 36 runs each in the 3rd wicket with Januka Ratnayake and Janith Ratnasiri 4.

### GotaтАЩs book and conspiracy theories

Former President Gotabaya RajapaksaтАЩs book тАШThe Conspiracy to oust me from PresidencyтАЭ which was launched recently did not evoke much interest or create any stir among the people as its name suggests to do.

Nor did it reveal any hidden facts or details about any incident that would have contributed to his ouster. However, the book is said to have been sold like hot cake due to the curiosity about what it could have contained.

Hence, unlike the commotion that was created in September last year by the Channel 4 documentary which suggested a purported link between the State Intelligence Service (SIS) and the National Thowheed JamaтАЩath (NTJ), the terrorist organization that was behind the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks in 2019, the book seems to have now almost been forgotten even by RajapaksaтАЩs friends.

### Easter Sunday, nightmares of past and fears for the future

On the 31th of this month Catholics and Christians of all denomination will celebrate Easter Sunday. The festival without a doubt brings to mind the Easter Sunday bombing of 2019.

On Easter of 2019, terrorists exploded their deadly caches of explosives in three churches where Christians were celebrating what to the community was the most sacred of Christian festivals. Separately on the same day, in three five star hotels members of the same terrorist group carried out similar attacks on guests having their Easter breakfast.

To-date no one knows why these misguided souls chose that date to perform their тАШmischiefтАЩ. The intelligence services of the US, UK, India, China, Israel Pakistan et al arrived in the country within hours of the bombing.

However, it was thanks to the immediate action taken by Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, -the head of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka- any further bloodshed was averted.
