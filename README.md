Singapore’s long-serving Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is stepping down, marking the end of a political era for the island nation.

After 20 years in power, Mr Lee will formally hand over the reins to deputy PM and finance minister Lawrence Wong on Wednesday night.

Since becoming an independent nation in 1965, Singapore has only had three prime ministers - all from the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP).

The first was Mr Lee’s father, Lee Kuan Yew, who is widely considered as the founder of modern Singapore and led the country for 25 years.

Analysts say the transition signals an evolution in Singapore’s political leadership as it moves out of the shadow of the Lee family, even though Mr Lee will remain in cabinet as a senior minister.

Over the weekend in his final interview as Prime Minister with local media, he thanked Singaporeans for their support.

“I didn’t try to run faster than everybody else. I tried to bring everybody to run with me,” he said. “And I think we did have some success.”

Policymakers must determine the level of full capacity national output in understanding the state of the economy and in making informed decisions regarding monetary and fiscal policies

The Sunday Times of 28 April 2024 reported that plans are underway to lift the restrictions on the import of motor vehicles because a committee of Treasury Officials has stated that in the absence of duties on motor vehicle imports the country would not meet the revenue targets set by the International Monetary Fund. The news report states further that the trade-off is an $ 800 million drain on foreign reserves against the earning of a SL Rupee denominated tax revenue of Rs. 340 billion. Whilst accepting that there would be different views re the logic of this trade-off, I see this as a situation which calls for Limiting Factor Analysis (LFA).

When President Ranil Wickremesinghe announces his candidacy, we will hear people sing of dark times

“For every complex problem, there is a solution that is clear, simple, and wrong.” – H.L. Menken

‘Sustaining Stability’ is the oxymoronic title of the recent panel discussion organised by the Central Bank.

How to make a three-legged stool stand on two legs would have been a more commonsensical, down to earth title for the profoundly perplexing exchange of views by five panellists – all steeped in the science of economics.

That makes it easy. A repetition of remarks made by participants or attempting to qualify who said what, is not necessary.

It was a seriously choreographed discussion. It was in English – the language of Global Commerce, the IMF, and holders of our International Sovereign Bonds.

Therein lies another tale. All this brouhaha is to appease creditors for us to get back to the business of borrowing.

Every year around late April we all speak about the Easter bomb disaster which affected thousands of people in the country.

During that period there were several public requests for action to be taken against all who are guilty of failing in their duties.

In an article on 2 May 2019 which was published in the papers soon after the disaster where I clearly mentioned:

“It is absolutely necessary that those responsible, starting from the top two leaders and all others holding political office, be compelled by law to face appropriate penalties for their indifference and negligence.”

As it has happened in the last 75 years after Independence, whenever a disaster takes place in the country we talk about it for some time and conveniently forget about it.

Transparency and widespread consultation is vital for an FTA Feasibility Study that reflects the interests of the country rather than vested interests of a few politicians and their business henchmen

It is important to realise that the mere reduction of an import duty at the border, through an FTA does not mean free market access for Sri Lanka goods to the Indian or any other market since there are many non-tariff barriers and trade facilitation documentation issues facing our exports to those markets. An UNCTAD Study on Non Tariff Measures in China and India (2020) noted that despite reduction in import duties at the border, a host of NTMs as sanitary and phytosanitary/technical barriers to trade, quotas, financial exchange and price changing measures, registration and administrative, non technical issues can adversely affect price and quantities traded.
