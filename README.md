### Shortage of elephant participation for Kandy Esala Perahera

Colombo, May 18 (Daily Mirror) - A situation has arisen where getting the participation of elephants at both peraheras has become a problem due to the holding of the Ratnapura Maha Saman Devalaya Perahera and the Kandy Esala Perahera on the same day, Sri Dalada Maligawa Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela said.

He told the Daily Mirror that at least 60 elephants will be able to participate in the Kandy Esala Perahera this year. During previous Kandy Esala Perahera seasons, 75 elephants participated, he said.

"There are a total of 96 tamed elephants available in the country, but only 80 elephants can be taken for peraheras this season due to their physical health conditions and other issues. At least 20 elephants will be sent for the Ratnapura Maha Saman Devalaya perahera, and the remaining elephants will be assigned to the Kandy Esala perahera," the Diyawadana Nilame said.

He said in 2000, a total of 225 tamed elephants were in the country, but now the count had decreased to 96.

Sri LankaтАЩs courts many years ago barred supermarkets from charging for plastic bags from customers after activists went to court.

However a Supreme Court ruled in March this year to overturn that.

The parliament Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development said it could not reverse the gazette issued under the Consumer Affairs Authority Act until it had received a copy of the ruling.

The committee said the ruling might prompt shoppers to bring their own bags, which would lead to a reduction in polythene waste.

It may only apply to supermarkets and not to smaller merchants, however. (Colombo/May18/2024)

'' The media is currently not to work with neutrality. So there is no media meeting, тАЭPrime Minister Narendra Modi explained.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi who interviewed a private television channel.. ': Why not hold a press conference for ten years in charge of the regime? тАЭ

Currently journalists are identified with their own self -interest. The media is not neutral.

The media that needs to work neutral is not doing so today. That is why the press conference was not held.

Previously the media was faceless. Who writes?What is its policy?No one was worried about it before. The situation is not the case today.

A new political culture that focuses on the media is not worried about the activities of politics.

I have no confidence in going on this path. I can also cut the ribbon at Vigyan Bhavan. I am traveling for a small project in a small district in Jharkhand, though.

I have come up with a new job culture. Do you agree with it?Don't want?The media must decide. тАЭ

The impact of these two factors тАУ the economic hardships and the Aragalaya тАУ has been such that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the party that bagged 52.25 percent of votes has been ranked at the bottom of some poll surveys since mid-last year, with not even 10 percent of voter preferences in favour of them.

Such heated debates are common, but it appears in this instance, that either these members in the debate were briefed to behave in that fashion or the Governing party does not have any spokespersons, leave alone decency and integrity.

### What should we commemorate in Sri Lanka in the month of May?

Who among those associated in an era of violence, values peace, the most; it is those who are immersed in it

The peace of a nation does not lie on the pulpit of the United Nations or any other international body. The long-term stability and sustainability of a country which has paid the price in blood for peace can only come, when like Japan, one revitalises the entire nation, in every sphere, from education to recreation, to sharpen a mind towards a peaceful and holistic mindset. One that is devoid of Mohaya (which can be interpreted as false pride or illusion) or Dweshaya (anger/spite). Such a nation will not have to face the consequences of these base qualities which is Dukkha

Recognising that any political structure thriving on division and unrest is a maniacal terror

Understanding that an arm or a limb or a life cannot be compensated

Comprehending the ego and attachment that begins the mindsтАЩ first riot

(Daily Mirror) - Dr. Rabindra D. Mehta, an India-origin Sports Aerodynamics Consultant, who, in 1980 used to open the bowling with Imran Khan for the Royal Grammar School in Worcester, and who has researched extensively on swing bowling, has been following the IPL from the USA, where he is now based at.

When the Indian cricket board is considering abolishing the tossing of the coin in local matches, the scientist has expressed his views on how the coin would be advantageous to the well-deserving higher ranking teams only.

"As we approach the end of the regular IPL season, all the teams in contention are vying for the first two spots (seed 1 and seed 2), and for good reason, since they get тАЬtwo bites at the cherryтАЭ! However, what is the advantage of finishing first (as opposed to second)? NONE!! And, for that matter, there is no advantage in finishing third as opposed to fourth."

тАЬUntil they become conscious, they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled, they cannot become conscious.тАЭ

This is a review (perhaps imprecise) of the anthology тАЬInterventionsтАЭ тАУ Selected Political Writings of Dayan Jayatilleka edited by Uditha Devapriya and Uthpala Wijesuriya with a forward by Kamaya Jayatissa, published by Neptune.

I say imprecise, because I wrote this review before reading the entirety of this collection of writings by Dayan J. When reading this missive I hope you will understand why I hurried to pen this review before digesting it in its whole.

Dayan Jayatilleka as a public intellectual has been rediscovered by two millennial opinion journalists тАУ the type who seek the narrative thatтАЩs alternative to that of the mainstream.

I must declare my interest. I know Dayan since 1968 as the son of Mervyn De Silva who was my Editor at Ceylon Daily News. Mervyn was my friend and a mentor of sorts.

### What must Sri Lanka do to avoid a second default in the near future?

*2024-05-17 20:19:41* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-must-Sri-Lanka-do-to-avoid-a-second-default-in-the-near-future/4-761921) ┬╖ `en`

A second default by Sri Lanka could be more devastating than Sri LankaтАЩs first default in 2022

Past evidence shows that most countries that default on their external debt, have a history of defaulting once again within the next 10 years. Going by this data, there is a probability that Sri Lanka can default once again.

A second default by Sri Lanka could be more devastating than Sri LankaтАЩs first default in 2022. In case of a second default Sri Lanka will have to go once again to the lender of last resort, the International Monetary Fund as a bankrupt nation. The conditions by the IMF if we default the second time will be much harsher and rightly so. The bilateral creditors and bondholders will also not be as kind if Sri Lanka goes for a second default. With harsher terms by the IMF, bilateral creditors and bondholders, Sri Lanka if it defaults again will have very little space to breathe.

### 2024 presidential election

*2024-05-17 20:18:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183818) ┬╖ `ta`

The 2024 presidential election in Sri Lanka follows a five-year term, amendable only by a two-thirds parliamentary majority. Candidates must be citizens, over 30 but not older than twice the age limit. Voting requires registration. For multi-candidate elections, a simple majority wins; otherwise, preferences are considered. The new president appoints a PM and Cabinet, aiming for a parliamentary majority. Challenges include ensuring a stable government amidst calls for abolishing the executive presidency due to concerns over corruption and misuse of power.

ЁЯЯй

The Constitution says that a president elected by the people will be in power for a five -year term. If he dies, if he resigns or fired from office. Any amendment that can be brought to extend the presidential term in the Constitution is passed by two -thirds of the majority of the votes in Parliament and the recognition of the people in a conference.

The constitution also states that the presidential election should be held within a period of less than a month before the end of the term of office in power and not two months.

Any citizen who has qualifications to take over the presidency can be a recognized political party as a candidate for the presidential election. Otherwise, a member of the Member of Parliament or the already Member of Parliament can be nominated by any other political party or any voter who is named in the voter turnout.

### Facebook, Instagram suspected to be тАЩtoo addictiveтАЩ

BBC-The European Union is investigating Facebook and Instagram over whether they are so addictive that they are having "negative effects" on the "physical and mental health" of children.

It will also scrutinise if they have done enough to check whether users are old enough to use them, and how content is recommended to children.

A number of big tech firms are now under investigation for potential breaches of the EU's tough new Digital Services Act (DSA), and could be fined up to 6% of annual global turnover.

Meta, which owns both platforms, says it has "spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies" to protect children.

This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission," it said.

in September, Meta provided regulators with a report on the risks associated with its platforms, as required under the DSA.
