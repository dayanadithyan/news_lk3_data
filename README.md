### Sir Ponnambalan Ramanathan  (1851- 1930): The First Member for Ceylon

*2024-07-15 11:08:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sir-ponnambalan-ramanathan-1851-1930-the-first-member-for-ceylon/) · `en`

In 1911 Sir Ponnambalan Ramanathan was elected to the educated Ceylonese seat in the Legislative Council at the age of sixty. The seat was so named because, even as late as 1910, the Governor did not think that Ceylonese in general were fit to exercise the vote. Ramanathan was elected to the seat largely by the votes of the Sinhalese. Admittedly, he was a brilliant speaker and had held the high office of Solicitor-General. He defeated Sir Marcus Fernando, a distinguished physician and a man of rare ability in many fields.

The 125th Anniversary of the birth of Ramanathan will fall on Friday April 16, 1976. As a young man he was a hard-working lawyer who was nominated a member of the Legislative Council at the age of 28 to succeed his uncle Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy as the ‘Tamil member’. He had to give up his seat when he was appointed Solicitor-General.

BUTLER, Pa. (AP) – Former President Donald Trump was the target of an apparent assassination attempt Saturday at a Pennsylvania rally, days before he was to accept the Republican nomination for a third time.

A barrage of gunfire set off panic, and a bloodied Trump, who said he was shot in the ear, was surrounded by Secret Service and hurried to his SUV as he pumped his fist in a show of defiance.

Trump’s campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing “fine” after the shooting, which he said pierced the upper part of his right ear. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place,” he wrote on his social media site.
