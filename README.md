### Amid election fever a dark horse rises - EDITORIAL

Polls fever in the country is heating up. Yet, ‘we the people’ are not certain whether the poll would be for a general election, presidential poll or whether a poll will be held at all. Our constitution however, dictates a presidential election is due during the fourth quarter of the year.

One thing seems certain; we still see the same faces who played a major role in bankrupting the country, putting themselves forward to lead us and our country into new vistas of prosperity.

While political parties are busy blaming each other for bringing this country to a state of bankruptcy, we do not hear any one of them raising a hand and saying ‘mea maxima culpa’ – through my most grievous fault or even saying ‘I am sorry’. Rather, we are being treated to a number of political dramas.

Growing support for more devolution of power to Wales and even independence from the UK

“Devolution - Welsh solutions to Welsh problems - that’s in my priority,” Gething declared.

Vaughan Gething, who was elected as First Minister (Chief Minister) of Wales last week, is the first Black to head a government in Europe. He is the fourth non-White head of government in the British Isles.

The politics of the British Isles is now truly multi-racial, a major and unprecedented development in British politics.

The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is an Indian. The Scottish First Minister is Hamza Yousaf, a Pakistani. The Irish Prime Minister (called the Taoiseach in the Irish language) is Leo Varadkar, who is part Indian. And now, the Welsh First Minister, called “prif weinidog” in the Welsh language, is Vaughan Gething, a half Zambian, the father being White and the mother a Black African.

### Why are all social issues not becoming political issues in Sri Lanka?

*2024-03-20 00:38:07* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-are-all-social-issues-not-becoming-political-issues-in-Sri-Lanka/4-759678) · `en`

Solving social issues can be considered as the fundamental responsibility of the Government in a democratic country

It is vital to convert these social issues into political issues to get a reasonable solution for the issues. However, despite this critical nature, all these issues are not always translated into the political agenda of the political parties. You might observe even some crucial issues are not getting the attention of the policymakers in the country

Even though each of us has individual desires to achieve, we all live in a society in which the activities of various actors are interconnected as seen in a spider web. Thus, it is difficult to progress as an individual in society while ignoring these interactions. Social issues are problems or conditions that negatively impact individuals, communities, or society as a whole. These problems can affect different aspects of people’s lives due to various interdependencies existing in society.

The incident occurred in the 37th over of the game when Hasaranga snatched his cap from one of the umpires and ridiculed the umpiring in the match.

He received a 50 per cent fine and accumulated three demerit points for his offense. This brought his total demerit points to eight in a 24-month period.
