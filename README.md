### Astronomers finally detect a rocky planet with an atmosphere

WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Astronomers have searched for years for rocky planets beyond our solar system with an atmosphere - a trait considered essential for any possibility of harboring life. Well, they finally seem to have located one. But this hellish planet - apparently with a surface of molten rock - offers no hope for habitability.

Researchers said on Wednesday the planet is a "super-Earth" - a rocky world significantly larger than our planet but smaller than Neptune - and it orbits perilously close to a star dimmer and slightly less massive than our sun, rapidly completing an orbit every 18 hours or so.

Infrared observations using two instruments aboard the James Webb Space Telescope indicated the presence of a substantial - if inhospitable - atmosphere, perhaps continuously replenished by gases released from a vast ocean of magma.

"Digitizing customs services is crucial for reducing export costs and living expenses. Despite Sri Lanka Customs' digital progress during the pandemic, reverting to manual processes post-pandemic led to corruption, delays, and increased costs. The Global Shippers Forum President urges complete digitalization to prevent market share loss to countries offering full digital services, citing India and Bangladesh as examples."

🟩

The government must completely digitize services offered by border agents, including Sri Lanka Customs, to ensure that the cost of exports and the cost of living is to be reduced.

Although Sri Lanka's customs are steadily operating and fully digitalized services during the epidemic, the agency returned to the manual process in the post -infection period, causing corruption with delays and additional expenses.

“Continuing governments do not have the motivation and vision of going to digitalization. Each rupee that is formed at port's transportation cost will come back to you. It is sent to the customer, so the cost of living is increasing.

With this media briefing, we urge the government to implement a complete digitalization, as this is not a neglecting issue in today's global economy, ”said Global Shippers Forum President Sean Wan Dard.

He warned that Sri Lankan exporters would lose their market share in exports as other countries in the region would come up with full digital services.

### ‘Interventions’ – A Book Review

*2024-05-09 08:38:53* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/interventions-a-book-review/) · `en`

“Until they become conscious, they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled, they cannot become conscious.” ― George Orwell

This is a review (perhaps imprecise) of the anthology “Interventions” – Selected Political Writings of Dayan Jayatilleka edited by Uditha Devapriya and Uthpala Wijesuriya with a forward by Kamaya Jayatissa, published by Neptune. I say imprecise, because I wrote this review before reading the entirety of this collection of writings by Dayan J.  When reading this missive I hope you will understand why I hurried to pen this review before digesting it in its whole.

Dayan Jayatilleke as a public intellectual has been rediscovered by two millennial opinion journalists – the type who seek the narrative that’s alternative to that of the mainstream.

I must declare my interest. I know Dayan since 1968 as the son of Mervyn De Silva who was my Editor at Ceylon Daily News. Mervyn was my friend and a mentor of sorts.

The Indian media reported that an alarming situation of severe coral bleaching had been reported in the Lakshadweep Sea and the Gulf of Mannar.

Asked for a comment in this regard, newly appointed Director General of the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) Dr. K.Arulananthan told Daily Mirror the heat level had increased to 31 degrees Celsius and remained for two weeks.

“If the heat level fluctuates between 27-28 degrees Celsius, it will be alright for coral health. However, if the current high level persists for another one month or so, coral deaths can be expected,” he said.

This examination is not a critique of foreign policy in isolation but a broader analysis of the mechanics of political authority within the presidential framework of the United States and Sri Lanka. My aim is to dissect how violence by way of conflation not only perpetuates but also emboldens the presidential system, transforming defense into a pinnacle of political maneuvering.

Colombo, May 9 (Daily Mirror) - Another court case with regard to Diana Gamage is on the cards as anyone could file another court case calling the Supreme Court to declare whether Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MPs could remain in Parliament as per yesterday’s judgement, Minister Kanchana Wijesekera told Parliament yesterday.

“One could question whether Gamage who has been declared as a non-citizen of this country could register a political party. One could also question whether the MOU signed by SJB General Secretary with Ms.Gamage is legally valid.

Further the validity of nomination papers signed by Gamage for certain MPs is also questionable,” the Minister said.

“Some SJB MPs whom I chatted with at the House canteen informed me that they were worried about yesterday’s judgment of the Supreme Courts which ruled that Gamage cannot function as an MP as she is not a citizen of Sri Lanka.

They are concerned since they may have to give up their MP posts,” he added.

May Day was at one time a significant event of the workers,for the workers and by the workers.  It is not so nowadays where the working class has been relegated to the back seat. The political class has taken over. The rhetoric however echoes and re-echoes on May day but the reality is different. The May Day  events have been turned into a political exercise where competing political parties engage in a show of strength by mobilising huge crowds.

May  1st 2024 saw   –   according to some newspapers –   41 May Day related  rallies,meetings or seminars being held throughout the  country.Other newspapers  lowered the number  to 22.. Pride of place was given to Colombo where the UNP, JVP/NPP, SLPP and SJB  held their rallies. All four parties had big crowds but the attendance was highest at the JVP rally. Furthermore the JVP rallies in Matara and Anuradhapura  also had large crowds. Compared to the “thun Sinhala” rallies the JVP rally in Jaffna was a poor show.
