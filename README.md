“We could not prioritize this in the first phrase. Therefore, we had a lot of inconveniences and many people have claimed benefits multiple times.”

Welfare Benefits Board Member Kumar Dunusinghe said that in one instance, an individual had registered for benefits 109 times.

This time, the Board will collect details of the applicant’s family members including their ID numbers to prevent the same family applying for benefits multiple times.

Feb. 15 (ICC) - UK based club cricketer Rizwan Javed has been banned from all cricket for 17 ½ years after he was found guilty of five different breaches of the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) Anti-Corruption Code for Participants (the ‘Code’).

Michael J Beloff KC, Chair of the ICC Code of Conduct Committee (acting as the ECB’s Disciplinary Panel), came to the decision after Rizwan failed to respond to the charges and was therefore deemed to have admitted that he has committed the offences charged, to have waived his right to a hearing and to have acceded to the imposition of a sanction.

### Japan slips into a recession and loses its spot as the world’s third-largest economy

*2024-02-15 15:58:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97297/japan-slips-into-a-recession-and-loses-its-spot-as-the-worlds-third-largest-economy) · `en`

Japan’s economy is now the world’s fourth-largest after it contracted in the last quarter of 2023 and fell behind Germany.

The government reported the economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.4% in October to December, according to Cabinet Office data on real GDP released Thursday, though it grew 1.9% for all of 2023. It contracted 2.9% in July-September. Two straight quarters of contraction are considered an indicator an economy is in a technical recession.

Japan’s economy was the second largest until 2010, when it was overtaken by China’s. Japan’s nominal GDP totaled $4.2 trillion last year, while Germany’s was $4.4 trillion, or $4.5 trillion, depending on the currency conversion.

A weaker Japanese yen was a key factor in the drop to fourth place, since comparisons of nominal GDP are in dollar terms. But Japan’s relative weakness also reflects a decline in its population and lagging productivity and competitiveness, economists say.

India, the world’s biggest exporter of onions, banned shipments on December 8, 2023 after domestic prices more than doubled in three months following a drop in production. India has taken the policy decision to contain inflation ahead of the parliamentary elections.

However, Sri Lanka sought an exemption to import 100,000 tonnes of big onions from India under special arrangements despite the ban.

Asked about the latest situation, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando told Daily Mirror that the attempt did not materialize and therefore the prices remained high in the local market.

The wholesale price of big onions remains at Rs.350-375 a kilo at the moment.
