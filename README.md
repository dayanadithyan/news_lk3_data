A Sri Lankan mother-of-three killed by her estranged husband fled the family home with her children almost a decade earlier after he hit her with a hammer and stomped on her, a jury has been told.

Nelomie Perera, 43, was found dead in a pool of blood in her kitchen with 35 separate injuries in December 2022.

Prosecutors allege Dinush Kurera, 47, murdered her in a “sustained, brutal and vicious attack” with a hatchet and kitchen knife in front of their children.

Kurera has pleaded not guilty to her murder and further denies assaulting his 17-year-old son.

On Wednesday, lawyers for Kurera, whom prosecutors allege had no injuries after the attack, told a jury that he admitted he killed his wife but he did so to save his own life.

“He grappled with her over the knife, in her murderous rage and he defended himself and the deceased was killed,” defence barrister John Desmond told the court.

### Vallibel One rebuts anonymous message circulated on social media

Vallibel One PLC yesterday issued a statement to the Colombo Stock Exchange refuting the anonymous, yet adverse message circulated on social media.

Our attention has been drawn to an anonymous message which is being circulated on social media under the caption “Vallibel One’s Rs. 163 billion Conundrum: A financial Thriller Unfolds Amidst Political Ambitions”.

We regret to note that the message appears to have been published with mischievous intent. The author of the publication, resorting to verbiage and a blatant distortion of facts has twisted a prudent application of policies by the company to cast sinister aspersions on the ultimate majority shareholder of the company, for political purposes. The circulated message states that the company is faced with a serious crisis referring to a “Rs. 163 billion set aside for expected credit losses”, which is manifestly false. In fact, the figure, Rs. 163 billion represents the Net amount of Loans and Advances of the Group.
