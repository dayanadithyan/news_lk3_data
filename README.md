April 7 (Reuters) - New Zealand said on Sunday that it was making immediate changes to its employment visa program after a near record migration last year which it said was "unsustainable".

The changes include measures such as introducing English language requirement for low skilled jobs and setting a minimum skills and work experience threshold for most employer work visas. The maximum continuous stay for most low skilled roles will also be reduced to three years from five years.

"The Government is focused on attracting and retaining the highly skilled migrants such as secondary teachers, where there is a skill shortage," Immigration Minister Erica Stanford said in a statement.

"At the same time we need to ensure that New Zealanders are put to the front of the line for jobs where there are no skills shortages," she said.

Last year, a near record 173,000 people migrated to New Zealand, the statement said.

Populist Peter Pellegrini has been elected president of Slovakia, succeeding the liberal Zuzana Caputova.

Mr Pellegrini, 48, defeated the pro-Western Ivan Korcok, a former diplomat, with 53% of the vote.

A former prime minister, he is an ally of Prime Minister Robert Fico, and shares the PM‚Äôs dovish attitude towards Russia.

Mr Fico and his allies now control Slovakia‚Äôs parliament, government and soon the president‚Äôs office.

Slovakia had been one of Ukraine‚Äôs staunchest allies before Mr Fico came to power in October on a pledge to halt supplies of Slovak Army military stocks to Kyiv. With Mr Pellegrini replacing Mrs Caputova, Ukraine has now definitively lost a voice of support in an EU and Nato capital.

Mr Fico has called for an end to Western military support for Ukraine, an immediate ceasefire and peace talks with Moscow. Mr Fico said recently President Vladimir Putin had been "unfairly demonised" and argued admitting Ukraine to Nato would mark the beginning of a third world war.

### MAKE AMERICA PRAY AGAIN

*2024-04-07 03:25:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/make-america-pray-again/) ¬∑ `en`

‚ÄúMarch Madness‚Äù is an annual ritual in the USA, the climax of the National College Basketball tournament that keeps Americans glued to their TVs for weeks. Employees in almost all offices and organizations, up to and including the White House, organize ‚Äúpools‚Äù to predict the final four, the semi-finalists of this tournament, usually a monumental task. The madness regarding the events concerning Trump during March was of such confusion that it has become impossible to predict even whether America will remain a democracy after November, 2024.

### It is up to India to settle the issue of poaching in Sri Lankan waters

*2024-04-07 03:18:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/it-is-up-to-india-to-settle-the-issue-of-poaching-in-sri-lankan-waters/) ¬∑ `en`

Kachchativu island when I visited it in 1974 was an uninhabited and desolate place occasionally visited by fishermen to dry their nets. A small Catholic shrine stood there for protection of fishers from storms and the sea.

The Lankan newspaper in late 1960s published a photograph of what was described as a group of pilgrims from India visiting the island. Serious fishing started when Indian fishermen depleted stocks on their side of the boundary and switched to more lucrative poaching of prawns, trawling on the Sri Lankan side on the muddy bottom of the basin South of Kachchativu.

When arrested by the SLN, Indian authorities exerted undue diplomatic and political pressure for the release of poachers and boats which are owned by influential people on Indian side. The Sri Lanka Navy effectively reduced poaching to zero but Indian political counter pressure even saw the overnight removal of the SLN commander then responsible for countering illegal fishing.

The Devil‚Äôs Comet will be positioned near the Jupiter, making it visible to the naked eye during the total solar eclipse on April 08.

A rare and massive comet, known for its ‚Äúhorned‚Äù shape and has a 71-year orbit, was observed for the first time in 1300 Anno Domini by a group of Chinese astronomers.

However, it was officially recognized after it was observed by the French astronomer Jean-Louis Pons in the 19th century and rediscovered by British American astronomer William Brooks in 1883.

The massive comet is also known as the ‚Äúdevil comet‚Äù due to its formation of two ‚Äúhorns‚Äù made up of ice and gas and periodic explosions.

According to NASA, the 18.6-mile-wide ‚ÄòDevil‚Äôs Comet‚Äô is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun and shine the brightest on the 21st of April.
