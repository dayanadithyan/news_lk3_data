Criticisms from Namal Rajapaksa are acknowledged as part of democratic discourse, while Wickremesinghe's suitability in fostering a common Sri Lankan identity is underscored through his track record of addressing issues affecting the common good. The upcoming election is anticipated to feature strong contenders, with the outcome to be determined by the voters on September 21st.

Ranil Wickremesinghe is brave enough that the 13th Amendment should continue and implement it. It is impossible to report this in Sri Lanka's political environment before the presidential election. External Affairs and Justice Minister Ali Sabri said that this is the most difficult issue, saying that Ranil Wickremesinghe is very relevant in our choices.

Question - What are your feelings about campaigning in favor of someone who has worked against you throughout your political life?

Answer - This is a part of politics. It is necessary to examine the current challenges and priority to the country than to be stubborn about parties and political leaders.

So what is important in this moment. Especially economics.

We must choose someone who can face these challenges. Because of this I choose him.

Question - You have consistently stated that it is the most important thing to strengthen the country's stability. Do you not think that anyone like Dhammika can help at this moment?

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has revealed plans to provide relief for personal income tax in the near future as the government is considering adjustments to the personal income tax structure to provide relief to taxpayers, the President’s Media Division reported.

Following the strong performance in tax revenue this year, the government has proposed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) an adjustment in Personal Income Tax slabs from Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 720,000, aiming to provide relief to mid-level taxpayers affected by recent tax reforms, he said.

The IMF, in turn, has suggested changes, offering more relief to lower bands, similar relief for mid-level taxpayers and slightly less for higher earners, while keeping the proposal’s core intact, he said.

The President revealed this while delivering the keynote address at the University Lecturers’ Conference held at the Water’s Edge Hotel last evening (13).

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s government has proposed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) an income tax relief by adjusting tax slabs, President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s office said, as the tax burden has become a key topic in the presidential election campaign.
