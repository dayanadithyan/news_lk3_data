India, June 5 (Indian Express) - The people have spoken and the NDA which claimed 294 Lok Sabha seats is set to return for a third term but the mandate is not exactly what Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spearheaded the BJP campaign, may have hoped for.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing party workers at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi in the evening, hailed the mandate for the NDA and a successive third term: ‚ÄúFor the first time since 1962, a government has returned for the third time after completing its two terms.‚Äù

### Interventions of a freelance intellectual: A review of Dayan Jayatilleka‚Äôs selected writings

*2024-06-05 05:27:35* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Interventions-of-a-freelance-intellectual-A-review-of-Dayan-Jayatilleka-s-selected-writings/4-762626) ¬∑ `en`

British philosopher and historian Perry Anderson defines Western Marxism as the product of defeat. Unlike in the Soviet Union and China, there were no successful Marxist revolutions in the West. The Western Marxist is then a vanquished and disenchanted figure. Never having known the taste and trials of success, the Western Marxist reduces socialism to an abstract ideal and an impotent exercise in scholasticism.

The theologian and Marxist scholar Roland Boer identifies the ‚Äúfreelance intellectual‚Äù as the chief proponent of Western Marxism. In short, the freelance intellectual is the academic, journalist, cultural critic, etc. who purveys a form of Marxist analysis but is, for the most part, independent of the discipline and accountability enforced by membership in a Communist Party or trade union. In China, to be a Communist means to be a Community Party member. In the West, one is free to adopt any label one pleases.

Colombo, June 4 (Daily Mirror) - The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has scheduled a major shutdown of the refinery at Sapugaskanda from July 8, its media spokesman S.M.C.P. Samarakoon said.

He said the refinery crude unit was shut down on May 29, followed by a complete shutdown of the production processes on May 30 morning due to a failure in the water demineralization plant, which is crucial for refinery power generation facilities.

After painstaking efforts, the repair work on the boiler water system has been successful, and the restoration of the power system will be completed shortly, Samarakoon said.

The resumption of the crude unit operation will commence effective tomorrow, and other processors will be started subsequently, he said.

Therefore, the CPC assured the public that there is no need to worry about their fuel requirements, as Ceypetco has sufficient stocks in storage tanks.
