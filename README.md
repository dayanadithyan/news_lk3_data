President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed a gathering in Colombo, emphasizing the importance of the IMF agreement for Sri Lanka's economic recovery. He warned against the consequences of defaulting on the agreement, referencing previous defaults which led to challenging economic periods. The event saw participation from various stakeholders including representatives from across the country's cooperative societies.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe says that the neighbors will go to the stupa and cannot eliminate the poverty of the people.

The President made these comments participating at a discussion held in Colombo yesterday.

A large number of representatives and representatives of the Board of Directors and officers of the Co-operative Societies island wide were joined.

"We are now building because of the agreement between the IMF and the government. If the treaty is given to fall again, a queue era again. We broke the IMF contract 17 times. I was told that the 18th time she was running back. "

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has raised concerns over the safety of its Test team ahead of the three-match series against England, starting on August 21 in Manchester, due to anti-immigrant riots that have erupted in various cities of the United Kingdom.

According to a report in ESPNCricinfo, the Sri Lankan players already in England - seven players and two support staff - have asked the countryтАЩs cricket board to arrange for better security over the next few days, as they travel to and from a ground near London, due to the widespread riots targeting immigrants in the UK.

The riots in the UK have taken place after a mass stabbing incident in Southport, where three children were killed. Due to disinformation about the attackers, many immigrants, as well as their businesses and places of worship, have come under attack from far-right groups.
