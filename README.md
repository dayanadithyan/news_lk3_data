“As a result, there is an estimate that a surprising 17 billion US dollar financing gap for women-owned MSMEs in Sri Lanka.

“The gender gap in employment and entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka continues to affect women’s economic empowerment opportunities and their resilience to economic shocks.”

### Sri Lanka says imputed rental tax will not apply to all

*2024-06-18 05:03:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-says-imputed-rental-tax-will-not-apply-to-all-168480/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s planned imputed rental tax will only apply to wealthier persons, according to a Finance Ministry statement.

Wealth taxes, which have been implemented in a number of other countries, have had detrimental impacts on housing as well as other negative fallouts, partly due to the lack of cashflows to pay such taxes.

“The envisaged property tax is in an advanced stage of design and therefore, it is premature to outline specific details of rates and thresholds,” the Finance Ministry said.

“However, the focus of this tax is on high wealth individuals, and not on average income earners.

“This objective will be achieved by a suitable tax-free threshold to ensure that the tax is targeted on very high value property or multiple properties that are owned by wealthy members of society.

Most assets have been built out of earnings already taxed by the state. Taxes that penalize thrift in general tend to have negative consequences, critics say.

Facing societal pressures and economic challenges, the government is criticized for its handling of taxes and adherence to IMF directives, leading to a perceived "tax tsunami" affecting citizens. Despite these issues, efforts like the Universal Information Technology Program, investing in smart classrooms, and the push for digital literacy and green education are highlighted as steps towards addressing national concerns and fostering growth.

🟩

Today, people are facing difficulties with irreversible pressure in society. Even though people are in poverty, the tax tsunami is not standing on the tax topic. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has accused the government of creating a formula for taxation and taxation of the International Monetary Fund.

This government has not been ordered to do everything the IMF says. If the government is efficient, there is no such thing as the opportunity to reach a good agreement for the people. The country is the toy rule in the rhythm of the International Monetary Fund. He said the government has imposed a tax tsunami on the shoulders of the people.

Under the Universal Information Technology Program, smart classroom equipment worth Rs 1,177,000 lakhs was held on Monday (17).

### Tamil speaking general candidate is essential

Basheer Segudaoud urges for a Tamil-speaking minority candidate to represent Tamil, Muslim, and Upcountry communities in Sri Lanka's presidential election, emphasizing the importance of unity among minorities to influence the outcome. He highlights the need for a candidate with strong ties to these communities, capable of securing support from Sinhala progressives and leading towards a more inclusive future.

🟩

United Peace Coalition Chairman Basheer Segudaoud said that a Tamil -speaking minority general candidate should be suspended as the overall representative of the Tamil, Muslim and Upcountry Minority Communities in the country.

He said this in a media statement issued to the media on Monday (17) regarding the general candidate in the presidential election.

The upcoming presidential election has become a speech. The proposed candidates of the Great Forces have come to the North, East and the hill country to seek the support of minority communities.

Vishwaroopam is the biggest match that the election has not existed before. Winning any candidate with a uniqueness can be as difficult as fiber in the stone.

Beyond that, it is no exaggeration if any candidate wants to get 50 percent of the votes.

A president could not appear from minority communities in Sri Lanka. But who is the President?Minority communities can become a power that determines.

Hints two additional parties may join their coalition during meeting

Sarvajana Balaya is set to hold its inaugural political rally today in Nugegoda, aiming to reignite the support of the 6.9 million voters who previously backed a better future for the country. During the meeting, it is hinted that two additional parties may join their coalition.

Holding a media briefing, Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP) leader Dilith Jayaweera expressed readiness to rekindle the enthusiasm of those voters.

He stressed that none of the Sarvajana Balaya representatives were responsible for the downfall of the previous regime, attributing the failure to the Rajapaksa family’s inability to meet the people’s expectations.

Jayaweera specifically blamed Basil Rajapaksa’s liberal ideologies for the regime’s collapse.

“The 6.9 million voters symbolise those who love the country,” Jayaweera stated.

He said there is no option for the people of the country other than rallying around Sarvajana Balaya.

### “The present time is opportune for a pledge to be taken together by the prospective candidates at the presidential election to support the implementation of the 13th Amendment and take forward the larger reconciliation process”- National Peace Council

*2024-06-18 00:09:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84213) · `en`

(Text of Media Release issued by the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka on 14 June 2024)

Sri Lanka is witnessing a positive transformation of electoral politics in relation to its long standing ethnic conflict that commenced with the economic collapse of 2022. The notion that the country required a “system change” was promoted by the student-led protest movement that publicly eschewed racism and upheld the rights of equal citizenship in their slogans.

In a manner inconceivable in the past, the three main candidates for the presidential election in October appear to be outbidding each other in support of the 13th Amendment to the constitution and devolution of power to the provinces.

This is an aspect of the change that has taken place in contrast to the politics of the past when narrow ethnic nationalism was used to foment violence and harvest votes.
