### Sri Lanka Hones Its Balancing Act

*2024-04-08 13:20:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lanka-hones-its-balancing-act/) ¬∑ `en`

Colombo has demonstrated its own brand of strategic autonomy on issues from Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine to China‚Äôs global footprint

Most South Asian governments tend to have nonaligned foreign policies, balancing their relations with major powers. This maximizes their diplomatic flexibility and ability to operate independently on the world stage, also known as strategic autonomy. India and Pakistan are two prominent examples: They both balance their relations with the United States and at least one of its core rivals (Russia and China, respectively).

But it‚Äôs important not to overlook Sri Lanka: In the last two years, Colombo has quietly and successfully navigated global conflict and great-power rivalry. Like many other countries in the region, Sri Lanka has not condemned Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine, even though resulting price shocks exacerbated its own economic crisis in 2022. Yet it has¬†called¬†for an end to the war and¬†announced¬†new measures that step up economic and energy ties with India.
