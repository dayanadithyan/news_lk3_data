Former United National Party Colombo Municipal Council Member Elbert Sampath has said that the President should take steps to suspend the increase in 10 thousand rupees for good deeds in the border of Colombo Municipal Council.

The decision of the Commissioner of Colombo Municipal Council to increase the massive fee for goodwill. Therefore, steps should be taken to prevent the tariff increase.

The Colombo Municipal Council has been charged only 1,500 rupees. However, it has increased to 10 thousand rupees and the fee of 5 thousand rupees has been increased to 20 thousand rupees.

With the massive economic crisis of the people, this massive increase is a move to make people more difficult.

### Sri Lanka private credit surge Rs97bn in Dec 2023

*2024-02-05 07:55:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-private-credit-surge-rs97bn-in-dec-2023-149846/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka’s private credit to businesses and individuals surged in December 2023 97.5 billion rupees from 62.5 billion rupees a month earlier, official data shows as bank loans continue a positive trend.

Sri Lanka’s private credit became negative around June 2022 after rates were hiked in April and intervention using Indian ACU balances also ended a little later, allowing the economy to adjust to market linked inflows.

Countries usually go through a period of de-leveraging or a recession when stabilization policies are applied after a central bank mis-target rates with inflationary open market operations, and fires credit beyond deposits available in the banking system.

In countries with floating exchange rates with positive inflation targets, where balance of payments problems in the form of forex shortages do not take place, long periods of mis-targeted rates with reverse repo operations end up in housing or asset price bubbles.

### தமிழரசு கட்சியின் தலைவராக சிறிதரனும் தமிழர் அரசியலும்

*2024-02-05 00:45:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83558) · `en`

தேசிய இனப்பிரச்சினைக்கு  அரசியல் இணக்கத்தீர்வைக்  காணும் முயற்சிகளிலும்  வடக்கு,கிழக்கில்  எதிர்நோக்கப்படும்  பல்வேறு மனிதாபிமானப் பிரச்சினைகளுக்கு தீர்வைக் காணும் முயற்சிகளிலும் தமிழ் அரசியல் கட்சிகள் ஐக்கியப்பட்டு ஒருமித்த அணுகுமுறையைக் கடைப்பிடிக்கவேண்டும் என்பதே தமிழ் மக்களினதும் அவர்களின் நலன்களில் அக்கறைகொண்ட சிவில் சமூகம் மற்றும் அவதானிகளினதும்  இடையறாத வேண்டுகோளாக  இருந்து வருகிறது.

ஆனால், தமிழ்க் கட்சிகளின் தலைவர்கள் அது குறித்து அக்கறை காட்டக்கூடிய மனநிலையில் இல்லை. ஏற்கனவே இருபது வருடங்களுக்கும் அதிகமான காலமாக பல்வேறு மாச்சரியங்களுக்கு மத்தியிலும் கூட நீடித்து நின்ற தமிழ் தேசிய கூட்டமைப்பும் கடந்த முற்பகுதியில் இல்லாமற் போய்விட்டது.

கடந்தவாரம் தமிழ்க் கட்சிகளின் தலைவர்களை சந்தித்த புதிய இந்திய உயர்ஸ்தானிகர் சந்தோஷ் ஜாவும் அரசியல் தீர்வுக்கான கோரிக்கையை அந்த கட்சிகள் ஐக்கியப்பட்ட ஒரு அமைப்பாக ஒருமித்து  முன்வைக்கவேண்டும் என்று வலியுறுத்திக் கூறியிருக்கிறார்.

### Independence and Self-Sufficiency: Co-operation in Times of Crisis

*2024-02-05 00:05:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Independence-and-Self-Sufficiency-Co-operation-in-Times-of-Crisis/172-276324) · `en`

For close to a decade and a half I have been studying co-operatives, particularly as I was preoccupied with questions about the post-war reconstruction of Jaffna. As I watched the failure of development policies that prioritised building transport and urban infrastructure over rural livelihoods, supported the proliferation of financial institutions leading to indebtedness, and grand claims about the private sector generating employment that did not materialize, I became more and more involved with the co-operative movement. Drawing on the institutional memory of the co-operative movement and the vast network of co-operatives that survived the war, some of us began to see an alternative for social and economic revival of the still rural war-torn society in the North.

True freedom cannot be bestowed by an external entity; it resides within you. Unleash it from within yourself

The 76th ‘February 4th’ has passed, marked by four days of aerobatics, consuming considerable aviation fuel and time.

The 76th ‘February 4th’ has passed, marked by four days of aerobatics, consuming considerable aviation fuel and time. This prompts questions about resource usage during such events. The primary question persists: why, after 76 years of independence, hasn’t this celebration translated into genuine freedom? To attain complete freedom for Sri Lankans, there is a need to fully implement the 13th Amendment or consider extending beyond its provisions.

### Will ITAK New Chief, Sritharan put the Tamil Movement on a Radical Path?

*2024-02-05 00:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Will-ITAK-New-Chief-Sritharan-put-the-Tamil-Movement-on-a-Radical-Path/172-276322) · `en`

Although Jaffna district Member of Parliament, Sivagnanam Sritharan had told the media on what principles he would lead the struggle for the political rights of the Tamil people after being elected as the leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) – popularly known as the Federal Party – it was expected that he would officially explain his policies after assuming office at the party’s convention that was to be held in Trincomalee last Sunday.

However, the convention was postponed indefinitely due to controversies surrounding selections for other posts, including the post of the General Secretary of the party. So the new leader was unable to deliver that important speech.

After the election of Sritharan by the party’s General Council in a secret ballot at Trincomalee Town Hall on 21 January, the other contender, Member of Parliament, M.A. Sumanthiran had publicly announced that he would cooperate with the new leader.
