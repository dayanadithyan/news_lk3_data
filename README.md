### Colombo’s most popular caricaturist in a bygone era

*2024-02-25 03:18:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/colombos-most-popular-caricaturist-in-a-bygone-era/) · `en`

With the passing of time, Lorenz did not have the time he would like to dedicate to the arts as before. The demand on his time in other fields such as in law and politics necessitated him to mainly if not totally focus on those aspects. However, his pencil and sketchbook never left his side. When inspiration struck him, out came a fine caricature. It has been over 150 years since his death and most of his once famous caricatures have been lost. A few have been reproduced as plates in some important publications over the last 100 years and preserved for posterity.

Caricatures have always been endearing pieces of art which have commented on sophisticated matters. In the dynasty of Lankan caricature artists such as J. L. K. van Dort, Bevis Bawa, Aubrey Collette, W. R. Wijesoma and Gihan de Chickera, C.A. Lorenz can be safely positioned as the ‘pioneer’.

### WHEN TIGER (RAY) HOLDEN MET DARA SINGH

*2024-02-25 02:52:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/when-tiger-ray-holden-met-dara-singh/) · `en`

Professional wrestling was introduced to Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) by Donovan Andree, a prominent organiser of sporting and musical events for the middle class. An entertainment starved nation was quick to lap up the fare so diligently selected by Donovan.

For a period of about two decades after the ceasing of hostiities in World War 2, Ceylon’s middle class woke up from a long war induced slumber to find that we were living in a virtual cultural desert. For the Sinhala speaking folk there was some relief from the emergence of Sunil Santha waxing lyrical on the joys and the beauty of the rural countryside through songs like “Olu Pipeela,” “Handapane” and “Bovitiya dhang palukam waray” For the English speaking Colombo centric middle class there was only Radio Ceylon and the Western movies and associated music like Jimmy Rodgers epic “Moonlight and Skies” and Doris Day’s “Que Sera “and the like.

### The Academician and the Elephant: an adventure in the wilds of Wasgamuwa

*2024-02-24 22:11:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-academician-and-the-elephant-an-adventure-in-the-wilds-of-wasgamuwa/) · `en`

Accounts of conflicts in remote jungle areas between man and elephant appear in our newspapers regularly. They make sad reading – man and beast each fighting a never ending battle for survival under increasingly difficult circumstances. There are then accounts of people getting killed, seriously injured or narrowly escaping when on tour in parks, sanctuaries and even outside these while seeking entertainment from seeing animals in their natural habitat. And then, of course, we’ve been inundated with press articles about the two baby elephants taken forcibly from Pinnawela to Kandy.

With elephants so much in the news, an incident came to mind a few weeks ago listening to a brilliant academician at a seminar in Colombo. This academician, a friend of many years, had been living abroad for a long time excelling in his studies and profession. On his return he had an almost insatiable thirst for travel – off the beaten track – the more remote the better.

### The late Alexei Navalny

*2024-02-24 21:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-late-alexei-navalny/) · `en`

You may wonder why I write about a now dead Russian, this Sunday. Three reasons: I had seen news on him on BBC newscasts a couple of years back and then very recently too and read about him; admired his fearless stand on corruption in Russia and then his mysterious death. I was saddened. Disturbing thoughts on how things could turn out even in democratic Sri Lanka crowded my mind. Third reason: his life and death are relevant to all countries for one reason or another, chiefly that opposition to governments and leaders is of such vital importance.

Alexei Anatolyevich Navalny, born June 4, 1976, was of Russian and Ukrainian descent. His father was from a village on the Belarusian border and was evacuated to a region in Ukraine after the Chernobyl disaster. He grew up in Obninsk, about 100 km southwest of Moscow but spent holidays with his grandmother in Ukraine. His parents owned a basket weaving factory which they still manage.
