### People seek to violate the purpose of the constitution - the people reject the presidential candidate that threatens democratic traditions - more than 140 civil society activists appeal

*2024-08-01 14:50:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190008) ¬∑ `ta`

Civil society activists in Sri Lanka warn against presidential candidates threatening democratic traditions, citing potential constitutional crises and undermining of the rule of law. They oppose the swift appointment of the Inspector General of Police, fearing it could lead to such issues. The Supreme Court's involvement suggests the appointment might be unconstitutional, highlighting concerns over the executive's power and the need for adherence to constitutional norms. Activists urge voters to support candidates committed to preserving democracy and abolishing the executive presidency, emphasizing the importance of upholding the constitution and ensuring a fair electoral process.

Sri Lanka's civil society activists have said that we would like to remind our people and all candidates that any presidential candidate who threatens the democratic traditions of the country seeks to violate the clear purpose of the constitution.

They said the President's intention to appoint the Inspector General of Police could create a constitutional crisis that would undermine the rule of law.

In a statement issued by 142 civil society activists and academics and more than 30 organizations.

After listening to the nine petitions against the appointment of the Inspector General of Police for six days, the appointment of the Inspector General of Police at 9.30 am on July 24 decided to re -examine the matter.

Until then, the court ordered that the work of working at the office of the Tennakoon Police Inspector General of Police has been restricted.

It means that the appointment is invalid if the Supreme Court finally decides that the appointment of Thenkon is contrary to the constitution.

But although many people say they are contesting in the election, Ranil, Sajith and Anura are the three war.

What kind of competition is going to happen between the three.If you ask what the party's role in this election is, I think that the party will be completely destroyed if an election comes back.

That is, it is my opinion that all their seats in the south will go to the JVP party.Their betrayal of this country is in the mind.

They have been raging in this country in particular, and they have raised themselves because of the war war.All of these are well known now.

### Concession to the importer and change the status of the national manufacturer - Sajith

*2024-08-01 11:24:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189965) ¬∑ `ta`

Sajith Premadasa criticizes the government for favoring importers over national manufacturers, especially in the coconut oil industry, highlighting issues like unfair taxation and the sale of low-quality, artificially refined oils as natural. He promises changes in the United People's Power regime to address these concerns.

üü©

Providing concessions to the importer and the burden to the national manufacturer must change the conditions.Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said that if the current government does not change this position, we will change it in the United People's Power regime.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said this while addressing a discussion with traditional coconut oil producers on Wednesday (31).

Although a government policy that contains double policies that protect the manufacturer and consumers is required, today, the government's unreasonable policy is very unreasonable to impose an 18 percent tax on the domestic manufacturer and remove the tax on the imported coconut oil manufacturer and protect a few.

Although the five -star hostels will be given the right place to the national manufacturers, the national manufacturers and the producers have not been encouraged and supported.

The Ministry of Health requests the public not to be deceived by food that some disease can be cured.

Dr. Ananda Jayalal, Deputy Director General of the Ministry of Health, said that the names of certain institutions said that the names of certain institutions were used.

Speaking at a media brief in the Health Promotion Bureau, Dr. Ananda Jayalal made this observation.

"Usually a meal is mainly intended to withstand disease, nutrition and disease. We calls drugs that heal diseases. Food cannot treat sickness. If anyone can heal any disease, you must really have permission from the main food authority. We see the names of various institutions, especially social media, especially the food is good for cancer. That propaganda often is wrong. A meal cannot be advertised that you can often heal a disease. If so, formal clinical data should be submitted to the Ministry of Health Ministry authority. It is illegal to do that. "
