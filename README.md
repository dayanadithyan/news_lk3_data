Current President then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had in 2015 assured justice over the murders, including that of former Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge and rugger player Wasim Thajudeen.

However, President Wickremesinghe and his administration have not provided any assurances to the families of the victims since taking office after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced out of office.

Dr. Kasippillai Manoharan, whose 20-year-old son, Ragihar, was among the five youths killed in Trincomalee in 2006, told Daily Mirror he has not heard anything from the Government over the investigations.

Known as the ‘Trinco Five’ case, five Tamil students were killed on January 2, 2006, allegedly by the security forces at point-blank range.

Dr. Manoharan said that Amnesty International had been pursuing his son’s case and now another foreign individual was assisting to ensure justice.

### The Iran-Israel conflict leaves Lanka at crossroads - EDITORIAL

Israel’s misguided (as the US President chooses to call it) attack on the Iranian Consulate in Syria, the retaliatory strikes by Iran on Israel and counter-strikes by Israel on Iran have set West Asia (referred to as the Middle East by the US and the West) in flames. By these actions, the taboo against direct attacks on each other has now disappeared.

If there is another round-a conflict over Iran’s nuclear advances or another strike by Israel on Iranian military officers- both sides will feel free to launch direct attacks on the other.

Relations reached a point of no return on April 1, 2024 when an Israeli air strike destroyed the Iranian Consulate annex building in Syria killing 16 people, including a senior Quds Force Commander.

### Iran and Israel: From Allies to brink of major conflict

At one point, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin even referred to Iran as one  of Israel’s “best friends.” However, sentiments shifted rapidly, and  Rabin later characterized Ayatollah Khomeini’s regime as “dark” and  “murderous.”

Global oil and gold prices surged, while stock markets plummeted, in the wake of reports that Israel had launched missiles at several sites in Iran.

Iran and Israel were once close allies during the reign of the Shah, as they shared common geopolitical interests and concerns regarding Arab nationalism. However, with the establishment of the Islamic Republic following the 1979 Islamic Revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini’s rise to power,Khomeini severed diplomatic ties with Israel and adopted a firm anti-Zionist stance.

### Market lending rate falls to two-year low as economy readies to take off

Prime rate hits a peak level of 29.67 percent in November 2022

The often watched market lending rate, which guides the rest of the rates on loans to small businesses to mortgages to consumers, touched a two-year low last week continuing its descent.

The average prime lending rate or the rate at which the banks lend to their most creditworthy clients for a short term fell 22 basis points to 10.41 percent last week.

This was the lowest level from 9.85 percent on April 1, 2022 just before the Central Bank raised interest rates by a bumper 700 basis points to rein in the inflation at the time.

Both government securities yields and the market lending rates are on the descent during the last 10 months since the time Central Bank pivoted to cut rates for the first time in June last year.

The prime rate hit a peak level of 29.67 percent in November 2022 when the monetary policy was  crushingly tight.

### United Nations pushes justice for Sri Lanka’s Easter victims

*2024-04-22 01:46:52* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/United-Nations-pushes-justice-for-Sri-Lanka-s-Easter-victims/56-760876) · `en`

The United Nations on Sunday urged Sri Lanka to bridge its “accountability deficit” and ensure justice as the country commemorated the 279 victims of its worst-ever attack against civilians five years ago.

The UN’s top envoy to the country, Marc-Andre Franche, told a remembrance service in Colombo that there should be a “thorough and transparent investigation” to uncover those behind the Easter carnage in 2019.

Islamist bombers hit three churches and three hotels in the island’s deadliest suicide attack aimed at civilians, but grieving families say they are still waiting for justice.

Among the dead were 45 foreigners, including tourists visiting the island a decade after the end of a brutal ethnic conflict that had claimed more than 100,000 lives since 1972.

“Sri Lanka suffers from a continuing accountability deficit, be it for alleged war crimes, more recent human rights violations, corruption or abuse of power, which must be addressed if the country is to move forward,” Franche said.
