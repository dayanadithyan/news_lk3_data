### Israel says Hezbollah rocket kills 12 at football ground, vows response

*2024-07-28 11:07:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100828/israel-says-hezbollah-rocket-kills-12-at-football-ground-vows-response) ┬╖ `en`

A rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights killed 12 people including children on Saturday, Israeli authorities said, blaming Hezbollah and vowing to inflict a heavy price on the Iran-backed Lebanese group.

Hezbollah denied any responsibility for the strike, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since the start of the conflict in Gaza.

The attack sharply escalated tensions in the hostilities which have been fought in parallel to the Gaza war and has raised fears of a full-blown conflict between the heavily armed adversaries.

The rocket struck a football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries.

### XXXIII Olympic Games

*2024-07-28 00:47:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/xxxiii-olympic-games/) ┬╖ `en`

Innumerable essays were written during schooldays; celebrated in 1948 was Major Desamanya Duncan M WhiteтАЩs Olympic silver medal in the 400m hurdles in London; and even more so Susanthika JayasingheтАЩs bronze promoted to silver in the 200m sprint in 2000 in Sydney. Thus no surprise that interest runs high every four years when the Summer Olympic Games are held. After all, here is one event that draws the world together in holding the most attended and famed gathering of all, a sporting event aimed to be sans politics, enmity, corrosive competition. Rather is it meant to foster a coming together of all nations of the world in peace, inducing sportsmanship of the correct win or lose type; with no monetary awards given by IOC, the International Olympics Committee.

MPs are not strictly divided along party lines in the current parliament, except for the TNA and JVP/NPP. MPs from other parties sit on both the government and opposition sides of the House. This movement is frequently and expected to continue in the coming weeks as political maneuvering continues. However, MPs come together for moments of shared amusement, as seen last Wednesday in the lobbies during an adjournment debate on promoting Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Here, Colombo District MP Rear Admiral (Retd) Sarath Weerasekara, who is also known for his part in the films тАЬGaminiтАЭ (2011) and тАЬDeveni YuddhayaтАЭ (2023), made a comment that drew laughter from both government and opposition MPs. He said that the Buddha had used AI many times. He claimed that while AI was discovered by modern Western scientists, the Buddha through meditation and spiritual attainment achieved as much.

Sri Lanka has a rich history of investment in education, reflected in its impressive literacy rate over 93%. However, since gaining independence in 1948, the island nation has struggled with political corruption and mismanagement, leading to increased economic instability and social unrest.

### HUSBANDLY QUIRKS

In my maidenly era, and even earlier, most of us entered marriage with stars in our eyes. If not always stars, at least happy expectations of a cozily comfortable home life where everything fell into place and nothing other than an occasional husbandly tantrum disturbed the peace of the day. No one told us that men had quirks or that they had strange, indeed offbeat foibles.

After all, how could a mother anticipate what peculiarities her daughterтАЩs charming fiance was going to exhibit once he had exchanged this role for that of a husband who required mollycoddling in the same manner his doting mother had provided all his life.

The first is the controversial issue surrounding the Supreme CourtтАЩs (SC) interim order, which has prevented incumbent IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon from functioning as the police chief.

In one master stroke last Sunday afternoon, the beleaguered American President Joe Biden turned the tables on Donald Trump and the Republican Party. From his home in Delaware, Biden tersely announced that he was withdrawing from the race and endorsing his Vice President Kamala Harris to be the nominee of the Democratic Party for the November presidential election. If that was stunning, the even greater shock and awe is the speed and manner in which Kamala Harris has rolled out her campaign; secured her nomination within hours; energized the Party at every level; enthused the youth in their own network worlds; raised millions of dollars by the minute; and served notice to Trump that she is the prosecutor, he is the felon, and she knows his type.

### Old Dogs, New Tricks: The Ongoing Battle Against Age-Related Mental Decline

Growing up in Sri Lanka in the 60s and 70s, our ambition was to secure a government job, retire by age 55, and enjoy a good pension. I often saw my male relatives doing just that, reclining in easy chairs with their legs propped upтАФa common and comfortable sight. However, the 80s brought dramatic changes. We scattered across the globe, embracing diverse cultures and values. In the USA, particularly, weтАЩve been conditioned to believe that age is just a number and that life is endless, with us as the Energizer Bunnies, going on forever.

This optimistic view was suddenly upended last week with President Joe BidenтАШs announcement of his campaign termination following his disastrous debate performance. Suddenly, age-related mental decline and dementia were thrust into the spotlight, challenging the notion that we can defy the effects of aging indefinitely.
