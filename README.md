All political parties are in election mode. Presidential elections are scheduled to be held between September and October this year. However, reaching the magical 50%+1 seems like a distant dream for the candidates in the running.

In the first presidential election in October 1982, President Jayewardene‚Äôs main rival Mrs.Sirimavo Bandaranaike was banned from contesting. Jayewardene was able to collect only 52.91 percent of the votes.

The 1988 election saw several election violence-related actions. That election was won by Ranasinghe Premadasa who received 50.4 percent of the votes. Voter turnout was low-around 55.3 percent, the lowest for a presidential election.

The¬† Official Poverty Measure, according to which the official US¬† poverty rate in 2022 was 11.5 percent, with 37.9 million people in¬† poverty

It‚Äôs hard to believe, but McDonald‚Äôs is losing customers in the US because they can no longer afford McDonald‚Äôs prices.

Americans spend eleven per cent of their earnings on food. Eating out is a major pastime. But, those in the median income groups (including sections of the middle class) are feeling squeezed as they need to spend more on almost everything, including rents, mortgages, cars and transport. Unemployment is on the rise, with Silicon Valley and Amazon among the earliest to begin layoffs.

Those earning $45,000 or less are less and less able to eat out, and McDonald‚Äôs outlets are favourite havens for that.

(Reuters) - Iran‚Äôs hardline former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has registered to run for president in the country‚Äôs June 28 election, organized after the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month, Iran‚Äôs state television reported on Sunday.

However he could be barred from the race: the country‚Äôs cleric-led Guardian Council will vet candidates, and publish the list of qualified ones on June 11.

Ahmadinejad, a former member of Iran‚Äôs elite Revolutionary Guards, was first elected as Iran‚Äôs president in 2005 and stepped down because of term limits in 2013.

He was barred from standing in the 2017 election by the Guardian Council, a year after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned him that entering was ‚Äúnot in his interest and that of the country‚Äù.

A rift developed between the two after Ahmadinejad explicitly advocated checks on Khamenei‚Äôs ultimate authority.

In 2018, in rare criticism directed at Khamenei, Ahmadinejad wrote to him calling for ‚Äúfree‚Äù elections.

*2024-06-02 17:41:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185139) ¬∑ `ta`

Namal Rajapaksa, the National Organizer of the PA, stated that political decisions are made without consulting the president. This stance was highlighted during an event in Colombo, where it was also mentioned that the PA has chosen Ranil Wickremesinghe as the interim president. Despite being in discussions with a presidential candidate, Rajapaksa emphasized the importance of adhering to the PA's policies, indicating no compromise on their political stance.

üü©

If we announce our presidential candidate by holding the post of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the government is in crisis. The President must announce his position on the presidential election.. The National Organizer of the PA, Namal Rajapaksa, said that we do not take a political decision with consultation with the president.

He was speaking to the media after the event held in Colombo on Sunday (2).

It is improper to say that if the members of the United People's Power are united with the president, it is improper to announce our political decision.

We have elected United National Party (UNP) leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the interim president.

We are in talks with the presidential candidate.

We have paid special attention to political decisions by highlighting the policies of the Sri Lanka PA. He said he would not give up the party's policies for any reason.
