### Puffiness and dark circles…under the eyes

*2024-05-23 07:35:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/puffiness-and-dark-circlesunder-the-eyes/) · `en`

Wow! The Aloe Vera magic is certainly helping The Island readers!

I had a few queries wanting to know whether Aloe Vera is helpful in moisturising the delicate skin under the eyes, and also reducing puffiness.

Extract fresh cucumber juice. You can do this by blending cucumber slices and then straining the juice through a fine sieve, or cheesecloth, to remove any pulp.

In a small bowl, mix together the aloe vera gel and cucumber juice until well combined.

Pierce the vitamin E capsules and squeeze out the oil into the mixture.

Add the olive oil to the mixture and stir well to ensure all ingredients are thoroughly combined.

Store the mixture in a clean, airtight container in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to chill.

After chilling, use a cotton pad, or your fingertips, to apply the mixture gently under your eyes.
