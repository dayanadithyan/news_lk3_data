### Indonesia issues tsunami alert after volcano erupts on remote island

*2024-04-18 10:34:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Indonesia-issues-tsunami-alert-after-volcano-erupts-on-remote-island/108-280887) · `en`

(CNN) - Indonesian authorities on Wednesday ordered hundreds of villagers to evacuate following multiple eruptions of a remote island volcano, raising fears it could collapse into the sea and trigger a tsunami.

Mount Ruang, a 725-meter (2,400-foot) conical stratovolcano on Ruang Island, North Sulawesi, has erupted at least five times since Tuesday night, spewing fiery lava and ash plumes thousands of feet into the sky, the country’s volcanology agency said.

Agency chief Hendra Gunawan said officials had raised the volcano alert to the highest level, warning people not to go within 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) of the peak, due to fears Mount Ruang could partially collapse into the water and cause a tsunami, as it did in 1871.

“Canadian leaders have a history of making such allegations, even though the Canadian federal government has concluded that the events in Sri Lanka during the war do not amount to genocide,” the official said.

Says worsening situation in Gulf could immediately put a strain on tea prices

Tea Board says industry has not officially shared any concerns as yet

The mounting tensions in the Middle East that are becoming increasingly unpredictable are likely to impact the Ceylon Tea cuppa, the industry stakeholders said, especially since over 50 percent of the island nation’s tea is exported to that region.

While the issues stemming from the Red Sea attack have already impacted the industry with longer delivery time and higher freight costs, new issues such as closure of airspace among others could add to the woes.

“Continuity of this would mean restricted movement of people, sending out samples and getting orders. As long as the sea is open, things should be okay.

Colombo, April 18 (Daily Mirror) - The Police department has decided to enhance crime detection by integrating public and private CCTV camera systems with the Police CCTV camera system, a senior police officer said.

In the initial stage, around 2000 CCTV cameras from private entities, including residences in Colombo city, will be linked to the police's camera network.

This initiative will be carried out in collaboration with interested participants. Individuals and private companies with CCTV systems are encouraged to connect their cameras to the Police CCTV system in Colombo, the official said.

As the second stage, steps will be taken to integrate the police camera system with cameras across the country.

While there is a notable presence of cameras in homes and private establishments in Colombo, their current impact on crime prevention is deemed minimal. The police department has only 176 CCTV cameras.

Accordingly, direction has been issued to implement the programme as soon as possible.

The encounter between  the Fox and Crow is an ancient  tale heard by most Sri Lankans in their childhood days. The crow has a vadai or kavun or piece of cheese in its beak. The crafty fox wants it and flatters the crow into thinking it  is a harmonious singer with a sweet voice. The fox entreats the crow to sing. The  foolishly vain  crow opens its mouth to sing and drops the titbit it has in its beak. The smart fox runs off with it, l eaving behind a dejected crow. This story has been made famous by singers like  MS  Fernando (Sora Gathu Keju Kaala) and AE Manoharan (Ka Kaa Kakakaka Ka Ka Ka) in their songs too.

### Role of governance and importance of eradication of corruption in attracting forex inflows

To cover up the reality, over-emphasis is placed to indicate that Sri Lankans are provided with too many subsidies and living beyond their means but a blind eye is turned to corruption and lack of governance

Lack of governance and corruption is so mainstream, even after the current IMF program is implemented, such corrupt practices are continuing and this was highlighted in the Parliament as well. It’s no wonder, the implementation of the anti-corruption bill is progressing at a snail’s pace

Corruption and investment have been synonymous in Sri Lanka for decades as investments paved the way for corrupt politicians and their close associates to embezzle public funds with ease. In a country where the term “governance” was used as a shield to cover corruption, hardly any room was left for transparency to play a role.

Mage Rata organization president Sanjaya Mahawatta today, lodged a complaint with the Illegal Assets Investigations Division, calling for an inquiry into model Piumi Hansamali using the Range Rover vehicle previously used  by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

“It is clear that an election is near and politicians tend to inject all their saved black money into the upcoming election campaigns and it has become a good time for the people who engage with money laundering activities.

“Accordingly, we have some doubts on how Piumi Hansamal managed to get the Range Rover vehicle (CBH 1949) which was used by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

“The question arises whether the Range Rover vehicle was given to the former president or if Gotabaya has given it to Piyumi,” said Mahawatta and further alleged that the model currently resides in a super luxury apartment, owns other properties and leads an exceedingly luxurious lifestyle.

*2024-04-18 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Kachchativu-Transforming-confrontation-into-cooperation/172-280856) · `en`

Katchatheevu is an uninhabited island-now in a sea of controversy-and sandwiched between India and Sri Lanka in the Palk Bay

In the matter of Kachchativu too, it could have been taken before the ICJ or an Arbitration Tribunal, as in the case of the Rann of Katch dispute between India and Pakistan

Article 15 of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, sets out the criteria for delimitation of the territorial sea between states with opposite or adjacent coasts

In the case of India and Sri Lanka, the territorial sea in this area has been designated ‘historic waters’ and has been delimited by agreement

### To protect the welfare of Sri Lankan migrant workers, hold recruitment agencies accountable

*2024-04-18 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/To-protect-the-welfare-of-Sri-Lankan-migrant-workers-hold-recruitment-agencies-accountable/172-280858) · `en`

Many studies have documented the tremendous wage gains that migrant workers experience across borders.; however, it is also well understood that these riches come at a price and migrant stories of abuse are common knowledge

The 2022 Football World Cup in Qatar centered the world’s attention on the abuse faced by thousands of primarily South Asian migrant construction workers. The spectacle was a rare opportunity to press the case for reform not just in Qatar, but across many Gulf-region governments whose glittering skylines conceal a staggering amount of migrant abuse. Yet, just as the fervour of fair weather football fans has waned, so too have international outrage and promises of reform.

While President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the splintered Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) government and opposition parties are focusing on the elections, what election should be held or when and on what basis, more attention needs to be given to vital issues relating to Mother Earth, as the world marks Mother Earth day on Monday, April 22.

In a statement, the United Nations said that Mother Earth is clearly urging a call to action. Nature is suffering. Oceans are being filled with plastic and turning more acidic. Extreme heat, wildfires and floods have affected millions of people.

Climate change, human-made changes to nature, as well as crimes that disrupt biodiversity, such as deforestation, land-use change, intensified agriculture and livestock production or the growing illegal wildlife trade, can accelerate the speed of destruction of the planet.

Every stable democracy needs a political and ideological centre. In Ceylon/Sri Lanka, the political Centre as distinct from the Right and Left was always identified with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) founded by SWRD Bandaranaike.

When he crossed the floor in Parliament in 1951, leaving DS Senanayake’s UNP government he was followed by only one MP, DA Rajapaksa, Mahinda’s father.

When the SLFP or a faction of it shifted Right and went into alliance with Ranil Wickremesinghe’s UNP in 2005, Mahinda continued the centrist tradition (which he sincerely thought to be ‘left’). The SLFP’s successor party the SLPP, founded with Mahinda as leader, continued the centrist tradition, however distorted and wayward, until Gotabaya’s nomination in 2019.

Sri Lanka may reach a deal with investors to restructure its $12 billion in defaulted global bonds by mid-May, according to strategists at Standard Chartered.

The South Asian nation has been hoping to reach a deal in the next few weeks, though the first round of direct talks with dollar bondholders failed to yield a breakthrough. The remaining disagreements relate to the structure of “macro-linked” bonds, an instrument proposed by bondholders, whose payout would vary depending on the nation’s economic performance.

“We think timelines are critical and expect an agreement by mid-May,” strategists including Shankar Narayanaswamy wrote in a note.

Further delays would take the talks too close to the planned presidential elections, Standard Chartered said.

The nation’s dollar bonds were among top performers on Wednesday, with the March 2029 note advancing 2 cents to 56.4 cents per dollar. Bonds maturing in March 2030 and April 2028 also climbed.
