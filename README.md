### Modi claims victory for his alliance in India’s general election

*2024-06-04 21:08:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99664/modi-claims-victory-for-his-alliance-in-indias-general-election) · `en`

(AP) — Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed victory for his alliance on Tuesday in India’s general election, despite a lackluster performance from his own party as it faced a stronger than expected challenge from the opposition, which pushed back against his mixed economic record and polarizing politics.

Modi told a crowd at his party’s headquarters that his National Democratic Alliance will form the government for the third consecutive time, saying Indian voters had “shown immense faith” both in his party and the coalition alliance.

“Today’s victory is the victory of the world’s largest democracy” he said.

Still, for the first time since Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it appeared unlikely it would secure a majority on its own, and the prime minister would instead need the support of the other parties in his coalition for his third five-year term in the world’s largest democratic exercise.

### Imran Khan acquitted in state secrets case

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been acquitted of leaking state secrets but will remain in jail because of a conviction in another case.

In the run-up to elections in February, the 71-year-old - who was ousted as prime minister in 2022 - was hit with three prison sentences for cases he insists were politically motivated.

Khan was sentenced to 10 years in prison in January on charges of making public a diplomatic cable in 2022.

The Islamabad High Court upheld his appeal and cleared him in that case on Monday, but he is not expected to leave prison for now.

The former cricket star and his third wife Bushra are both serving prison sentences after a court ruled that their 2018 marriage had been un-Islamic and illegal as it came too soon after her divorce.

The couple were also found guilty of corruption over gifts received during his term as prime minister.

Even behind bars, the former cricket star remains a powerful force in Pakistani politics.
