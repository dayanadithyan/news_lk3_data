Summary so far: There are 39 Presidential hopefuls seeking the mandate from voters to rule Sri Lanka for the next five years. Since Sri Lanka is a country that had been embroiled in an unparalleled economic crisis and still struggling to recover, it is necessary to adopt a suitable policy strategy to push the economy through a high growth path to facilitate it to deliver prosperity and wellbeing to people. This requires the policymakers to give the highest priority to build an innovative or a creative economy.

In this context, the development of human knowledge will generate inventions, but those inventions should be commercially produced by entrepreneurs through a process, identified by the Austrian American economist Joseph Schumpeter as innovation. Then, to lead those innovations to continued economic advancement, as also identified by Schumpeter, the knowledge should be diffused or made known to others, and they should imitate the early innovators.

As Sri Lanka inches closer to the Presidential election on September 21, 2024, the usual buzz around political campaigns is in full swing. But there’s a strong contender that might just tip the scales in unexpected ways—social engineering! And no, we’re not talking about hackers sneaking into databases. Instead, it’s the strategic manipulation of public sentiment and behavior, a practice that’s gaining unprecedented traction in the democratic world, especially among Sri Lankan voters, with the proliferation of smartphones and social media.

Social engineering is the deliberate effort to influence attitudes and behaviors on a large scale, often through subtle and calculated messaging. It’s about crafting narratives, pushing slogans, and even spreading rumors or misinformation to steer the masses toward a particular candidate or away from others.

### Memories of the past of the photos!

*2024-08-19 16:35:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191440) · `ta`

Photos capture moments, immortalizing them for future generations. They remind us of growth and change over time, celebrating milestones like birthdays. Poet Vairamuthu's verse, "Don't carry old age, run as a child," resonates with us when viewing old photos, evoking both joyous and poignant memories. Photography, beyond being a mere hobby, is an art form that conveys photographers' talents and ideas. Its evolution, from the Daguerreotype Process in the 19th century to modern digital cameras, reflects humanity's fascination with capturing reality. Today, photography continues to play a crucial role in documenting our world, from personal snapshots to historical images like the iconic "Tank Man" photo. Recognizing the impact of photography, World Photo Day serves as a reminder of its power to convey stories and emotions, making it a vital part of our cultural heritage.

🟩

Photos are the ones that we live in and live in this world forever!

The indirect meaning that we celebrate birthdays is that one year has increased in our lives. The photos taken during the passing of years have been reminiscent of the time they have passed and keep us young.

When we look at those photos in the present, we have a refreshing thing that we will go for that time!

Poet Vairamuthu's concept poetry is "Do not carry out the old age, and run the child ..". When we look at our old photos, these lines are the ones that tap our minds. They are the treasures of the time that bring the happy moments and tragic events in our lives.

Photo is not a movie alone. It is a classic art that expresses the talent of photographers.

It is their artistic art for the famous photographers to express many ideas at the same time.

At the beginning of the 19th century, Louis Daguerre and Joseph Nicephore Niepee designed the operational method of the photo known as "Daguerreotype Process".
