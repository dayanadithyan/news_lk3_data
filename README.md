Thousands of students have been evacuated from nearly 100 schools in and around India’s capital Delhi after fake bomb threats were emailed to them.

Authorities say the threats appear to be a hoax. Nothing was found during a search of the schools, they add.

Police say they have traced the origin of the threat emails and an investigation is under way.

The federal home ministry and Delhi Police have asked people to stay calm.

Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena, the constitutional head of the state, said schools in Delhi and neighbouring suburbs that received the bomb threat have been cordoned off as search operations are being carried out.

The city’s Fire Services said they sent fire engines to the schools but found nothing during their search.

“Dog squads, and bomb disposal units are also working,” Mr Saxena told local media. “I want to assure the people of Delhi that Delhi Police is fully prepared and we will try to prevent any untoward incident from happening.”

Labour Tribunal of Kalutara, Sri Lanka has ruled that the British Broadcasting Corporation’s (BBC) decision to prematurely terminate the contract of top journalist Azzam Ameen was ‘unreasonable and unjustifiable’.

Having delivered the Order on 26th April, 2024, the Labour Tribunal also found that the actions of the BBC, particularly of the BBC’s representative Iain Haddow, were arbitrary and high-handed.

Ruling against the BBC, the Labour tribunal also ordered the British media house to pay compensation to journalist Azzam Ameen, which amounts to the equivalent of 10 months of the salary drawn by the journalist at the time of his termination of contract.

The ruling comes in connection to the case filed by Azzam Ameen on the BBC’s decision to terminate his contract over a leaked, distorted voice recording, alleged to have been a phone call with politician Ranjan Ramanayake.

Colombo, May 1 (Daily Mirror) - Following the price reduction of Lanka auto diesel from last night, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijerathne said today that this fuel price revision is insufficient for a bus fare revision at this time.

Addressing the media he said that according to the National Bus Fare Policy, the recent amount of the fuel price revision cannot be calculated.

Accordingly, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) reduced the retail price of a litre of Lanka auto diesel by Rs. 30 with effect from last night.

"During the past months, we provided the service while incurring a loss of Rs. 27 per litre of diesel. Even after the previous fuel price revision the association had taken a decision not to go for a fuel price revision as it was not even 4% of the minimum fare hike needed for a fare revision.

"According to the policy calculation, only Rs. 3 will be reduced from the bus fare, but it is not more than the minimum calculation of 4%.

The Vehicle Importers’ Association insists on the necessity of a proper regulatory framework for vehicle imports in Sri Lanka.

President of the association Indika Sampath Merinchige emphasized the need for the government to establish a committee inclusive of their association’s representatives to make decisions on this matter.

“When importing vehicles to Sri Lanka in the past few years, specifically in 2017, 2018, and 2019, 85% of the vehicles imported were used vehicles with only 15% new vehicles were imported. Out of that, 95% of the vehicles were sourced from Japan”, he added.

Today is International Workers’ Day, also known as Labour Day, which is observed annually on May 1 in Sri Lanka and the world at large.

The day, which has its origins in the labour union movement, specifically the eight-hour day movement, is a celebration of labourers and the working classes that is promoted by the international labour movement.

May 1 is observed as an ancient northern hemisphere spring festival, however, it became associated with the labour movement in the late 19th century after trade unions and socialist groups designated it as a day in support of workers.

The date was chosen to be International Workers’ Day to commemorate the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago in the US, in which a peaceful rally in support of workers led to a violent clash with the police, leading to the deaths of at least 38 civilians and 7 police officers.

While 60 police officers and 115 civilians were injured. Those who died due to the clash were hailed as “Haymarket Martyrs”.

The dynamic policies of President Premadasa came to an abrupt halt 31 years ago

As one who had the opportunity to serve as the Chairman and Director General of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission and later converted to the Board of Investment from 1991 to 1993 and prior to that as the Chairman of the People’s Bank during the period of President Premadasa, it will be appropriate for me to write about the importance to implement the economic policies of the Premadasa period to overcome the current economic crisis and achieve sustainable economic recovery on the 31st Death Anniversary of late President Premadasa. Although giving free handouts was the order of the day, Premadasa policies were able to change this concept by pushing economic development to the provinces. He did this by inviting the private sector businessmen to set up garment factories in the rural areas which provided employment and brought in the much needed foreign exchange.

Colombo, May 1 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka put up a brave effort in two weeks of training as a XV a side outfit to outclass India by 45 points (7 tries, 5 conversions) to 10 points (1 try, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) at the Racecourse ground in Colombo last night.

Sri Lanka made their intention very clear of running the three quarter line and spread the ball wide with the speedy threes. Though the first 10 minutes, Indians stood out with some good defense, hosts Sri Lanka scored three unanswered first half tries, which put the Indians on the backfoot.  India spoiled many Sri Lankan moves but the lead the hosts created with very good foundation in the first half was too much for a catch up game.

Tarinda Ratwatte, Sohiru Anthony, Adeesha Weerathunga and Mursheed Doray were omnipresent. In fact Tarinda played a major role in the initial half as Centre and then moved to fill in Thenuka Nanayakkara’s fly half berth.

Australia, May 1 (ICC) - A host of big names have missed selection as Australia announced their 15-player group for next month's ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

Veteran batter Steve Smith, young gun Jake Fraser-McGurk, experienced seamer Jason Behrendorff and all-rounder Matt Short all miss the cut as the 2021 T20 World Cup champions sprung some surprises when revealing their squad for the four-week tournament in the West Indies and the USA.

Left-arm spinner Ashton Agar wins a recall despite not having played a T20I since the last T20 World Cup on Australian soil in 2022, while Marcus Stoinis, Tim David and Cameron Green join Glenn Maxwell in the final squad as all-rounder options.

Mitchell Marsh will captain the side, with his promotion to full-time T20I confirmed by Australia alongside the squad announcement.

Selection chair George Bailey believes Australia have a well-balanced squad and is confident of a strong showing in the ninth edition of the T20 World Cup.
