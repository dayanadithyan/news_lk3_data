Due to a wasp attack, the Central Kala Fund suspended tours to Sigiriya, affecting 70 tourists. 26 foreigners and 13 locals were injured, with many leaving the hospital untreated. This is the first such incident, possibly triggered by heat and high tourist activity. Tour guides recommend protective measures against wasps to prevent future losses. The project is exploring steam spraying as a solution and plans to refund affected tourists.

ЁЯЯй

Following the target of 70 domestic and foreign tourists, the Central Kala Fund was suspended on Wednesday afternoon (14).

Sigiriya Project Manager Dusitha Herath said that hundreds of tourists have lost their chances of traveling to Sigiriya due to the danger of the wasp.

26 foreign tourists and 13 local tourists have been injured and admitted to the emergency department of Sikiriya Divisional Hospital. He also said that many people left the hospital without treatment.

The official said that this is the first time that tourists face the wasp attack and most of them are shocked by the incident.

It is believed that the nests of the wasps may have been dissolved due to the existing heat and the high advent of tourists.

Meanwhile, tour guides have suggested that steps should be taken to protect tourists without a wasp attack and that there will be a huge loss.

### Employee of the Arctic Radar site

*2024-08-14 17:11:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191098) ┬╖ `ta`

An employee at the Arctic Radar site in Nunavut, Canada, died from a rare snow bear attack, the second such incident in recent years. Snow bear populations, affected by global warming, are decreasing. Meanwhile, a black bear attack in Montana endangered a child, highlighting the danger these animals pose despite their smaller size compared to polar bears.

ЁЯЯй

An employee who worked at the Arctic Radar site in the northern Nunawat of Canada has died after being hit by two snow bears.

The attack took place on Breward Island, southeast of Bafin Island.

The deceased is working at the Nasituk Corporation, a company that operates radar security sites on behalf of the Canadian government.

In these areas, the snow bear attack on humans is rarely occurring.

тАЬThe safety and well -being of our employees is one of the main. We are very obliged to ensure a safe workshop for employees, тАЭthe company said.

This is the second incident that followed after the snow bear struck last year.

Last year, a woman and her 1 -year -old son were attacked by a bear in the village of Alaskan.

Two -thirds of the world's snow bears ie 17,000 bears in Canada. The number of snow bears is decreasing. Scientists say that the global warming is the cause of the destruction of glaciers and the destruction of places for reproduction.

### Our choice is Ranil Wickremesinghe;He is the one who bravely declares that the 13th Amendment should continue and practice it - Ali Sabri

*2024-08-14 17:06:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191086) ┬╖ `ta`

In the midst of Sri Lanka's political climate, the focus shifts towards Ranil Wickremesinghe, praised for his bravery in advocating for the continuation and implementation of the 13th Amendment, a stance considered bold amidst the pre-presidential election dynamics. Despite historical political differences, the emphasis is on addressing current challenges, particularly economic ones, rather than adhering strictly to party lines. Wickremesinghe is highlighted for his experience and potential to navigate the complexities of governance, including economic management and foreign relations. The decision by the Sri Lanka PA to field its own candidate is noted, with internal support leaning towards Wickremesinghe due to his leadership in initiating economic recovery efforts. The majority of the Sri Lanka PA's MPs have chosen Wickremesinghe, indicating a significant alignment within the party. Criticisms from Namal Rajapaksa are acknowledged as part of democratic discourse, while Wickremesinghe's suitability in fostering a common Sri Lankan identity is underscored through his track record of addressing issues affecting the common good. The upcoming election is anticipated to feature strong contenders, with the outcome to be determined by the voters on September 21st.

Ranil Wickremesinghe is brave enough that the 13th Amendment should continue and implement it. It is impossible to report this in Sri Lanka's political environment before the presidential election. External Affairs and Justice Minister Ali Sabri said that this is the most difficult issue, saying that Ranil Wickremesinghe is very relevant in our choices.

Question - What are your feelings about campaigning in favor of someone who has worked against you throughout your political life?

Answer - This is a part of politics. It is necessary to examine the current challenges and priority to the country than to be stubborn about parties and political leaders.

So what is important in this moment. Especially economics.

We must choose someone who can face these challenges. Because of this I choose him.

Question - You have consistently stated that it is the most important thing to strengthen the country's stability. Do you not think that anyone like Dhammika can help at this moment?

He further stated at a press conference held on Monday (12) at President Ranil Wickremesinghe's political office located on Loris Road, Bambalapitiya.

Anyone can criticize the programs implemented by our government. But they cannot be carried out properly. Even if the opposition parties do not support our program, they may not have been acting in disrepair.

Therefore, people should not be deceived by relying on false promises. But people are now directly aware that President Ranil Wickremesinghe's promises are fulfilled. The people of the country will not vote for the loser, not the winner of the election.

Sri Lanka's voters face an unprecedented long -standing ballot as 36 candidates have been restricted until Tuesday evening.

Two nams in this ballot have turned the ballot into a confusion.

Stopping candidates of the same name is a tactic used by Rajapaksas in the past.

Rajapaksas stopped Sirisena to confuse Maithripala Sirisena's supporters who contested the presidential election in the 2015 presidential election as the general candidate of the opposition parties.. He was seen as a look like Maithripala Sirisena.

AR Sirisena, who stopped Rajapaksakkal, received 18174 votes, though many were not disappointed by this deception.

If his name is written in C.S.
