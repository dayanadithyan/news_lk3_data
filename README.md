Colombo (News 1st) – The humble tea pluckers of Sri Lanka’s central highlands may not know it, but their world famous cuppa is at the centre of an unusual storm that is brewing between the United States and the United Kingdom.

On Wednesday (24th), the UK Cabinet Office put out an official statement, disputing the method of making tea that had been suggested by the U.S. embassy in London.

”In response, to the statement put out by the US Embassy in the UK: We appreciate our Special Relationship, however, we must disagree wholeheartedly… Tea can only be made using a kettle.” the UK Cabinet Office said on X (formerly Twitter).

Hours before, the US embassy had stated, perhaps tongue in cheek, that the proper way to brew a cuppa is “by microwaving it”.
