The state-run Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) on Thursday cut power supplies to the parliament over a debt of 23m Ghanaian cedi ($1.8m; £1.4m).

The outage interrupted a debate on the president’s State of the Nation speech.

A video shared by local media showed MPs in the dimly lit chamber chanting: “Dumsor, dumsor”, which means power outage in the local Akan language.

Local media reported that a back-up power generator restored power to the chamber a few minutes later.

But other parts of the parliament building remained without power for most of the day before supplies were restored.

MPs and parliamentary staff who were using the elevator when the abrupt blackout hit were stuck, Ghana’s TV3 channel reported.

The power company’s communications director William Boateng told Reuters news agency it had resorted to disconnecting power because of parliament’s refusal to “honour demand notices to pay up”.

The government announced an action plan to reduce corruption and undertook to ‘eliminate or restrict’ tax cuts by minister’s as part of efforts to improve governance.

Dates are an important part of the food of Sri Lanka’s Muslim community who break fast during the Ramazan period.

Dried dates are imported to Sri Lanka from the Middle East to make cake and other sweets also during the rest of the year.

Standard quality dried dates now retail for a little under 1000 rupees a kilogram.

“There is one group that is opposed to education reforms. These are revolutionaries who recently became ‘modern’. They say free education need not be modernised. They say Sri Lanka’s stagnating education must continue the way it is,” Premadasa said speaking at an event.

“Every time something new is being attempted, what do they do? They take to the streets. They go on paada yatras and hold protests.

“But did you know? The children of these big revolutionaries study at international schools,” the leader of the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) said.

Acknowledging that disparity in education is a real problem in Sri Lanka, Premadasa said that measures must be taken to address it.
