SriLankan Airlines will spread its wings across the Middle East region after acquiring more aircraft on lease this year to strengthen its fleet, its top official says.

Richard Nuttall, chief executive officer of SriLankan Airlines, said fleet modernisation plays an important in the carrier’s turnaround as well as caters to growing passengers demand in the region. He said the airline will strengthen its current fleet of 21 to 22 in July, with plans to add three more aircraft within the next three months to increase the tally to 25 aircraft this year.

“We are aiming to boost SriLankan Airlines fleet with more leased aircraft that will help increase frequency on existing routes as well as add two or three new routes. The airline will place major orders for fleet replacement after its restructuring is completed under the International Monetary Funds (IMF) programme,” Nuttall told Khaleej Times during his recent visit to Dubai.

The topics of the judiciary and its independence were a recurring theme during last week’s parliamentary sittings. Both government and opposition MPs took turns discussing various aspects of the judiciary, with some using their parliamentary privileges to criticize judges and the courts.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe led the baton charge on Tuesday morning, explaining his stance on the recent Supreme Court determination on the constitutionality of the Gender Equality Bill. Using the words “judicial cannibalism”, he found fault with the court for holding that the Bill violated the powers of Parliament under Article 4 of the Constitution and called for the appointment of a parliamentary select committee to study and make recommendations on this matter. But he did say he was not proposing summoning judges before the select committee.

“All theory is grey… But forever green is the tree of life. “Goethe (Faust)

For three months in late 1990’s, American author and political activist Barbara Ehrenreich lived the life of a low-wage worker. She wanted to discover, first hand, how President Bill Clinton’s welfare reforms were impacting on the lives of the working poor. Her experiences gave birth to her most celebrated book, Nickle and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America. In it, she focuses on the phenomenon of employed-homeless, workers who often do more than one job but are still unable to afford a roof over their heads. The conjunction of low wages and high rents create poverty traps from which few workers escape, Ehrenreich notes.

Adjudicated rapist and convicted felon Donald Trump’s pathological yearning for absolute fealty was on display at Tuesday’s Republican primary election in Virginia’s Fifth District, a deep-red Republican seat.

Popular incumbent, ultra-conservative Representative Bob Good, head of the Freedom Caucus, which includes indomitable Trump warriors like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan, was seeking a third Congressional term. In a primary where a Republican victory was a foregone conclusion in the general election, Good faced a challenge for this safe Republican seat from Republican State Senator, John J. McGuire III, also a Republican hard-liner, endorsed by Donald Trump.

### Reflecting on Poson

*2024-06-22 18:57:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/reflecting-on-poson/) · `en`

Unlike Vesak, Poson is specific to Sri Lanka and India. It celebrates the coming of Buddhism to the island through an embassy of five monks, one samanera, and one layman, led by Mahinda Thera, the son of Asoka from his second wife, Vedisa-Devi. The Dipavamsa and the  Mahavamsa are the main literary sources from this country that we have for the details of this embassy. All other accounts are variations on them.

According to these chronicles, Tissa, the second son of Mutasiva, was out on a hunt with 40,000 of his courtiers during a water festival, when he caught sight of an elk-stag (or a deer) which he proceeded to give chase to. He then pursued it to the top of Missaka Mountain, or Mihintale as it is known today, where he encountered Mahinda Thera, who preached the Dhamma to him after testing his intelligence.

It is an old truism in policy analysis that there is nothing purely ‘technical’ in policy decisions. Every policy decision has a political aspect to it. Technical analysis is necessary and useful to identify and evaluate feasible options, including the costs and benefits of each option. In the end, what is selected or rejected is a political matter based on political preferences. There is nothing wrong with that. What gets to be objectionable is when decisions are made to reach outcomes to benefit some or disbenefit someone else based on inappropriate considerations.
