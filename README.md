Mullivaikkal porridge is the strongest activity of the Mullivaikkal porridge, even when the government's restrictions and repression are being used to commemorate the Tamils-the Hostel General

Mullivaikkal Kanji plays an important role in the joint memories of Tamils living in Sri Lanka. This symbolizes the tragedy and recovery of Tamils in Sri Lanka's final war. May 2009, in the No -Fire Zone, Mullaitivu, 150,000 - 190,000 Tamils were cooked, with a series of bombshells in the region.. Made with rice, water and salt, the porridge was the lifeblood of thousands of Tamils for 15 years.. This is the symbol of the survival and coordination of a oppressed society.

Mullivaikkal porridge is the strongest activity of making and distributed even when the government's restrictions and repression are being used to commemorate the assassinated and disappeared Tamils.. It emphasizes the united social sentiment of a society, the need of tolerance and understanding.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs courts many years ago barred supermarkets from charging for plastic bags from customers after activists went to court.

However a Supreme Court ruled in March this year to overturn that.

The parliament Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development said it could not reverse the gazette issued under the Consumer Affairs Authority Act until it had received a copy of the ruling.

The committee said the ruling might prompt shoppers to bring their own bags, which would lead to a reduction in polythene waste.

### Why not meet the media?Prime Minister Narendra Modi

*2024-05-18 02:48:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183829) ¬∑ `ta`

Prime Minister Narendra Modi avoids media due to perceived bias and self-interest among journalists, preferring direct communication. He criticizes the current media landscape as lacking neutrality, contrasting it with the "faceless" media of the past. This stance reflects a shift towards a more controlled political culture, where the media's role is questioned. Political observers suggest this move could indicate uncertainty about electoral outcomes.

üü©

'' The media is currently not to work with neutrality. So there is no media meeting, ‚ÄùPrime Minister Narendra Modi explained.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi who interviewed a private television channel.. ': Why not hold a press conference for ten years in charge of the regime? ‚Äù

Currently journalists are identified with their own self -interest. The media is not neutral.

The media that needs to work neutral is not doing so today. That is why the press conference was not held.

Previously the media was faceless. Who writes?What is its policy?No one was worried about it before. The situation is not the case today.

A new political culture that focuses on the media is not worried about the activities of politics.

I have no confidence in going on this path. I can also cut the ribbon at Vigyan Bhavan. I am traveling for a small project in a small district in Jharkhand, though.

I have come up with a new job culture. Do you agree with it?Don't want?The media must decide. ‚Äù

Prediction of the results of the forthcoming Presidential election would be the most difficult one in Sri Lankan history, since almost all traditional attachments of the voters with the main political parties seem to have been shattered to the core by the economic crisis that brought millions of people to the streets in 2022.

The unprecedented economic hardships within their household and the agitations with slogans on the streets against all present and past rulers of the country for nearly four months seem to have shaped a new political mindset among the majority of people in the country.

The impact of these two factors ‚Äì the economic hardships and the Aragalaya ‚Äì has been such that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the party that bagged 52.25 percent of votes has been ranked at the bottom of some poll surveys since mid-last year, with not even 10 percent of voter preferences in favour of them. Interestingly, the SLPP has never challenged the results of such surveys either.

*2024-05-17 22:07:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Members-of-our-Parliament-and-French-Queen-Marie-Antoinette-EDITORIAL/172-282845) ¬∑ `en`

Hardly a day passes without hearing the profligacy and misdeeds of one or the other members of Parliament. Just two days ago, while strong criticism was being voiced at Members of Parliament for demanding permits to import new cars for themselves, a State Minister reportedly slapped an airport worker for demanding payment for services rendered.

Media reports inform us that many MPs across the political divide have secured liquor permits in the names of their friends and relatives. These permits we all know will subsequently be sold for huge sums of money.

According to one report, the going price per permit is around rupees fifty million. The permit is for the establishment of new liquor shops in the country.

To add insult to injury Members of Parliament are now demanding that the rupees one million insurance cover they enjoy be extended to cover their families as well.

Colombo, May 17 (Daily Mirror) - The Supreme Court today directed the petitioners to serve notices on former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa as he was not represented by a counsel in connection with five fundamental rights petitions.

When the five Fundamental Rights petitions challenging former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa‚Äôs decision to grant a presidential pardon to ex-soldier Sunil Ratnayake, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the Mirusuvil murder case, were taken up for argument, neither Gotabaya Rajapaksa nor a lawyer represented him.

Supreme Court two-judge-bench comprising Justices Yasantha Kodagoda and Achala Wengappuli further directed the petitioners to serve notices on Sunil Ratnayake, a respondent in the petitions as he was also not represented by a lawyer. These petitions are to be taken up for argument on September 4.

The Supreme Court has already granted leave to proceed with these petitions in terms of Article 12(1) of the constitution (Right of equality).
