*2024-04-08 17:56:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Lower-prices-in-fireworks-this-festive-season/108-280401) · `en`

Colombo, April 8 (Daily Mirror) - There is a higher demand for fireworks this year than in the previous festive seasons, but there is less demand for several firework items, All-Island Fireworks Manufacturers Association (AIFMA) President Dinesh Fernando said.

Addressing the media, he said the distribution process of all types of fireworks has started around the country to meet the needs of the people.

The manufacturing of fireworks did not take place at 100% in the previous years due to the financial crisis in the country, Fernando said.

"There is a shortage of several fireworks, such as whistling rockets and whistling spinners, in the local market. The price of the ingredients for the making of fireworks has decreased by 30 percent this year when compared with previous years," he said.

Accordingly, the fireworks price in the local market shows a lower budget, Fernando said.

### Sri Lanka Hones Its Balancing Act

*2024-04-08 13:20:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sri-lanka-hones-its-balancing-act/) · `en`

Colombo has demonstrated its own brand of strategic autonomy on issues from Russia’s war in Ukraine to China’s global footprint

Most South Asian governments tend to have nonaligned foreign policies, balancing their relations with major powers. This maximizes their diplomatic flexibility and ability to operate independently on the world stage, also known as strategic autonomy. India and Pakistan are two prominent examples: They both balance their relations with the United States and at least one of its core rivals (Russia and China, respectively).

But it’s important not to overlook Sri Lanka: In the last two years, Colombo has quietly and successfully navigated global conflict and great-power rivalry. Like many other countries in the region, Sri Lanka has not condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine, even though resulting price shocks exacerbated its own economic crisis in 2022. Yet it has called for an end to the war and announced new measures that step up economic and energy ties with India.

Colombo, April 8 (Daily Mirror) - United Republican Front (URF) leader Patali Champika Ranawaka said Sri Lanka defaulted on a payment of USD 6 billion starting from April 2022 when the country announced bankruptcy.

He said this was the reality though the Central Bank data show the increase of foreign reserves to USD 5 billion.

"While CBSL data shows Sri Lanka's foreign reserves reaching USD 5 billion, it is imperative to understand that from April 2022, the sum of defaulted debt is approximately USD 6 billion. The sum of loans obtained since the default from the World Bank, ADB, and IMF is USD 3 billion," he posted on X.
