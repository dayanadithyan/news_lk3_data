### Bangladesh mocks Sri Lanka after series defeat

*2024-03-19 20:19:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Bangladesh-mocks-Sri-Lanka-after-series-defeat/108-279171) · `en`

Mar. 19 (Daily Mirror) - Bangladesh clinched the third ODI against Sri Lanka by four wickets to secure a 2-1 series win on Monday (18) which was followed up by a celebration from their veteran wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim who brought his helmet as they were lining up to pose for the post-match photograph adding more fuel to the fire.

At the conclusion of the T20 series, Sri Lanka team brought out the 'timed-out' celebration which appeared to upset Bangladesh captain Najmul Shanto who claimed that the Islanders needed to move on from it, but on Monday Rahim probably made him eat his words when he went as far as taking his helmet to take the photographs after post-match presentation.

It doesn't look like either team is going to move on from the 'timed-out' celebration anytime soon as an unlikely rivalry is growing strong between a team that has won two ICC World Cups and played in six World Cup Finals, against a team that is yet to play ICC World Cup semi-final.

(CNN) - The world’s oceans have now experienced an entire year of unprecedented heat, with a new temperature record broken every day, new data shows.

Global ocean surface temperatures started breaking daily records in mid-March last year, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, fueling concerns for marine life and extreme weather across the planet.

“The amplitude by which previous sea surface temperature records were beaten in 2023, and now again in 2024, is remarkable,” said Joel Hirschi, associate head of marine systems modeling at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK.

Global average ocean temperatures in 2023 were 0.25 degrees Celsius warmer than the previous year, said Gregory C. Johnson, a NOAA oceanographer. That rise is “is equivalent to about two decades’ worth of warming in a single year,” he told CNN. “So it is quite large, quite significant, and a bit surprising.”

### No confidence motion against Sri Lanka Speaker taken up in parliament

ECONOMYNEXT – Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena had ignored opposition protests and a Supreme Court ruling when passing the Online Safety Bill, chief opposition whip Lakshman Kiriella charged in parliament.

Kiriella’s party, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), took up its no-confidence motion against the speaker on Tuesday.

Clauses that required a two thirds majority if they were not amended as per the Supreme Court ruling, were passed by a simple majority without the amends, Kiriella claimed. “He ignored calls for a division and approved the third reading without a vote.”

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the opposition had not studied the approved Bill carefully, as it would become evident that the changes found to be in violation of clause 12.1 of the Constitution had been amended or removed altogether.

“4 of the 9 charges you make have one shortcoming, pertaining to repeat offenders, which has been amended by the Attorney General and sent to be gazetted,” Rajapaksa said.
