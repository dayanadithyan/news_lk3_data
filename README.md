Sahran's policy may still be in the country, with 5,000 people following his principles. Abe Janapala questions if anyone fights against the IS system. Current religious leaders suggest Sahran's group is a maneuver for Gotabhaya Rajapakse. Rajapakse's political mistakes are separate, but if this is an attempt to smear him, it's seen as a conspiracy. 95% of MPs haven't read the Commission of Inquiry report. Maithripala Sirisena claims India was involved in the Sunday Attack, but international contacts are implied.

Currently responsible religious leaders say that the group, including Sahran, is a maneuver for Gotabhaya Rajapakse to take over to this.

Gotabhaya Rajapakse's political mistakes are a different story. But if this is an attempt to call Gotabhaya Rajapakse a maneuver, it should be seen as a conspiracy to cover up these issues.. It is not acceptable that he was aware of this.

Meanwhile, 95 percent of the MPs would not have read the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Sunday Attack.. You have to see who witnessed the Commission.

The court remanded him in custody for two months and said Ivanov entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties to receive property and services while working for the ministry of defense.

Ivanov, deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages.

The defense ministry, whose spending has spiraled since the start of the war, has made no comment.

As the right hand man of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, IvanovтАЩs detention is the highest profile corruption case since Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had been informed, and Shoigu had also been told.

Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defense officials chaired by Shoigu.

Argentina has asked Interpol to arrest IranтАЩs interior minister over the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people, the foreign ministry said Tuesday.

The Iranian minister, Ahmad Vahidi, is part of a delegation from Tehran currently visiting Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and Interpol has issued a red alert seeking his arrest at the request of Argentina, the ministry said in a statement.

Argentina has also asked those two governments to arrest Vahidi, it added.

On April 12, a court in Argentina placed blame on Iran for the 1994 attack against the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires and for a bombing two years earlier against the Israeli embassy, which killed 29 people.

The 1994 assault has never been claimed or solved, but Argentina and Israel have long suspected the Iran-backed group Hezbollah carried it out at IranтАЩs request.

Prosecutors have charged top Iranian officials with ordering the attack, though Tehran has denied any involvement.
