Presidential hopeful Janaka Ratnayake speaking to the media outside the ECSL said he has requested the ECSL to stop the debate from going ahead.

‚ÄúSelecting six candidates while excluding 33 others is unjust to those left out. The chosen six will receive unnecessary promotion through the event, which will also gain extensive media coverage,‚Äù he said.

Ratnayake said his group voiced their opposition to the debate and urged the ECSL to prevent the event from taking place. Ratnayake said if action is not taken, he will seek legal redress by filing a petition before the Supreme Court.

### Ranil Wickremesinghe's election symbol is illegal -Vijayadasa Rajapaksa

*2024-08-21 01:01:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191573) ¬∑ `ta`

Vijayadasa Rajapaksa criticizes the Election Commission for assigning an election symbol to a committee during ongoing local government elections, arguing it's premature and undermines public trust in the commission's ability to manage elections efficiently.

üü©

It is illegal to give the election symbol to a committee in the presidential election as the local government elections are not yet over.. However, the National Democratic Front's presidential candidate Vijayadasa Rajapakse said that the Election Commission has done so.

He was speaking at a press conference held at his election office in Colombo on Tuesday (20).

Elections have begun as the nomination has been filed for the local government elections. But the election has not ended yet. In this backdrop, the Election Commission has given a gas cylinder election to a group contesting the local government elections.. This is illegal.

At the same time, if the local government elections are over, there is nothing wrong with providing the election symbol to the election panel to the other election.. Local government elections were initiated, though. But not ending. That is why we say that the election symbol given to a group cannot be given to a different candidate.

Since the day nominations were accepted for the presidential election, the atmosphere has intensified progressively. Even months before the election date was set, the National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) began its campaign with a meticulously planned strategy, positioning itself ahead in the early stages. However, as other candidates entered the race, the competition has grown increasingly fierce. The current president, who started the race with minimal public support, has made considerable progress according to reports. Meanwhile, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has managed to pose a strong challenge to the NPP, forming a broad multiethnic coalition. Despite this, most surveys indicate that a majority of voters are still undecided, making the upcoming weeks crucial for securing victory.

In a true democracy, the selection of candidates and the election process should involve the entire population equally. Unfortunately, our current election rules allow only a select few to become candidates without requiring any public endorsement, such as a stepwise regional election process within the party. Our system favours existing politicians and makes it virtually impossible to register a political party to address specific issues. It is a significant obstacle to a fair and inclusive democratic process. Despite the wishes expressed by the ordinary people during ‚ÄòAragalaya 2022,‚Äô we are left with mostly the same 225 candidates to choose from once again, a situation that should concern us all.
