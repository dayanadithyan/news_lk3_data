### The president's inherent involvement is essential for reconciliation

*2024-05-21 12:45:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184129) ┬╖ `ta`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe aims to resolve Sri Lanka's economic crisis and address ethnic issues, promising self-governance and economic reforms. His policies, including tax relief and privatization, face opposition but could secure his reelection. Despite commitments to reconciliation, recent police actions against Tamil memorials and student protests indicate ongoing tensions rather than progress towards peace. International scrutiny, including calls for apologies and investigations into human rights abuses, further complicates the situation. Wickremesinghe's tenure ends with unresolved questions about his ability to lead Sri Lanka towards lasting reconciliation and economic stability.

ЁЯЯй

Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that he was elected as the president and that Sri Lanka was to restore Sri Lanka from its economic crisis and that he would work for the self -government to fulfill that obligation.. Thus, before the economic success, there were great speculations about the President's objectives on holding the presidential election.

Through his commitment to the president's faith in resolving the economic crisis, the truth of his claims can be found in the vigilant and unwavering economic policies of the people.. The president is relaxing in the imposition of high taxes beyond the limits of the people and the privatization of state institutions that are strongly opposed by most employees.

Both policies are so influential that he can be re -elected president in the upcoming presidential election.. But he stands firmly in them with great confidence.

May 21 (BBC) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has angrily condemned the International Criminal Court's prosecutor for seeking arrest warrants for him alongside Hamas's leaders over alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict.

Mr Netanyahu said he rejected with disgust that "democratic Israel" had been compared with what he called "mass murderers".

Mr Netanyahu's comments have been echoed by US President Joe Biden, who said there was no equivalence between Israel and Hamas.

The chief ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Netanyahu and his Defence Minister Yoav Gallant bore criminal responsibility for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

The ICC is also seeking a warrant for Hamas's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, for war crimes.

Israel and the US, its key ally, are not members of the ICC, which was set up in 2002.

Let us first notice what literacy is in any field. Literacy. In addition, this includes the ability to use this knowledge in practical or appropriate environments.

Since we are paying attention to public legal literacy at the grassroots level of Sri Lanka, it is important to clearly define what is general legal literacy.

Moreover, public legal literacy is helping people to identify legal issues, understand their legal rights and take appropriate action to solve legal issues.
