There are a few leading jewellery business operators involved in this racket, according to information available. It is learnt that these business operators have continued to bring gold from India through unlawful means for a long time denying tax revenue to the government.

Daily Mirror learns that there is a sinister move involving some customs officials to underestimate the value of gold stock seized for dubious transactions at the moment. The customs authorities suspect that gold items have been smuggled in boats from India and payments have been made through unlawful methods.

### Kabosu, the face of cryptocurrency Dogecoin, dies at 18, owner says

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kabosu, the Japanese dog that became a global meme and the face of alternative cryptocurrency Dogecoin has died at 18, her owner announced in a blog post on Friday.

The Japanese Shiba Inu passed away while sleeping, her owner Atsuko Sato wrote.

Kabosu became recognizable as the face of Dogecoin, an alternative cryptocurrency that began as a satirical critique of the 2013 crypto frenzy.

But the token jumped in value after Tesla boss Elon Musk, a proponent of cryptocurrencies, began tweeting about it in 2020. Since then the billionaire has repeatedly promoted the coin.

Dogecoin added as much as $4 billion to its market value last year when the billionaire, who bought social media site Twitter in 2022, briefly replaced Twitter's blue bird logo with an image of Kabosu. Musk subsequently renamed Twitter X.

With a market capitalization of around $23.6 billion, Dogecoin is now the ninth biggest cryptocurrency, according to data site Coingecko.com.

### Did you know these issues about Buddhism in Indonesia?

*2024-05-25 03:39:38* ¬∑ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/cxwwnp77m87o) ¬∑ `si`

It seems like you've shared a detailed narrative about the evolution of Buddhism in Indonesia, particularly focusing on the influence of Ashin Thera and the development of a unique Buddhist tradition that incorporates elements of Indonesian multiculturalism and language. This narrative touches upon the historical context of Buddhism in Indonesia, including its interaction with the government, the rise of Christianity among certain groups, and the adaptation of Buddhism to fit local cultures.



If you have specific questions or need further clarification on any part of this narrative, feel free to ask

üü©

The various teachings of Buddhism, including theravada and wita, is spreading throughout the entire Indonesia today. How did it break into different traditions after it began?

One day at the school phase I went to the house of a friend located in the southern part of Jakarta. Like me, this friend is also a Chinese origin. The difference is that he is a Christian and is a Buddhist.

After I wanted to return home, I came to his mother, and she came to my gate.

There she briefly replied with me: "What church are you going?"

Back to her again I have answered "yes" before she left.

For more than 15 years, for more than 15 years, I have been unrest that I was saying that "still Buddhist" on the same day.

Her motive was not bad. She said it was by a normal tone and not to ridicule.

However, when I think of the statement, I said, "So what have I been in a Buddhist?"I question me that I am.

My family is followers of Trotic Policies and is literally, "three teachings of truth".

Politics and economics are concepts that are fundamentally intertwined. Yet the unprecedented economic crisis of 2022 highlighted the complex challenges of aligning short-term political goals with long-term economic strategies.

While the sharp appreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee in recent months has been roundly welcomed by most sectors of society as a positive signal, this optimism overlooks the nuanced factors influencing our currency‚Äôs strength and the medium-long-term challenges that could arise from volatile fluctuations in the price of the rupee.

While a stronger rupee certainly promises cheaper imports of essentials like petroleum, electricity, food medicine and other essentials in the short term, as a nation that is surviving on borrowed time and foreign currency, we cannot afford to ignore the other side of the equation ‚Äì exports.

Each year in April, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) marks its first armed insurrection against the government in 1971, as ‚ÄòApril Heroes‚Äô Commemoration Day. The second JVP insurrection is memorialised by way of the ‚ÄòNovember Heroes‚Äô commemoration marking the death of JVP founder and leader Rohana Wijeweera in 1989.

Wijeweera led two rebellions, one in 1971 and a second in 1989. Thousands of young Sinhalese men and women died in the two insurgencies led by the then-JVP leader. In those dark days, civilians were involuntarily disappeared by state forces, while the JVP too killed many civilians.

The ‚ÄòMothers of the Disappeared‚Äô was a coming together of female Sinhalese, who lost relatives during the JVP insurrections to government forces. They came together under a common umbrella to demand information as to what had happened to their sons, daughters, husbands and wives.

As the monsoonal rains are set to wreak havoc and a climate emergency is in the making, the government had other pressing priorities.

May 24 (BBC) - The UN's top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), has issued a dramatic ruling, ordering Israel to "immediately halt its military offensive in Rafah".

It acted in support of a South African application last week which sought a number of measures against Israel, accusing it of stepping up what it says is a genocide.

Presiding judge Nawaf Salam said the situation in Gaza had deteriorated since the court last ordered Israel to take steps to improve it.

Israel has vehemently denied the allegation and signalled it would ignore any order to halt its operation.

Reading the court's ruling on Friday, Nawaf Salam said "Israel must immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate" which could bring about "the physical destruction" of the Palestinians - alluding to what constitutes genocide under international law.

Israel, he added, must also allow unimpeded access to Gaza to any UN body investigating allegations of genocide.

Colombo, May 24 (Daily Mirror) - Over 300,000 power disruption incidents were reported during the past few days with more than 30,000 occurring within a single hour on some days, the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers' Union (CEBEU) said.

While issuing a media release they said they had experienced significant delays in restoring power outages caused by recent severe weather conditions.

The CEBEU has expressed regret over these delays, attributing them to the limited number of technical staff available to address the issues.

Additionally, the high volume of calls has overwhelmed CEB telephone operators, leading to many calls from consumers going unanswered.

The union has urged the public to exercise patience and caution, advising them not to touch any live wires during outages, while the technical teams work to restore power as quickly as possible.

### Two Sri Lankan students in Japan accused of illegal abortion

*2024-05-24 15:43:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Two-Sri-Lankan-students-in-Japan-accused-of-illegal-abortion/108-283302) ¬∑ `en`

(This story has originally been reported by Japanese media 'The Mainichi')

MITO -- Two Sri Lankan students in Japan were arrested over an illegal abortion, and an expert points out that international students' unstable resident status may be a factor behind the incident.

Ibaraki Prefectural Police on May 23 announced the arrests of Rubasing Liyanage Udeshika Ayomi Jayalath of Toride, Ibaraki Prefecture, for allegedly aborting her baby when she was about nine months pregnant, and her boyfriend Munasingha Sudesh Dilshan De Soysa of Utsunomiya in the neighboring prefecture of Tochigi, for allegedly aiding the abortion.

According to the police, Jayalath used a drug to abort her baby at De Soysa's home around April 29. The suspects, both 30, have admitted to the allegations. Jayalath had visited an obstetrician in Tochigi Prefecture in late March to ask for an abortion, but the doctor refused as she was beyond the period allowed for an abortion under Japan's Maternal Health Act.

### Scientists find Earth-like planet that could be home to alien life

*2024-05-24 15:35:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Scientists-find-Earth-like-planet-that-could-be-home-to-alien-life/108-283301) ¬∑ `en`

May 24 - Scientists have found a new Earth-like planet that could support alien life ‚Äì just 40 light-years away.

The planet is a remarkable discovery in the search for habitable worlds: it is slightly smaller than the Earth, and thought to be just a little hotter. Many planets outside our solar system, called exoplanets, tend to be much larger and hotter than our own world.

The newly discovered planet is called Gliese 12b and researchers say that even if we cannot find whether it is home to alien life then it will help in our search for other worlds that might be.

The planet planet orbits its host star every 12.8 days, and is comparable in size to Venus - so slightly smaller than Earth.

It has an estimated surface temperature of 42C, which is lower than most of the 5,000-odd exoplanets (planets outside of the solar system) confirmed so far.
