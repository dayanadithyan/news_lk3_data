The people of the hill country are suffering from various hardships and are suffering from a salary for corruption. While the salary increase of these people is legally published in the gazette notification, the power to oppose it is surprising.

If the court goes against the salary hike in the hill people who are carrying the country's economy as a backbone, it is understood that the plantation companies are in a state of disrepair.

Plantation Company owners if you don't change we will change you ‚Äù. Meanwhile, we are also telling the government that we will change the livelihood of the plantation people immediately.
