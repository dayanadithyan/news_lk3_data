New York, June 11 (BBC) - Heinrich Klaasen hit a vital 46 as South Africa claimed a nervy four-run victory over Bangladesh that put them on the brink of securing a place in the T20 World Cup Super 8s.

A combination of the pitch, poor shot selection and good bowling from Bangladesh saw South Africa teetering on 23-4 after they won the toss, as Tanzim Hasan Sakib snaffled 3-18.

Klaasen hit three fours and two sixes in his 44-ball innings as he shared a 79-run partnership with the dependable David Miller to help South Africa recover to compile a defendable 113-6.

Bangladesh made a decent fist of the run chase and at 94-4 with three overs remaining were probably slight favourites.

However, when Kagiso Rabada took the key wicket of Towhid Hridoy for 37 the momentum swung back to the Proteas.

### Rise in flies poses risk of diarrhoea and contagious viral fever

Colombo, June 11 (Daily Mirror) - As floodwaters recede, the proliferation of flies has raised alarms among health authorities due to the increased risk of diarrhoea outbreaks and the spread of contagious viral fevers.

According to consultant Dr Deepal Perera, the abundance of organic matter in flooded areas accelerates the maturation of fly eggs, leading to a rapid increase in fly populations as floodwaters subside. These newly hatched flies, seeking food sources, often gravitate towards faeces, garbage, and contaminated surfaces, further exacerbating the health crisis.

тАЬThe consequences of the surge in fly populations are dire. Flies are notorious carriers of pathogens, including bacteria and viruses responsible for diarrheal diseases and viral fevers,тАЭ he pointed out.

тАЬContaminated food and water sources, when ingested, can lead to a range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, cramps, nausea (feeling an urge to vomit), and loose stools,тАЭ Dr Perera stated.

тАЬThe era of widespread mass attacks by encryptors on both individuals and businesses is gradually fading away. Instead, we are witnessing a shift towards organised groups that execute hacks involving data theft and encryption, commonly referred to as double extortion.

The rationale behind this evolution lies in the perpetratorsтАЩ ability to operate with greater efficiency, thereby enabling them to demand significantly higher ransom sums,тАЭ said┬а Fedor Sinitsyn, Lead Malware Analyst at Kaspersky.

### Sri Lanka should separate foreign policies from borrowing policies: Dr. Devarajan

A prominent economist stressed the need for Sri Lanka to separate its foreign policies from the borrowing policies, so it does not repeat the same mistakes that have resulted in it having to grapple with high cost of debt.

Citing the governmentтАЩs decision in 2019 to reject the favourable loans from the US and Japan, to choose commercial loans from China, due to the countryтАЩs lenient stance over Sri LankaтАЩs human rights issue, former World Bank Acting Chief Dr. Shanta Devarajan noted the move was detrimental and added to the woes of the country.

тАЬI think this was a big mistake because it mixed up the foreign policy objectives with the economic policy objectives. You always borrow from the cheapest lender, regardless of what your foreign relations are with that country. So, Sri Lanka should keep its borrowing policy separate from its foreign policy,тАЭ asserted Dr. Devarajan.

He added that some say it is impossible to make the separation but it is possible, as in the case of Taiwan and China.

*2024-06-11 00:42:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185791) ┬╖ `ta`

South Africa advanced to the Super 8 round in the 9th T20 World Cup by defeating Bangladesh by 4 runs in a closely contested match at the New York Nasav Kandri International Stadium. Despite a challenging start where they lost six wickets and managed only 113 runs, Henry Glassen and David Miller's partnership of 79 runs revived South Africa's innings. In response, Bangladesh also struggled, losing seven wickets for 109 runs, with Tauhid Ritoy's 37 runs being a highlight. Keshav Maharaj's bowling performance, taking three wickets across four overs, sealed South Africa's victory.

South Africa won by 4 runs in the T20 World Cup for the D Group, which was completed shortly before the New York Nasav Kandri International Stadium between South Africa and Bangladesh.

With this victory, South Africa has increased the chance of playing the Super 8 round in the 9th T20 World Cup.

It is worth noting that the two -day teams have failed the second team with the target of a very low total number.

Pakistan lost by 6 runs in response to 120 runs in the same stadium against India.

South Africa became the pride of the team that retained very little total number in the T20 World Cup after winning with Bangladesh. Earlier, India's 119 runs were the smallest number.

South Africa decided to bat first, which gave them difficulty again, losing six wickets in 20 overs and scoring only 113 runs.

In the match against the Netherlands, the total number of South Africa's leading quarries was 23 runs in the 5th over.

### India voted emphatically for political, social, and economic inclusion, for a more consultative government, and for the sanctity of the Constitution.

*2024-06-11 00:36:00* ┬╖ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84178) ┬╖ `en`

Emphatic. An election result that throws up no outright winners would not be normally described as that. But this was no normal election. It was an election for the democratic heart and soul of India. And, in this sense, the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha election, which left the BJP with less than a majority, were emphatic.

An emphatic rejection of Prime Minister Narendra ModiтАЩs creeping authoritarianism, his and Home Minister Amit ShahтАЩs two-man regime, and their divisive politics, anti-federal tendencies, and idea of тАЬdevelopmentтАЭ that lined the pockets of crony capitalists without improving the lives of the common people. An emphatic vote for political, social, and economic inclusion, for a more consultative government, and for the sanctity of the Constitution and the guarantees and protections written into it for all citizens.

### Presidential pardons shouldnтАЩt encourage impunity - EDITORIAL

*2024-06-11 00:31:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Presidential-pardons-shouldnt-encourage-impunity-EDITORIAL/172-284557) ┬╖ `en`

The Supreme CourtтАЩs June 6 reversal of the order of President Maithripala Sirisena to grant a pardon to Jude Shramantha Jayamaha, who was sentenced to death over the Royal Park murder incident on July 1, 2005, was the second such action by the apex court within the last six months.

The court on January 17 quashed the clemency given by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva who had been on death row over the murder of former Presidential Advisor Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8, 2011.

Both rulings by the Supreme Court to quash the capital punishment given to Duminda Silva and Jude Shramantha Jayamaha were based on technicalities - meaning the President had failed to adhere to the proper legal procedures in granting the special Presidential Pardon.

Benefits outweigh drawbacks and external finance will not be a problem

Having taken a firm decision to include nuclear energy in its mix of energy sources, Sri Lanka is now well on the way to harnessing it. Literature on the subject shows that the benefits of going for nuclear energy outweigh the drawbacks, and external finance will not be a problem.

The Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board (SLAEB) Chairman Prof. Rexy Denzil Rosa has said that Sri Lanka has identified nuclear energy as a clean and green energy source to fulfil future electricity demand. In March 2024, the Sri Lankan Cabinet committed the country to a nuclear power programme.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says that Sri Lanka is pursuing nuclear power to increase its low carbon power production, tackle climate change and increase energy security.

Colombo, June 10 (Daily Mirror) - In a landmark judgment, the Colombo District Court held that a foreign decree of a marriage contracted in Sri Lanka can be recognized and enforced in Sri Lanka.

Colombo District Court Judge R.A.M. Rajapakse delivered this judgment in favour of the plaintiff, facilitating him in obtaining a single status certificate.

This case centers around the marriage of two Sri Lankan nationals, which was legally recognized in Sri Lanka.
