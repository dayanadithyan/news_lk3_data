The Sri Lankan Government has granted entry to a US research ship for replenishment purposes alone.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed that while the ship was denied permission to conduct research activities, it was allowed entry for replenishment purposes.

Earlier reports indicated that the Sri Lankan Government declined a request for a research vessel to access Sri Lankan waters, consistent with its policy against permitting research ships in its maritime territory. The vessel, which included students from a US university, specifically sought permission to enter Sri Lankan waters solely for logistical support, including fuel, water purification, and food.

In December of last year, Sri Lanka suspended the entry of foreign research vessels due to significant security concerns raised by neighbouring India and the United States, particularly following the visits of two Chinese research ships within 14 months.

In November, the UN Secretary- General called Israel‚Äôs retaliation¬† (including cutting off food, aid and water supply to Gaza) a genocidal¬† action, and¬† was heavily condemned by Israel and pro-Israeli lobbies¬† across Europe and the US.

When Israel launched a massive bombardment of the Gaza Strip in retaliation to the Hamas cross-border attack on Oct 7, 2023, I had divided sympathies, especially in view of the atrocities committed by Hamas fighters inside Israel that day.

These divided sympathies stemmed from the fact that I began my journalism career in Amman, Jordan, a step away from Jerusalem, the West Bank and Israel. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon to drive out Yasser Arafat‚Äôs Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) began when I was a young reporter and sub-editor at the Jordan Times. I quite understand what the Palestinians have been going through ever since the formation of Israel as a Jewish State in 1948.

### May Day and the plight of Lankan workers - EDITORIAL

*2024-04-29 00:03:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/May-Day-and-the-plight-of-Lankan-workers-EDITORIAL/172-281513) ¬∑ `en`

This Wednesday is May Day, a day set apart to commemorate the struggles and gains made by workers and labour movements the world over. Very sadly, in our country, workers‚Äô day has been usurped by political parties and gains lost to economic woes.

Today, workers dance and parade the streets, not to regain their lost rights of the past four to five years. They will carry forward campaigns of diverse political parties hoping to grab power at the yet undeclared elections expected to be held later this year.

The average monthly household income of the poorest 20% of our population is Rs. 17,572, raised from a meager Rs. 12,500 in March this year. But multiple energy price increases and sales tax hikes in January raised the cost of living and hit wage earners hard.

What is being bargained is much less than the relief of $ 14 billion expected through debt restructuring. While noting that it is not a relief for Sri Lanka, the Government‚Äôs initiative to reach some agreement with them should be commended.

The move startled dealers who have been offering their used vans at astronomical prices.

The price of a 13-seater automatic HiAce was listed at an all-inclusive price of 16 million rupees, nearly half the 32.5 million rupees asking price of a five-year-old HiAce that had travelled 48,000 kilometres, advertised in recent days.

### Sri Lanka to pay 13.0-pct return to EPF holders for 2023: Minister

*2024-04-28 20:56:00* ¬∑ [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-pay-13-0-pct-return-to-epf-holders-for-2023-minister-160367/) ¬∑ `en`

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs state-managed Employees Provident Fund will pay a 13 percent return to its member in 2023, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has said.

The government has decided to pay the return from the earnings the fund made in 2023, he said.

It was higher than the 9.0 percent return the EPF had paid in recent years, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

Sri Lanka re-structured the debt of the EPF, extending maturities and initially raising the coupon the 12 percent, after the central bank busted the currency from 200 to 370 destroying its real value and pushing inflation to 70 percent.

However, over the past year, the central bank has appreciated the currency, recouping the fund some of its losses.
