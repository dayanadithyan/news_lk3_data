### 41 years ago, the Sinhala Buddhist chauvinist policies responsible for the Black July are the cause of the military occupation of today- Pearl.

*2024-07-24 12:11:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189249) · `ta`

In 1983, the Sinhala Buddhist majority's policies sparked the Black July massacre, leading to ongoing military occupation and economic exclusion of Tamils in Sri Lanka. The event, commemorated by the Pearl Organization alongside global Tamils, highlights the enduring impact of Sinhalaism on Tamil rights and safety. Despite calls for reconciliation and accountability, including at the UN Human Rights Council, little has changed for Tamils, who face continued marginalization and lack of justice. The organization advocates for international support and self-determination for the Tamil people.

🟩

The Sri Lankan government has said that the same Sinhala Buddhist majority policy is due to the Sri Lankan government's land grabbing military occupation and economically exclusion, the same Sinhala Buddhist policy that has led to the riots.

To commemorate the 41st anniversary of the Black July, the Pearl Organization is joining Tamils ​​around the world to commemorate the victims of the planned massacre against Tamils ​​today.

Moreover, Sinhalaism, which is responsible for violence, is trying to investigate how to influence the current events, as well as the Tamil nation.

After the independence of 1948, Sinhala Buddhist chauvinism was rapidly rooted in the structure of Sri Lanka.

The abolition of the rights of Tamils ​​and national communal rhetoric led to many anti -Tamil massacres.

Black July is one of the most ruthless horrible massacre that took place before the war.

The issue is centred on the controversy over the term of office of the President and the period of continuity of the Parliament once elected.

Already two parties have gone before the Supreme Court invoking determination on the consistency with the Constitution of repealing and replacing Article 30, under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, certified on 15 May, 2015.

Leaving the argumentation part to the more qualified legal profession I intend to set out below the issues concerning the matter about which there is a growing strong dispute debated in public and the media.
