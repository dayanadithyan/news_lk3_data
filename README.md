*2024-06-17 04:01:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/adani-wind-farms-in-mannar-and-procedural-challenges-in-swiss-auction/) · `en`

India’s Adani Group, which has committed SL’s single largest FDI in the power sector by committing to invest over a billion dollars in setting up ~500MW wind projects in Mannar and Pooneryn region, is facing resistance from a lobby group. The reason is unclear, says Vinayak Maheswaran – an equity and economic analyst at an equity markets platform who was also a former analyst at Wells Fargo Advisors.

“Initially they said the project harms the environment. This when the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) was done by a renowned professor and the government promised to implement the suggestions made in it and by public to minimize environmental impact. Several other Renewable Energy Organizations, Climate Organizations, environment organisations like the National Environment Caucus, Youth for Renewable Energy Organization, Sri Lanka Blue Green Alliance too conducted their own studies and have decided to back the project.”

### It is difficult to reduce the model

*2024-06-17 01:33:03* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/குறைப்பது-கடினம்/175-338997) · `ta`

Despite global lubricant price drops, immediate fuel price reductions in Sri Lanka are challenging due to the country's reliance on imported and refined fuel, influenced by international market prices, particularly from Singapore. About 35% of Sri Lanka's fuel demand is met through imports. While the cost of lubricant oil has decreased significantly since last September, affecting overall fuel prices, the situation remains complex.

🟩

The Ministry of Power and Energy has said that despite the decline in lubricant prices in the world market, it is difficult to reduce the prices of fuels in the country immediately.

According to the government -approved purchases, fuel prices should be carried out in Sri Lanka.

The refined fuel is imported according to the Singapore Business Index. Accordingly, the secretary also stated that fuel supply should be supplied in Sri Lanka in accordance with the prices that are determined there.

Sulakshana Jayawardena also said that about 35 per cent of the country's total demand is imported and refined, and that the prices of refined fuel in accordance with world market prices cannot be corrected.

However, Professor Vasantha Attukorala of the Economics University of Peradeniya University said that the price of lubricant oil fell by 27 per cent compared to last September.

An Asian elephant in central Thailand has given birth to a rare set of twins, in what caretakers have described as a miracle.

The mother, 36-year-old Chamchuri, was not expected to deliver twins and when she gave birth to a male calf last Friday, staff at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal, had thought the delivery was done.

But while cleaning up the first calf and helping it stand on its feet, they heard a loud thud and realised that Chamchuri had given birth to a second calf, a female.

The second birth sent the mother into a panic and caretakers had to restrain her to prevent her from stepping on the female calf. One caretaker was hurt in the melee.

Dramatic footage on social media showed a crowd of caretakers – known locally as mahouts – frantically separating the female calf from the mother, with blood from the birth still visible on her hind legs.

### Govt to introduce imputed rental income tax due to failure to implement property tax?

Wasantha Athukorala, a professor in the Department of Economics and Statistics at the University of Peradeniya, alleges that the government is working to introduce an imputed rental income tax, as the government failed to prepare plans for the implementation of a property tax by April 2025, as proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Furthermore, Prof. Athukorala expressed that if a property tax is implemented in the country, all ill-gotten gains will be exposed.

It was announced that Sri Lanka will likely introduce an imputed rental income tax, as part of the ongoing revenue mobilization efforts. The new tax comes as a substitute for the property tax, as the introduction of the property tax and the gift and inheritance tax by 2025 encountered delays, due to constitutional restrictions on sharing revenues between the central and local authorities and the lack of adequate information on property values.

### HOW NOT TO RUN AN ELECTION (1956)

*2024-06-16 11:29:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/how-not-to-run-an-election-1956/) · `en`

As a Returning Officer, I played only second fiddle to the Government Agent, who was actually in charge of the Parliamentary Elections at the district level. However I was given definite duties: first, for staffing the polling booths with government staff officers; second, for supervising the actual process of elections in the polling booths; and third, for counting the ballots once the voting was done.

My first job was difficult because many Sinhalese officers in those days were reluctant to come so far to a Tamil-speaking district. This was long before the Tigers became the major political or military force in those districts. I was able to overcome this difficulty because some of my Sinhalese friends shared my interest in jungles and lagoons, and they were eager to come as polling officers to the Eastern Province. I had to officially get them to staff the polling booths; but unofficially, I had also to look after them and provide social activities for them.

### On demeaning Anura Kumara Dissanayake

*2024-06-16 11:27:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/on-demeaning-anura-kumara-dissanayake/) · `en`

In Sri Lanka, Tamil politics took a dramatic turn this week when Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake visited members of the Tamil National Alliance. According to media reports, Premadasa has promised to implement the 13th Amendment, while Dissanayake has vowed to revisit issues like devolution and power sharing.

This is not as shocking a development as one may assume; far more shocking developments have taken place in Sri Lankan politics. Nor should it surprise anyone it is taking place months before a presidential election, arguably the most crucial in recent years, is to be held.

Both Premadasa and Dissanayake are veteran political stalwarts; both have been in active politics since the early 2000s. There is something cynical about the whole matter, but perhaps what is most cynical is that the TNA itself has accepted these visits and engaged with these delegations.

### Champika Ranawaka accuses ‘political underworld’ of thriving on narcotics

United Republican Front leader, Patali Champika Ranawaka, MP, says that Sri Lanka faces the danger of becoming a ‘narco-state’ if immediate action is not taken to stop the growth of what he describes as the ‘political underworld.’

“There is a political underworld operating in this country in addition to the goon-run social underworld we are all aware of. This political underworld thrives on its nexus with drug cartels. It must be eliminated without further delay; otherwise, we will all suffer under a narco-state,” Ranawaka said during an interview with the Sunday Island on Thursday.

He said that there were around 100,000 ex-servicemen with arms training now in society facing financial problems. “There are also 10,000 to 15,000 ex-LTTE cadres. They could be lured easily into criminal activity because of their financial problems.

The presidential and possible parliamentary elections are expected to take place later in 2024 and will be the most important set of elections in our post-Independence history.
