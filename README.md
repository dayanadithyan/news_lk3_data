The elderly couple, originally from Canada, were visiting their ancestral homeland in Sri Lanka. The attackers, armed with weapons, targeted them in their sleep, causing severe injuries including fractures and internal bleeding. Despite medical interventions and relocation for safety reasons, the victims continue to face challenges in recovery and seek justice.

### The government is not going to carry out a debt restructuring - Lakshman Kiriella

*2024-05-22 15:18:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184231) ¬∑ `ta`

Lakshman Kiriella criticizes the government for failing to implement laws effectively, citing examples like the lack of action against a lawmaker accused of assaulting an airport employee. He also mentions the government's avoidance of the UN Human Rights Council due to potential accountability issues. Kiriella argues that the government's inability to uphold the rule of law and its reluctance towards debt restructuring until after the presidential election hinder economic development.

üü©

The agreement with the IMF on debt restructuring is not going to end the presidential election until the presidential election is over. This is because the debt does not need to pay until the debt is not reorganized.

The government that has made the country the country cannot build the economy of the country.

He said this while addressing the adjournment of the House in Parliament on Wednesday (22).

The President recently said that the government has passed 75 new laws during this period.

It is true. But even if the laws are allowed, they are not properly implemented. Over the past few years, the law has been established only for the government. The current chief justice king has filed 42 cases during the Good Governance. But the Gotabhaya government did not know what happened to the cases after the arrival of the government.

We recently found a Member of Parliament attacked an ordinary employee at the Katunayake airport.
