Despite losing an early wicket, Kathryn Bryce emerged was undeterred and launched an attack during the Powerplay, striking two boundaries off Udeshika Prabodhani in an over. She dished out the same treat to Sugandika Kumari but the left-arm spinner had the last laugh by getting rid of the opposition skipper two balls later.

### Unveiling the dark reality: Sri LankaтАЩs deepening drug crisis

*2024-04-28 06:53:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/unveiling-the-dark-reality-sri-lankas-deepening-drug-crisis/) ┬╖ `en`

Robert Frost once wrote, тАШHome is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.тАЩ ItтАЩs a place like Hotel California in the popular Eagles song by that name тАФ you can check out any time you like but you can never leave.

ItтАЩs all about family. The prodigal son or daughter can return. And when they do, other residents cannot pack their bags and leave, however distasteful the returnee has turned out to be or the returning is.

And even if they are far away, тАШfamilyтАЩ remains, in our thoughts and in our hearts, whether they are тАШprodigalтАЩ or not. Indeed, while there are degrees of prodigality or extravagant behaviour that displease friends and relatives, few things can make people grieve as extreme addiction to narcotics and alcohol. It is a тАШfamily matterтАЩ unlike anything else. It is in fact a household matter wherever the addict may reside.

Perhaps there is no phrase of Karl Marx that is better known or more frequently quoted than his quip about religion being the opium of the masses. So let me quote the passage in full.

тАЬReligious distress is an expression of real distress and a protest against this distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, the spirit of a spiritless condition. It is the opium of the masses. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the condition for their real happiness. The demand to give up this illusion is the demand for men to give up a condition which needs illusionsтАЭ. Marx, Critique of HegelтАЩs Philosophy of Right.

The passing of A.T. Ariyaratne at the age of 92 years on April 16, 2024 removes from the national scene a colossus that straddled many spheres of local life and singularly gained international recognition for himself and his country to an unimaginable extent. Though small and diminutive in physical size he reached dizzy heights that should inspire the current and future generations to emulate him. A.T. Ariyaratne was an innovative thinker who consistently punched above his weight.

Much has been written of him and much will be written of him in the future. Therefore, I will confine myself in this essay to the lesser publicized aspects of his charismatic life.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs tax collections in 2023 have totalled 2,750 billion rupees, up 55 from 2022 and higher than a revised out-turn presented at a November, official data show.

Sri Lanka originally targeted 3,130 billion rupees of tax collections in 2023 or 10.3-pct of gross domestic product despite an economic contraction but with an inflated economy at hikes in rates, while the International Monetary Fund projected only 3,005 billion rupees (10.1-pct of GDP).

In a budget for 2024 presented to parliament in November, the tax target was revised down to 2,596 billion rupees, or 9.2 percent of GDP.

But the actual collections have turned out to be 2,720 billion rupees for 2023, which is 8.9 percent of GDP.

With non tax revenues of 100 billion rupees, lower than expected, total revenues were 3,048.8 billion rupees or 11 percent of GDP, in slightly lower than the 11.3 percent in the original budget but in line with the 10.9 percent IMF projection.
