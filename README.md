### UkraineтАЩs тАШHarry Potter CastleтАЩ hit in Russian missile strike, at least 4 killed

*2024-04-30 12:54:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98935/ukraines-harry-potter-castle-hit-in-russian-missile-strike-at-least-4-killed) ┬╖ `en`

At least four people have been killed in a Russian missile strike that hit a Gothic-style building in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa.

Known to locals as the тАЬHarry Potter CastleтАЭ, its turrets were still burning at nightfall and emergency services graded the blaze severe.

Residents reportedly did not have enough time to take shelter as air raid alerts only happened a few minutes before the strike.

тАЬThe type of missile is currently being checked; forensic specialists are carrying out the appropriate evaluations to this end,тАЭ said a spokesperson for UkraineтАЩs Southern Defense Forces, Dmytro Pletenchuk.

тАЬAll services, including the State Emergency Service, are currently working to eliminate the consequences of the missile strike - yet another war crime.тАЭ

Visiting the capital Kyiv earlier on Monday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the allianceтАЩs members had failed to deliver what they promised to Ukraine in good time, allowing Russia to exploit battlefield advantages.

### UK Policeman spared jail after assault on innocent Sri Lankan

*2024-04-30 12:46:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/UK-Policeman-spared-jail-after-assault-on-innocent-Sri-Lankan/108-281651) ┬╖ `en`

UK, April 30 (The Independent) - A serving UK Metropolitan Police officer who assaulted an innocent Sri Lankan after mistaking him for a criminal has been spared jail.

PC Jonathan Marsh, 34, had been called out to Atlanta Boulevard in Romford, east London, on 13 November 2022 after a medical worker reported someone was damaging a sign outside and making threats to kill.

Marsh mistook Rasike Attanayake, who had called 999, for the suspect and bundled him to the ground before punching him in the back of the head.

Mr Attanayake was arrested and put in the back of a police car until officers realised their mistake and he was de-arrested.

Police-worn bodycam footage played to the court showed Marsh pulling Mr Attanayake to the floor, swearing at him and punching him in the back of the head.

After the incident, he complained to the Met Police and the force referred the case to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) for them to investigate.

### 2019 Easter Sunday tragedy: National Peace Council says intl. role in ascertaining truth remains relevant

The National Peace Council (NPC) in a statement said yesterday that the international role in ascertaining the truth of the 2019 Easter Sunday tragedy remains relevant even today.

On April 21, the country marked the fifth anniversary of the tragic Easter Sunday bombing that claimed the lives of approximately 300 persons and left more than 500 others injured and maimed. The enduring consequences of the Easter Sunday bombing need to be kept in mind. The economic repercussions, stemming from the decline in foreign investments and tourism, continue to haunt the country, contributing to the economic challenges faced today. The National Peace Council is particularly concerned that the erosion of trust in Government leadership, exacerbated by perceived failures in accountability and transparency, remains a pressing concern for all citizens. Unfortunately, this leads to frustration and loss of faith in the system, which can also lead to further injustices.

### A call to end  тАШCorporal PunishmentтАЩ  and create a fear-free childhood

School and home are the places where children spend most of the time of the day; hence corporal punishment should be absent in both places and they should feel safe in such environments

Research unequivocally shows that corporal punishment is linked to adverse outcomes, including increased aggression, poorer mental health, and diminished cognitive development, which could result in long-term psychological issues and social dysfunctions, ultimately contributing to a cycle of violence that affects the broader society and future generations

A study on the perceptions of Sri Lankan parents on the use of corporal punishment (2012) found that 74 per cent of parents resort to corporal punishment

The alternatives are rooted in communication, understanding, and mutual respect

### Early BuddhismтАЩs links with urbanisation and commerce

When land-based feudalism replaced urbanism and trade, Buddhism waned in India, says Indian scholar Balkrishna Govind Gokhale

In sixth century BC, Buddhism thrived in the Gangetic Plain in North India due to urbanisation and the development of trade. According to the renowned scholar of Buddhism in India, Balkrishna Govind Gokhale, Buddhism began to decline in India when urbanisation and trade yielded place to feudalism.

In his paper in the Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies (Vol Number 2, 1982, University of Wisconsin Madison), Gokhale says that the use of iron tools, beginning from the seventh century BC, increased agricultural productivity, which in turn led to larger commodity surpluses, which became available for exchange through trade.
