### Independence and Self-Sufficiency: Co-operation in Times of Crisis

*2024-02-05 00:05:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Independence-and-Self-Sufficiency-Co-operation-in-Times-of-Crisis/172-276324) · `en`

For close to a decade and a half I have been studying co-operatives, particularly as I was preoccupied with questions about the post-war reconstruction of Jaffna. As I watched the failure of development policies that prioritised building transport and urban infrastructure over rural livelihoods, supported the proliferation of financial institutions leading to indebtedness, and grand claims about the private sector generating employment that did not materialize, I became more and more involved with the co-operative movement. Drawing on the institutional memory of the co-operative movement and the vast network of co-operatives that survived the war, some of us began to see an alternative for social and economic revival of the still rural war-torn society in the North.

The 76th ‘February 4th’ has passed, marked by four days of aerobatics, consuming considerable aviation fuel and time.

The 76th ‘February 4th’ has passed, marked by four days of aerobatics, consuming considerable aviation fuel and time. This prompts questions about resource usage during such events. The primary question persists: why, after 76 years of independence, hasn’t this celebration translated into genuine freedom? To attain complete freedom for Sri Lankans, there is a need to fully implement the 13th Amendment or consider extending beyond its provisions.

Although Jaffna district Member of Parliament, Sivagnanam Sritharan had told the media on what principles he would lead the struggle for the political rights of the Tamil people after being elected as the leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) – popularly known as the Federal Party – it was expected that he would officially explain his policies after assuming office at the party’s convention that was to be held in Trincomalee last Sunday.

However, the convention was postponed indefinitely due to controversies surrounding selections for other posts, including the post of the General Secretary of the party. So the new leader was unable to deliver that important speech.

After the election of Sritharan by the party’s General Council in a secret ballot at Trincomalee Town Hall on 21 January, the other contender, Member of Parliament, M.A. Sumanthiran had publicly announced that he would cooperate with the new leader.

“We intend to take additional strikes, and additional action, to continue to send a clear message that the United States will respond when our forces are attacked, when our people are killed,” White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC’s “Meet the Press” program on Sunday.

The strikes are the latest blows in a conflict that has spread into the Middle East since Oct. 7, when the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed Israel from the Gaza Strip, igniting war.

COLOMBO (News 1st) – Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has called for a transition to new leadership in Sri Lanka.

Cardinal Ranjith highlighted the contrasting approaches taken by Singapore and Sri Lanka after independence. While Singapore's leaders prioritized unity and the well-being of all communities, he decried the division sowed by Sri Lankan leadership based on language and religion.

He further praised Singapore's strong legal system and emphasis on discipline, contrasting them with the perceived disregard for law and order in Sri Lanka.

The Cardinal accused the government of self-serving agendas and prioritizing personal gain over the nation's well-being. He questioned the legitimacy of their "independence celebrations" at a time of economic and political turmoil, suggesting that they only celebrate their own freedom, not that of the suffering people.

Colombo, Feb 04 (AFP) - A maiden Test hundred by Ibrahim Zadran helped Afghanistan recover in the one-off Test against Sri Lanka in Colombo, as the tourists ended day three on 199 for one on Sunday.

Afghanistan had to show fight in their second dig after being shot out for 198 in the first innings to concede a lead of 241.

Ibrahim went past his previous best Test score of 87 and then completed his maiden Test hundred in the last over of the day with a single to covers, leaving him unbeaten on 101.

The first was on 39 when Prabath Jayasuriya put down a tough return catch, and then again on 63 when Nishan Madushka at short mid-off dropped a catch off Jayasuriya's bowling.

The wicket had flattened out but still the Afghan batters had to show application, and they put up a fine show as Sri Lanka struggled to find the breakthroughs.

It was a disciplined effort by the bowlers and Jayasuriya was required to bowl long spells, sending down 32 overs but without picking up a wicket.

A group including former Parliamentarian Mervyn Silva was seen carrying a false coffin into the Borella Cemetery on Sunday (04 Feb.), in protest against the Online Safety Bill.

Security personnel at the entrance of the cemetery had reportedly attempted to prevent the group from entering into the premises.

Despite their attempt, however, the group had entered the premises and staged a protest against the highly controversial Online Safety Bill, which came into effect earlier this month.

The legislation which seeks to regulate online content was passed in Parliament, with amendments, on 24 January, amidst objections from opposition politicians and activists who allege the new law will muzzle free speech.

The controversial Bill garnered not only the attention of local activists and organisations, but also that of diplomats and large international organisations, claiming that the Bill had numerous problematic aspects.

Today, Sri Lankans are totally fed up with both political parties. Millions of Lankans have finally realized that together the two major parties ran our country to ground while protecting each other when laws were broken, and corruption was evident.

Thank to the contribution of the social media, an angry public who were deprived of the very basic necessities of life rallied together and managed to chase away a president who mismanaged the country, a historic first in our beloved island.

Two of his catastrophic decisions were giving a tax to the tune of around Rs 600 billion without figuring out how to pay for it (now RW has made the people pay for it with increased taxes) and later opting to go for organic fertilizer during a global pandemic thereby ruining the only healthy sector of our economy which was agriculture. Had Gota not been given the huge tax cut he might have had the money to buy chemical fertilizer.

Vice President Nangolo Mbumba takes the helm in Namibia - a mining hotspot with significant deposits of diamonds and the electric car battery ingredient lithium - until presidential and parliamentary elections at the end of the year.

A presidency post on social media platform X did not give a cause of death, but late last month the presidency said he had travelled to the United States for “a two-day novel treatment for cancerous cells”, after being diagnosed following a regular medical check-up.

Born in 1941, Geingob was a prominent politician since before Namibia achieved independence from white minority-ruled South Africa in 1990.

There is no doubt that the two great ideological sides are interested in ensuring that the strength of the Tamil people is going to be a Western force with a democratic strength, or that the Maldives is going to be a democratic face -like autocratic ideology.. It is very important that political leadership take advantage of this position in favor of the concept of their homeland theory.

It is inevitable that every political party in the world has different ideas and positions. It is not forgotten that the best characteristic of a political party is to solve all of them independently.

At the same time, other political parties and organizations are working through their general conferences through internal election democracy and their democratic values transparency..

The verdict does not deal with South Africa's main allegation of Israeli genocide in Palestine. On the contrary, the actions demanded by South Africa are aimed at protecting the rights of the Palestinian people under the genocide.

Temporary measures demanded by South Africa are demands to be put before the final judgment of the main case, and it may take years to the final judgment.

It is true that the rulings of the International Court of Justice are controlled by all sides, but there is no way to implement them.
