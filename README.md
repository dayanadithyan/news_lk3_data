### Strong solar storm hits Earth, could disrupt communications

An unusually strong solar storm hitting Earth could produce northern lights in the U.S. this weekend and potentially disrupt power and communications.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a rare severe geomagnetic storm warning when a solar outburst reached Earth on Friday afternoon, hours sooner than anticipated. The effects were due to last through the weekend and possibly into next week.

NOAA alerted operators of power plants and spacecraft in orbit to take precautions, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

“For most people here on planet Earth, they won’t have to do anything,” said Rob Steenburgh, a scientist with NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center.

The storm could produce northern lights as far south in the U.S. as Alabama and Northern California, according to NOAA. But it was hard to predict and experts stressed it would not be the dramatic curtains of color normally associated with the northern lights, but more like splashes of greenish hues.

### Risk for boys with bodice -powered sports materials

*2024-05-11 11:06:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183211) · `ta`

Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa warns that sports materials containing chemicals like lithium, silver oxide, and alkaline can pose a risk to boys, potentially causing severe damage if swallowed. The short esophagus can lead to these materials reaching the stomach, causing respiratory blockage and even death. Immediate hospitalization is advised, with honey administered as first aid.

🟩

The Assistant Secretary of the Government Medical Officers Association, Dr. Palitha Rajapaksa, said that the children will be affected by the sports material.

He said that the games played by the boys may be swallowed, or that there are potentials, or the ear and nose, as the types of chemical compounds such as lithium, silver oxide and alkaline are in the form of button.

The reason is that the first part of our diet canal (esophagus) is naturally short, so that when swallowing the bark can go into the stomach and cause severe damage.

This can cause a sudden explosion in the stomach, causing respiratory tract blockage and death.

Therefore, the children should be taken to the hospital immediately if they get caught in such accidents. He said that until the first aid is taken to the hospital, two teaspoons of clean honey should be given to the affected children once in 10 minutes.

The Colombo Tea Auction offering recorded a decline significantly, totalling 4.9 million kilogrammes.

There was improved demand and a dearer trend in prices for most teas on offer, perhaps triggered by the lower volume on offer against the backdrop of urgent shipments, Forbes and Walker Tea Brokers said.

The Ex-Estate offerings were reasonably maintained and totalled 0.74 million kilogrammes.

The Westerns – Select Best, on offer were irregular and often easier, whilst the others together with the teas in the Below Best and Plainer categories, were often firm and Rs.20-40 per kilogramme dearer. The Nuwara Eliyas were a weak feature and mostly unsold, due to a lack of suitable bids.

The Uda Pussellawa BOPs were barely maintained, whilst the corresponding BOPFs appreciated by Rs.40-60 per kilogramme. The Uva BOPs sold around last levels, whilst the corresponding BOPFs gained by up to Rs.100 per kilogramme.
