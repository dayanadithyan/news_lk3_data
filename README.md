Colombo, March 21 (Daily Mirror) - Running counter to the statement by the Health Ministry regarding the return of migrated doctors to Sri Lanka, recent statistics paint a different picture, revealing only a meagre five specialists have returned to the country this year.

The assertion initially made by Deputy Director General (Medical Services) Dr. G. Wijesuriya failed to produce the statistics and thus met with skepticism, especially considering the stark reality depicted by the data.

Dr. Wijesuriya, who found himself in hot water over the statement, claimed a reversal in the trend of doctors, particularly those pursuing postgraduate training abroad, choosing not to return to Sri Lanka. “Although it’s not in alarming numbers, the migrated doctors have started to return to the country,”

ECONOMYNEXT – The purchase price of a wind power plant in Mannar, Sri Lanka built by India’s Adani has now been lowered to 8.85 US cents in the latest negotiations, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

“They are now proposing 8.85 US cents or about 26.90 rupees,” Minister Wijesekera told parliament.

The private plant has drawn controversy because it was not coming through competitive bidding and the initial price demanded was said to have been as high at 15.20 US cents a unit.

Power purchase agreements (PPA) which run up to 20 years are among the largest government procurement in the island and dwarfs some capital projects.

Minister Wijesekera said the plant came as a government-to-government deal.  A cabinet appointed negotiation committee was appointed to sort out the price.

Some political analysts refer to such power plants as a ‘geopolitical’ cost.

There are now several plants for which prices are being negotiated without competitive tender.

### Indian Adani Group says “vicious campaign” against its Sri Lanka wind project

ECONOMYNEXT – India’s Adani Group, which is in discussion to get clearance for two renewable energy projects in Sri Lanka, has complained of a possible “vicious campaign” against its 250 MW wind-powered energy project in the island nation’s Northern district of Mannar.

Sri Lankan officials have said the Adani’s wind power project has been facing some delays as a Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee (CANC) has been raising concerns over the project components including tariff.

In a fresh blow, Rohan Pethiyagoda, a prominent Sri Lankan biodiversity scientist, in a recent video said Adani’s wind project is “yet another wasteful scam” and questioned about its Environmental Assessment Impact (EIA) and the pricing.

“The EIA for Adani’s Mannar power project is little more than a shame, a stamp, a whitewash,” Pethiyagoda, a conservationist and a public-policy advocate, told in a self-explanatory video posted by himself in his own YouTube platform.

Government institutions often carry a reputation for bureaucracy, inefficiency, and stagnation. But this need not be the case. With visionary leadership, effective management, and a commitment to progress, these institutions can evolve into powerful catalysts for positive change.

It’s a common misconception that Government institutions are inherently resistant to development. While challenges exist, they are not insurmountable. Proper administration, strategic planning, and a results-oriented mind-set can drive transformation.

Effective management is the cornerstone of success. Leaders must prioritise transparency, accountability, and collaboration. A well-functioning team, aligned with a shared vision, can overcome obstacles and achieve remarkable outcomes.
