### அவுஸ்திரேலிய பண்ணையில் உலகின் மிகப்பெரிய புளூபெர்ரி பழம்

*2024-03-15 15:37:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178792) · `ta`

கடந்த ஆண்டு நவம்பர் மாதம் புளூபெர்ரி பழம்  பறிக்கப்பட்டு  உறைவிப்பான் பெட்டியில் (freezer) வைத்து பேணப்பட்டது.

இது சுமார் 4 சென்றி மீற்றர் அகலமும் 20.4 கிராம் நிறையும் கொண்டதோடு, சாதாரண புளூபெர்ரியை விட 10 மடங்கு பெரிதாகும்.

நுகர்வோரிடம் காணப்பட்ட பெரிய புளூபெர்ரி பழங்களுக்கான கேள்வியை நிவர்த்தி செய்வதற்காக கோஸ்டா குழுமத்தால் இந்த புதிய வகை எடெர்னா புளுபெர்ரி உருவாக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.

எடெர்னா இனம் தொடர்ந்து நல்ல விளைச்சலை தருகிறது. ஆனால் அண்மையில் வடக்கு நியூ சவுத் வேல்ஸில் உள்ள கொரிண்டியில் உள்ள அவர்களின் பண்ணையில் ஒரு மகத்தான விளைச்சலைத் தந்துள்ளது.

மரங்களில் சில பெரிய புளூபெர்ரி பழங்கள் காய்த்து கிடந்ததை எங்கள் குழுவினர்  அவதானித்து அவற்றை பறித்து எடை போடும் போது அதிர்ச்சி அடைந்தனர்.

அதில், உலகிலேயே மிகப்பெரிய புளூபெர்ரி பழம் என்ற சாதனையை முறியடித்த பழம் பெரியதாக இருந்தது. அன்று காலையில் நாங்கள் 20 அல்லது அதற்கு மேற்பட்ட பழங்களை பறித்தோம் அவைகள் முந்தைய உலக சாதனையை முறியடித்திருந்தது.

විදේශයන්හි සිටින රුසියානුවන්ට ද එම රටවල රුසියානු තානාපති කාර්යාලය වෙත ගොස් ඡන්දය ප්‍රකාශ කළ හැකිවීම විශේෂත්වයකි.

කලාප 29ක පළමුවරට ඡන්දය පාවිච්චි කරන්නන්ට මාර්ගගත ක්‍රමයට ද ඡන්දය ප්‍රකාශ කිරීමට අවස්ථාව ලබාදී තිබේ.

බොහෝ ප්‍රදේශවල පෙරවරු 8.00 සිට රාත්‍රී 8 දක්වා ඡන්දය ප්‍රකාශ කිරීම සිදුකෙරේ.

2000 වසරේ සිට රුසියාවේ බලය හොබවන 71 හැවිරිදි ජනාධිපති පුටින් 2004, 2012 සහ 2018 වසරවලදී නැවත තේරී පත්විය.

2021 වසරේදී ජනපති පුටින් අත්සන් තැබූ නියෝගයකට අනුව ඔහුට තවත් ජනාධිපතිධුර කාල දෙකකට තරග කළ හැකිය.

ඒ අනුව ජීවත්ව සිටියොත් 2036 වසර වනතුරු ඔහුට රුසියානු ජනාධිපතිධුරය දැරීමේ අවස්ථාවක් පවතී.

මෙවර ජනාධිපතිවරණය ජයගතහොත් ජනපති පුටින් සෝවියට් සමූහාණ්ඩුවේ නායකයෙකු වූ ජෝසප් ස්ටාලින්ට පසු වැඩිම කාලයක් රුසියාව පාලනය කළ නායකයා බවට පත්වේ.

### Israeli strikes killed at least 29, injured over 150 in Gaza awaiting aid: Palestinian officials

*2024-03-15 15:00:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97977/israeli-strikes-killed-at-least-29-injured-over-150-awaiting-aid-in-gaza-palestinian-officials) · `en`

At least 29 Palestinians were killed while awaiting aid in two separate Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, Gaza’s health ministry said.

In the first incident, Palestinian health officials in the Hamas-ruled strip said eight people were killed in an airstrike on an aid distribution centre in Al-Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip.

Later, at least 21 people were killed and more than 150 wounded by Israeli gunfire at a crowd awaiting aid trucks at a northern Gaza roundabout, Gaza’s health ministry said.

In a statement, Israel’s military denied attacking aid centres, describing the reports as “false.”

“As the IDF assesses the incident with the thoroughness that it deserves, we urge the media to do the same and only rely on credible information,” the statement said.

### President hints at vehicle import resumption; importers warn of possible cost increase

President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday hinted at a possible gradual resumption of private vehicle imports starting next year. However, local vehicle importers have warned that this development may not necessarily translate into positive news for buyers.

While the relaxation could breathe new life into the stagnant motor sector, importers have expressed concerns that duty structures for imported vehicles may see a significant increase.

In January, the government revised the duty structure, resulting in a significant rise in vehicle import costs. Despite the potential allowance for vehicle imports, importers caution that substantial restrictions may remain, implying it is too early to celebrate the statement made by the President.

The Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka’s survey indicates that local market prices are poised to climb alongside the resumption of imports.

### Questions to those questioning Sri Lanka’s IMF program

Becoming an export oriented economy is a good solution but it is a long term solution as we cannot become an export oriented economy overnight either as that takes years to materialise.

The pause in repayment of external debt (except multilateral debt) for nearly 2 years is largely due to the creditors being reassured that the IMF is there.

There has been a lot of criticism about Sri Lanka’s 17th IMF program from people of various backgrounds. They have made all kinds of accusations against the IMF program and criticised it. I agree that the IMF program is not the perfect solution. But the question is, what is the alternative? I am yet to see anyone who has offered a sensible alternative to the IMF.

Due to the current economic environment, it is understood that tax revenue collection should be enhanced to increase the Tax to GDP ratio. However, the Government should take precaution to ensure this endeavour to enhance tax revenue does not lead to harassment or unfairness to the taxpayer.

There are many knowledgeable tax officers who understand both sides of the fence and act professionally by respecting the Rule of Law and the Taxpayer Rights. However, due to heightened pressure from the Ministry of Finance and Parliamentary Committees one could lose track of respecting the rights of the other party. What is the recourse available to a taxpayer if tax officers transgress the Rule of Law to exercise their power without respecting the legal rights of the taxpayer?

*2024-03-15 06:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/CCC-urges-collaborative-approach-to-address-parate-suspension-concerns/108-278884) · `en`

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) yesterday expressed “deep concerns” about the government’s move to suspend parate execution, and called for a collaborative solution to address this growing issue.

The CCC stated that while it understands that certain businesses, essentially in the SME sector need to be supported in the current economic climate, providing that support in the form of curtailing credit recovery measures is not necessarily the best method of supporting these industries.

“The Chamber is concerned about the potential impact on the overall financial market as a result of the cancellation of the parate execution law,” it said in a statement to the media.

### What does it mean to revive planning?

*2024-03-15 05:55:56* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-does-it-mean-to-revive-planning/4-759509) · `en`

We cannot generate a more critical concept of planning until we take seriously the conflict of interests and ideologies that will inevitably shape any possible recovery for Sri Lanka today

Despite claims of a ‘free market’, the leverage that these actors have over much of the global supply chain means that large swathes of the market are in fact held under a kind of private dictatorship. Accordingly, the question is not whether to plan. Instead, we must ask whether we prefer a form of planning that works in a democratic way with an explicit understanding of the public good, versus one that does not

### Revitalising Sri Lanka through Social Solidarity Economy

*2024-03-15 05:49:11* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Revitalising-Sri-Lanka-through-Social-Solidarity-Economy/4-759508) · `en`

By embracing the principles of the SSE, the nation can chart a course towards a more just, inclusive, and sustainable future

As Sri Lanka grapples with a severe economic crisis, the need for a transformative economic model has never been more apparent. Decades of neoliberal policies since 1977 have left the nation facing rising inequality and vulnerability to global economic shifts. Previous experiments with socialist policies encountered challenges, stifling innovation and individual entrepreneurship. It’s time for a paradigm shift, and the Social Solidarity Economy (SSE) emerges as a beacon of hope for a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable future.

### Wages of sin latest addition to never ending fiascos at CBSL

*2024-03-15 05:45:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Wages-of-sin-latest-addition-to-never-ending-fiascos-at-CBSL/4-759507) · `en`

It is difficult to find another instance in the history of central banking where the head of that bank with conscienceless audacity abused the constitutional independence of that institution to raise unilaterally the wages of his staff to such a height, between 36 and 79%, and made them an un-imitable elite of officers to be envied by the rest of the community of public servants. This is one of many and multiplying horror stories one hears almost daily from paradise Sri Lanka.

At a time when millions of hard-working heads of ordinary families and parents are found skipping meals or eating smaller portions to feed their children, when 30% of five-year-old children are found malnourished, and when the danger of starvation is knocking at the doors of the poorest, the unconscionable act of munificence by the big chief Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe (NW) fits into the proverbial robbery of Peter to pay Paul. The Central Bank’s notoriety continues unabated.

It was reported that the Commissioner General Sepalika Chandrasekara has said that about 1,000 companies have been issued notice by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) to pay up their tax arrears amounting to more than Rs. 160 billion in six months or face seizure of bank accounts and property.

I would like to know from the Commissioner how feasible it is to execute the above decision, if the company resorts to or is faced with any one or more of the following situations:

1. If the bank balance of the company is very low/nil and not substantial enough to recover the tax arrears, or if the money is totally withdrawn before the account is blocked.

2. If the company has taken a huge overdraft and thereby already indebted to the bank

3. If the property has been already mortgaged requiring parate execution

4. If the company deliberately goes into bankruptcy and declares so before seizure by IRD

### Ogilvy Sri Lanka and Women in Need unveil ‘Masterpiece of Abuse’ art installation

Ground-breaking initiative uses local newspaper cuttings documenting instances of abuse and harassment against women to mark International Women’s Day

In a poignant tribute, Ogilvy Sri Lanka, in partnership with Women in Need (WIN), revealed ‘Masterpiece of Abuse’, an art installation, designed to raise awareness and support for survivors of abuse on International Women’s Day.

Crafted from local newspaper cuttings documenting instances of abuse and harassment against women, this forsaken art serves as a powerful symbol of the harsh realities faced by women. It stands in stark contrast to the celebratory and empowering messages that often dominate media platforms exclusively on Women’s Day.

The installation captures the essence of the pervasive issue of abuse experienced by women across the island. By depicting the harsh realities of survivors, it seeks to illuminate the often-overlooked struggles that persist, urging society to confront this pressing issue head-on.

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) in a statement yesterday expressed its deep concern over the increasing number of vacancies in the Superior Courts, which has now reached a critical point that significantly hampers the functionality and the integrity of the justice system.

The statement issued by BASL President Kaushalya Nawaratne PC and Secretary Isuru Balapatabendi also said the following.

The recent retirement of a judge of the Supreme Court has further exacerbated the situation by creating an additional vacancy in the Supreme Court. This comes at a time when there is already an ongoing impasse between the Constitutional Council and the Executive over the appointment to fill an existing vacancy within the same court. The delay in resolving these appointments is not only undermining the efficiency of our appellate courts but also eroding public confidence in the legal system›s ability to deliver timely justice.

These are days when parents have to motivate children with positive thoughts and help them envisage victory after being engaged in a struggle. We are in an era where we have to make a struggle to live, study, find food, retain jobs and stand up for what’s right. For this we must ensure that our loved ones engaged in the struggle to live and prosper emerge as victors.

But there can be people out there who dedicate some time from their lives to defeat evil. There are citizens of this country who would want to defeat this ‘unelected’ regime; where its present president came to power not through the vote of the citizens, but from support inside the parliament. There are citizens in this nation who’d want to change this regime and install a new one after an election. And those who contribute to that change might not even stand in public with the winners, but prefer to play watchdog because ‘power’ has the potential to corrupt lawmakers.
