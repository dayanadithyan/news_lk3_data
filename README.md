Colombo, May 14 (Daily Mirror) - If the MPs who have applied for liquor licenses are to face punishment, as the Opposition Leader suggests, it raises suspicions on how many MPs will remain loyal to him, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

Addressing the media, he said no arrangements have been made to provide liquor licenses to any of the parliamentarians' friends or acquaintances. The Opposition Leader claimed no such project was launched, but he repeats that over and over again.

"Based on the reported population data, liquor licenses were issued 16 years ago. The government's approach doesn't involve promoting the use of legal alcohol; instead, it focuses on regulation through tax hikes and implementing new license fees. The overarching goal seems to be enhancing state revenue while simultaneously curbing the proliferation of illegal alcohol," the State mMnister said.

Modern thermal radiation therapy, like Endovenous Laser Therapy, offers relief for varicose nerve issues, affecting many who work long hours. This treatment involves a small procedure to heat and eliminate the infection in the affected nerve area, improving blood flow and reducing discomfort. It's a welcome solution for patients, offering quick recovery and minimal downtime.

🟩

Many of us continue to work for more than five to eight hours a day. Most of them have a varicose nerve infection in their ankles and foot.

If this is easy to describe, the blood is pumped from the heart of all parts of our body with a balanced force.

Because of this, the blood that spreads throughout the body comes back to the heart. The blood vessel system is naturally in our body that we have one path to the body from the heart and another path to the heart from the other part of the body.

In this case, the blood that runs up to the quarter of the area is contaminated, and when they are weak, the contaminated blood is stagnant when they are weak, or when they are weak, or weak, due to various disturbances or due to various disturbances or exclusive blood vessels.. This causes the skin in the quarter and ankle area in the end. It also makes the nerves and causes discomfort and sickness.

Colombo, May 14 (Daily Mirror) - Cabinet approval was granted today to commence the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Level (A/L) classes immediately after the completion of the GCE Ordinary Level (O/L) examinations.

Cabinet spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardana said it will take at least three months for the Examinations Department to release the results after the completion of the GCE (O/L) examinations.

"During this period, the students' deviation from school education is the reason for the decrease in their tendency to proceed for the GCE (A/L) education, and it also creates various social issues," he said.

Taking these facts into account, it has been identified that it is appropriate to start the GCE (A/L) education in schools with the completion of the O/L examinations in 2024. This makes it possible to manage the students' time effectively and provide enough time for teachers to cover the GCE (A/L) syllabus, Minister Gunawardana said.
