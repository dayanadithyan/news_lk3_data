### No mea culpa

*2024-03-29 05:45:56* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/No-mea-culpa/14-760104) · `en`

It’s almost comedic in its simple-minded analysis of complicated issues

Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s book titled “Conspiracy to oust me from the presidency” does in no way live up to its title. If anyone thinks this is a page turner that gives a blow by blow about how a conspiracy unfolded to destroy his presidency, don’t waste your time or your money on the work.

The former president merely insults those who don’t believe there was a conspiracy to get rid of him. This writer read the Sinhala version of the book. The author writes that only the extremely naïve, ‘bolanda’, would believe that there wasn’t a foreign conspiracy to oust him.

That statement is typical of the way Gotabaya Rajapaksa (GR) ruled the country. He seemed to be so aloof that he was constantly seen to be out of touch when in power. Added to that was his rather supercilious attitude which seemed to make him think he knew more than the rabble he ruled over.

Those who possess drugs are in custody, while those who enabled these persons to possess the drugs are walking free and continuing to bring more drugs into the country

In recent times, there is a massive campaign launched in Sri Lanka to eliminate drugs in the country. It is an excellent objective. But who are those being caught and disciplined? Those who are in possession of drugs. But has it ever occurred to these knights in shining armour, who go after those who possess drugs, that there is another group on whom no drugs are found or will ever be found, who are nevertheless, the masterminds of the drug trade?

### “Ye are the light of the world”: A mystical approach to Easter

*2024-03-29 05:41:28* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Ye-are-the-light-of-the-world-A-mystical-approach-to-Easter/14-760102) · `en`

Our purpose in this world is to choose the resurrection where we join with Christ and seek his power of thought to restore our minds to its original glory

The resurrection of Christ is the corner stone of Christian mystical thought. As such, there are no neutral or idle thoughts for the spiritual seeker. In this way, all thought produces form at some level but they are either true or false. For the spiritual aspirant, the resurrection, correctly speaking, is the highest level of thought; for it acknowledges that there is no thought but God.

### Easter and the Roman Centurion: A Symphony of Redemption

*2024-03-29 04:30:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/easter-and-the-roman-centurion-a-symphony-of-redemption/) · `en`

Easter, the cornerstone of the Christian faith, is universally described as a celebration of penance, hope, renewal, and the triumph of life over death. Central to this profound narrative in history is the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, a pivotal moment that unfolded on the cross; an instrument known, and well-recognised, as an emblem of condemnation, retribution, and shame. However, on that fateful day of the crucifixion, amidst the anguish and agony of the execution of the Son of God, one figure emerges from the pages of history; the Roman Centurion who stood at the foot of the cross. His coincidental encounter with divinity and spirituality transformed a moment of despair into a guiding light of redemption.

### Getting back to that peaceful Easter Sunday - EDITORIAL

*2024-03-29 00:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Getting-back-to-that-peaceful-Easter-Sunday-EDITORIAL/172-279813) · `en`

Easter Sunday is an important day in the Sri Lankan calendar as this day has become the talking point as never before due to the  2019 ‘Easter Sunday bombings’.

Christians would never compare man’s sufferings with the agony Jesus went through on the cross. According to Rev. Frs. Sanjeewa Mendis and Sriyananda Fernando-who spoke on the meaning and message of Easter on ITN’s Pini Viyana programme on March 28-the message conveyed by the Son of God is to spread ‘love’ even during the toughest of times.

Sri Lankan Christians also conveyed a similar and strong message when their kith and kin were brutally blown to pieces inside three churches chose to stay calm and collected as a community. They had forgiven the assailants, but demanded justice for the affected families. This calmness was preserved largely due to the instructions issued by the head of the Catholic Church, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith.

### Gaza genocide, ISIS and the tailpiece of Moscow terror

An injured man is helped outside Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City: The United Nations says the Gaza Strip’s health system is collapsing. AFP

The Moscow terror attack, conveniently claimed by the so-called Islamic State, a.k.a. ISIS, and the diplomatic circus at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday in passing a Gaza ceasefire resolution may appear disconnected at first glance. But there is enough interconnection between the two tragedies.

First, let’s discuss the ISIS connection. The Friday evening terror attack at the Crocus City Hall on the outskirts of Moscow has revealed the mercenary character of ISIS. Questions have always lingered about the Islamic credentials of ISIS since its birth from the ashes of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in 2011.

(Reuters) - Sri Lanka has called for proposals from dealer managers to support its restructuring of some $12 billion of international bonds, the Finance Ministry said on Thursday, in a fresh sign that the island nation is closing in on finalizing its debt rework.

Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt in May 2022 as the economy sank into its deepest financial crisis in decades due to a severe shortfall of dollars. The government was expected to start formal restructuring talks with bondholders this week.

“In the context of the restructuring of its International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), the Government of Sri Lanka is working towards launching an invitation to exchange its existing ISBs denominated in United States Dollars for new ISBs in the same currency,” the notice posted on the Finance Ministry’s website said.

### Fallen ’Crypto King’ Sam Bankman-Fried gets for 25 years for fraud

Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and investors of his now-bankrupt firm.

The ruling cements the downfall of the former billionaire, who emerged as a high profile champion of crypto before his firm's dramatic collapse in 2022.

The 32-year-old was later found to have stolen billions from customers of the exchange ahead of its implosion.

But he was convicted by a New York jury in November on charges including multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

During the sentencing hearing on Thursday, Judge Lewis Kaplan provided a harsh assessment, saying it was clear Bankman-Fried was motivated by a drive to be politically influential.

Despite "protestations of sorrow" about customer losses, Judge Kaplan said, Bankman-Friend had expressed "never a word of remorse for the commission of terrible crimes".
