Despite losing seats in the latest elections, India under PM Modi is set to maintain its robust stance towards Sri Lanka, focusing on economic cooperation and infrastructure projects while possibly easing pressure on certain issues. This approach aims to balance strategic interests and manage perceptions positively in Sri Lanka, especially in light of changing dynamics in the region.

Analysts have said that Narendra Modi, who has been appointed as the Prime Minister of India twice, will not change his policies on Sri Lanka, even if the Indian parliamentary election has not won the third time in the Indian parliamentary election.

Researchers have said that the aggressive motivation for the merger and infrastructure projects with Sri Lanka may be reduced.

The Bharatiya Janata Party has failed to obtain a majority and has been forced to get the support of the state parties.

The BJP -led National Democratic Alliance has won 293 seats, but Narendra Modi's BJP has only 240 seats.

As a result, the two state parties that have seized 28 seats have become influential.

India is pressing over land oil gas and power supply in Sri Lanka.

Also, in collaboration with the private sector, it has obtained a profitable reconstruction energy and port plans.

But veteran Mahmudullah Riyad showed all his experience at the end to see Bangladesh over the line with an unbeaten 16.

It was the final of four games at the Grand Prairie Stadium and the Dallas crowd have been treated to some top entertainment on a surface which offered some bounce and produced good contests between bat and ball.

### EXPLAINER: Implications of Modi’s narrow election victory on Sri Lanka

ECONOMYNEXT – Two-time Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s less-than-expected win at the India’s parliamentary election may not change its foreign policy towards Sri Lanka, but aggressive push for connectivity and infrastructure projects in the island nation could be slowed, analysts say.

Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost its outright majority in the election and found itself reliant on support from regional parties.

Broader coalition National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 293 seats in the 543-member lower house of parliament, where 272 constitutes a simple majority.

However, Modi’s BJP won only 240, less than outright majority, making two regional parties’ leaders kingmakers in the alliance with their 28 seats in total.

India has been pushing for land, oil, gas, and power grid connectivity in Sri Lanka along with securing lucrative renewable energy and port projects in partnership with Indian private sector.

Sri Lanka submitted in May 2009 technical and scientific data and other information to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf for the establishment of the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond Sri Lanka’s Exclusive Economic Zone of 200 nautical miles under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Afterwards, the Commission established a sub-commission to engage with Sri Lanka in 2016.

*2024-06-08 07:57:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185577) · `ta`

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa criticizes the government for issuing liquor licenses in non-tourist areas, arguing it contradicts national development goals. Religious leaders, civilians, and civil organizations also oppose these permits, especially near schools. The government is urged to cancel such permits and halt political bribery related to alcohol distribution, focusing instead on appropriate locations near the tourism industry.

🟩

The government distributed liquor license is against the policy of creating an inadequate nation. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said that permission has been granted within the villages that are not carried out in the tourism industry.

The government has rapidly launched a plan to issue a liquor license in the past. This is against the principle of creating an inadequate nation. Providing these facilities focusing on the tourism industry is part of the tourism industry, but permits have been granted within the villages that are not carried out.

Other religious leaders, civilians and civil organizations have expressed their opposition to this.. Therefore, if these permits are issued in areas where the tourism industry is not carried out in areas where the schools are adjacent to the schools, the government should take steps to cancel the liquor permits issued in the absence.

### Sri Lanka May 2024 remittances rise 13.5-pct to $544mn

*2024-06-08 06:32:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-may-2024-remittances-rise-13-5-pct-to-544mn-167007/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s remittances coming through official channels gained 13.5 percent to $544.4 million in May 2024 compared to the same month last year, helped by more expatriates using the official banking channels.

The remittances in the first five months were $2,624.4 million, 11.8 percent up from the same period last year, the official data showed.

The remittances have risen continuously after the central bank gave up a parallel exchange rate regime, which compelled most expatriates to switch informal Undiyal and Hawala money transfer methos.

The island nation witnessed a 57 percent jump in remittances coming through formal banking channels to $5.97 billion in 2023, from $3.8 billion a year earlier, helped by elimination of parallel exchange rate.

Sri Lanka’s external sector has now recovered after the central bank started to run balance of payments surpluses following a decision to end money printing to sterilize interventions made with Indian Asian Clearing Union money.

June 07 - Sri Lanka is successfully lobbying for the increase of the size of its Exclusive Economic Zone or the country’s territorial sea in cooperation with the Maldives avoiding any conflict between the two sides on overlapping claims, the Daily Mirror learns.

Sri Lanka submitted in May 2009 technical and scientific data and other information to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf for the establishment of the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond Sri Lanka’s Exclusive Economic Zone of 200 nautical miles under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

### Range Bandara’s  “Loud Thinking” about Election Postponement Damages   Ranil’s Election Campaign in the Short Term.

*2024-06-08 03:33:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84130) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s political stage was enlivened last week by the solo performance of  United National Party (UNP) general -secretary Palitha Range Bandara. Addressing a media briefing on 28 May, the policeman turned politician came out with a suggestion that the presidential election due this year and the Parliamentary election scheduled for next year should be postponed while the terms of office for both should be extended by two more years. The former Puttalam district and ex-state minister wanted a resolution passed by Parliament to that effect and ratified by the people at a referendum.

The essence of what Palitha Range Bandara proposed was this -. Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the country’s leadership at a time of a great economic crisis. Considerable progress  has been achieved by the  Wickremesinghe Govt to remedy the situation. A degree of economic stability has been established but more time is needed to ensure greater economic stability.

### Canada stun Ireland by 12 runs in T20 World Cup

*2024-06-08 00:24:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Canada-stun-Ireland-by-12-runs-in-T20-World-Cup/108-284398) · `en`

(New York) - Canada won their first match at any Twenty20 World Cup when they stunned Ireland by 12 runs in a Group A game in New York on Friday.

Defending a target of just 138, the non-Test nation bowled and fielded expertly to hold Ireland to 125-7 from their full 20 overs.

Ireland collapsed spectacularly to 59-6 and come the last five overs they still needed 64 more runs to win -- a rate of more than 12 an over

George Dockrell (30 not out) and Mark Adair (34) reduced the target to 17 off the last six balls.

But Canada paceman Jeremy Gordon held his nerve superbly, conceding just three runs and dismissing Adair with the second ball of the 20th over when he held a skyed caught and bowled chance.

The 37-year-old Guyana-born Gordon finished with fine figures of 2-16 from his maximum four overs.

The US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung meeting the officials of the Election Commission

What a big fuss would have been made by the embassies of Western countries had the Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Qi Zhenhong met with the members of the Election Commission (EC), as American Ambassador Julie Chung and several other Western diplomats had done recently?

Also, can we at least imagine a meeting between the Sri Lankan or Indian Ambassador to the United States and the election officials of the US, including those of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), to discuss the forthcoming US Presidential election? Answers to these questions would explain the world order that had been imposed by the West on others.

### The right to strike and motivated strikes

*2024-06-08 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-right-to-strike-and-motivated-strikes/172-284353) · `en`

For over the past 35 days, the non-academic staff of government universities in the country has been on strike. There is no doubt that the working class of this country is burdened with low salaries. In some instances, workers’ wages were reduced during the economic melt-down.

On June 6 the Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union of Sri Lanka Railways suddenly decided to go on strike. The trade union action according to the Union is being carried out over delays in second-class promotions of locomotive drivers and several other issues.

With the present cost of living far beyond the reach of a majority of workers, something needs to be done to correct the situation. Yet the country too is going through unprecedentedly bad economic times.

While most of the demands of the strikers are understandable, what the public find  difficult to agree with is the manner in which these strikes are called. Trade union action most always, inconveniences the public.

### Change is good: Provided it is for better and not for worse

*2024-06-07 23:56:50* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Change-is-good-Provided-it-is-for-better-and-not-for-worse/14-762802) · `en`

People’s aspiration and hope for a change was short lived and short changed, widening the mistrust between policy makers and electorate further

One fact remains as an acceptable analogy; which is, those who cannot cope with change will never be able to initiate change in any circumstances. This applies to all stakeholders including those who caused and contributed to the current crisis. Fair share of responsibilities fall on to the electorate who got carried away with populism engineered by few; with an ultimate aim of state and regulatory capture for their advantage leaving the country into a dire state grappling with debt. Therefore, capacity and capability to initiate that essential change is absent in the DNA of politicians who deceived their constituents

### Understanding Sinhala Buddhism: Lessons from the recent past

Sri Lankan Buddhists are spoiled for choice these days. Depending on where your faith lies and what tugs at your heart, it seems you can choose the flavour of Theravada Buddhism that suits you best: from the traditional temple Buddhism of the great sects of Kandy to the radical orthopraxy of ascetic Buddhism in remote forest monasteries, and from the devotional Buddhism of Mahamevna to the contrarian, eclectic mix of teachings at Umandawa, the variety can be dazzling—so much so that one could be excused for thinking that this lack of homogeneity is a sign of decay.

### How Argentina’s once great economy was destroyed? Lessons for Sri Lanka

Argentina’s exemplary economic success took a wrong turn from 1946 when Juan Peron became president and he implemented economic policies to make Argentina self-sufficient

As Argentina was the fifth largest economy in the world in the early 1900s, Sri Lanka was one of the best economies in Asia and was referred to as the Switzerland of Asia. Sri Lanka’s downfall too was due to looking into import substitution starting in the mid 1950s. Sri Lanka went into a disastrous overdrive towards import substitution and self-sufficiency starting in 1970 which led to goods shortages and high prices and an economic crisis. Sri Lanka opened its economy in 1977. But the Sri Lankan economy has not remained fully open since then and many of the tough reforms were not done when Sri Lanka opened its economy leading to many lost economic opportunities for the country

The National Peace Council (NPC) in a statement said the unreleased Nawaz Commission report may hold the key to acceptable Trust and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).

During a recent visit to the North, President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that the Government would be establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to address human rights issues that arose out of the three-decade long war. He said that the legislation was nearly finalised with the main remaining question being whether the power to prosecute war crimes should be given to the commission or to a special court. The President said, “We’re deliberating whether the TRC should wield judicial authority or if a separate court should be empowered based on TRC recommendations. This decision is paramount, and I’ve tasked relevant ministers, in consultation with parliamentarians and ambassadors, to draft legislation for parliamentary review.”

The monsoon rains have wreaked havoc, particularly in the districts of Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Matara, Galle, Ratnapura, and Puttalam. Thousands of families have been forced to evacuate their homes and seek refuge in safe locations such as temples, churches, and other public places, with many inaccessible areas in the country. Many homes have sustained severe damage, power supplies have been disrupted, and children are unable to attend school due to closures.
