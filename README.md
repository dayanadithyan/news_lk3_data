However, Russia still trails India and China in size, with the shadow economy potentially underestimating its true GDP.

The World Bank has upgraded Russia's ranking after reviewing its data. And Russia says that Japan has actually overtaken Japan in 2021 and has since retained the fourth place since.

Its earlier calculations were based on 2017 data, but these are now updated to reflect 2021 statistics.

### A shooting incident and conspiracy theories

*2024-07-21 13:06:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/188993) · `ta`

Conspiracy theories often arise when official explanations lack clarity, especially regarding incidents like shootings. They suggest a "shadow government" operates outside democratic norms, using power secretly. This concept isn't new in U.S. history; it's been linked to events such as presidential assassinations. These theories serve as political tools, highlighting the potential misuse of conspiracy narratives.

🟩

The shadow government is seen as contrary to democracy because of the exercise of power beyond the selected government. As far as the United States is concerned, the assassination of the president and the unleashing of assassinations on them is not new. In all cases where there is no proper answer to the question, stories are told in the name of conspiracy. The lesson we can learn from American history is that conspiracy can be used as political weapons.
