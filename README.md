Colombo, Feb 15 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka’s attempt to secure an exemption from India on its ban on big onion exports has not materialized resulting in importers looking to other markets for purchases at higher costs, Daily Mirror learns.

India, the world’s biggest exporter of onions, banned shipments on December 8, 2023 after domestic prices more than doubled in three months following a drop in production. India has taken the policy decision to contain inflation ahead of the parliamentary elections.

However, Sri Lanka sought an exemption to import 100,000 tonnes of big onions from India under special arrangements despite the ban.

Asked about the latest situation, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando told Daily Mirror that the attempt did not materialize and therefore the prices remained high in the local market.

The wholesale price of big onions remains at Rs.350-375 a kilo at the moment.
