(AP) тАФ Hundreds of inmates fled HaitiтАЩs main prison after armed gangs stormed the facility in an overnight explosion of violence that engulfed much of the capital. At least five people were dead Sunday.

The jailbreak marked a new low in HaitiтАЩs downward spiral of violence and came as gangs step up coordinated attacks in Port-au-Prince, while embattled Prime Minister Ariel Henry is abroad trying to salvage support for a United Nations-backed security force to stabilize the country.

Three bodies with gunshot wounds lay at the prison entrance, which was wide open, with no guards in sight. Plastic sandals, clothing and electric fans were strewn across normally overcrowded concrete patios. In another neighborhood, the bloodied corpses of two men with their hands tied behind the backs laid face down as residents walked past roadblocks set up with burning tires.

Even without favourable weather conditions, CEB would have made profits amounting to Rs. 40 bn

The financial performance of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is largely positive as it ended the financial year 2023 with a massive profit.

Unaudited interim financial statements filed to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) showed Rs. 75.7 billion profits for the Group, and Rs. 61.2 billion for the Board.

The improvement in the financial performance is largely due to the increase in rainfall from September, and the hike in electricity tariff that came in the fourth quarter (4Q23). However, as per the statements, even without the heavy rainfalls which reduced its reliance on oil and coal-based generation, CEB would have still made profits of about Rs. 40 billion.

National plans have not worked in Sri Lanka or anywhere else. The Indian Planning Commission has been redesigned and renamed. Can there be sectoral policies? Yes, there should be national policies for specific sectors that are based on evidence and broad stakeholder consultation, even in rapidly changing fields such as digital. They should not change every time a Government changes or a minister is appointed. But they should be reviewed and modified as circumstances change. Should efforts be made to articulate sector policies? Yes, to a limited extent. An approach that accepts the imperfection of information and difficulties of articulation and seeks a balance between workable certainty and flexibility is what will work

But the central banks in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh were worse than even the bad central bank in Sri Lanka. Why the central banks in Singapore or Hong Kong were successful was because those countries continued with open economy policies. They did not adopt socialist systems. They were going on modifying or developing the open economy systems. According to Ronnie, that was the secret to their success.
