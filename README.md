### Health Sector Gripped by Strikes as 72 Professions Walk Out

*2024-01-16 06:23:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/16/health-sector-gripped-by-strikes-as-72-professions-walk-out/)*

Colombo (News 1st) – Sri Lanka's healthcare sector faces significant disruption today as members of 72 health unions representing a wide range of professionals, including laboratory technicians, radiology technicians, pharmacists, public health inspectors, midwives, drug compounders, and entomology officers, have decided to launch a strike.

The action, led by the Health Service Trade Union Alliance is set to continue until 8 am tomorrow.

The strike stems from a recent decision by the President, also serving as the Minister of Finance, to increase the duty interruption, attendance, and transport allowance (DAT) for doctors by 35,000 rupees.

Union Convenor Ravi Kumadesh has criticized the move as discriminatory and demanded similar financial incentives for other healthcare professionals.

Adding to the tension, government nurses are also poised to launch a 24-hour symbolic strike starting at 7 am tomorrow.

News First reached out to Health Minister Ramesh Pathirana for comment, and he noted that the matter is under discussion with acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe.

The widespread strikes raise concerns about potential disruptions in healthcare services across Sri Lanka.

Patients seeking non-emergency care may face delays or cancellations, while critical services could be stretched thin.

Hayleys Solar, the renewable energy arm of Hayleys Fentons recently surpassed 150MWp of installations, a national record for rooftop solar PV capacity in Sri Lanka, setting a new milestone in the island’s transition to renewable energy.

By March 2023, Hayleys Solar crossed its milestone of 125MW and has continued to add new rooftop solar capacity to its portfolio, in various locations across the country. Its 150MWp of solar capacity is enabling Hayleys Solar to save close to 151,835 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions released to the air every year.

Expressing his views, Hayleys Fentons Managing Director Hasith Prematillake stated: “This achievement is the largest to be installed across the island by any single entity and supports us to empower the community making solar solutions closer to all via accessibility and affordability. We are grateful for the trust and support our customers have placed in us.”

Hayleys Solar continues to establish solar experience centres island-wide, adding to its portfolio of experience centres in Matara and Jaffna with new launches in Nawala, Katunayake, Kurunegala and Kandy soon, This will make it easier for people from different communities to access and learn about solar solutions.

These centres offer a comprehensive range of applications, including rooftop PV systems, batteries, and inverters, alongside live demonstrations of solar-powered water pumps, lighting systems and solar powered hot water systems.

With high electricity tariffs, Hayleys Solar offers easy payment plans and loan facilities to support affordability for households and businesses to transition to solar.

Hayleys Solar Executive Director and CEO Roshane Perera said, “By far, Hayleys Solar has become a top of mind household name and plays a major role as a trendsetter in the solar energy sphere as the undisputed market leader. Throughout our remarkable journey, we have empowered a diversified clientele including world-renowned organisations and thousands of households. We are very grateful to our loyal clientele who has placed their trust with us”

“We are also in the process of installing the largest battery of 2MWh which will be commissioned by January 2024. I believe it is our responsibility as the market leader to focus on innovation and bring in the latest technologies to drive growth to expand market share in this sector.”

In 2022, amid challenges in power availability, Hayleys Solar enabled the facilitation of a massive project of installing solar at 830 telecommunication towers across Sri Lanka, which supported the community to stay connected.

With its ongoing commitment to adding rooftop solar capacity to empower the community with electricity and energy self-sufficiency, Hayleys Solar is dedicated to improve the livelihoods of many Sri Lankans for generations.

### SFG becomes first CORSIA-accredited validation and verification body in SL

*2024-01-16 01:19:06 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/business/SFG-becomes-first-CORSIA-accredited-validation-and-verification-body-in-SL/34-757405)*

The Sustainable Future Group (SFG), Sri Lanka’s premier Sustainability Validation and Verification Body which was South Asia’s first to be IAF-accredited to award ISO 14064-1 and 2 for organisational and project-level GHG reporting, ISO 14067 for product carbon foot printing, and ISO 14065 for environmental information, chalked up another “first” when it was accredited under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The accreditation was granted by the Sri Lanka Accreditation Board (SLAB) recently during the first day of the ‘Environment Matters in Aviation Workshop’ held at the Sri Lanka Civil Aviation Authority (SLCAA) auditorium in the presence of the Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Minister, South Asian Civil Aviation Authorities, South Asian Airplane Operators, and other high-level stakeholders in the Aviation industry. Representatives of the EU – South Asia Aviation Partnership Project II (EU-SAAPP II) who provided guidance, support and training for SFG against the CORSIA Scheme from 2019 up until the point of accreditation were also present at the occasion.

The CORSIA scheme provides specifications for airplane operators to calculate and report its CO2 emissions from its fleet, application of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs), and offsetting the amount of CO2 emissions which cannot be reduced through the use of technological improvements, operational improvements, and SAF usage with selected types of emissions units from the global carbon market. SFG is now accredited to verify whether airplane operators have correctly calculated its fleet emissions and have offset its residual emissions against the specifications provided in the CORSIA Scheme. Their first assessment was conducted on the ‘Airplane Operator Emissions Report’ of Maldivian Airlines (Island Aviation Services Ltd.) of the Maldives, which comprised of a desk and site review at the Maldivian Airlines office premises. Following the assessment, the results were then verified in accordance with the ISO/IEC 17029:2019 and ISO 14065:2020 standards by SFG.

CORSIA is the first global compliance market-based scheme for any sector implemented by The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), specialised agency of the United Nations (UN) that oversee and coordinate international air navigation principles and regulations.

The accreditation certificate was handed over to SFG by SLAB Chairman Dr. Sampath Wahala to Sustainability Assurance and Advisory Services Manager Sajeewa Ranasinghe.

### Cardinal slams President’s decision to involve SL in US led Red Sea Op

*2024-01-16 01:09:47 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/news/Cardinal-slams-President-s-decision-to-involve-SL-in-US-led-Red-Sea-Op/56-757395)*

Criticises Govt. for overlooking domestic concerns while involving itself in a Middle East conflict

Says SL has leaders who are indifferent to starving countrymen but are gearing up to join war

Stresses Catholic Church is not agitating for disorder or anarchy but it has a right to demand that justice is done

Emphasises it is now time for active protest rather than remaining silent as 2024 is an election year

In yet another scathing attack against the Government, the Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith on Sunday slammed the decision made by the current Government led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to send in two Sri Lanka Navy vessels to join the Red Sea operation launched by the US and its allies to safeguard merchant vessels from attacks by Houthi rebels

Ranjith criticised the Government for overlooking domestic concerns while involving itself in a Middle East conflict. “We have leaders who seem indifferent to the hunger of our people, yet they are gearing up for a conflict in the Middle East,” he said.

The Archbishop made these comments during a sermon at All Saints Church in Borella, commemorating the second anniversary of the discovery of a grenade on the church premises that sparked a major controversy at the time.

“It is boastful to announce that we will join an international armada with two small ships while the people here are starving. People are going through serious difficulties, these leaders are hardly concerned, and they only want to enjoy themselves at the cost of the taxpayer” he said.

The Archbishop said the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka is not agitating for disorder or anarchy in the country but it has a right to demand that justice is done. “But where is justice when they manipulate incidents like the grenade incident?” he asked.

Ranjith emphasised that the time has come for active protest rather than remaining silent. “In this election year, we have an opportunity to decide whether these corrupt politicians will persist in governing our country or if a new group will be entrusted with steering our nation towards the future,” he added.

He also accused the authorities of failing to find the real perpetrators who placed a grenade inside the church, who planned the Easter Sunday attacks and those who have harassed the media in the past.

Commenting on the grenade incident, Ranjith said the grenade had been set up to explode on the day. He said the police arrested four innocents including the sacristan of the Church who had picked the grenade up. “These four had no idea what a grenade was. This is why the sacristan picked it up innocently. He did not understand it was a grenade” he said.

The Archbishop remarked that the Minister in Charge of the Police and the Secretary of Defence hastily pointed fingers at the four individuals without conducting a thorough investigation or reviewing the CCTV footage at that time. “This is how justice works in this country. Big shots can remain free even after committing a murder. There is no rule of law. There is only the law of the powerful,” he alleged.

He urged the Government to launch a comprehensive investigation into the incident but expressed scepticism about its execution. Ranjith stated, “We are yet to witness justice being served for those responsible for the Easter Sunday attacks. The perpetrators behind the disappearance of Prageeth Ekneligoda and the killing of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramatunga remain unknown. It appears that these critical issues have been overlooked, with authorities seemingly prioritising international concerns over resolving domestic challenges in the country.”

### CID arrests self-proclaimed ‘Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara’

*2024-01-16 01:08:53 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/news/CID-arrests-self-proclaimed-Bodhisattva-Avalokiteshvara/56-757394)*

Investigators of the Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Mahinda Kodituwakku, a man professing to be the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara yesterday in Pannipitiya.

Kodituwakku who suddenly shot to fame recently through viral videos of him preaching flanked by groups of followers is being accused of distorting Buddhist teachings and engaging in irreligious activities.

According to Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa, the suspect has been apprehended on four charges, including violations under the Computer Crimes Act. Additionally, Thalduwa said he faces allegations of insulting the Buddhist doctrine by delivering various sermons, thereby offending religious sentiment.

The Police Spokesperson said the suspect is also facing charges under Sections 291 (a) and 291 (b) of the Penal Code for allegedly uttering words with the explicit intent of causing religious offence and insulting the religion or beliefs of a specific class. Charges under the Money Laundering Act have also been brought against Kodituwakku.

On 12 January the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court also imposed an overseas travel ban on him after the police received many complaints, particularly from Buddhist clergy against his activities.

The Magistrate issued the order following Senior Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dileepa Peiris requesting a travel ban as it was required for an investigation led by the CID’s Computer Crimes Division.

Peiris revealed that the suspect, who recently arrived from Egypt, organised extravagant ceremonies to welcome himself at the Bandaranaike International Airport and the Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya. He said ongoing investigations aim to ascertain whether the suspect misrepresented himself as a Bodhisattva to serve the objectives of a religious fundamentalist organisation or if he acted under the influence of a fundamentalist group. Concurrently, the suspect is under investigation for potential violations of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

DSG Peiris accused the suspect of exploiting religion for personal financial gain. He highlighted that the suspect’s sermons, disseminated through his YouTube channel, distort Buddhism and pose significant dangers. Furthermore, he noted that the suspect has publicly admitted to sexually abusing his daughter, potentially making him liable to charges of sexual abuse of a minor. The case against Kodituwakku will be taken up again on 17 January.

Meanwhile, the Mahanayaka Theras also sent a letter to President Ranil Wickramasinghe over the weekend urging him to institute the requisite legal measures to enforce the law against persons involved in distorting Buddha Dharma.

In Buddhism, Avalokiteshvara is a tenth-level bodhisattva associated with great compassion.

### Economy 2024: More challenging than the two previous years

*2024-01-16 00:22:42 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Economy-2024-More-challenging-than-the-two-previous-years/4-757391)*

Unless correct policies are adopted from now onward, becoming a rich country by 2048 will simply be a wish only

It seems that IMF is working with numbers which are pleasing to their ears ignoring the wider external debt problem which the country is faced with. Once Sri Lanka begins to repay the whole debt, it will not be able to maintain the current low-level equilibrium that involves relative stability in the exchange rate, on one side, and the balance in the current account of the balance of payments, on the other

Sri Lanka has entered 2024 having passed 2022, the year of the severest economic crisis, and 2023, the year of the beginning of economic recovery. Having followed an economic recovery package as agreed with IMF for an extended fund facility or EFF, Sri Lanka should now consolidate its position to retain the hard-earned macroeconomic stability and push the economy to a high growth path needed for delivering permanent prosperity to its people. However, the present stability experienced by Sri Lanka is at a low-level equilibrium as observed by the Presidential economic advisor, Dr. Sharmini Cooray in the 2023 Central Bank Anniversary Oration (available at: https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/about/speech_20231102_CBSL_73_anniversary_oration_e.pdf).

What she meant by a low-level equilibrium was that though high inflation has been brought down to an affordable rate of about 5% and the exchange rate from close to Rs. 400 to about Rs. 320 a dollar, that has been attained at a low level of GDP, that is, $ 77 billion in 2022 compared with $ 85 in 2021. The average income of a Sri Lankan, if distributed equally among them and known as per capita income, has also fallen from $ 3,997 in 2021 to $ 3,474 in 2022. Hence, on average, all Sri Lankans have become poorer.

At this level of per capita income, Sri Lanka is categorised by the World Bank as a lower middle-income country because it is a way above the threshold of $ 1,135 attributable to a low income or a poor country. However, the Sri Lanka Government requested the World Bank in late 2022 to treat it as a poor country for the disbursement of concessional funds from the World Bank group. This request has, as a special case, now been granted by the Bank. Hence, Sri Lanka today is like a person who has on paper academic qualifications equivalent to a university degree, but his knowledge is so poor that he is assigned the work that can be handled by a person with only GCE (Advanced level) qualification.

It is just an instance of voluntarily becoming poorer in front of the rest of the world because it helps the country to get low-cost foreign aid. Thus, the GDP numbers released by the authorities do not reflect the true position of Sri Lankans. This is a stigma. Accordingly, the biggest challenge which Sri Lanka faces in 2024 or in later years is to have it removed and show the world that it is not a poor country anymore. But like the proverbial ‘beggar’s wound’, the incentives are to continue to enjoy this stigma.

Sri Lanka enters the new year with a friendly but significantly serious warning by IMF. According to IMF’s Communications Director Julie Kozack, though the progress of the current EFF program is satisfactory, the country should complete the negotiations with the external commercial creditors and implement the agreements with official creditors for the restructuring of the selected items of the central government external debt (available at: https://www.ft.lk/front-page/IMF-urges-swift-action-on-debt-restructuring/44-757364). For external debt restructuring purposes, only the commercial borrowings and those borrowed from bilateral sources were included.

The total public sector borrowings as at the end of 2021 amounted to $ 69 billion, made up of $ 45 billion by the central government and $ 24 billion by other public sector entities (see for details: https://www.ft.lk/columns/Child-s-guide-to-debt-restructuring-Not-a-cakewalk-but-a-task-entailing-hard-work/4-736706). Of this, only $ 33 billion or nearly a half was to be restructured. Even if this is successfully restructured, the problem of country’s foreign indebtedness remains unresolved.

2024 will be an election year, and it is unlikely that the energy and the talent pool of the Government could be diverted to this type of long-term planning. But with every passing moment, the country will lose valuable time which cannot be regained. But there is no choice in my view. The Central Bank with the support from IMF has stabilised the economy at a low-level equilibrium. If no proper policies are adopted to upgrade the real economic activities that will deliver richness and prosperity to people, it will be difficult for the country to maintain even this low-level equilibrium. This is a formidable challenge, and the Government should not take this challenge lightly

It seems that IMF is working with numbers which are pleasing to their ears ignoring the wider external debt problem which the country is faced with. Once Sri Lanka begins to repay the whole debt, it will not be able to maintain the current low-level equilibrium that involves relative stability in the exchange rate, on one side, and the balance in the current account of the balance of payments, on the other.

She has expressed the IMF’s satisfaction about the restructuring of the domestic debt, tagged as domestic debt optimisation by the Sri Lanka Government, in 2023. The reference here is the decision of the Government to pass the entire burden of the domestic debt relief on to the superannuation and pension funds. Among them, the chief burden-bearers are the largest private sector superannuation fund, Employees’ Provident Fund or EPF managed by the Central Bank, and the Employees’ Trust Fund or ETF, managed by a separate board of trustees.

These two funds as well as other provident and pension funds were told by the Government that if they would not agree to the proposed optimisation, they would be subject to an income tax of 30% instead of the 14% they were paying at that time. The tax of 30% was justified because that was the tax paid by other financial institutions and, therefore, it was an equalisation of the tax rates. I discussed in a previous article how this tax comparison would fall on EPF unfairly because EPF and other funds paid taxes on the gross income while financial institutions paid it on the net income (available at: https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-misunderstood-taxation-of-EPF-and-other-superannuation-funds/4-750423).

Accordingly, the amounts of taxes paid by EPF on its gross income would be 70% in 2020, 88% in 2021, and 490% in 2022 when recalculated on the tax base of net income applicable to financial institutions. The other bond holders were freed from this burden and equity in distributing burden required the Government to treat all of them equally.

I therefore pointed out in the article under reference as follows: “If the pain is passed on to all the bondholders equally, it would have been a fair and equitable treatment. Though there is a fear that it would lead to instability of the financial system, that could be avoided it the pain is transferred to all equally. Then the people would have felt that they have been treated fairly. Such a trust is a must when a country goes through a painful adjustment to come out of a serious economic crisis”. But the plan of passing the burden on the superannuation fund holders was carried out as planned. However, it involved the reduction of the earnings of EPF members by a significant margin by Rs. 274 billion over the period 2024 to 2038 (available at: https://www.ft.lk/columns/Apologetic-custodian-of-EPF-also-a-victim/4-753076).

It is about this treatment of the domestic debt that IMF’s communications head has expressed her satisfaction. Since EPF earnings are likely to be lower than 9% after paying a tax of 14%, it will be a challenge for the Government to ensure a minimum rate of return of 9% to EPF members as promised in the debt optimisation plan. It is in fact an unnecessary waste of the taxpayers’ money if the Treasury meets this shortfall.

Sri Lanka’s avowed goal is to deliver richness to its people by 2048 when the country celebrates the centenary of independence from Britain. This is a challenging task since the country is now going through a low-growth scenario till at least 2027. In 2022, it was a negative growth of 7.8% and in 2023, it is projected to have a negative growth of about 4%. From 2024 to 2026, the growth will be at an annual average rate of about 2% according to the forecasts made by both IMF and the World Bank. According to these forecasts, the country will return to the size of its economy which it had in 2021. That amounts to a GDP of $ 85 billion. It is from this level that the country will have to move up to become a rich country by 2048.

I have discussed the main challenges involved in a previous article in this series (available at: https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-Magic-2048-What-is-to-be-done-to-make-Ranilnomics-a-reality/4-747608). In this article, the main challenge has been identified as follows: “In terms of the World Bank classifications, a country will become a rich country if its gross national income or GNI per head reaches the threshold of $ 12,000 and remain at that level or above thereafter. Over the next 25 years, Sri Lanka’s population also will increase requiring the country to produce more to reach this level. The population of the country has been rising at about 1% per annum in the past. But the future population projections are made based on demographic changes. Accordingly, for Sri Lanka, two population projections were made, one at an average growth of half a percent per annum and the other at an average growth of a little over a fifth of a percent. In the first one, the population will rise to 25.4 million by 2048. In the second one, Sri Lanka’s population will peak in 2035 and begin to fall thereafter.

Since EPF earnings are likely to be lower than 9% after paying a tax of 14%, it will be a challenge for the Government to ensure a minimum rate of return of 9% to EPF members as promised in the debt optimisation plan. It is in fact an unnecessary waste of the taxpayers’ money if the Treasury meets this shortfall

“By 2048, its population will be 21.9 million, a little more than its population in 2021.

In terms of the first projection, to generate a GNI per capita of $ 12,000, the total GNI should rise to $ 305 billion or an increase of 243% over the period. The average growth per annum should be about 12%. In terms of the second projection, the GNI should be $ 263 billion marking an increase of 196% over this period. It marks an annual increase, on average, of 10%. Therefore, the annual economic growth to be maintained from 2028 to 2048 will be between 10 and 12% if Sri Lanka is to become a rich country by that last year of the period. This is again a formidable challenge for future

This is a formidable challenge. Unless correct policies are adopted from now onward, becoming a rich country by 2048 will simply be a wish only as it had happened on many occasions in the past. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the nation in June 2023, announced that he would be following the Growth Lab approach developed by the Center for International Development or CID of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government (available at: https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/special-statement-delivered-by-president-ranil-wickremesinghe-full-text/). Wickremesinghe has a particular love for CID because he himself had been an alumnus of this prestigious institution.

He explained the Growth Lab approach as follows: “Under the Lab approach, we will bring together Government Ministers, government officials, subject matter experts, and key representatives from the private sector to collaboratively engage in detailed discussions over a period of six weeks. The aim is to collaboratively resolve any roadblocks hindering the roll-out of investments and projects by listening carefully to the private sector. During these discussions, comprehensive implementation plans will be developed, and the necessary facilities to support the implementation of these projects will be organised. Government stakeholders involved in the Labs will dedicate their full-time efforts to ensure the successful execution of these projects. As President, I, along with the Cabinet Ministers, will actively participate in this event to demonstrate the government’s commitment to ensuring success of the Lab process”.

The timeline announced was that the lab will be convened in the third quarter of 2023, its report ready by September 2023, and it will be presented to people for their review, suggestions, and approval before the end of 2023. That will be unveiled for implementation as a ‘national transformation plan’. This plan will be based on four important pillars: reforming both the fiscal and financial sectors, driving investments for accelerated economic growth, introducing social protection to the vulnerable and the implementing a strong good governance program, and transforming the state-owned enterprises or SOEs to function as profit centres.

While these are important goals, they do not cover all the required strategies that should be adopted. For instance, they do not include a human resource development plan to upgrade the country’s human capital to a creative capital stock, encouraging the professionals who are leaving the country to contribute to the country’s development through a system of reverse migration, and introducing high technology to the country’s production structure to help it to compete successfully in the global markets.

Sri Lanka’s avowed goal is to deliver richness to its people by 2048 when the country celebrates the centenary of independence from Britain. This is a challenging task since the country is now going through a low-growth scenario till at least 2027. In 2022, it was a negative growth of 7.8% and in 2023, it is projected to have a negative growth of about 4%. From 2024 to 2026, the growth will be at an annual average rate of about 2% according to the forecasts made by both IMF and the World Bank. According to these forecasts, the country will return to the size of its economy which it had in 2021. That amounts to a GDP of $ 85 billion. It is from this level that the country will have to move up to become a rich country by 2048

Even with the limited scope announced, the Government has missed all these milestones in the timeline. Hence, they will have to be redated for 2024. But 2024 will be an election year, and it is unlikely that the energy and the talent pool of the Government could be diverted to this type of long-term planning. But with every passing moment, the country will lose valuable time which cannot be regained. But there is no choice in my view. The Central Bank with the support from IMF has stabilised the economy at a low-level equilibrium. If no proper policies are adopted to upgrade the real economic activities that will deliver richness and prosperity to people, it will be difficult for the country to maintain even this low-level equilibrium.

This is a formidable challenge, and the Government should not take this

### Now, to those taxes

*2024-01-15 23:46:44 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Now-to-those-taxes/4-757374)*

While a State needs tax revenue to meets its expenses, it is widely acknowledged that high taxes act as a disincentive to investment, and consequently, development. In Sri Lanka, it is money taken from a relatively efficient sector to an inefficient State, mainly to pay its debts and to keep afloat many white elephants in an overall unproductive   sector. The most objectionable are the indirect taxes like the ‘VAT’ that leave a deep dent in the average purse, already reeling from the effects of a drastically devalued currency

“Alongside  decayed roués with dubious means of subsistence and of dubious origin, alongside ruined and adventurous offshoots of the bourgeoisie, were vagabonds , discharged soldiers, discharged jailbirds, escaped galley slaves, rogues, mountebanks, lazzaroni, pickpockets, tricksters, gamblers, maquereaus, brothel keepers, porters, literati, organ-grinders, rag-pickers, knife-grinders, tinkers, beggars, in short, the whole indefinite, disintegrated mass, thrown hither and thither, which the French term, la boheme” -The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte-Karl Marx

No, in the above quote Marx was not describing the Sri Lankan Parliament!

In this instance, Marx’s searing analysis, couched in his accustomed vivacity, was directed at a French social class of early 19th century he describes as the ‘lumpen- proletariat’, which by and large had supported Louis Bonaparte in his quest for the Presidency of France in 1848.Three years later, in 1851, Bonaparte staged a coup d’etat, soaring above the class struggle, that was thought to be imminent. His ascendency despaired outstanding thinkers of the era like Victor Hugo and Karl Marx, who saw Louis Bonaparte as an imposter, a grotesque mediocrity playing the role of a hero.

It was inevitable that Bonaparte would invite comparisons to his epoch making uncle, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Marx mocks the nephew’s (Louis Bonaparte) coup, comparing it with Napoleon Bonaparte’s coup of 1799 on Eighteenth Brumaire. Adopting German philosopher Hegel’s idea that world spirit causes the re-enactment of events, Marx opened his thesis with the celebrated line that history repeats, first as a tragedy (Emperor Napoleon) and then as a farce (nephew Louis Bonaparte). It is uncertain whether Marx accepted the Hegel aphorism as a historical truism, but in the case of Napoleon and his far less illustrious nephew, a telling line indeed.

For France, the 18th and 19th centuries were tumultuous; the land of revolutions, class wars, communes and Napoleon. Marx anticipated a triumphant revolution, but it did not evolve that way. Today France is a highly productive and prosperous country, boasting a vibrant cultural life. Like most western countries, high standards of living across the board have made class definitions and antagonisms meaningless. Uncommonly perceptive Marx may have been, but theoretical postulates must bow to obvious realities. As historian Fukuyama suggests, “history” as an unbroken chain of class struggles may not be tenable in context. That is not to say that human societies will remain static. In time, there is bound to be turmoil and even cataclysmic upheaval, but perhaps not quite on the lines as suggested by Karl Marx.

While the enormous validity of Marx is undeniable, it is also an important factor that his focus was primarily on Europe, then a melting pot of social, economic, national as well as religious ideas. These were years of incredible ferment; everything old was challenged, examined and reformed, if not discarded. Asia was a distant continent, backward and primitive, evoking only an occasional comment from Marx, often derisive. Weak societies, stuck in a mind-set of a bygone era; awash with dark superstitions, in the choking grasp of incompetent despots; they were in no position to resist the European colonisation

Almost every institution we now behold in this country, whether it be the parliament or the judiciary, medical profession or the constabulary, the game of cricket or political parties, owe their introduction to that colonial intrusion.

‘History’ may have ended, ‘races’ have not. In the modern world, certain “peoples” have proved themselves capable of running complex systems, building huge economies, expanding intellectual horizons, providing a high standard of living for its citizens, while at the same time, ensuring a sturdy democratic structure. The endless lines of hopefuls waiting at their door for a better life, is evidence enough of their success, and, a damning testimony to the failure of the feeder countries.

There are other races that have achieved some benchmarks, but not all; successfully building large economies and improving the life of their citizens, relative to the condition they were in before.

There is a third group, repeatedly going from tragedy to comedy, in an endless cycle; limited, inept and fundamentally corrupt. In these countries, in times when the State predominates, their systems are distinguished by corruption, incompetence and stagnation (SriLanka 1970-77). When their private sector comes to the fore, it is cronyism, exploitation and plunder, the free market interpreted by coarse temperaments, through their avaricious eyes

Whether it is State run or private sector heavy, the glaring truth is that Sri Lanka has one of the weakest industrial bases in Asia. Typically, we have clung on to garments, an industry with very little specialisation or innovation and one that keeps migrating to poorer economies (with poor wages) in order to be viable. If not for the plantations established more than two centuries ago, and our blue collar workers in the Middle East, the show would have ended much earlier.

Sri Lanka being a tiny economy, it is inevitable that most businesses are either suppliers or work contractors for the Government. Neither party needs tuition on what makes the system work!

The so called old elite, a comprador class created by the needs of the colonial era, has now given way to a new elite, a parvenu class. If the former were a tragedy, now we have the farce! They are unmistakable; in appearance undistinguished, the expensive designer brands and the contrived casualness sitting awkwardly on the essentially provincial character; ingratiating, self-promoting, slithery; our new rich have all the vices of the old, but none of their virtues! If the former attracted mockery, the latter invites

We do not have an Asian Marx to vivisect the sorry mimic we have made of the adopted system. If there were to be, what he beholds would provide him endless scope for contempt. A lamentable scene, where every aspect of the adopted system is understood only partially, interpreted perversely and works in contradiction of its very purpose.

Our Constitution is a good case in point. Once elected, Sri Lankan politicians become omniscient, the little matter of constitutional tinkering taken in their stride. With cavalier disregard for the consequences (Constitutions are generally rigid, resistant to change) they play at law making. Before the introduction of the 1978 Constitution its spiritual author JR Jayewardene advanced the case for a presidential system, arguing that Sri Lanka needed such a system to embark on our rapid development and that a President carrying a personal mandate from the people need not be deterred in that endeavour by the pressures and restrains that a parliamentary system would necessarily impose. Whatever the legal technicalities may be, the very constitution has now allowed an unelected person to be appointed by Parliament to that

While a State needs tax revenue to meets its expenses, it is widely acknowledged that high taxes act as a disincentive to investment, and consequently, development. In Sri Lanka, it is money taken from a relatively efficient sector to an inefficient State, mainly to pay its debts and to keep afloat many white elephants in an overall unproductive   sector. The most objectionable are the indirect taxes like the ‘VAT’ that leave a deep dent in the average purse, already reeling from the effects of a drastically devalued

And, this is a country where politicians are collecting millions in the guise of election funds, without receipts and without tax!

It is basic to the spirit of democracy that for a Government to impose taxes on the people, must first have a mandate to govern from the people. There cannot be taxation without representation. Leave aside the President, it is extremely doubtful whether the parliamentary majority today   enjoys the trust and confidence of the people any longer. Democracy is not only the holding of periodic elections. For it to have any meaning, the true spirit of democracy must be alive in the hearts and minds of its putative practitioners. If we use the experiences of the past 70 years as a gauge, for these hearts and minds, democracy is just another business, a sure way of hogging the public stage.

When we began our new journey in 1948, there were high expectations. For 70 years we journeyed gaudily and noisily; 70 long years of bombast, phrase-mongering and grandstanding. Now that all this hoopla has ended in a messy train wreck, we see all our post 1948 leaders in true light; second rate men: empty characters with monstrous egos; men of small deeds and big talk.

Not the wreckers of the country, not the beneficiaries from the sleaze, not those who enjoyed all the pageantry and the privileges of the State; the burden has fallen squarely on the millions of our impoverished citizens. Their unelected President demands it. Their elected representatives in Parliament have voted for it.

### IMF team overseeing Sri Lanka’s bailout programme visits Jaffna

*2024-01-15 23:22:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96428/imf-team-overseeing-sri-lankas-bailout-programme-visits-jaffna)*

A team of senior IMF officials overseeing Sri Lanka’s bailout programme has toured the Tamil-dominated Northern district of Jaffna for the first time under the current USD 2.9 billion agreement, officials said on Monday.

Led by Peter Brueur, the International Monetary Fund senior mission chief for Sri Lanka, the team last week met with the Governor of the Northern province, PMS Charles, and other senior officials and discussed issues related to economic growth in the province, demining programmes, resettlement of conflict-displaced individuals and compensation for conflict victims.

They also discussed the educational matters related to Jaffna University, post-COVID operations, and the adverse effects of climate change on the northern region, the officials said.

The team, which returned to Colombo on Monday, is scheduled to engage with the finance ministry. Talks are expected with Shehan Semasinghe, the state minister of finance, who leads the local IMF engagement under President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The discussions in Colombo are anticipated to focus on the targets outlined in the current IMF programme, which advocates large scale economic reforms in the island nation.

In a meeting with President Wickremesinghe on Thursday last, Brueur had expressed satisfaction with Sri Lanka’s progress in implementing reforms aimed at revitalising the economy.

The global lender had commended Sri Lanka for its advancements in policy-oriented variables and fiscal consolidation.

Sri Lanka, which declared its first-ever debt default in April 2022, had secured an IMF bailout agreement of USD 2.9 billion over four years by the last quarter of 2022.

The first tranche of USD 1.5 billion was released in March 2023, with the second installment of USD 337 million arriving in December 2023 following the first review.

### Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Platforms may invest in Sri Lanka Telecom - report

*2024-01-15 23:12:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96427/mukesh-ambanis-jio-platforms-may-invest-in-sri-lanka-telecom-report)*

Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani has plans to expand his horizons in the telecommunications business through his firm Jio Platforms, expressing interest in buying stake in Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, the state-owned telecom company, Indian media reported.

The Sri Lankan government has been struggling with the cash-strapped Telecom PLC, as current authorities continue to push for privatisation of many sectors to revive the economy amid the recent financial crisis.

Sri Lankan government had invited applications from potential bidders for Sri Lanka Telecom PLC by November 10, and Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Platforms was one of three companies that expressed interest in buying the stake of the firm, reported Moneycontrol.

The Sri Lankan government on January 12 issued a press release where it named Jio Platforms as one of the potential bidders for their government telecom company. Apart from Jio, the other two companies in the running are Gortune International Investment Holding Ltd and Pettigo Comercio International LDA.

The press release further said that the proposals by the company will be “evaluated as per the Special Guidelines on Divestiture of State-Owned Enterprises approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.”

Sri Lanka has been mandated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to push for the privatisation of all the non-core sectors in the country, in order to pull the Sri Lanka out of the deep cash shortage that triggered the anti-government protests in 2022.

With the Sri Lankan investment, Reliance’s Jio Platform is hoping to enter and dominate the global telecom market. Currently, Jio is market leader among all Indian telecom service providers.

Latest figures released by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) showed that Jio added 31.59 lakh mobile users in October 2023, significantly more that top competitor Bharti Airtel.

Recently, Reliance and Jio shares rallied on the stock market after Mukesh Ambani’s investment announcements at Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2024 in Gandhinagar last week. The jump in shares led to Mukesh Ambani reclaiming the spot of the richest person in Asia.

### BREAKING: Red Sea crisis heats up as Houthi missile hits US cargo ship

Colombo (News 1st) – Tensions rose further in the Middle East as a Houthi missile fired from Yemen hit a U.S.-owned cargo ship in the Red Sea late Monday (15th), raising the possibility of more U.S. military strikes on Yemen in response, foreign media reported.

The merchant vessel Gibraltar Eagle, flying the flag of the Marshall Islands, was hit in the Red Sea by an anti-ship ballistic missile fired from Yemen by the Houthis, but has not suffered any significant damage and is continuing on its way, U.S. Central Command said.

A second missile that was fired had malfunctioned and crashed on land in Yemen.

The Houthi attacks came a few days after the U.S. and U.K. struck multiple targets across Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen with over 100 bombs and missiles. The Houthis have vowed revenge against the US, UK and any nation that helps the coalition.

The Houthis have been staging attacks against ships in the Red Sea for more than a month, claiming that they are only targeting ships bound to or from Israel or are connected to Israel in some way.

Most of the world's largest shipping firms have suspended sending vessels through the Red Sea and are now using the much longer route around Africa. This has driven shipping rates up and caused some disruption to global supply chains.

### Person remanded over sword attack on teenager in Ragama

The Welisara Magistrate’s Court has ordered a suspect who was arrested over attacking a teenage boy with a sword and was in hiding for 11 days, to be remanded in custody until January 19.

On January 04, the suspect had attacked a 14-year-old child with a sword over a dispute that had occurred between the two groups of people, the police said.

It is reported that a finger of the child’s left hand had been severed due to the sword attack.

However, the suspect, Dilruk Prashantha Silva, a father-of-three, had surrendered to police after evading arrest for 11 days, following the discharge of the victim from the hospital, the police said.

Nevertheless, on Sunday (15) Welisara Magistrate Thusitha Dhammika Uduwawidana ordered the suspect to be remanded in custody, after considering a request made by Ragama Police stating that the investigations are still underway in search of the sword used in the attack.

Attorney-at-Law Shamindra Soysa, who appeared on behalf of the victimized child before the courts, had previously filed a motion alleging that the police, who had arrested the suspect previously, had released the suspect due to the pressure exerted on the investigating officers by a senior police officer.

The magistrate, who took all facts presented into consideration, ordered the case to be recalled on January 19, 2024 and also ordered the police to report the progress of the investigations related to the case to the courts on the aforementioned date.

### Beyond Plantations: Kahawatte’s holistic approach to sustainable prosperity

*2024-01-15 19:43:00 - [islandlk](http://island.lk/beyond-plantations-kahawattes-holistic-approach-to-sustainable-prosperity/)*

Our latest Regional Plantation Company (RPC) Innovation Update highlights one of Sri Lanka’s trailblazers in sustainable, ethical and community-centric plantation management – Kahawatte Plantations PLC (KWPL) under the MJF Group.

KWPL was established in alignment with the MJF Group’s vision that ‘Business is a Matter of Human Service’, As such their pioneering initiatives not only boost agricultural excellence but also significantly uplift the living standards of their plantation communities and beyond.

KWPL has been at the forefront of a broader movement aimed at fostering innovation and standardizing plantation practices to harmonize economic goals with profound social responsibility. The company has been an advocate for a progressive model that integrates comprehensive welfare programs, environmental stewardship, and community empowerment into its corporate ethos, thus supporting the progressive evolution of Sri Lanka’s plantation industry.

With a history steeped in the rich tradition of Ceylon tea, rubber, cinnamon and an array of diverse crops, KWPL’s journey is marked by its pursuit of excellence in every leaf and life it touches.

The company’s strategic approach goes beyond cultivating crops; it cultivates a sustainable future for all its stakeholders. KWPL’s people-centric strategy is a proactive step towards the diverse ways in which an industry leader can contribute to both the sector and the personnel at its frontlines.

KWPL’s estates span12,400 hectares across the Nawalapitiya and Sabaragamuwa plantation districts. Within each, KWPL is engaged in cultivating tea, cinnamon, rubber, and timber. In the last three years, the company has further expanded its portfolio by venturing into coffee, coconut, and pepper cultivation as part of a strategic diversification that will further strengthen the company’s resilience to increasingly volatile global market conditions, and enhance its value addition potential.

From its inception, Kahawatte has been driven by the philosophy of its parent body, propelling it to take the lead in various community welfare programs across the sixteen estates under its care. What distinguishes these initiatives is their profound impact, as the benefits transcend the plantation population, positively influencing neighbouring communities.

Moreover, the company is committed to a significant investment of Rs. 120 million in the fiscal year 2023/2024 towards development initiatives. This substantial investment will encompass the enhancement of 20 Childhood Development Centres (CDCs), restroom facilities, re-roofing projects, and healthcare centres.

Ringing in the new year for Sri Lankans was an increase in the value-added tax (VAT) rate to 18% and a withdrawal of tax exemptions on several goods and services. The last day of 2023 witnessed long queues as people rushed to stock up on essentials such as fuel and gas. Although queues are a familiar sight following the onset of the economic crisis, this time around, it was to avoid being hit with the VAT hike.

In light of these developments, this blog aims to shed light on VAT, offering a brief overview and delving into the potential implications of the increase, particularly on the poor and vulnerable.

There are both pros and cons to VAT. While VAT offers a means for governments to generate revenue without overcharging the wealthy, its downside lies in imposing a substantial economic burden on lower-income groups, as consumers ultimately bear the tax burden.

In an attempt to raise government revenue, the VAT rate on applicable goods and services increased from 15% to 18% starting 01st January 2024. This amendment brought 97 previously VAT-exempt goods and services including, fuel, gas, telecommunication services, as well as several food products manufactured using locally cultivated grains, locally manufactured coconut milk, and certain dairy products (locally produced), under the tax umbrella. Items that continue to be VAT-exempt include medicines, educational services, public passenger transport services, and food products such as infant milk powder, locally manufactured rice, bread, etc.

Along with the change in tax rates, the VAT threshold for businesses was also reduced to an annual turnover of LKR 60 million (from LKR 80 million) and LKR 15 million per taxable period (from LKR 20 million). These changes to VAT are expected to generate revenues of around LKR 1,400 billion in 2024.

The tax rate increase and the threshold reduction for businesses liable for VAT signals that more items are applicable for VAT at a higher percentage than before. Although this affects all households, it adds an excessive burden on the already struggling poor and vulnerable groups grappling with the concurrent crises from COVID-19 in 2020 to the ongoing economic crisis.

The fuel price hikes, a direct consequence of the new VAT rates, are expected to trigger a domino effect on the prices of various consumer goods and services, potentially leading to inflation. Although inflation has been low since mid-2023 compared to the beginning of the year, the latter part of 2023 (October to December) witnessed a relative increase in inflation. As per the Colombo Consumer Price Index, inflation between September to December 2023 was recorded as 1.3%, 1.5%, 3.4% and 4.0% respectively. The VAT reforms are likely to add to inflationary pressures in 2024. This, in turn, will further reduce the purchasing power of already constrained households.

A survey conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) in 2023 on the impacts of the economic crisis revealed that over 60% of households in the country experienced a decrease in income since March 2022. The survey also finds that over 90% of households experienced an increase in their monthly household expenditure due to the economic crisis. The findings further reveal that 99% of households that experienced a rise in expenditure witnessed an increase in food expenditure. The combination of reduced income and rising expenses is poised to constrain consumer spending, particularly affecting goods and services subject to VAT. For example, the survey results reveal that 83% of households whose expenditure increased due to the economic crisis experienced a rise in transport costs. Following the imposition of VAT on petrol and diesel (previously VAT exempt), the price hike in these commodities will further escalate household expenditure on transport. This will compel some households to self-impose restrictions on the use of certain modes of transport or find alternate solutions due to unaffordability concerns.

Purchasing power constraints force households to adopt various coping strategies to minimise the impacts of these adverse shocks. Around 74% of households that experienced a decline in income did not employ any coping strategies to mitigate the impact while around 7% resorted to a secondary job or additional source of income. Conversely, to cope with the impact of rising expenditure, households employed multiple mechanisms such as limiting/controlling expenses (75%), dietary changes (75%) and reducing/withdrawing savings (46.4%), etc. It is interesting to note that most households chose to adopt coping mechanisms only with respect to mitigating the impact on expenditure although a majority experienced income loss as well.

In the absence of savings – particularly among the poor and vulnerable due to the consecutive adverse shocks –households are likely to borrow to cover their essential expenses. As per survey findings, 55% of households in the country are currently indebted with 22% of such households in debt to meet daily food requirements. Interestingly, 22% of households have accumulated outstanding debt due to the economic crisis while the majority (78%) have not. However, it is concerning that over half of Sri Lankan households are presently indebted, and a considerable share face financial constraints to satisfy essential needs. The VAT reforms are likely to impact these households further through amplified indebtedness due to increased borrowings from both official and unofficial channels. This limits the possibility of timely recovery from shocks as concerns such as repayment challenges will arise in the future. Hence, in addition to struggling at present, the poor and vulnerable are also at risk of facing more prolonged periods of struggle even as the country’s economic crisis subsides.

It is important to support the poor to cope with the VAT hike at least through targeted initiatives that cater to the most vulnerable groups. Using existing social protection programmes to identify the most vulnerable households and providing them with some form of concessions such as reduced prices on certain VAT-liable goods and services that are frequently used by these groups is one such option.

Targeted transfers are another option. While cash transfers are already provided to eligible poor and vulnerable groups in the country it is important to assess if the amounts received by these groups are sufficient to cope with the ongoing crisis and the burden of indirect taxes. Another option worth considering is to provide needy households with dry rations/nutritious food commodities since low-income households spend a large portion of their total expenditure on food and this share may increase further due to the VAT reforms. Further, although it was mentioned that essential items such as fruits and vegetables will not be taxed, these items too are likely to go up in prices due to the indirect nature of the tax.

Although it is too early to assess the true impacts of the VAT amendments on the poor and vulnerable’s ability to survive, they are certainly at elevated risk of facing unaffordability which in turn triggers countless other obstacles. While the degree of the abovementioned risks can vary by household, they can only be measured upon the availability of sufficient consumption data over the upcoming months. Proactive measures, such as timely support in the form of targeted initiatives and concessions, can not only alleviate the immediate challenges but also contribute to the resilience and recovery of the most vulnerable segments of the population.

### Sri Lanka rupee not a one-way bet, hedging instruments, deepening needed: CB Governor

*2024-01-15 19:14:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-rupee-not-a-one-way-bet-hedging-instruments-deepening-needed-cb-governor-147314/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rupee is no longer a one-way bet, and the Central Bank would like to see a deeper market with more hedging instruments in the future Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

“We all know in the past the exchange rate has been a one-way bet, and there has been a lot of speculation,” Governor Weerasinghe said delivering an annual policy speech on January 10.

“Now we have been able to address that part. It is no longer a one way bet. It responds to demand and supply conditions and we will intervene to smoothen out any excess volatility.”

Governor Weerasinghe also dismantled most of the trading controls imposed during the period of inflationary domestic operations, which triggered forex shortages, allowing forex markets to work.

“And also in this kind of environment we would take steps to foster a deeper and more liquid domestic foreign exchange market, that is basically run by you,” he told bankers in the audience.

The central wanted a deeper and more liquid FX market also hedging instruments to hedge exposure for businesses, he said.

“This would be further supported by implementing the FX Global Code in the domestic foreign exchange market, providing a common set of guidance to promote a robust, fair, liquid, open, and appropriately transparent market in which market participants could confidently and effectively transact at competitive prices that reflect available market information.”

The central bank has launched the first phase of an  International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) in 2023 to collect data on cross-border transactions and foreign currency transactions daily from the banking system.

“The Central Bank plans to report monthly data pertaining to the external current account, particularly on trade in services, based on ITRS data from 2024 onwards,” Governor Weerasinghe said.

“Going forward, all banks are urged to continue to support the development of the ITRS system and to ensure the coverage, accuracy and timeliness of data.”

Under Governor Weerasinghe’s watch the rupee has appreciated from 360 to around 330 to the US dollar on complementary monetary policy.

Sri Lanka rupee came under pressure from large liquidity injections made to suppress rates before and after intervening in forex markets to maintain the exchange rate, driving unsustainable credit over 2021 and 2022, (inflationary monetary policy) triggering reserve losses.

In 2022 March, an attempt was made to float the currency without hiking rates sufficiently and with a surrender rule (buying dollars while the rupee was falling), leading to steep collapse of the rupee to 360 to the US dollar from around 200.

Since the setting up of the central bank in 1950 the rupee has been busted from 4.70 to the US dollar, in a worse fall than Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, all of which started at the same rate as currencies derived from the Indian rupee, which was originally silver based.

Governor Weerasinghe in April 2022 hiked rates, possibly ending hyperinflation and market dollarization, and established a guidance peg at which dollars were bought from banks.

In March the surrender rule was lifted and under his watch the rupee appreciated to around 330 to the US dollar.

Since then, the rupee has fluctuated between 320 to 330 to the US dollar under muted private credit conditions and largely deflationary policy (central bank selling down its Treasuries stock and withdrawing liquidity from dollar purchases).

Analysts have however warned that when private credit picks up, the central bank in the past has resumed inflationary policy to suppress rates, losing its ability to collect reserves, triggering depreciation, and social unrest through rising energy and food prices and long run higher nominal rates.

Sri Lanka’s rupee, and currencies of most other countries that became unstable, started to fall steeply after the International Monetary Fund’s Second Amendment to its articles in 1978, which left countries without a credible anchor (or peg) for money allowing bureaucrats to choose bad ones and depreciate at will.

### Myanmar rebel group claims control of town bordering India, Bangladesh

*2024-01-15 18:47:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96423/myanmar-rebel-group-claims-control-of-town-bordering-india-bangladesh)*

An ethnic armed group in the western Myanmar state of Rakhine said it has taken control of a town bordering India and Bangladesh, marking the latest loss for the military government as it battles rebellion in several parts of the country.

Myanmar is in the throes of an insurgency on multiple fronts, where allied anti-junta groups backed by a pro-democracy parallel government have seized control of several military posts and towns. It is the biggest challenge the junta has faced since it mounted a coup against an elected government in 2021.

A spokesperson for the Arakan Army (AA) said late on Sunday it had conquered Paletwa, a port town on the Kaladan river that is key to trade with neighbouring countries.

“Regarding border stability issues, we will cooperate at our best with neighbouring countries,” said AA spokesperson Khine Thu Kha in a statement, adding the group will take over administration and law enforcement in the area.

A spokesperson for the junta did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not independently verify the AA’s claim.

The fall of Paletwa in the west comes after another rebel group in the Three Brotherhood Alliance took Laukkai town on the in northern Shan State on the border with China.

Last week, the junta agreed a ceasefire with that group, the TNLA, for the region bordering China. The talks were held in the Chinese city of Kunming and facilitated by Chinese officials.

But on Sunday, the rebel alliance said junta forces are breaching the ceasefire agreement, launching attacks in several townships in Shan State.

### Shritharan  Backed by Yoheswaran  Asks Sumanthiran not to Contest the ITAK President Election.

*2024-01-15 18:18:00 - [dbsjeyarajcom](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83440)*

“Suma, Shri And Yohes In Triangular Contest For ITAK/FP Leadership” was the heading of my article published in the “Daily Mirror”of 16 December 2024. Ihe article  was about the forthcoming  election for the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK) President post. The ITAK known as the Federal Party (FP) in English is the premier political Party of  the  Northern and Eastern  Tamils of  Sri Lanka.   Currently the ITAK/FP has six MPs in Parliament representing  the two Northern and three Eastern electoral districts.

As stated earlier the ITAK’s long delayed party convention is scheduled for  January 27 and 28 this year in Trincomalee. A crucial change of leadership is on the cards as the current ITAK President Somasuntharam Senathirajah known as “Maavai” is on the verge of “compulsory  retirement”. “Maavai” has been ITAK President since 2014.

Hence, a new President will be elected one week before   the convention  at a combined meeting of the ITAK “Podhu Sabhai”(General Council) and “Mathiya Seyal Kuzhu” (Central working Committee) to be held on 21 January in Trincomalee. Around 325  persons from the General council and 50 from the Central Working Committee will elect the new president.Voting is by secret ballot. Voting by proxy is not allowed.

Three contenders are in the fray for the ITAK Presidency. The three aspirants to the ITAK leadership  mantle are Mathiaparanan Abraham Sumanthiran, Sivagnanam Shritharan and SeenithambyYoheswaran. As is well known, Sumanthiran and Shritharan are both Jaffna district MP’s while Yogeswaran is a former Batticaloa district Parliamentarian.

The eldest of the competing trio, M A Sumanthiran  was  born in 1964 and is a lawyer by profession. He was first appointed as a national list MP in 2010. Subsequently he was elected to Parliament from the Jaffna district in the 2015 and 2020 elections.

S. Shritharan was  born in 1968. He is a former teacher and school principal. Shritharan was elected successively to Parliament from the Jaffna district in the 2010, 2015 and 2020 elections.

The youngest of the trio is S.Yoheswaran born in 1970. Yoheswaran’s vocation/profession  is social service.  Yoheswaran was elected from the Batticaloa district to Parliament in 2010 and 2015. He contested the 2020 polls but was not elected.

The nomination procedure requires a  minimum of six members of the Central Working Committee  to propose a name with the prospective candidate’s consent. In this instance Sumanthiran’s name was proposed by twelve persons while Shritharan and Yoheswaran were nominated by six persons each. They were from Kilinochchi and Batticaloa district respectively. Sumanthiran was nominated by four persons from Jaffna district and one each from the Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaitheevu,Vavuniya,Trincomalee,Batticaloa, Amparai and Colombo districts respectively.

The election to the party president post is  a “first” for the ITAK. Though the party constitution states an election must be held if there are two or more candidates, there has never been a presidential election in the ITAK’s 74 year old history. The Party’s co-founder and respected leader Samuel James Veluppillai Chelvanayagam venerated by his followers as “Thanthai Chelva” adopted the practice of   selecting a leader through a consensus among  senior leaders and obtaining approval from the rank and file at the party convention.

An election of a president for the first time therefore is a refreshing  feature as it strengthens inner -party democracy. However there were many within and without the ITAK who feared that a competitive election could result in  the party breaking up. These  worries were compounded  by the veiled threats issued on behalf of a potential candidate by his supporters that their man would form a new party or join another party if he was not elected president. There was concern that the party would be divided.

This writer too  had some concerns about an election. I felt that under prevailing circumstances , the holding of a presidential election could encourage fissiparous tendencies within the party and ultimately lead to fragmentation. The party could suffer a serious split. Besides an election could  create an opening for extraneous intervention by the global Tamil Diaspora, Elements in India and the Sri Lankan “deep state”

As such  I urged well-intentioned ITAK stalwarts and well-wishers to intervene and bring about a compromise among the candidates thereby avoiding an election.

I  called upon  ITAK leaders like Sampanthan, Maavai Senathirajah, CVK Sivagnanam, Kurukularajah to work positively and constructively in this regard. The ”Daily Mirror”article was translated into Tamil and published in Tamil newspapers. The feedback I received indicated that my viewpoint had struck a responsive chord in some   ITAK members, supporters and well-wishers.

Initially  there were reports of the ITAK’s “emeritus leader”  Rajavarothayam Sampanthan writing a letter to current ITAK  president “Maavai”Senathirajah about the ITAK Presidential election. The Nonagenarian  Trincomalee MP does not hold any post in the ITAK now, but is respectfully referred to as “Perunthalaiver” (Great leader) by  the Tamil media. The Octogenarian  ”Maavai” Senathirajah who was Jaffna district MP for almost two decades, lost in 2020 and is no more an MP.

“Maavai”  SEnathirajah has clung on to the ITAK presidency for nine years despite calls by many to relinquish his post and enable  new leaders  to take over. When Sampanthan became ITAK president in 2010, he served for two , two -year terms and let Senathirajah who was then  the general secretary become president in 2014.  Senathirajah who should have stepped down gracefully in 2018 did not do so. Instead he has hung on to the presidency by “hook or by crook”.  The ITAK Party convention was not held for several years so as to avert  the advent of a new president.

Finally overwhelming pressure from the party rank and file compelled Senathirajah to comply with the demand for a party convention. When it became clear that there was going to be an election,  some had genuine  concerns about a party split as a result, “Maavai”  then suggested  that he should continue further as president instead of having an election. This was rejected by the party. Moreover the rival  candidates themselves   “united” on this issue and reiterated the call for an election.

Under these circumstances, Sampanthan’s letter provided Maavai with another opportunity to remain in office as ITAK president. Sampanthan piqued with some ITAK partymen in Trincomalee alleged that elections for  branch leadership posts  in the district had not been done properly. (Sampanthan’s troubles with the ITAK in Trinco may be discussed in detail in a future article) As such he wanted the present branches to be dissolved and urged that the party convention should not be held until then.

“Maavai” utilsed Sampanthan’s demand to his advantage. He suggested that the ITAK Convention be postponed indefinitely until Sampanthan’s grievances were redressed. Until then he Senathirajah would continue to be  the ITAK’s pro tem president. An ITAK Politbureau meeting was convened at Sampanthan’s Colombo residence on 10 January to discuss the issue.

Meanwhile  Ex-MP Yoheswaran openly aligned with Shritharan and extended support to him in the  ITAK presidential hustings. This made the election a duel between Sumanthiran and Shrithaean.

When the  ITAK politbureau met on  Jan 10th, Senathirajah was in for a surprise. Although the Politbureau meeting had been convened to discuss  matters like Sampanthan’s letter of complaint against the ITAK Trinco branches, postponng the Convention and endorsing  “Maavai” as pro tem ITAK president, those did not happen.

Sampanthan pointedly refrained from discussing  the Trincomalee branch issue. Therefore the matters of postponing the convention and appointing  a pro tem president were not taken up for discussion. What  Maavai did not know was that three  concerned individuals all of them lawyers had visited Sampanthan at different times prior to the Politbureau meeting and discussed Sampanthan’s grievances. The “Perunthalaiver”was satisfied and a  compromise arrived at.. As a result  Sampanthan did not follow up his letter of complaint.

The Politbureau therefore confirmed that the convention would take place. The President election would also be held. Nevertheless, some felt that an election should be averted and the party tradition of electing a president through a consensus should be  continued. Sampanthan too expressed the same sentiments. It appeared that most members of the Politbureau wanted the  candidates to arrive at an understanding and do away with an election. This placed the two main contenders in a delicate position. What was to be done?

Sumanthiran then   stated that he was prepared to discuss the matter  the next day and possibly reach an understanding ,if  Shritharan and Yoheswaran were willing.  Both Shri and Yohes agreed. Sumanthiran then  suggested that all three of them meet the following day and  arrive at a compromise if possible. Thre was agreement and it was decided that Sumanthiran would  meet with Shritharan at the latter’s  residence in Madiwela. Yoheswaran was also staying there.

The meeting took place on January 11th morning at Madiwela.  Sumanthiran began the talks by saying “let us discuss this matter in deference to the wishes of the Politbureau and reach a settlement”.Shritharan cut to the chase immediately by asking Sumanthiran to withdraw  and let him (Shri)become president. He would quit in two years and let Sumanthiran be president.

Taken aback by this blunt “request” Sumanthiran asked Shritharan  why he was making this demand. Shritharan replied in Tamil “You once said that you will work with me as Party leader”. Sumanthiran then refreshed Shritharan’s memory by referring to the context in which he reportedly said this.

“You had announced that you (Shritharan)were ready to take up the  leadership of the ITAK. The media asked me what my response was to your statement. I replied that I would be prepared to work under you if the party elected you as president. Subsequently you apologized to Senathirajah for making such a statement and declared that you wont be interested in a leadership position for five years” Sumanthiran reminded Shritharan

Sumanthiran pointed out that Shritharan had not been elected president and therefore  the question of working under him did not arise. At this point Shritharan asked Sumanthiran why he wanted to be the ITAK president. “Why cant you let me be President this time and take over after me?” asked Shri.He also reiterated that the ITAK presidency could be shared by both on a rotational basis of two years each.

Sumanthiran responded by saying that he was not interested in being president on a rotational basis. He said that the Tamil people were facing a huge crisis at present.  It was the ITAK that could provide positive leadership at this juncture. The party needed both change and continuity.

The President’s counsel pointed out that he could provide both  change and continuity as he had been involved in every major  political initiative undertaken by the ITAK concerning the Tamil national question. He had participated in negotiations and discussions nationally and internationally. He  was in contact with many international leaders and officials. He had also handled legal matters in a number of issues affecting Tamils. Besides he  had good relations with a number of  political leaders from different parties said Sumanthiran

Speaking further Sumanthiran said that on the strength of his background and experience ,he was  confident of leading the ITAK  successfully   in the near future. He said  that with the support of the party, he hoped to accomplish several things for the benefit of the Tamil people during his tenure.  Sumanthiran also said that he had publicly announced that he would retire from Politics when he reached 65 years and that he would be 60 next February. Therefore he was not going to be President for a long time.

The  third candidate Yoheswaran was a silent listener to the conversation. At this juncture Yoheswaran got up and prepared to leave. Shritharan then  said let the election take place and ended the discussion. Sumanthiran left. The discussion did not take more than 20 minutes. Consequently both Sumanthiran and shritharan spoke to Tamil media outlets and said that the party would elect the new president.

The stage therefore is set for  the ITAK presidential election on 21 January. One of the three candidates Yoheswaran has thrown in his lot with  another candidate  Shritharan. The election will therefore be a duel between Sumanthiran and Shritharan. The  fate of the ITAK presidential election will greatly determine the future course of Tamil  Nationalist politics in Sri Lanka.

### Sri Lanka revises import duties for 1,222 items under Singapore FTA

*2024-01-15 16:34:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-revises-import-duties-for-1222-items-under-singapore-fta-147311/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has published import duties of up to 20 percent applied to 1,222 items under a free trade agreement with Singapore.

Sri Lanka usually has a negative list for imports in trade deals.

In addition, so-called para tariffs, such as the Sri Lanka’s Airport Levy as well as an import CESS is also charged from some goods.

Excessively high import duties on some items, imposed to give artificially high profits to politically connected producers while harming consuemrs, have led to undervaluation and corruption, critics say.

### Int’l rights groups urge govt to stop ‘abusive anti-drug operation’ and release arbitrary detainees

*2024-01-15 15:34:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96418/intl-rights-groups-urge-govt-to-stop-abusive-anti-drug-operation-and-release-arbitrary-detainees-)*

Over 30 international human rights organisations including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists have expressed their deep concern regarding the “drastic intensification” of anti-drug operations in Sri Lanka leading to significant human rights violations.

Issuing a joint statement, the 33 international organizations demand the Sri Lankan government to stop the ‘abusive anti-drug operation’ and release the arbitrarily detained individuals.

Furthermore, the statement highlights that this operation is unfolding in a context of already severe repression against persons who use or are suspected of using drugs, and who suffer discrimination and stigma within the Sri Lankan criminal justice system and society.

“Alongside the Sri Lankan police, members of the armed forces have been supporting this operation, during which several human rights violations have been reported. These violations include alleged arbitrary arrests, primarily against individuals from marginalised socio-economic communities; searches conducted without warrants or reasonable suspicion; and degrading treatment including strip searches in public as well as cavity searches. The searches and arrests have been televised, in violation not only of the right to privacy (and of basic human dignity) but also of a person’s right to be presumed innocent”, the joint statement added.

The global organizations, which also point out that according to lawyers, persons are being arrested even when no drugs are found in their possession, simply for having been arrested for drug offences or having been sent to compulsory rehabilitation in the past, mention that the arrests of main livelihood earners and mothers have adversely impacted the ability of families to meet their basic needs during a time of economic crisis in Sri Lanka, and the wellbeing of children.

“Persons are being arrested primarily under Section 54A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, an offence which is non-bailable. As a result, those arrested are bound to spend time (sometimes months) in pretrial detention, thereby exacerbating already poor conditions of imprisonment in an overburdened prison system.”

Furthermore, the statement has drawn attention to the fact that the level of overcrowding of the prison system is at nearly 200% - with punitive drug policies playing a significant role: as of 2022, 63% of convicted persons were sentenced for drug-related offences, as per the statistics issued by the Department of Prisons.

The aforesaid organizations have also expressed in this joint statement that the total number of arrests pursuant to operation Yukthiya has exceeded 29,000 as of 9 January 2024, while nearly 1,500 people are in administrative detention in police custody for further investigation and at least 1,600 more persons have been sent for compulsory drug rehabilitation, “in violation of several fundamental rights; including the right to the highest attainable standard of health, which includes the right to consent to and withdraw from medical treatment”.

“‘Drug treatment’ in these centres is abstinence-based, essential harm reduction services are not available, and persons undergo severe withdrawal symptoms without any medical assistance while in detention.”

“The use of violence to discipline and punish has been reported in at least two compulsory drug rehabilitation centres which are within the purview of the Bureau of the Commissioner General for Rehabilitation and are operated by the military, which is in itself a violation of international standards”, it added.

“The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in its statement at the conclusion of its visit to Sri Lanka 2017expressed concern regarding the involvement of military personnel in drug treatment and rehabilitation, the fact that strenuous physical exercise was the core component of compulsory drug treatment, and at the lack of trained professionals to monitor the health of people in detention. Furthermore, the statement highlighted the irregularities in the judicial process by which persons were sent to drug rehabilitation centres without a medical assessment”, the statement mentioned.

In addition, the organizations say that since the 2016 UN General Assembly Special Session on drugs, there is international consensus on pursuing a holistic and health and human rights-based approach to drugs, which encompasses supply and demand reduction as well as harm reduction.

“The 2019 Ministerial Declaration on drugs – the current global drug policy document - as well as multiple resolutions of the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, and the UN Human Rights Council reiterate and recommend a similar approach”, it added.

Further, the joint statement clarified: “a punitive and militarised approach to drug control contravenes recognised international human rights standards and guidelines, is ineffective to protect individual and public health, and ultimately fails to make communities safer”.

Thereby, the 33 global organizations call upon the Government of Sri Lanka to immediately cease operation “Yukthiya” and release persons who have been arrested without evidence or reasonable suspicion. The government should ensure that those arrested who do not have access to legal representation are provided legal aid, they stressed.

Through the statement, it is also demanded to immediately release persons arrested or sent to compulsory drug rehabilitation for using drugs/having a drug dependence, cease involving the armed forces in drug control and treatment activities as consistent with human rights law, repeal laws that allow compulsory drug rehabilitation, close compulsory treatment centres and release persons presently held at the centres within the purview of the Bureau of Commissioner General for Rehabilitation.

Additionally, they have called the government to ensure that any law enforcement operation to address the supply side is conducted respecting due process standards and constitutionally protected fundamental rights.

### IMF Talks Tax and Resilience with Sri Lanka’s North

*2024-01-15 14:59:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/15/imf-talks-tax-and-resilience-with-sri-lanka-s-north/)*

COLOMBO (News 1st); A high-level team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) visited Sri Lanka's Northern Province on Sunday, holding a focused discussion with Governor P.S.M. Charles and key stakeholders on the region's economic struggles and potential pathways for recovery.

The meeting, organized by the Governor's Secretariat, brought together representatives from Jaffna University, local businesses, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and the IMF.

Governor Charles briefed the IMF team on pressing issues faced by the province, including ongoing development projects, inadequate infrastructure, climate change impacts, and difficulties in compensating flood-affected farmers.

Jaffna University representatives presented their analysis of the current economic situation, highlighting the challenges posed by the Easter bombings, COVID-19 pandemic, economic crisis, and recent tax increases. They advocated for stricter implementation of anti-corruption laws, revised distribution policies, and continued focus on reconciliation efforts.

Business representatives and SME owners expressed concerns about the new tax policy's burden on their already crisis-stricken activities. They reported difficulties obtaining loans from banks and navigating changes in interest rates, further hindering their operations.

The IMF delegation, led by Senior Mission Chief Peter Breuer, acknowledged the hardships caused by the tax increase and acknowledged the country's need for stricter economic policies to overcome entrenched issues. However, Breuer pointed to positive economic indicators towards the end of 2023 and stressed the importance of sustaining these improvements.

"While we saw a small uptick in the third quarter of 2023, we're still far from robust, inclusive growth. Inflation hit 70% last year, disproportionately impacting those without savings or buffers. The path to recovery will require sustained commitment to sound economic policies," said Peter Breuer, Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, IMF.

(NDTV); A court in Vietnam on Friday (12) sentenced former Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long to 18 years in prison after finding him guilty of taking bribes in a coronavirus test kit scandal, state media reported.

Nguyen Thanh Long was accused of taking bribes worth $2.25 million in the scandal, in which a local firm was accused of colluding with officials to commission a state-funded research unit to produce and overstate its prices of coronavirus test kits, Phap Luat Online newspaper said.

Reuters could not immediately reach Nguyen Thanh Long's lawyers for comment.

"I was wrong, I am sorry," Nguyen Thanh Long was quoted by the newspaper as saying at the trial.

The verdict comes as Vietnam intensifies its years-long anti-graft campaign that has seen hundreds of senior officials investigated for corruption, with many forced to quit, including former president and premier Nguyen Xuan Phuc and two deputy prime ministers.

### IRD urges public to beware of confidential information being misused during registration for TIN

*2024-01-15 13:50:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96416/ird-urges-public-to-beware-of-confidential-information-being-misused-during-registration-for-tin-)*

The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) urges the general public to follow the guidelines issued by the department and to use the services of authorized tax consultants and auditors, if such services are necessary, to avoid the misuse of their confidential information.

Joining the “At HydePark” current affairs programme on Ada Derana 24, the Senior Deputy Commissioner of the Inland Revenue Department Nihal Wijewardana revealed that several official channels have been opened up for the general public to answer any concerns and ease the process of obtaining the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).

Mr. Wijewardana further expressed that people can obtain required assistance regarding the matter directly from the IRD through the hotline number 1944. The general public can also visit the regional offices of the department for any required assistance regarding this or obtain the TIN easily, he added.

“If not you can follow the formal online process introduced by the department by visiting the official website of the Inland Revenue Department through www.ird.gov.lk”

Meanwhile, also joining the program, Deputy Commissioner General of the IRD Saman Shantha outlined that the country’s top tax collecting authority is in the process of implementing a centralised system to collect information pertaining to personal income by linking up with other departments and institutions within the country.

### GMOA opposes health sector trade unions’ strikes; Nurses not to join planned strike

*2024-01-15 13:19:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96415/gmoa-opposes-health-sector-trade-unions-strikes-nurses-not-to-join-planned-strike-)*

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) claims that the island-wide strike action organized by health sector employees is unjustified.

The Secretary of the GMOA Dr. Haritha Aluthge expressed that 50% of the wage demands made by the trade unions which are protesting the government’s decision to increase the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors have been completed, and that only 15% of the requested increment have been received by the doctors.

“Their demand was to increase the salaries of government employees by Rs. 20,000. They have received Rs. 10,000 so far. It means that 50% of their demands are completed”, he said.

Dr. Aluthge also pointed out that the majority of the protesting health workers are related to the secondary level of government service, while another group of them are in the primary grade.

“The doctors are in the senior grade of the government service. This is hilarious that they are trying to be at the equal level as doctors”, he said.

“This is something that is not happening; and something that must not happen.”

Furthermore, Dr. Aluthge emphasized that it is an ‘illegal strike action’.

Against this backdrop, the All Ceylon Nurses’ Union has decided not to join the strike action to be launched jointly with over 75 health sector trade unions on Tuesday (16), but will only hold a demonstration in front of government hospitals during lunch time.

The Chief Secretary of the union H.M.S Mediwatte stated that this decision was taken in consideration of the inconvenience faced by the patients during health sector employees’ strikes.

He also expressed that the nursing officers from across the island will protest in front of the Health Ministry on Wednesday (17), and will launch a continuous trade union action until their demands are fulfilled.

The health sector employees’ trade unions decided to launch another 24-hour token strike starting from 06.30 a.m. tomorrow (Jan. 16), in protest of the government’s decision to increase DAT allowance for doctors by Rs. 35,000.

Earlier today, President of the Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) Upul Rohana mentioned that around 100,000 health workers including all paramedical services, hospital secretaries, administrative officers as well as health administrative assistants, minor staff and 75 other trade unions of the health staff will join together with this island-wide strike.

“This action will completely disrupt the hospital service. The government should understand that it is not possible to maintain medical services only with the doctors”, Upul Rohana said.

Meanwhile, the President of the Academy of Health Professionals Ravi Kumudesh expressed that if military forces are used to suppress the health workers’ strike, they will continue to carry out the trade union action even further.

Last week, the day-to-day functions of many hospitals across the island had come to a standstill, owing to several trade union actions launched by several health sector employees demanding an allowance of Rs 35,000.

On 08 January 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000.

නව තාක්ෂණය භාවිතා කරමින් වේලන ලද කරවළ හා උම්බලකඩ කිලෝග්‍රෑම් 10,000කින් යුත් පළමු කන්ටේනරය අපනයනය කිරීම ඊයේ (14) පහජ්ජාව කරවළ හා උම්බලකඩ නිෂ්පාදනය කරන  මෙගාෆිෂ් ආයතනය විසින් සිදු කරනු ලැබීය.

මෙම කර්මාන්ත ශාලාව විසින් නිෂ්පාදිත කරවළ හා උම්බලකඩ පළමු කන්ටේනරය අපනයනය  කෙරෙන අවස්ථාවට කෘෂිකර්ම හා වැවිලි කර්මාන්ත අමාත්‍ය මහින්ද අමරවීර මහතා ඇතුළු පිරිසක් සහභාගි වූහ.

සාම්ප්‍රධායික කරවල නිෂ්පාදනයේ දී  හිරු එළියෙන් කරවළ වේලීම සිදු කළත් මෙම නව තාක්ෂණය යටතේ කරවළ හා උම්බලකඩ සකසනු ලබන්නේ වායු සමීකරණ පද්ධතියක් ආශ්‍රිතව විජලනය කිරීමේ ක්‍රමවේදයක්  (Air Condition Dehydration) යොදා ගනිමිනි.

මුළුමනින්ම ආරක්ෂිත හා සෞඛ්‍ය සම්පන්න ක්‍රම යොදා ගනිමින් නිෂ්පාදනය කෙරෙන කරවළ හා උම්බලකඩ මිනිස් පරිභෝජනයට ඉතාමත් උචිත වේ. විශේෂයෙන් කරවළ වේලීම සදහා Law Salt ලුණු යොදා ගැනීම, හා මාළුවල අඩංගු තෙල් (Fish Oil) ඉවත් නොවීම වැනි කරුණු නිසා මෙම නව තාක්ෂණය යටතේ වේලන ලද කරවළ ගුණාත්මකබවින් ඉහළ මට්ටමක පවතී.

අපේ රටේ නිෂ්පාදනය කෙරෙන කරවළ හා උම්බලකඩ ඔස්ට්‍රේලියාවට හා කොරියාවට අපනයනය කරන  පළමු අවස්ථාව ද මෙය වේ.

මෙම අවස්ථාවට සහභාගි වූ කෘෂිකර්ම හා වැවිලි කර්මාන්ත අමාත්‍ය මහින්ද අමරවීර මහතා අදහස් පළ කළේය.

මම 2018 ධීවර අමාත්‍යවරයාව සිටිය දී මෙම ව්‍යාපෘතිය ආරම්භ කිරීමට මුලික පියවර ගත්තා. එවකට ජලජීවි වගා සංවර්ධන අධිකාරියේ සභාපතිවරයා වශයෙන් කටයුතු කළ ජනාධිපති නීතිඥ උපාලි මොහොට්ටි මහතා මෙම ව්‍යාපෘතියට යෝජනා ඉදිරිපත් කළා.

අද එම ව්‍යාපෘතිය සාර්ථක වී තිබෙනවා. සාම්ප්‍රධායික කරවළ සැකසීමේ දී බොහෝ විට අපද්‍රව්‍ය ඊට එකතුවීමට ඉහළ සම්භාවිතාවක් තිබෙනවා. ලුණු වැඩිපුර යොදන්නේ එම තත්ත්වය වළක්වාලීමටයි. නමුත් පළමුවරට වායුසමීකරණ පද්ධති යොදා ගනිමින් සිදු කෙරෙන මෙම කර්මාන්ත ශාලවේ කරවළ නිෂ්පාදනයේ දී අඩුම තරමින් දූවිලි ටිකක් හෝ මැස්සෙක්වත් ඇතුළුවීමට අවකාශයක් නැහැ.

ඒ නිසා මෙම ක්‍රමයට කරවළ හා උම්බලකඩ නිෂ්පාදනය කිරීම මගින් මිනිස් පාරිභෝජනයට ඉතාමත් සුදුසු කරවළ අපිට වෙළෙඳපොලට ඉදිරිපත් කළ හැකියි. මෙමගින් රටට අවශ්‍ය විදේශ විනිමය අපිට ලැබෙනවා. රට තුළ මෙවැනි ව්‍යාපෘති සෑම අංශයක්ම සඳහා යොදාගත හැකියි. යනුවෙන් ද අමාත්‍යවරයා සඳහන් කළේය.

සියක් නගර අලංකරණ වැඩසටහන යටතේ 2023 වසර සදහා සියලු පළාත් ආවරණය වන පරිදි ව්‍යාපෘති 156 ක් හදුනාගෙන ආරම්භ කරන ලදි. පොදු වෙළදපොළවල්, බස් නැවතුම්පොළවල්, රථගාල්, ඇවිදින මංතීරු, බහුකාර්යය ගොඩනැගිලි, නාගරික උද්‍යාන සහ නගර අලංකරණ ව්‍යාපෘති ඊට ඇතුළත් වේ. 2023 වසර අවසන් වන ඉන් ව්‍යාපෘති 133 ක් අවසන් කර ඇති බව නාගරික සංවර්ධන අධිකාරිය සදහන් කරයි. ඉතිරි ව්‍යාපෘති 23 හි ඉදිකිරීම් කටයුතු සිදු කෙරෙමින් පවතී.

රටේ සියලුම නගර සංවර්ධනය කිරීමේ වගකීම පැවරී ඇත්තේ නාගරික සංවර්ධන අධිකාරියටයි. ඒ වෙනුවෙන් එම අධිකාරිය මේ වනවිට විශාල වැඩ කොටසක් සිදු කරමින් පවතී. අමාත්‍ය ප්‍රසන්න රණතුංග මහතා පෙන්වා දෙන්නේ නාගරික සංවර්ධනය මගින් රටතුළ සෘජු හා වක්‍ර රැකියා විශාල ප්‍රමාණයක් උත්පාදනය කළ හැකි බවයි.

During a special operation conducted to chase away Indian poaching trawlers from Sri Lankan waters last night (14), the Sri Lanka Navy has apprehended 10 Indian fishermen along with an Indian trawler after having spotted they were engaging in illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters north of Point Pedro, Jaffna.

The Northern Naval Command which deployed an Inshore Patrol Craft to chase away a cluster of Indian poaching trawlers has held the Indian poaching trawler with the fishermen as they continued to remain in island waters off Point Pedro.

The 10 apprehended Indian fishermen and the poaching trawler were brought to the Kankasanthurai harbour and they will be handed over to the Mailadi Fisheries Inspector for onward legal action, the Navy said.

The Navy conducts regular patrols and operations in Sri Lankan waters to curb illegal fishing practices by foreign fishing trawlers, taking into account the consequences of these practices on the livelihood of local fishermen and the marine resources of the country.

### Artificial Intelligence will affect almost 40% jobs globally: IMF report

*2024-01-15 10:39:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96412/artificial-intelligence-will-affect-almost-40-jobs-globally-imf-report)*

Artificial intelligence (AI) is projected to impact nearly 40% of global jobs, with advanced economies expected to bear a greater share of the consequences compared to emerging markets and low-income countries, according to an analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported by Bloomberg.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva wrote in a blog post that, in most scenarios, AI is likely to exacerbate overall inequality and called for proactive measures by policymakers to prevent the technology from further intensifying social tensions.

The impact of AI on income inequality will hinge on how well the technology complements high earners. Increased productivity from high-income workers and companies could widen the wealth gap, Georgieva explained.

According to the IMF chief, countries should implement “comprehensive social safety nets” and retraining programs for vulnerable workers to mitigate these effects.

The IMF report, published on Sunday (14 January) evening, highlighted that, while there is potential for AI to fully replace some jobs, the more probable scenario is that it will complement human work. Advanced economies may witness about 60% of jobs affected, surpassing the impact on emerging and low-income countries.

However, the report noted that only half of the jobs affected by AI will face negative consequences; the rest may benefit from enhanced productivity gains due to AI integration.

“Your job may disappear altogether - not good - or artificial intelligence may enhance your job, so you actually will be more productive and your income level may go up,” Georgieva wrote.

Georgieva’s comments align with discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where global business and political leaders are deliberating on AI. Some companies have raised concerns among employees by investing heavily in AI, with examples such as Buzzfeed Inc. using AI for content creation and restructuring its news department.

While the European Union has reached a tentative deal on AI legislation, the US is still considering its federal regulatory stance on the matter.

The IMF report predicts that emerging markets and developing economies will experience a smaller initial impact from AI on labour markets but are also less likely to benefit from the productivity gains that AI integration may bring.

The IMF chief stressed the importance of helping low-income countries seize the opportunities presented by artificial intelligence.

While addressing the potential challenges of AI, she acknowledged its tremendous opportunity for everyone.

She also acknowledged the need for an AI-related productivity boost to sustain global economic growth, emphasising the importance of unlocking productivity for a positive global narrative.

The IMF is set to publish updated economic forecasts later this month, indicating that the global economy is broadly on track to meet previous projections.

Georgieva cautioned that 2024 is likely to be a “very tough year” for fiscal policy worldwide due to countries addressing debt burdens from the Covid-19 pandemic and managing depleted buffers.

With billions of people heading to the polls this year, Georgieva expressed concern that governments might face pressure to increase spending or cut taxes to gain popular support, potentially undermining progress made in the fight against high inflation.

### Sri Lanka to have pricing formula for water: Minister

*2024-01-15 10:37:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-to-have-pricing-formula-for-water-minister-147299/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – A water price formula will be prepared in consultation with the advisors of the National Water Supply Board and the Asian Development Bank, Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Minister Jeevan Thondaman said.

“A price formula will be introduced for water charges, that can reduce the water charges along with lowering the electricity bill,” Thondaman was quoted as saying in a statement by the Government Department of Information.

Thondaman was speaking at a discussion held at the Peradeniya University Institute of Water Research and Technology.

Last week, the National Steering Committee on Water Sector Reforms met today to finalise several key policies and guidelines in the water sector.

“We are ready to present to the public, for their feedback, Sri Lanka’s new national policies on Drinking Water and Water Safety, as well as new Guidelines on Water Supply Connections,” Thondaman said on X.

“Our aim is to ensure a safe, affordable and reliable water supply for all under a consistent and clear framework.”

The new policies and guidelines are part of the US$ 200 million ADB supported reforms in the water sector.

Thondaman said the goal of the reforms was to create a more sustainable water sector in Sri Lanka that is both climate and consumer conscious. (Colombo/Jan15/2024)

### Health sector employees to go on strike tomorrow

*2024-01-15 10:22:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96411/health-sector-employees-to-go-on-strike-tomorrow)*

The health sector employees’ trade unions will launch another 24-hour token strike starting from 06.30 a.m. tomorrow (Jan. 16), in protest of the government’s decision to increase the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors by Rs. 35,000.

President of the Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) Upul Rohana stressed that the Minister of Health has not provided any discussion regarding their demands.

He mentioned that therefore, around 100,000 health workers including all paramedical services, hospital secretaries, administrative officers as well as health administrative assistants, minor staff and 75 other trade unions of the health staff will join together with this island-wide strike.

“This action will completely disrupt the hospital service. The government should understand that it is not possible to maintain medical services only with the doctors”, Upul Rohana said.

Meanwhile, the President of the Academy of Health Professionals Ravi Kumudesh expressed that if military forces are used to suppress the health workers’ strike, they will continue to carry out the trade union action even further.

### Sri Lanka labour ministry to import SUV, health double cabs

*2024-01-15 09:18:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-labour-ministry-to-import-suv-health-double-cabs-147286/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe has allowed the import of vehicles which are banned, including a sports utility vehicle and double cabs, for several ministries and state agencies, in a gazette notice.

Ministry of Labor and Foreign Employment will be allowed to import an SUV, the Ministry of Health 21 double cabs, and two buses for the Ministry of Education.

Sri Lankan Airlines would be allowed to import three economy classes ramp coaches. Sri Lanka has seen a surge in tourism.

Sri Lanka has imposed import controls during the tenure of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa after his economic bureaucrats cut rates with printed money to push up growth (target potential output).

The import control law was enacted in 1969 by the economic advisors of the Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake.

In 1968, Sri Lanka’s output was pushed up to 8.2 percent with inflationary central bank operations (mostly rural credit re-finance at the time) and there were BOP deficits for two years running.

Sri Lanka also started to have IMF programs in the 1960s. The 1960s also saw increased use of statistics to justify inflationary central bank operations in the US.

In 1971 the Bretton Woods collapsed and Sri Lanka went into a ‘closed economy’.

In order to operate a reserve collecting central bank with rate cutting powers, Sri Lanka imposes both trade and capital controls, which intensify in periods of mis-targeting rates (rate cuts enforced with reverse repo operations). (Colombo/Jan15/2023)

### Govt incurred additional cost of over Rs. 1 bn on gas purchases amid crisis: audit report

*2024-01-15 01:29:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96405/govt-incurred-additional-cost-of-over-rs-1-bn-on-gas-purchases-amid-crisis-audit-report)*

The government had to bear an additional cost of Rs. 1,139 billion amidst the economic crisis last year due to cancellation of the term tender and importing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) at higher rates, the Auditor General’s Department revealed.

This was mentioned in a special audit report compiled on the procurement of liquefied petroleum gas Litro Gas Lanka Ltd for the years 2022 and 2023.

The report indicates that despite having obtained the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers to grant the LP gas tender to the lowest bidder, the Singapore-based Siam Gas Trading Pte Ltd., steps had been taken to commence a new procurement process to buy gas at a higher rate.

Accordingly, the government had to pay a higher rate for the purchase of liquefied petroleum gas, even in the face of an economic crisis, the Auditor General’s Department alleged.

The Technical Evaluation Committee had recommended on April 26, 2022, that Siam Gas Trading, the lowest bidder, should be the supplier qualified for 2022-2023 period. The Procurement Committee also approved this on April 28, 2022.

Later, on May 04, 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to select Siam Gas Trading as the LP gas supplier for the aforementioned period.

The report says that the Board of Appeal, having considered the appeal made by the previous supplier OQ Trading Ltd. against the selection, had given its consent to award the procurement to Siam Gas Trading.

However, despite the approvals so given, it had been decided to commence a new procurement process following the Cabinet Decision dated June 13, 2022, whilst gas was being purchased from OQ Trading Ltd. at a price exceeding that of Siam Gas Trading (CP+ $96) irrespective of the lack of a formal methodology for Sri Lanka to purchase gas since March 2022.

The report revealed that the term procurement had been cancelled despite Siam Gas Trading having being selected, and, as gas had been purchased from OQ Trading Ltd. at a higher price, the government had incurred an additional expenditure of USD 3,145,960 (equivalent to Rs. 1,138,837,430 in total) amidst the economic crisis.

### Indonesian volcano erupts for second time in just over a month

*2024-01-14 23:11:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96404/indonesian-volcano-erupts-for-second-time-in-just-over-a-month)*

Indonesia’s Marapi volcano has erupted for the second time in weeks, the country’s geological agency said Sunday.

According to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, the 2,891-meter-high (9,500 feet) volcano began erupting at 6 a.m. local time (6 p.m.ET).

The volcano in West Sumatra province erupted at least twice, the agency said according to Reuters.

Reuters also reported nearby houses, vehicles and evacuation tents set up by the local disaster agency were covered in volcanic ash.

The ministry warned residents and visitors not to go within a 4.5 kilometer (2.8 mile) radius of the Verbeek Crater where the eruption took place and told residents in nearby communities to wear masks in the event of falling ash.

Some residents also went to health facilities to receive respiratory check-ups, Reuters added.

A previous eruption on December 3 killed 23 hikers who were on the mountain at the time, and saw volcanic ash being spewed as high as 3,000 meters (9,843 feet) into the air.

Mount Marapi is among the most active volcanoes in Indonesia which lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire with 127 active volcanos – more than anywhere else in the world.

It has erupted 11 times during the early 21st century, with it deadliest single event having killed 60 people in 1979.

### SLPA to establish new terminal services agreements with shipping lines

*2024-01-14 22:59:00 - [islandlk](http://island.lk/slpa-to-establish-new-terminal-services-agreements-with-shipping-lines/)*

The year 2023 witnessed significant growth at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA). In comparison to the 1,925,895 TEUs handled by SLPA in 2022, it has handled a total of 1,965,128 TEUs in 2023, reflecting a 2% growth, SLPA said in a press release.

SLPA anticipates positive growth in container operations despite a percentage drop in global container volumes in 2022. SLPA is optimistic that the present growth rates will persist with the expected improvement in import and export activities in the global market and the gradual recovery of the country’s economy.

In 2023, the Port of Colombo (POC) operated 6,951,003 TEUs, marking a 1.17% growth compared to the 6,862,184 TEUs handled in 2022.

The recent growth at the SLPA can be attributed to increased efficiency levels at its terminals that include the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) and the East Container Terminal (ECT) and their ability to attract new services, establishing connections with new Terminal Services Agreements (TSA) with shipping lines.

SLPA expresses confidence in attracting more services at its terminals in 2024. This confidence will be reinforced by the successful completion of constructions at the East Container Terminal (ECT) and the JCT-V project in near future.

මෙම පුද්ගලයා  සිය මවගේ නිවසට පැමිණ සිටියදී  ඊට යාබදව පිහිටි නිවසේ පදිංචි මස්සිනා සමග මෙම ගල් කොරිය මතට පැමිණ  (13) දා අළුයම  02  පමණ වනතෙක් මත්පැන් සාදයක් පවත්වා තිබේ.

පසුව අලුයම දෙකට පමණ සාදය නවත්වා මියගිය පුද්ගලයාට නිදිමත යැයි පවසා අඩි පහක පමණ බෑවුමක් සහිත ගල් කොරිය මත නිදාගෙන තිබේ. ඉන් මඳ වේලාවකට පසුව අනිත් පුද්ගලයාද එම ස්ථානයේම නිදාගෙන ඇති අතර (14) දා දහවල් 10 පමණ ඔහු අවධි වී බැලීමේදී  තමා සමග නිදාගත් අනෙත් පුද්ගලයා නිදා සිටි ස්ථානයේ නොමැති බව දැක අවට විපරම් කර බැලීමේදී නිදාසිටි ගල්කොරිය මත සිට අඩි පනහක් පමණ  පහලින් පිහිටි ගල් වල මතට වැටී සිටිනු දැක තිබේ.

ඒ අනුව ක්ෂණිකව එම ස්ථානයට ගොස් බැලීමේදී ඉහලින් බිමට වැටී අනතුරට පත්ව සිටිනු දැක පසුව ඥාතීන්ට දන්වා ඔවුන් සමග අනතුරට පත්ව සිටි පුද්ගලයා  මත්පැන් සාදයට සහභාගි වූ අනෙත් පුද්ගලයාගේ නිවසට ඔසවාගෙන රැගෙන විත් තිබේ.

එහෙත් මොහු කිසිදු ප්‍රතිචාරයක් නොදැක්වීම නිසා සැකසිතී 119 හදිසි ඇමතුම් අංකයට දැන්වීමෙන් පසුව පොලිස් නිලධාරීන් පැමිණ පරීක්ෂා කිරීමේ දී ඔහු මියගොස් ඇති බවට අනාවරණය වී තිබේ.

ඊට අමතරව මෙම මරණය සිදුවූ ආකාරය තවදුරටත් විමර්ශනය කොට වාර්තා කරන ලෙසටද සාම විනිසුරු මානෙල් ගමගේ මහත්මිය පොලිසියට නියෝග කළාය.

මත්පැන් පානය කිරීමෙන් අනතුරුව දෙදෙනා අතර ඇති වූ ආරවුලක් හේතුවෙන්  මොහු මිය ගියාද නැතහොත් නිදා සිටි ස්ථානයේ සිට පෙරළී ගොස් පහළට වැටී මියගියා ද යන්න පිළිබඳව මෙතෙක් අනාවරණය වී නොමැති අතර ඒ සම්බන්ධයෙන්  අංශ කිහිපයක් ඔස්සේ පොලිස් විමර්ශන ක්‍රියාත්මකය.

සිද්ධිය සම්බන්ධයෙන්  හංවැල්ල පොලිසියේ පොලිස් සැරයන්  රණසිංහ නිලධාරීහු පරීක්ෂණ පවත්වති.
