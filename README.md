Sajith Premadasa criticizes the government for its inefficiency and danger, highlighting issues like the appointment of the Inspector General of Police and the Supreme Court's rulings on local elections and the VVS.

üü©

Opposition leader and United People's Power Presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa says that the government cannot build a law.

He said this in a post shared on social media after a court ruling on local government elections.

The appointment of the Inspector General of Police, the Supreme Court's ruling against the VVS, and the verdict of violating the fundamental rights by not holding the local government elections are the obvious blunt warnings of the Supreme Court.

The government cannot build a law, which cannot be upheld. This is the structure that confirms our stability.

We must act before this legislation affects our economy and the future of our future.

Rescue crews brought four body bags ashore at Porticello. Salvatore Cocina, head of the Sicily civil protection agency, said a fifth body had been located. Divers on-scene said they would try to recover it on Thursday while continuing the search for the sixth.

The discovery made clear the operation to search the hull on the seabed 50 meters (164 feet) underwater had quickly turned into a recovery one, not a rescue, given the amount of time that had passed and with no signs of life over three days of searching.

In countries with Chinese-funded development projects, like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, internal conflicts and riots have arisen. The National Freedom Front leader highlighted that understanding these issues is crucial for aspiring presidents. In Bangladesh, student protests against a quota system escalated into violence, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Similar tensions are observed in Sri Lanka due to China's investment in the Colombo Port. These examples illustrate how Chinese development zones can fuel internal disputes.

International contradictions are created in countries where a Zone of China is implemented by a Path Development Project.

Speaking at the debate on the Law Law Law Regulations on Wednesday (21) in Parliament, he said.

China has fully invested to the Colombo Port Development City. Therefore, Sri Lanka has not been affected by the port Urban Development Program.

### My markers in the fight for four decades

*2024-08-22 02:00:49* ¬∑ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c3ej1y059gno) ¬∑ `si`

Given the comprehensive overview of Sri Lanka's presidential elections, it's clear that each election has been marked by unique challenges, including political instability, violence, and issues related to voter turnout, especially in regions affected by conflict. The 2023 presidential election faces its own set of challenges, including the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic instability, and ongoing social issues.



To address these challenges effectively, the new President must prioritize several key areas:



1. **Economic Recovery**: Focus on stabilizing the economy, addressing inflation, and ensuring financial stability for all citizens. This includes implementing policies that support small businesses, agriculture, and job creation.



2. **Reconciliation and Unity**: Given the historical context of ethnic and religious tensions, the new President should champion initiatives aimed at national reconciliation, healing wounds, and promoting unity among all communities. This could involve truth and reconciliation commissions, educational reforms, and policies that ensure equal rights and opportunities for all.



3. **Good Governance and Anti-Corruption Measures**: Strengthening institutions, improving transparency in government operations, and implementing robust anti-corruption measures are crucial. This includes reforming the judiciary, enhancing fiscal responsibility, and ensuring accountability across all levels of government.



4. **Addressing Social Inequalities**: Work towards reducing socio-economic disparities, ensuring access to quality education, healthcare, and basic services for all segments of the population. This involves investing in social welfare programs and infrastructure development in underprivileged areas.



5. **Promoting Democracy and Human Rights**: Uphold the principles of freedom of expression, assembly, and the rule of law. Engage in dialogue with opposition parties, civil society organizations, and international partners to strengthen democratic institutions and practices.



6. **Environmental Sustainability**: Address environmental concerns, including climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. Implement policies that promote sustainable development, protect biodiversity, and ensure the well-being of future generations.



7. **International Relations and Diplomacy**: Strengthen diplomatic relations with other countries and international organizations. Seek partnerships for trade, investment, and cooperation in areas like technology, health, and security.



8. **Security and Law Enforcement**: Ensure the safety and security of all citizens, particularly in regions previously affected by conflict. Work towards demilitarization and civilian control of the security apparatus, while maintaining the ability to respond effectively to threats.



By focusing on these areas, the new President can address the multifaceted challenges facing Sri Lanka and pave the way for a more prosperous, peaceful, and united nation.

üü©

Elections from the 20th century are vertebrates in the democratic administration of Sri Lanka. In 1982, a presidential election was held for the first time for the Executive Presidency of the Second Republic of 1977.

Many presidential elections since that year were held while Sri Lanka was facing critical conditions.

In these previous presidential presidential elections, in time to exercise the sovereignty of the people, the factor in democracy has been democratic.

The first constitutional reforms of the first constitution to take control of Sri Lanka in 1815 was brought to the reconstruction of the first constitutional reforms.

The decades of decades end because of the requests that the demands and unofficial MPs who have come to increase the number of representatives of the Legislative Council.
