### Desperate Sri Lankans seek risky foreign jobs amid tough IMF reforms

ECONOMYNEXT – After working 11 years in Saudi Arabia as a driver, Sanath returned to Sri Lanka with dreams of starting a transport service company, buoyed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s 2019 presidential victory.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and an unprecedented economic crisis in 2022 shattered his dreams. Once an aspiring entrepreneur, he became a bank defaulter.

Facing hyperinflation, an unbearable cost of living, and his family’s daily struggles, Sanath sought greener pastures again—this time in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

“I had to pay 900,000 rupees ($3,000) to secure a driving job here,” Sanath (45), a father of two, told EconomyNext while having a cup of tea and a parotta for dinner near Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi.

Working for a reputed taxi company in the UAE, Sanath’s modest meal cost only 3 UAE dirhams (243 Sri Lankan rupees). Despite a monthly salary of around 3,000 dirhams, he limits his spending to save as much as possible.

Israel has no intention to slow down its genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip, even after a series of blows it suffered this week in the form of the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor seeking arrest warrants for its leaders and the recognition of Palestine as an independent state by three European countries: Ireland, Norway, and Spain.

There is no letup in Israel’s killer intent. The Gaza Strip has been made uninhabitable. It is heartbreaking to watch on Al Jazeera the wounded, the sick, the elderly, and little children running for cover in search of not-to-be-found safety amid a severe shortage of food, fuel, and medicine, among other essentials.

The Sri Lanka Police has caused a stir in the motoring scene by making great efforts to strictly follow an old law that relates to the ownership of vehicles. What stirred a hornet’s nest in social media was when a female police officer checked a vehicle recently and demanded to know details of vehicle ownership.

Now we come to know that the police have powers vested in them to check vehicle registration details courtesy a law passed in Parliament many years ago. This law was possibly passed to prevent unlawful activities linked to vehicles; example theft and unlawful assembling of vehicles.

However, the incident made motorists wake up to the requirement of keeping the ownership details of vehicles in order. In the past there was a habit of delaying the updating of the vehicle registration book when ownership of the ‘machine’ changed. Now new owners of vehicles have to be more responsible in having vehicle registration documents in order.
