Political analyst and former diplomat, Dayan Jayatilaka, said that the presidential election seems to be a bipolar game between Sajith Breamedasa Anuragumara.

What is your view on the campaign campaign by the leading candidates as the election campaigns have reached its final stage?

. Between Anura Sajith Ranil. One way you want to list in any order, it seems to be a bipolar game between Sajith Premadasa and Anuragumara Dissanayake.

This is a period of history globally there is a massive wave against the person in office. It is also mentioned by thinkers and publications such as Times Magazine. This is a universal event.

You have austerity package in Sri Lanka as a result of the agreement between President Wickremesinghe and the International Monetary Fund.. So one must logically consider that voters will vote for change until voters are not considered a masochistic.

### Pakistan-Sri Lanka trade dispute unresolved: Report

*2024-09-18 11:26:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102055/pakistan-sri-lanka-trade-dispute-unresolved-report) ┬╖ `en`

Pakistan and Sri Lanka have yet to operationalise a bilateral dispute resolution body, nearly two decades after signing a treaty, leaving trade disputes unresolved. This could potentially harm PakistanтАЩs exports to the island nation.

On Monday, PakistanтАЩs Ministry of Commerce informed a Senate Standing Committee on Commerce that Sri Lankan authorities were uncooperative, suggesting the issue now needs to be addressed at the political level.

Senator Anusha Rahman of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chaired the meeting. Initially, ministry officials implied the dispute resolution forum was effective but later admitted Sri LankaтАЩs lack of cooperation.

тАЬWe have friendly relations with Sri Lanka and want to amicably resolve the trade disputes,тАЭ said PakistanтАЩs Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal.

### More support for SLPP, UNP than either partyтАЩs presidential candidate: IHP poll

ECONOMYNEXT тАФ There is substantially more support for the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and President Ranil WickremesingheтАЩs United National Party (UNP) than there is for either partyтАЩs presidential candidate, the Institute for Health Policy (IHP)тАЩs monthly poll has found.

(IHP)тАЩs Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) polling director Dr Ravi Rannan-Eliya was quoted as saying in a statement from the institute that its parliamentary election voting intent survey has revealed тАЬsubstantially more support for the SLPP in a general election than for their presidential candidate, and similarly more support for WickremesingheтАЩs presidential candidacy than for the UNPтАЭ.

тАЬIt would be unwise to write off the SLPP as a political force, since many SLPP voters appeared in August to be switching their presidential vote to Ranil Wickremesinghe. Of course, they could also do this using their second preference votes, which suggests limited voter understanding of that option,тАЭ he said.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs central government debt fell to 99.83 percent of gross domestic product by June 2024 from 105.49 percent in December, amid exchange rate stability, a reduced budget deficit, and an expanding economy, official data show.

Public debt with guaranteed debt of state enterprises fell to 105.7 percent of GDP in June 2024, down from 112.74 percent in December 2023.

Rolling GDP to June went up to 28,909 billion rupees, from 27,629 in December 2023.

Guaranteed debt includes a credit to the Reserve Bank of India which the central bank is paying down.

When central banks use proceeds of swaps or other debt, it prints money to keep policy rates down and acquires government debt in the process (to sterilize the intervention by running inflationary policy), driving credit and imports.

As a result, central bank dollar borrowings or reserves which are spent to finance private imports, are fully backed with government debt which have already been issued.

He further claimed that individuals attending these rallies are paid between Rs. 3,000 and Rs. 5,000, creating an artificial image of public support.

тАЬThese gatherings, featured on social and State media, are not representative of genuine political movements,тАЭ Ratnayake said.

The success stories from other nations provide compelling evidence of the NSWтАЩs potential, and Sri Lanka must now seize this lagging behind opportunity to accelerate its own implementation

The National Single Window (NSW) is an integrated digital platform designed to streamline international trade by allowing parties involved in trade and transport to submit standardised information and documents through a single entry point. This concept, supported by international organisations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Customs Organization (WCO), aims to simplify and harmonise the flow of information between traders and government authorities.

### The new president is essential to prioritize racial reconciliation

*2024-09-18 02:04:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/193968) ┬╖ `ta`

New president prioritizes racial reconciliation, National Peace Council urges focus on inter-government unity. Economic stability and corruption require long-term political solutions based on devolution. True political acceptance of all communities' aspirations essential for national healing and confidence rebuilding. New leader must address Tamil community concerns and promote power sharing in provincial councils. Political commitment and ethnic peace crucial for attracting foreign investment and international support. Building a new social contract respecting all communities' rights and aspirations key to Sri Lanka's future: justice, equality, and sustainable peace.

ЁЯЯй

The National Peace Council has urged the new presidential election to be given priority to inter -government reconciliation.

In this regard, the report issued by the Peace Council on Tuesday (17).

As the presidential election campaigns end, the focus from the election contest must return to the country's emergency challenges. While the election results are uncertain, the new president is going to take responsibility for a country that is wrestling with the economic stability and the deepest rooted corruption and punishment culture.

A challenge to note in the presence of the new government that requires a long -term racism through a political solution based on devolution. The new president must give priority to this issue to bring about sustainable peace and unity to the country.

### Sri LankaтАЩs next leader: can make or break the nation

*2024-09-18 02:03:38* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-next-leader-can-make-or-break-the-nation/4-766815) ┬╖ `en`

As Sri Lanka prepares for its upcoming Presidential election, the stakes have never been higher. In 2022, the country faced an unprecedented economic crisis that brought the nation to a standstill, marked by fuel shortages, soaring inflation, and widespread protests. Since then, the country has taken steps toward stabilising the economy, but much remains to be done. This election is not just about choosing a leader but about securing the nationтАЩs future and ensuring continued recovery from the devastating economic collapse.

The road to recovery has been difficult, but significant progress has been made since 2022, largely supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. However, Sri Lanka remains vulnerable, and the next president must navigate the country through this challenging period with a steady hand. Voters, therefore, must consider candidates who possess the qualities necessary to complete the recovery process and set the nation on a path to sustainable growth.

The success of NPPтАЩs entire economic trajectory hinges on reforming governance. This is the pillar on which the new system would be built and that was the message from the Aragalaya generation. AKDтАЩs resolve to change the rotten political culture and moribund system of governance should therefore stabilise the economy faster with IMF assistance and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth with equity.

This article considers the weaknesses and flaws in the current trajectory of Sri LankaтАЩs economy and the need to reassess the path we are taking towards debt sustainability. It will present the views of professional economists that have critically evaluated the outcomes of Sri LankaтАЩs IMF program and debt restructuring negotiations.

There are a number of questions to ask about the current trajectory, but we must first understand that the broad targets are all aimed at generating debt sustainability and increasing Sri LankaтАЩs international credit ratings so that it is able to re-enter capital markets to finance part of the countryтАЩs foreign exchange requirement. Given below are these broad targets of the IMF:
