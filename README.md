Former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez was sentenced by a U.S. judge on Wednesday to 45 years in prison for his conviction on drug and firearm offenses.

The sentence means Hernandez, 55, will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, unless his expected appeal succeeds.

A Manhattan jury found him guilty in March of accepting millions of dollars in bribes to protect U.S.-bound cocaine shipments belonging to traffickers he once publicly proclaimed to combat.

Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, while defense lawyers said a 40-year term, the mandatory minimum under federal law, was enough.

U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel said the 45-year sentence should send a message to well-educated, seemingly personable defendants who may believe they are insulated from prosecution.

He also said jurors saw through Hernandez‚Äôs ‚Äúpolished demeanor‚Äù during the two-week trial, where he took the stand in his own defense.

### Restriction of Credit: Will the news truly harmony with Sri Lanka?

*2024-06-27 08:08:08* ¬∑ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/cpv3dy0wgnwo) ¬∑ `si`

Sri Lanka has successfully restructured $10 billion in loans with major official bilateral creditors, aiming to alleviate its economic crisis. This move, however, raises questions about the country's financial stability and the credibility of such announcements amidst ongoing economic challenges. Critics argue that while restructuring is a positive step, the real test lies in the country's ability to meet its future obligations and the perception of international rating agencies. The restructuring includes significant debts owed to China, India, and Japan, among others, but excludes commercial sovereign bonds totaling around $14.73 billion. The government's optimism contrasts with concerns over the sustainability of the debt and the potential impact on the country's creditworthiness.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that Sri Lanka completed the restructuring agreements with its major official bilateral creditors.. The loans of $ 10 billion will be restructured.

King Dutugemunu had a good relationship with the Maha Vihara.
