### A bloc to confront global debt crisis: What role for Sri Lanka?

*2024-04-10 01:58:21* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-bloc-to-confront-global-debt-crisis-What-role-for-Sri-Lanka/4-760536) · `en`

What proved to be particularly effective were the ways in which the IDEAs conference explored how powerful states and capitals reproduce a highly unequal global order with dramatic regional differences

Even if Sri Lanka is eventually able to “successfully” exit the IMF program, the question is, at what human cost? The paucity of discourse about a short to medium-term relief strategy to cope with the immiseration of working people during the depression is an indictment of our ruling class. But considering the views expressed at the IDEAs conference, it further reflects tremendous short-sightedness in ignoring the paradoxes that have provoked serious researchers elsewhere. They have considered the impact of debt crisis not only on the infrastructure gap but also on human development

### A “Hindu” presidential candidate and the “Hindu Tamil Eelam” concept

*2024-04-10 01:30:38* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-Hindu-presidential-candidate-and-the-Hindu-Tamil-Eelam-concept/4-760530) · `en`

Siva Senai leader Satchithanandam and those of his ilk are seemingly successful in the short term in their anti-Christian action. But in the long term their actions are succeeding in weakening Tamil nationalism by driving the Hindu-Christian wedge in between. In that sense Satchithanandan is accomplishing what the historic enemies of Tamil nationalism have been unable to do in the past – Divide Tamils! The sad irony in this is that Satchi himself was nurtured in the nursery of Tamil nationalism and regards himself as Tamil nationalist still

Current media coverage in Sri Lanka is heavily focused on the forthcoming Presidential elections. Though officially not announced yet, it seems a foregone conclusion that the presidential poll would take place later this year. Several potential candidates ranging from incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe to media magnate Dilith Jayaweera are tipped to be in the presidential fray.

### Peak state capitalism – what’s next?

*2024-04-10 01:27:08* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Peak-state-capitalism-what-s-next/4-760529) · `en`

The limits of state capitalism are visible worldwide, from China, Sri Lanka, Egypt, and Nigeria to Ukraine. Globally, state-owned enterprises’ assets are worth the equivalent of half the global GDP, while government-owned real estate is worth twice that amount. Decades of research, including from the IMF, have shown that government-owned businesses are, on average, one-third less productive than private firms. This is hampering financial sector reform and the efficient allocation of capital, leading to constrained economic development and growth.

### Hajj Quota allocation suspended by Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal yesterday suspended the allocation of 3500 quotas by the Hajj committee given to Sri Lanka for the Hajj Pilgrimage.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had granted a quota of 3500 pilgrims to the island for the upcoming Hajj in June.

The Hajj committee was given discretion to allocate from the quota numbers of pilgrims to each travel operator.

In a writ petition filed before the Court of Appeal a travel agent who was not granted any allocation said the process adopted by the Hajj committee was arbitrary.

The Petitioners said that there was a large amount of money of pilgrims which were involved and that the process was susceptible to corrupt practices.

They said that they had been singled out and victimised after questioning the conduct of allocation of quotas of the Hajj committee in the year 2023.

The court of appeal also ordered the provisional registration of the Travel Agent United Travels as a Hajj operator.

### Commercial High Court to hear Jaffna -Kilinochchi water project dispute

The District Court of Mt. Lavinia whilst refusing the extension of an enjoining order, directed the transfer of the Jaffna Kilinochchi water supply project to the Commercial High Court of Colombo.

KP Projects International Ltd., had previously obtained Enjoining Orders on against both the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and the China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) on the contract to the Jaffna Kilinochchi Water Supply and Sanitation Project.

The project is considered to be crucial for ensuring piped water access to Jaffna Peninsula residents.

CMEC argued that the dispute, involving a commercial transaction exceeding Rs. 50 million, warranted transfer to the Commercial High Court under the provisions of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996 and submitted that the Plaintiff has surreptitiously valued the action at Rs. 100,000 in order to institute action before the District Court.

### India loosens onion export ban to help neighbours

India is gearing up to supply thousands of metric tonnes of onions to Sri Lanka and UAE, days after it approved limited exports of essential commodities to the Maldives.

According to the Hindustan Times, India has supplied 10,000 metric tons of onions over and above the agreed 14,400-ton cap.

The world’s largest global exporter of onions, India has either banned or limited export permits for the in-demand vegetable, as well as for rice, wheat flour, pulses, and sugar, since last December.

Subsequently, onion prices are believed to have risen dramatically in neighbouring countries that have depended on onion imports from India to meet their domestic demand. Through a “special quota” arrangement, the Indian Government recently allowed exports to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Bahrain, and Bhutan.

### New Year, tough times and animal abuse - E

We wish our readers a happy and bountiful New Year, as the country celebrates its cultural festival this month. On the 13th of this month, the two major communities in our country Tamils and the Sinhalese celebrate the Eastern or cultural New Year. Around the same time, our Muslim brothers and sisters celebrate Ramadan, while Christians celebrate Easter.

The ‘Adhi Vasies’- also known as the ‘Veddahs’ also celebrate the New Year or ‘Kona Mangalaya’ during this time. Within the month all communities celebrate.

This year too, since the Covid-19 pandemic hit our country in January 2020, New Year celebrations will be held on an austere basis. Over 500,000 persons lost employment due to the lockdowns imposed during that period.

Making a bad situation worse, the financial meltdown in 2022 led the country to announce it was bankrupt. The country was thus deemed not credit-worthy by the world’s financial institutions.

### Sri Lanka best  place for solo female travel and belittling country

The British travel magazine Time Out ranked Sri Lanka as the best place for solo female travel.

I have written in these pages that Sri Lankans, more than anyone else, have done a spectacular job in disparaging their country at home and abroad. The genesis of this particular penchant is multifaceted. Some are innately bitter, some are attention-seeking, and others seek validation. For certain others, this represents an escapism from an existential identity crisis. Most of them live in an eternal gripe. So whenever the country gets a positive mention, their egos are prickled, their heartbeat rises, and they resurface, like earthworms after the rain, to contest, talk trash and scandalize.

### International court rules Switzerland violated human rights in landmark climate case brought by 2,000 women

An international court in France on Tuesday ruled Switzerland’s failure to adequately tackle the climate crisis was in violation of human rights, in a landmark climate judgment that could have a ripple effect across the globe.

The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg, France delivered its ruling in a case brought by more than 2,000 Swiss women, the majority of whom are in their 70s, against Switzerland’s government. They argued that climate change-fueled heat waves undermined their health and quality of life, and put them at risk of dying.

The court ruled that the Swiss government had violated some of the women’s human rights due to “critical gaps” in its national legislation to reduce planet-heating emissions, as well as a failure to meet past climate targets.

This amounted to a breach of the women’s rights to effective protection from the “the serious adverse effects of climate change on lives, health, well-being and quality of life,” the court said in a statement.
