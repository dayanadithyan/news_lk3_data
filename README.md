### Elections could dent Sri LankaтАЩs recovery: ADB

*2024-04-12 22:09:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Elections-could-dent-Sri-Lankas-recovery-ADB/108-280661) ┬╖ `en`

Colombo, April 12 - Sri Lanka's recovery could be stalled by abrupt policy changes after elections later this year even as the economy showed signs of stabilising, the Asian Development Bank warned Friday.

The island nation weathered an unprecedented financial crisis in 2022 that forced a foreign debt default as well as food and fuel shortages that prompted months of unrest.

It secured a $2.9 billion rescue loan from the International Monetary Fund last year, with President Ranil Wickremesinghe hiking taxes and cutting generous subsidies to restore the government's ruined finances.

But the ADB said presidential polls due by October could weaken the commitment to austerity measures.

"Risks to the outlook tend to the downside," the bank said in its latest forecast on Sri Lanka's economy.

Among them, the most important is uncertainty associated with the upcoming elections, including any possible impact on fiscal policy and reform implementation."

### Uncertainty over elections could risk Sri LankaтАЩs economic recovery: ADB

The тАЬuncertaintyтАЭ over the impending elections in Sri Lanka will cause a possible downward trend in the countryтАЩs economic outlook, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said.

The island nation is set to face a presidential election in the last quarter of this year, while the parliamentary election is due mid-next year.

However, political uncertainty prevails in the country as opposition parties have pledged to reverse the current IMF-linked reforms, which have proved to be unpopular with the masses.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has steered the recovery programme by going into a bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a USD 2.9 billion facility, maintains that the island could once again face economic collapse if the IMF programme reforms are not adhered to.

### Germany eases gender change rules

*2024-04-12 21:59:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Germany-eases-gender-change-rules/108-280660) ┬╖ `en`

Germany, April 12 (BBC) - The German parliament has passed a law making it easier for citizens and residents to legally change gender.

It's also introducing hefty fines - in specific circumstances - for disclosing someone's prior registered name or gender without consent.

Previously, changing your registered gender required a doctor's certificate and the approval of a family court.

Now over-18s can change to male, female or diverse, a third gender option that already exists under German law.

Three months on from a request for such a change, applicants will then have to appear at a registry office in person.

You can also request that no details regarding your gender are registered at all.

The intentional and harmful disclosure of someone's prior name or legal gender could attract a fine of up to тВм10,000.

However, there are exceptions - for example if it's a legal requirement due to court proceedings or police investigations.

April 12 (BBC) - President Joe Biden has been urged to ban imports of Chinese-made electric cars to the US.

The chair of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Sherrod Brown, wrote "Chinese electric vehicles are an existential threat to the American auto industry".

His comments are the strongest yet by any US lawmaker on the issue, while others have called for steep tariffs to keep Chinese electric vehicles (EV) out of the country.

In February, the White House said the US was opening an investigation into whether Chinese cars pose a national security risk.

"We cannot allow China to bring its government-backed cheating to the American auto industry", Senator Brown said in a video on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.

Senator Brown, who is a Democrat from the the car-producing state of Ohio, is seeking to win a fourth term in office in November's election.

The White House did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.
