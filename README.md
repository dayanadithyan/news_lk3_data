Is this the Faculty Backup Act to suppress the fourth pillar of the pillars of democracy?Otherwise it is to be seen as a law for enriching the media. Everyone has questions as to why this bill is being brought in today. Have been granted adequate rights in the Constitution. I see this as a violation of the constitution.

At present, political analysts are of the opinion that there is a school of thought that it’s better for the country to allow President Ranil Wickremesinghe to continue as the first citizen of the country for a few more years, because he has made essential goods in Sri Lanka freely available, and also put a full stop to queues at fuel and gas stations.  But there are credibility issues with this government because this President hasn’t yet got rid of many lawmakers who have had questionable track records

### Edtech for marginalised children in Sri Lanka: Insights from MENA and other Asian countries

Access to inclusive and equitable quality education is a fundamental human right

Despite the Government’s recent efforts to improve access to technology in facilitating edtech, that solely is insufficient and ineffective in improving inclusiveness in education. Rather, targeted, strategic and innovative measures should be taken to ensure that the implementation of edtech is effective in promoting inclusiveness in education for marginalised and vulnerable groups of children in Sri Lanka

In marking International Day of Education that was observed on 24 January 2024, the following areas are explored on educational technology, based on the IPS study ‘EdTech: Landscape and Challenges in Asia and MENA’.

How technological resources can help fill gaps in access and reduce inequalities in education in Sri Lanka

Despite the recent uptake of educational technology (edtech) in Sri Lanka, it does not cater to the needs of diverse groups of vulnerable children in the country

### Shritharan shock, Presidential election wild card and crippled SJB strategy

Sri Lanka’s Tamil politics just has a new leader. Sivagnanam Shritharan is not the leader I would have hoped and wished for the Tamil people—I was expecting and rooting for M.A. Sumanthiran, a sophisticated postwar parliamentarian—but that’s democracy and the autonomous choice of a community.

The choice of Shritharan, a hardcore Tamil nationalist with sympathy for the LTTE including in wartime, indicates the propensity of Tamil nationalism towards what may seem like separatism but is at root, isolationism, involution. The result is political marginality.

### Sri Lanka defeated Namibia by 77 runs in Kimberley

Jan. 24 (ICC) - In the 12th match of the ICC Under-19 World Cup at Diamond Oval in Kimberley, Sri Lanka secured a commanding 77-run victory over Namibia, showcasing a blend of robust batting and incisive bowling.

The Eagles kept Sri Lanka in check with their tight lines and ensured that the run rate crept at less than two in the first seven overs. Under pressure, Pulindu Perera tried to steal a quick single and was run out by a brilliant teamwork from Peter-Daniel Blignaut, who ran in from point to throw the ball at the non-striker's end, and Junior Kariata, who managed to break stumps despite being awkwardly placed.

The Island nation were then rocked by Zacheo van Vuuren, who brought two wickets in his first two overs. Sineth Jayawardena's minimal foot movement meant that he was unable to cover one that came in, while Ravishan de Silva was brilliantly held by JW Visagie after he nicked one to the keeper's right.
