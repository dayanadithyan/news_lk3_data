### Sri Lanka micro-finance bill challenged by community organizations

*2024-01-24 14:20:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-micro-finance-bill-challenged-by-community-organizations-148535/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – A planned bill to regulate micro-finance organizations has been challenged in the Supreme Court by traditional community organizations which provide savings and credit, according to a statement.

The proposed bill  is “intrusive and violate the autonomy of community organisations such as Death Donations and Welfare Societies, Sarvodaya Shramadana Societies and Women’s Organisations engaged in community savings and credit providing activities for generations before modern micro-finance began,” they say.

The community based organizations have also complained that larger finance companies which also provide micro-finance and where concerns have been raised about “predatory lending”, appear to be excluded.

Regulating for the sake of regulating will harm these community-based initiatives and trample on low-income people’s autonomy and traditional rights to organise their credit services, petitioners have said.

### Northern people who see the military farming in their own land

Parliamentarian Rasamanikam Chanakyan has said that the plight of the people of the Northern region should not come to anyone who sees the military farming on their own land.

He was speaking to the Defense Minister during the hearing of today's parliamentary session.

The war in the North and East is now over 15 years after the end of the war. We cannot accept the claim that we have only protected military camps, especially in these North and East districts after 15 years.

Although the priests claim that the ground floor of the Math Math School is not under military control, the ground land is under military control.

You have said that you have set up another school instead of a school where a military camp has been set up in the Morakottan army.

The newly built school is found in a river area. This is not what village parents or children do not want.

Even if the school is used through a temporary alternative, it is unable to continue to be used.

She’s the last major challenger after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his presidential bid over the weekend, allowing her to campaign as the sole alternative to Trump.

Trump’s allies ramped up pressure on Haley to leave the race before the polls had closed, but Haley vowed after the results were announced to continue her campaign. Speaking to supporters, she intensified her criticism of the former president, questioning his mental acuity and pitching herself as a unifying candidate who would usher in generational change.

### Sri Lanka central bank equity positive by end 2023, no need for govt capital yet: Governor

*2024-01-24 11:05:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-equity-positive-by-end-2023-no-need-for-govt-capital-yet-governor-148503/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank had positive equity in its balance sheet by end December and the central bank does not need a government capital injection, after losses made in debt restructuring, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

The International Monetary Fund has asked the central bank to be recapitalized if its capital is negative by 2025, he said.

“If you look at end December balance sheet, we still maintain positive equity,” Governor Weerasinghe said.

“So I think there is no need for us to seek recapitalization at this point.”

Due to converting Treasury bills to bonds, the lower yielding bonds led to a large capital loss at current yields immediately.

The central bank, while losing money on central bank dollar swaps and dollar borrowings, makes cashflow profits on its Treasuries portfolio coupons, though at a lower rate than before restructuring. Foreign assets also bring profits.

### Prevailing prices of commodities cannot be reduced further - Sagala

Sagala Ratnayaka, the President’s Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of the Presidential Staff, states that there is no possibility of further reducing the prevailing prices of commodities.

Ratnayake expressed that since the rupee is appreciating very slowly, what needs to be done now is to take steps to increase the income of the people.

“The price of goods has been brought to the lowest possible point. The prices of some goods like vegetables, fluctuate frequently. However, in terms of foreign exchange, the prices of goods have reached the lowest point”, he said.

“Further appreciation of the rupee is happening very slowly. All we have to do now is to increase the income of the people. Otherwise, we have to make the income of people match the tripled prices of goods.”

Meanwhile, he also said that although the salaries of government employees are increased by Rs. 10,000 from this year, that amount is nowhere near enough to cover the expenses considering the price hikes.

### Health Ministry denies Onco Surgeon’s retirement request

Colombo, Jan 24 (Daily Mirror) -  Notwithstanding official reports indicating that Onco Surgeon Dr. Crysantha Perera, accused of allegedly assaulting a female hospital staffer, has sought early retirement, the Health Ministry is reported to have rejected his request, Daily Mirror learns.

The surgeon, in accordance with the recently issued circular, is eligible to continue serving until the age of 63. However, the 61-year-old surgeon had formally submitted his retirement request two years prior to reaching the retirement age.

Against this backdrop, informed sources suggest that the Health Ministry's refusal is based on the pressing service requirements at the Karapitiya Hospital, where Dr. Crysantha plays a pivotal role as the chief Onco surgeon.

Highlighting Dr. Crysantha's significant contributions to the hospital, sources emphasise that his departure would create a void that cannot be easily filled at this juncture due to the absence of any immediate replacements.
