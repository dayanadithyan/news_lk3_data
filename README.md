The Finance Ministry officials have told the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) that the revenue loss incurred from the initial ‘sugar scam’ should be classified as tax foregone, instead of a tax loss.

This was mentioned when the Finance Ministry officials were summoned before the COPF on Tuesday (22).

When asked about the progress of recovering the lost revenue resulting from the initial ‘sugar scam’, as highlighted in the report by the Auditor General, the ministerial officials contended that it should not be classified as a tax loss, but rather as tax foregone due to the reduction of the special commodity levy from Rs. 50 to 25 cents.

Despite this explanation, the COPF members pressed the officials for data on certain companies that had disproportionately profited from this tax adjustment, amounting to Rs. 1.4 billion from six companies, with an additional six companies yet to be investigated.

### UK parliament descends into chaos over Gaza ceasefire vote

*2024-02-22 22:00:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97465/uk-parliament-descends-into-chaos-over-gaza-ceasefire-vote) · `en`

Dozens of lawmakers stormed out of Britain’s parliament on Wednesday with tempers flaring as the three biggest political parties sought to outmanoeuvre each other over a vote on a ceasefire in Gaza.

The uproar followed a decision by the speaker to ignore precedent and allow a vote which helped the opposition Labour Party avoid a large-scale rebellion among its own lawmakers over its position on the Israel-Hamas war.

Lawmakers from the governing Conservatives and the opposition Scottish National Party (SNP) left the debating chamber in protest and some tried to take the rare step of holding proceedings in private.

The speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, eventually apologised and said he had made his decision to allow lawmakers to vote on a range of views because he was concerned about their security after some had faced threats of violence over their stance on the war.

“It is regrettable and I apologise for the decision,” he told parliament. “I did not want it to end like this.”

Colombo, Feb 22 (Daily Mirror) - The problems relating to drugs are not the only issue in the health sector, and both the former and incumbent health ministers have been prone to viewing health matters narrowly, focusing primarily on drug-related issues, Deputy Director of the National Hospital Colombo (NHC) Dr. Rukshan Bellana said.

Addressing the media, he said that when considering health issues, the incumbent and former Health Minister walk on a single track.

"Drugs are not the sole issue in the country's health sector. The health administration of the hospitals has gone from bad to worse. We cannot treat patients without implementing rules in hospitals. If the Health Ministry cannot understand the issues faced by the patients and cannot understand what they mean, it is better for everyone to go home," he said.

"We should prioritize on a patient-centred hospital management system while shifting away from an employee-centred approach," he added.

(Reuters) - A Chinese research ship arrived in the Maldives on Thursday, global ship-tracking data showed, just three months after a similar vessel visited the Indian Ocean and sparked New Delhi’s security concerns.

The visit follows January comments by a U.S. think tank, that China’s navy could “leverage the insights gained from these missions” for deployment of naval forces, a claim Beijing calls part of a concocted image-smearing “China threat” narrative.

Xiang Yang Hong 03, owned by a research institute that reports to China’s natural resources ministry, made a port call in the Maldives capital of Male, data from MarineTraffic showed, more than a month after leaving its home port of Xiamen in southeastern China.

Prior to its arrival, the civilian ship had spent more than three weeks surveying waters just outside the exclusive economic zones of India, the Maldives and Sri Lanka, the ship-tracking data showed.

That led the country into an unprecedented economic crisis in 2022 with a sovereign debt default. Sri Lanka is still struggling to come out of the crisis.

### Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and Finance given ‘BBB+(lka)’ rating by Fitch

ECONOMYNEXT – Fitch Ratings said it assigned Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and Finance Plc (MBSL) a first-time national long-term rating of ‘BBB+(lka)’.

“MBSL’s rating is driven by our view that the parent, BOC, would provide extraordinary support to MBSL, if required,” the rating agency said.

“We assess MBSL’s standalone credit profile as being weaker than its support-driven rating because of its small franchise with 1.8% market share of sector loans, evolving business model, and weak financial profile, which is reflected in its poor asset-quality metrics, weak profitability and high leverage.”

Fitch Ratings – Mumbai – 22 Feb 2024: Fitch Ratings has assigned Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka & Finance PLC (MBSL) a first-time National Long-Term Rating of ‘BBB+(lka)’.

MBSL is 84.5% owned by Bank of Ceylon (BOC, A(lka)/Stable) and other BOC group entities. BOC is the largest banking group in the country.

### Sri Lanka repays $20m Iranian oil debt with tea

Colombo, Feb 22 (Daily Star) -  Sri Lanka said Wednesday it had exported tea worth $20 million to Iran to partially repay its $251 million oil debts, with Colombo saying Tehran's visiting foreign minister had expressed "satisfaction" at the deal.

"So far $20 million worth of tea has been exported to Iran under the barter trade agreement," Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena's office said in a statement after talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.

The tea-for-oil deal was agreed upon in December 2021, but exports were delayed by Colombo's economic crisis that forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down in July 2022.

The barter deal allows sanctions-hit Iran to avoid having to use scarce hard currency to pay for imports of popular tea.

It also allowed Sri Lanka to pay with tea, as the country was short of foreign currency.

In her writ petition, the appellant sought an order to quash the decision of the Department of Immigration and Emigration to deport her in an arbitrary manner.

The Attorney General had raised preliminary objections against the appeal on the basis that there is no proper affidavit before court and that the appellant has suppressed material facts and misrepresented facts to court.
