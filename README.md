(Daily Mail) - UK aid to China has fallen by 90% since 2019 тАУ but transparency about how the money is spent is declining, a watchdog has warned.

The Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI) found that engagement with Beijing across all of Government dropped from ┬г80 million at the start of this Parliament to an estimated ┬г8.2 million in 2023-2024.

However, there is only limited information in the public domain on how some aid funding, including the British CouncilтАЩs to China, is being used, according to a report by the watchdog.

Transparency has further reduced this year with the decision to stop routinely publishing official development assistance (ODA)-eligible administration costs on a country-by-country basis, the ICAI said.

It follows a change in OECD guidelines on donor reporting of such costs, which now requires that donors do not assign them to a specific nation.

Russia and China on Friday vetoed a U.S.-sponsored United Nations resolution supporting тАЬan immediate and sustained cease-fireтАЭ in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, calling the measure ambiguous and saying it was not the direct demand to end the fighting that much of the world seeks.

### Weather, economy and fate of cricket team

ItтАЩs growing hotter by the day. Last Saturday the temperature in Colombo rose to around 89 degrees Fahrenheit.

Forecasters have predicted that there will be no let-up in the spell of hot weather. Rather they are warning that temperatures will rise further by April when the sun will be directly over Lanka.

Doctors also warn the public to avoid strenuous labour, to wear white clothing that absorbs solar energy and drink more water. A difficulty here is that our reservoirs are running low on water supplies. The Department of Irrigation is requesting the public to reduce the consumption of water!

The irony of it all is that the Department of Meteorology warned us of the impending dry spell around mid-last year. In this column we have constantly drawn attention to the need to dredge our ancient tanks and the need for clearing waterways which feed the tanks, thereby enhancing the collection of greater quantities of water.
