Colombo, June 4 (Daily Mirror) - The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has scheduled a major shutdown of the refinery at Sapugaskanda from July 8, its media spokesman S.M.C.P. Samarakoon said.

He said the refinery crude unit was shut down on May 29, followed by a complete shutdown of the production processes on May 30 morning due to a failure in the water demineralization plant, which is crucial for refinery power generation facilities.

After painstaking efforts, the repair work on the boiler water system has been successful, and the restoration of the power system will be completed shortly, Samarakoon said.

The resumption of the crude unit operation will commence effective tomorrow, and other processors will be started subsequently, he said.

Therefore, the CPC assured the public that there is no need to worry about their fuel requirements, as Ceypetco has sufficient stocks in storage tanks.

### Modi claims victory for his alliance in India’s general election

*2024-06-04 21:08:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99664/modi-claims-victory-for-his-alliance-in-indias-general-election) · `en`

(AP) — Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed victory for his alliance on Tuesday in India’s general election, despite a lackluster performance from his own party as it faced a stronger than expected challenge from the opposition, which pushed back against his mixed economic record and polarizing politics.

Modi told a crowd at his party’s headquarters that his National Democratic Alliance will form the government for the third consecutive time, saying Indian voters had “shown immense faith” both in his party and the coalition alliance.

“Today’s victory is the victory of the world’s largest democracy” he said.

Still, for the first time since Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it appeared unlikely it would secure a majority on its own, and the prime minister would instead need the support of the other parties in his coalition for his third five-year term in the world’s largest democratic exercise.

Sri Lankans observe May 1 ‘the International Labour Day” as a holiday. Political parties hold rallies, often as a show of strength. Three decades ago, President Ranasinghe Premadasa was killed by a LTTE suicide bomber, while addressing the United National Party (UNP)’s May Day rally. This year as many as 19 rallies were held in Colombo. The presidential election poised to be held in Sept-October added interest to the rallies. Notable among them was the rally of the UNP addressed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The large number of people who turned up at the rally probably cheered Wickremesinghe, after the historic drubbing the UNP suffered in the last parliamentary poll.

ECONOMYNEXT – Direct flight by Pakistan’s private airline operator Air Sial between Colombo and Islamabad is likely to reduce the air ticket cost, Sri Lankan High Commissioner for Pakistan Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne said.

No direct flight is operating between Colombo and Islamabad now.

Sri Lankans travel to Pakistan’s capital via Dubai or Doha Qatar, with transit flights at a higher cost and long duration. The alternative with land route from Lahore or Karachi also takes much time.

“This connectivity has to increase. We are unable to do it with Sri Lankan Airlines,” Wijegunaratne told EconomyNext from Islamabad.

“So we need to get private airlines. This is a very profitable route. SriLankan (Airline) does not have aircraft and the tickets are expensive because of monopoly,” he said.

“A direct flight from Colombo to Islamabad will be only 3.5 hours. The Pakistan government has realized this and now Air Sial is given approval and it is already operating mostly for Buddhist countries.”

### Imran Khan acquitted in state secrets case

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been acquitted of leaking state secrets but will remain in jail because of a conviction in another case.

In the run-up to elections in February, the 71-year-old - who was ousted as prime minister in 2022 - was hit with three prison sentences for cases he insists were politically motivated.

Khan was sentenced to 10 years in prison in January on charges of making public a diplomatic cable in 2022.

The Islamabad High Court upheld his appeal and cleared him in that case on Monday, but he is not expected to leave prison for now.

The former cricket star and his third wife Bushra are both serving prison sentences after a court ruled that their 2018 marriage had been un-Islamic and illegal as it came too soon after her divorce.

The couple were also found guilty of corruption over gifts received during his term as prime minister.

Even behind bars, the former cricket star remains a powerful force in Pakistani politics.
