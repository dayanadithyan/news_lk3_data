### Why are foreign envoys making a beeline to  the JVP?

The JVP misread the invite as the Indians had acknowledged that the party would be the next government in waiting and Anura Kumara, the prospective president.

These days, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)/National PeopleтАЩs Power (NPP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and top-level party stalwarts are busy receiving a beeline of foreign diplomats, who seem eager to know what is going through those elusive minds.

That is an achievement for the party that languished on the sideline. Their luck has changed since the Indians showed a sudden interest and invited the JVP leadership to New Delhi, where they met, among others, Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, and travelled to ModiтАЩs home turf, Gujarat to learn the Gujarati model of development.

ECONOMYNEXT тАФ Research by free market think tank Advocata has found that persistent disparities in financial and digital literacy are major hindrances to women achieving financial independence in Sri Lanka, a country whose female labour force participation is half of that of men.

The study has found that, despite a commendable literacy rate, disparities in financial and digital literacy hinders access to financial services.

The Advocata Institute said in a statement on the study that Sri Lanka has been struggling with inadequate digital infrastructure and a regulatory environment where vulnerable populations, notably women, face exploitation and marginalisation which contributed to restricting womenтАЩs access to finance. Other barriers, which include the lack of digital and financial literacy, drove consumers, especially women, towards informal financial services.

The Central Bank yesterday resumed cuts by further reducing key policy rates by 50 basis points as inflation remains anchored. The move was also to further ease the financial conditions┬аwith a view to support and accelerate the expansion of the economy.

The rates cut came after a four months hiatus since November 22 last year, when the Central Bank said they would pause any more reduction until both, the government securities yields and the lending rates, fall broadly in line with the policy rates.

Although both yields and rates eased thereafter, quite notably the yields showed some reversal in the last four weeks while the softening in lending rates slowed, the Central Bank said.

Even as we pen these lines, our country is going through one of the hottest periods weather-wise. As though this were not bad enough, political party leaders and their followers are also breathing fire at their opponents, adding to the heat.

We continue witnessing intra-party squabbles in the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and dirty linen being washed in public. The тАШNational PeopleтАЩs Power is gaining in popularity. But in the past it has not been able to turn this into actual votes.

The year 2024 is already seeing a turnaround for private equity deals with Sri Lanka expecting deals amounting up to USD 250 million, says the Hong Kong-based merchant banking firm MCM Partners.

Speaking to Bloomberg Markets Asia on Monday (March 25), Managing Director of MCM Partners Jahnavi Bhagwati explained as to why she sees a turnaround for private equity deals in 2024 as opposed to a sluggish 2023.

According to her, countries like India and Sri Lanka, which is a turnaround story, are going to present opportunities in the private space this year after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates in March, ending the countryтАЩs historic era of negative interest rates in a move that marked a historic shift in monetary policy.

Bhagwati mentioned that the stock markets in the region are already seeing a pickup as inflation has been curbed, adding that investment activity will spur when rate cuts kick in.
