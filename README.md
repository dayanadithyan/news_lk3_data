When people who have the same first name meet up, there‚Äôs name-related humour. The more, the merrier, obviously, especially if they are good friends and enjoy friendly banter. Today I am thinking of three people who share the name Michael: Michael Tissera, Michael Sproule and Michael De Zoysa, all three who played cricket for St. Thomas‚Äô College, Mt. Lavinia. The first of course is the bigger name associated with the gentleman‚Äôs game.

Today I remember these three gentlemen sending everyone into fits of laughter as they talked among themselves, each referring to the others by name. It went something along the following lines: ‚ÄòYes Michael, as I was telling Michael‚Ä¶but Michael, when I explained to Michael, Michael kind of agreed, but then again Michael‚Ä¶‚Äô And it went on!

### The Lasantha Wickrematunge legacy: Remembering his life and influence

5 April would have been the 66th birthday of one of the country‚Äôs most beloved, renowned journalists and human rights defenders Lasantha Wickrematunge who was assassinated at the age of 50. Many have been inspired by the work of this legendary figure. He was a fearless activist and fighter for a democratic Sri Lanka during the 26-year bloody civil war and he went on to win the hearts of millions of our countrymen for his unwavering pursuit of racial equality and human rights in our homeland.

I first met Lasantha when I was 14 years old in 2000. My family had just moved to Nugegoda for a short period and we lived one road down from his home. The boys around our area would often gather to play cricket outside after school and everybody in our neighbourhood would always point at his house and proudly boast to any visitors as to who our neighbour was.

In an era of escalating climate risks and impacts, the global financial system stands at a crossroads. Existing structures and frameworks are facing serious challenges in adjusting to a changing global environment in ways that acknowledge and address the imperatives of climate justice, equity, and the needs of developing countries. The urgency of reform or improvement has been highlighted by several recent initiatives and proposals, such as the Bridgetown Initiative 2.0, the Paris Pact for People and Planet, the V20 Accra-Marrakech Agenda, or the Ubuntu Initiative, and featured prominently in the climate negotiations as well.

### Racist politics raising its ugly head?

On Saturday 30 March 2024 in a YouTube message, Sujeewa Bandara, former Secretary to the ousted President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, claimed that the people who gathered at the Mirihana house of Gotabaya seeking to remove him from power as president were not Sinhalese but Muslims.

This is absolute nonsense, calculated mischief and bankrupt politics. Video clips of the event show there were no Muslims there but all Sinhalese. Thus the statement, on the eve of presidential or general elections, seems to be aimed at rousing Sinhalese against Muslims ‚Äì perhaps to come to power as they had done since the island‚Äôs independence in 1948.

Fortunately for Sri Lanka, Sinhalese have woken up and openly dismiss racist politics. All what they want is solution to their burning day-to-day economic problems caused by racist politics.

### Mannar Wind Farm Project: Another folly like Sinharaja logging project on the horizon?

A wind farm consisting of 30 towers generating 100MW (Phase 1 ‚Äì Thambapawani) was established on the southern coast of Mannar Island in 2020, with financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The widespread criticism of this project due to its positioning within one of the main bird migratory corridors in the Asian region (detailed elsewhere in the article) was largely overlooked or ignored due to the economic priorities that prevailed at the time, as it happened with the now infamous Canadian-funded Sinharaja Mechanised Logging Project of the 1960s and 70s.

Jaffna, April 05 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that both Sinhala and Tamil people have a right to interact with the State in their own languages, NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that the proportion of the Tamil youth in public institutions, tri-forces and important sectors should be increased.

Speaking at the Northern Provincial Conference of Ceylon Teachers Service Union yesterday, he said it was vital to defeat the racial political culture in the country on behalf of the future generation.

"Our main political stream has adopted rival politics so far. Sinhala people in the South were organised against the North. Tamil people in the North were organised against Sinhala people in the South. We need to put a stop to this racial political culture. That is for our future generation," he said.

Dissanayake appealed to Tamil politicians in the North saying that if they were really concerned about the issues faced by the Tamil people, they need to unite.
