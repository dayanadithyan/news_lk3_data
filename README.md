### What I learnt and what Tamil political leaders never learnt

*2024-04-17 03:11:08* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-I-learnt-and-what-Tamil-political-leaders-never-learnt/4-760701) · `en`

Who is responsible for emerging religious extremism in Tamil North? Let me tell you, it’s the callously irresponsible Colombo resident Tamil leaderships. In democratic electoral politics, the strength of leaderships lies in how open and committed they stand against injustice and for democratic and fundamental rights.

### Gammanpila seeks official docs on Katchatheevu from FM

*2024-04-17 02:42:34* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Gammanpila-seeks-official-docs-on-Katchatheevu-from-FM/56-760694) · `en`

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader Udaya Gammanpila has requested official documents from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning the ceding of Katchatheevu Island from India to Sri Lanka. He submitted a Right to Information (RTI) request on 11 April.

Gammanpila said the request was made at an opportune time, as India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has brought up the Katchatheevu issue during the lead-up to India’s general election, which begins on 19 April.

He expressed a desire for the public to have access to the relevant documents, including what he termed historical evidence dating back to the 12th century BC and the exchange of letters between India and Sri Lanka on the subject.

The Katchatheevu issue was raised on Indian political platforms by Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently, who accused the rival Congress party of underhandedly giving the island to Sri Lanka. Modi also criticised the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) for its alleged involvement in the matter.

### How does CSK get best out of Pathirana?

*2024-04-16 19:28:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/How-does-CSK-get-best-out-of-Pathirana/108-280785) · `en`

Colombo, April 16 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana delivered another match-winning performance for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) on Sunday when they defeated Mumbai Indians fairly comfortably.

The right arm quick ended up taking four wickets for 28 runs keeping  CSK in the third spot of the points, very much in the running for play-offs.

Pathirana has so far played three games in the IPL 2024 capturing eight wickets and the 21-year-old seems to be flourishing in Chennai colours.

The former Trinity College speedster has done fairly reasonable job when representing the country. However, in certain games he was well below par.

One would wonder how has CSK been able to get the best out of Pathirana far more regularly.

It must be stated that CSK found Pathirana before the national selectors even considered him for Sri Lanka. Chennai probably have a better scouting system through which they had identified Matheesha Pathirana and Maheesh Theekshana.

Colombo, April 16 (Daily Mirror) -  The Court of Appeal has ordered the suspension of the previous allocation of quotas for Haj pilgrims for 2024 and to include an aggrieved travel agent for proper allocation.

Each year the Saudi Arabian government allocates quotas to each country in order to manage the influx of pilgrims.

Sri Lanka had been allocated 3,500 pilgrims this year which had been allocated to different travel agents.

The Court of Appeal made the interim order following a petition filed by a travel agent.

The travel agent alleged that the Haj Committee had arbitrarily suspended their travel license for a period of two years.

In the petition the petitioner United Travels said that the decision by the commitee to suspend his license for two years was done for collateral reasons.

The petitioner asked that he be registered as a travel operator for 2024 and to suspend the allocation made in December 2023.

### SJB accuses NPP of avoiding calls for Sri Lanka presidential debate

ECONOMYNEXT — The leftist National People’s Power (NPP) is avoiding the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB)’s call for a debate ahead of Sri Lanka’s upcoming presidential election, the SJB claimed.

SJB MP Harshana Rajakaruna told reporters that when the SJB invited the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led NPP for a debate between the economic councils of the two parties, the NPP proposed a debate between the two party leaders instead.

“We’re ready for both. The JVP is avoiding the issue,” said Rajakaruna, accusing the Marxist-Leninist party of obfuscating through various statements.

Neither SJB leader Sajith Premadasa nor NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake can govern alone and each would need a skilled team to implement their policies led by an honest leader, said Rajakaruna.

“The most skilled team is with Premadasa in the SJB,” he said.

The MP once again invited the NPP for whatever debate of their choosing.

April 16 - Experienced Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has revealed he asked to sit out a recent Indian Premier League (IPL) match to give himself a 'mental and physical break' ahead of June's ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

Maxwell watched on from the sidelines as his Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) fell to a 25-run loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday, with the Australia star admitting after the match that he had asked team management to omit him from the side.

The 35-year-old has made an indifferent start to the ongoing IPL season with just 32 runs from six innings and the dip in form has seen the highly-rated RCB outfit manage just one win from seven matches and sees them languish at the bottom of the IPL table.

With Maxwell set to play a major role in Australia's tilt for T20 World Cup success in the USA and Caribbean in June, the veteran said he requested to team management that he be dropped from the side so he could reset ahead of the 20-over showcase.
