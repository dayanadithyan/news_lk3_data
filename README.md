Records Rs. 75 .5 bn profit for group, Rs. 61.2 bn for Board

Even without favourable weather conditions, CEB would have made profits amounting to Rs. 40 bn

The financial performance of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is largely positive as it ended the financial year 2023 with a massive profit.

Unaudited interim financial statements filed to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) showed Rs. 75.7 billion profits for the Group, and Rs. 61.2 billion for the Board.

The improvement in the financial performance is largely due to the increase in rainfall from September, and the hike in electricity tariff that came in the fourth quarter (4Q23). However, as per the statements, even without the heavy rainfalls which reduced its reliance on oil and coal-based generation, CEB would have still made profits of about Rs. 40 billion.

Corruption and Crime in our country have hit a new high. According to Transparency International, ‚ÄúSri Lanka is the 115th least corrupt nation out of 180 countries‚Äù. According to the 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index reported by Transparency International Corruption Rank, Sri Lanka averaged 87.50 from 2002 until 2023, reaching an all time high of 115.00 in 2023.

The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) say, impunity has over the years become institutionalised and systematised. Mechanisms to hold state actors to account for their actions have been eroded.

During the time of former President Rajapaksa, via amendments to the Constitution, checks on the arbitrary use of power were diluted, and institutions to protect the independence of the judiciary were tampered with.

As of February 2024, Sri Lanka lost another 38 elephants as a result of the Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC), elephant-train collisions, gunshot injuries and other natural causes.

In 2023, Sri Lanka made headlines as the country with the highest number of elephant deaths as 473 elephants succumbed to natural and largely unnatural causes. For years, Sri Lanka‚Äôs wildlife has been at the receiving end of poor infrastructure development, encroachment of lands and lack of collaboration among stakeholder institutions to minimize human-wildlife conflicts.
