Investing in women also includes actively addressing discrimination and ensuring laws, policies, budgets and investments that respond to their needs

It is time that Sri Lanka prioritizes women’s empowerment and recognizes that gender equality is not only a matter of rights but the bedrock of an equitable, peaceful and prosperous society. However, it takes investment to build inclusive communities and societies with the full participation of women and girls from all backgrounds

When global crises such as climate disasters, poverty, and hunger occur, women and girls are affected the most

Gender inequality is also reflected in women’s representation and participation in leadership, which remains abysmally low in Sri Lanka

March 8 (Reuters) - Gold prices surged to a fresh record high on Friday as data showing a rise in the U.S. unemployment rate boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates soon.

Spot gold rose 0.7% to $2,173.49 per ounce by 10:42 a.m. ET (1542 GMT), while U.S. gold futures added 0.7% to $2,180.50.

Bullion was on track to post its biggest weekly percentage increase since mid-October.

Gold reached an all-time high of $2,185.19 after a report showed a rise in the U.S. unemployment rate and a moderation in wage gains despite job growth acceleration in February.

"We still believe the same underlying premise remains, which is the combination of the expectation that the Fed is still going to cut rates later this year and dollar weakness," said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.

### Gold hits fresh record, heads for best week in 5 months

Gold prices hit record highs for a fourth consecutive session on Friday on growing speculations over June interest rate cuts ahead of key U.S. jobs data due later in the day.

Spot gold rose 0.4% to $2,168.28 per ounce as of 1057 GMT, while U.S. gold futures added 0.5% to $2,175.50.

Gold reached a new all-time high of $2,170.99 earlier in the session and has gained more than 4.1% so far this week, setting it on track to post its biggest weekly percentage increase since mid-October.

“I think a lot of the demand that we’ve seen coming from is really in the paper market. It’s just speculative demand,” said Michael Widmer, Bank of America’s head of Metals Research.

“You always had good support from Chinese buying and central bank buying. But that was never enough to take prices high.”

Gold first surpassed its December peak on Tuesday, primarily aided by growing indications of cooling price pressures and bullion’s traditional safe-haven cachet.

*2024-03-08 17:43:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178261) · `ta`

Velu Kumar MP, elected as President of the Union in the 9th Parliament, represents the upcountry plantation community. The Union, established by the Tamil Progressive Alliance, aims to address the community's needs and future development.

🟩

The Parliament for the evolution of the upcountry plantation community was established in the ninth parliament by the efforts of the Tamil Progressive Alliance. At the same time, Kandy district parliamentarian Velu Kumar was unanimously elected as the President of the Union.

Vice Presidents Sujith Sanjaya Perera, Nayana Vasalake and Udayakumar were elected as Vice Presidents. Leaders of many parties and senior MPs were present at the event.

Within the Parliament, many groups and unions are running. However, the problems of the mountain plantation community are being investigated directly on anything that is doing so is very low. Thus, there is no such thing as the development of policymakers and projects related to the future of the mountain plantation community.

To eliminate this gap, the Union was founded in Parliament at the request of the Tamil Progressive Alliance to carry out the activities of the Upcountry Plantation Community.

### The National People's Power should unite in the widespread political alliance - the Freedom People's Council

*2024-03-08 17:42:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178255) · `ta`

The National People's Power is uniting in the Freedom People's Council, a political alliance led by the United People's Power. Dylan Perera, a representative of the Independent People's Council, urged national unity in this coalition. Sri Lanka Peramuna's alliance with the United National Party could lead to less than 20 seats in the general election, prompting President Ranil Wickremesinghe to prioritize the United National Party. The PA's boycott is understood, and coalitions should only form when the truth is understood. The United People's Sabha-led coalition will be established on the 15th.

🟩

The broader political coalition headed by the main opposition United People's Power will be established on the 15th.

Members of the Ministry of PA, which are not in the ministry, are opposed to the government and the Ministry of State for the Ministry of State and the Ministry of State for alliance with the United National Party.

If Sri Lanka Peramuna will get less than 20 seats if he has allied with the United National Party and contests the general election, President Ranil Wickremesinghe will give priority to the United National Party.

Most of the members of the PA have been able to understand the boycott of the PA, which has been well understood in the present state.

### Indian Ocean Security Conference & Ranil’s Statement – A Point Of View

*2024-03-08 17:33:15* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/indian-ocean-security-conference-ranils-statement-a-point-of-view/) · `en`

I refer to the front page headlined news report in the Daily News paper of 29th February 2024 and wish to express my independent, objective views as a free thinker.

Indian Ocean as the name suggest is virtually India’s Ocean, because India is the predominant country in the region. The security of the Indian Ocean is a major concern of India, as much as those of the other littoral countries, including Sri Lanka. In this light, saying that Sri Lanka will remain neutral is preposterous. Sri Lanka’s security is also tied up with the Indian Ocean Security. Therefore, it cannot remain neutral and do nothing about it.

ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka wants to introduce more foreign languages to the school curriculum to make it easier for school leavers to get jobs, but there is a shortage of teachers, State Minister for Education, Aravindh Kumar, said.

Sri Lankans are already seeking jobs in Japan and Korea where local language skills are a requirement.

“We are planning on introducing foreign languages such as Japanese, Chinese and Korean in order to create jobs for local people,” Kumar said to reporters Friday.

“When I met with the Japanese ambassador, he said he will give Sri Lankans jobs with a salary of 500,000 in Japan, however, they must know Japanese language.”

Sri Lanka, however, does not have enough foreign language teachers.

Sri Lanka has lost more than 5,000 teachers, after the latest currency collapse, according to reports.

Sri Lankan teachers are paid low salaries. At Sri Lanka’s salary scales with depreciating rupee, it is not possible to recruit foreign teachers.
