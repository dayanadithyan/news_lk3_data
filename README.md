Specially those living along the upper areas of the Kelani and Kalu Ganga closer to the Ratnapura district are requested to be vigilent of sudden floods, he said.

There are possibilities of sudden floods in these areas if rains of 100mm continue, Bandara said.

### Aachchi ‚Äì My Heroine

*2024-05-26 04:19:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/aachchi-my-heroine/) ¬∑ `en`

Aachchi (my paternal grandmother)‚Äôs claim to fame was a story about her mother‚Äôs bravery. My great-grandmother was 160-years old when the Krakatoa Volcano in the Javanese Sea erupted in 1883. She ran with her brother to the seabed to catch gasping fish left behind by the receding waves. When the sea swelled and exploded, it took her about a hundred metres before dashing her onto a building. If we pressed for more drama, Aachchi would say that her mother rode high waves and swam home over the railway track and coconut trees.

At the time of his death on May 19, in a helicopter crash that has yet to be fully investigated, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi had risen through the ranks. Sanctioned by the West and nicknamed the ‚ÄúButcher of Tehran‚Äù for his uncompromising attitude to protesters, he was seen as the successor to Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Under his watch Iran went through some pretty turbulent times, including a spate of protests in 2021 following the death in custody of a 22-year-old woman. But it also saw through a transformation in its foreign relations, signalling an outreach to Asia and the Global South.

On the day of Mullivaikkal, we remember the thousands of people killed in the final war in Sri Lanka and the victims of the worst human rights violations.. At this point, I recall the victims who are still living with the pain of the injustice they have been inflicted, and those who survived the violations and their loved ones.

At the same time, Mullivaikkal and the war should be viewed as symbolism that should be remembered that the victims of the past violations should be stopped before justice.

### Eighty years in Sri Lanka:The Life and Times of Fr. Vito Perniola SJ

I always wonder how he did it? A simple, slender Italian priest who used the bus to get about. He was one who never compromised on discipline. A stickler for proper diction who spoke a manifold of Western and Oriental languages. A first-rate scholar who realized there was a single door one could walk in and outof between history and social linguistics. He embraced the Lankan heritage by becoming a distinguished citizen of the country just after independence.

Generations not born here will laud and praise the memory of Father Vito Perniola of the Society of Jesus for his exemplary efforts in publishing 19 definitive volumes on the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka. Abstemious by nature, and frugal in food, drink, clothes, and lifestyle, Fr. Vito Perniola was a shining example of plain living and high thinking.
