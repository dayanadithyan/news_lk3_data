Why is all the attention to address accountability only fixated on the Sri Lankan State and none on the LTTE?

A report in an English daily recently stated that the UN human rights office has ‚Äúcriticised the Sri Lankan Government‚Äôs failure to acknowledge and hold accountable the perpetrators of tens of thousands of enforced disappearances‚Ä¶ Authors of the report also accuse the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam of ‚Äúengaging in abductions‚Äù which were described as ‚Äútantamount‚Äù to enforced disappearances.‚Äù Continuing, the report adds that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights had stated: ‚ÄúAccountability must be addressed.

The challenge for the major political parties is to accept the concept and then work out any areas of contention, and areas of improvements

The concept of a legislated economic plan that incorporates economic parameters (or targets) is an opportunity to end 76 years of insanity. The challenge for the major political parties is to accept the concept and then work out any areas of contention, and areas of improvements. Opposing the concept is insanity and a disservice to future generations.

The Economic Transformation Bill is expected to provide for the National Policy on Economic Transformation and for the establishment of the Economic Commission of Sri Lanka, Investment Zones, Office for International Trade, National Productivity Commission, and Sri Lanka Institute of Economics and International Trade, and for the repeal of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law No.4 of 1978 and other matters connected.

### Interventions of a freelance intellectual: A review of Dayan Jayatilleka‚Äôs selected writings

British philosopher and historian Perry Anderson defines Western Marxism as the product of defeat. Unlike in the Soviet Union and China, there were no successful Marxist revolutions in the West. The Western Marxist is then a vanquished and disenchanted figure. Never having known the taste and trials of success, the Western Marxist reduces socialism to an abstract ideal and an impotent exercise in scholasticism.

The theologian and Marxist scholar Roland Boer identifies the ‚Äúfreelance intellectual‚Äù as the chief proponent of Western Marxism. In short, the freelance intellectual is the academic, journalist, cultural critic, etc. who purveys a form of Marxist analysis but is, for the most part, independent of the discipline and accountability enforced by membership in a Communist Party or trade union. In China, to be a Communist means to be a Community Party member. In the West, one is free to adopt any label one pleases.

Elections are crucial in democracy, allowing citizens to choose their leaders and hold them accountable. However, the proposal to postpone Sri Lanka's presidential and parliamentary elections for two years faces significant backlash. Critics argue that extending the government's term undermines democracy and could suppress opposition. Economic recovery and international support are cited as reasons, but opponents warn that delaying elections could harm democratic gains and public trust.

To date, 16 people have died, 5 remain missing and 84,749 persons have been displaced. Sadly, nothing has changed. Have our engineers run out of ideas as to how such disasters could be prevented?

Media reports show 2017 was perhaps the worst year since torrential rains soaked the country in May 2003. The Disaster Management Center reported more than 150 deaths, over 1,800 damaged homes and almost half a million people becoming homeless.

After painstaking efforts, the repair work on the boiler water system has been successful, and the restoration of the power system will be completed shortly, Samarakoon said.

The resumption of the crude unit operation will commence effective tomorrow, and other processors will be started subsequently, he said.

### Modi claims victory for his alliance in India‚Äôs general election

(AP) ‚Äî Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed victory for his alliance on Tuesday in India‚Äôs general election, despite a lackluster performance from his own party as it faced a stronger than expected challenge from the opposition, which pushed back against his mixed economic record and polarizing politics.

Modi told a crowd at his party‚Äôs headquarters that his National Democratic Alliance will form the government for the third consecutive time, saying Indian voters had ‚Äúshown immense faith‚Äù both in his party and the coalition alliance.

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs victory is the victory of the world‚Äôs largest democracy‚Äù he said.

Still, for the first time since Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it appeared unlikely it would secure a majority on its own, and the prime minister would instead need the support of the other parties in his coalition for his third five-year term in the world‚Äôs largest democratic exercise.

Sri Lankans observe May 1 ‚Äòthe International Labour Day‚Äù as a holiday. Political parties hold rallies, often as a show of strength. Three decades ago, President Ranasinghe Premadasa was killed by a LTTE suicide bomber, while addressing the United National Party (UNP)‚Äôs May Day rally. This year as many as 19 rallies were held in Colombo. The presidential election poised to be held in Sept-October added interest to the rallies. Notable among them was the rally of the UNP addressed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The large number of people who turned up at the rally probably cheered Wickremesinghe, after the historic drubbing the UNP suffered in the last parliamentary poll. Wickremesinghe also lost the election.

The former Puttalam district and ex-state minister wanted a resolution passed by Parliament to that effect and ratified by the people at a referendum.

The essence of what Palitha Range Bandara proposed was this -. Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the country‚Äôs leadership at a time of a great economic crisis. Considerable progress  has been achieved by the  Wickremesinghe Govt to remedy the situation.

### Defying  Doomsday Predictions of Exit polls  the Congress -led INDIA -Bloc of Opposition Parties  Shock  the Ruling  BJP in vital states, thereby resetting India‚Äôs political landscape.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost its national majority after suffering major losses in key states, marking a dramatic shift in a political landscape it has dominated for the past decade.

The BJP emerged, comfortably, as the country‚Äôs single-largest party in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India‚Äôs parliament. But with most votes counted after India‚Äôs six-week-long election on Tuesday, the BJP was well short of its performances from 2014 and 2019.

Unlike both those elections, when the BJP won clear majorities on its own in a house of 543 seats, it was poised to end up with 240 seats this time around. The halfway mark is 272 seats.

By contrast, the opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party, was projected to win more than 200 seats, significantly higher than exit polls had predicted. Released on June 1 after the final phase of India‚Äôs election cycle, the exit polls had suggested that the BJP would outdo its 2019 tally of 303 seats.
