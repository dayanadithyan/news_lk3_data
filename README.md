Will the Muslims rally behind the candidate promising to do away with the old system? ‚Äì Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

He has been in politics for a long time to understand the business mentality of these parvenus, and he knows that many of them would swing their allegiance to any side at the right price. That allegiance was assumed to be enough to draw Muslim votes in the past, because those leaders with support from religious clerics ruled over their respective constituencies like fiefdoms. This will not work anymore, because of the new awakening. AKD‚Äôs call for a new political culture and NPP‚Äôs commitment for a clean and accountable government are the primary ingredients of the recipe for a new system. A new generation of voters are rallying behind AKD, island wide. Muslims should not isolate themselves and stand aloof from this memorable shift

Renewable energy (RE) is clean, abundant, and sustainable but comes with its own challenges like intermittency, variability, cost, and integration.

To overcome these, the sector is constantly innovating with newer technologies and practices to make it more cost and operationally effective.

Fuel produced from green energy sources such as hydrogen, methane, ammonia, and ethanol are green in nature and these can be stored, transported, and used for various applications, such as transportation, heating, and industry. Many nations are building capacities for such fuel, and Sri Lanka too has huge potential to produce and export them.
