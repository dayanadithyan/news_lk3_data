The reasons for the ban on the events have been changed from preventing the spread of the disease from the prevention of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).

The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval for the proposal to commence G.C.E. Advanced Level classes immediately after the conclusion of the ongoing G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination.

As it takes at least 03 months for the Department of Examinations to release the results after the completion of the G.C.E. O/L examination, students drop out of schools during this period, they are less inclined to continue studies and this leads to the creation of various social problems.

Accordingly, it has been recognized that it is appropriate to start higher education activities in schools immediately after the completion of G.C.E. O/L examinations, the Department of Government Information (DGI) said in a release.

Thus, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal table by Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha to commence G.C.E. Advanced Level classes immediately after the completion of G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination, which is currently underway.
