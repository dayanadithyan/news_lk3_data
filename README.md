### Foreign reserves expand reaching US$ 4.5bn in February

Official reserves in February reach US$ 4,517 mn, up from US$ 4,496 mn in January

In February, official foreign currency reserves inched up as the Central Bank maintained its efforts to shore up reserves by accumulating foreign currency from banks. This accumulation comes at a time when demand for foreign currency remains subdued compared to the ample supply from remittances, tourism, and robust exports.

Latest figures reveal that by the end of February, the Central Bank held US$ 4,517 million in official reserve assets, a modest increase from US$ 4,496 million reported in January.

With the absence of large-scale demand for foreign currency from the importers, and also the absence of substantial foreign currency, debt repayments have provided more wiggle room for the Central Bank to collect dollars from the market and rebuild its reserve buffer.

### UNHRC Robust on Lanka, Hypocrisy in Gaza - EDITORIAL

Earlier this month, the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) once again took up the issue of its resolution on ‚ÄúPromoting Reconciliation, Accountability and Human Rights in Sri Lanka‚Äù. We also heard for the umpteenth time representatives of western nations pontificate on how wars should be conducted with minimum loss to civilians, women and children.

Believe it or not, it is we Lankans who have undergone civil conflicts on three or more occasions. It was after all our men and women (brothers, sisters, husbands, wives and children) who paid the price in blood, sweat and tears. It was we who suffered the pain of inquisition. We have seen it all and still feel the pain.

War means killing and being killed. The rules of war ‚Äì the protection of women, children and non combatants ‚Äì are often ignored during armed conflicts. However, the cold-blooded killing of civilians is not only a war crime, but a crime against humanity and cannot be tolerated.

(Reuters) - Palestinians prepared for Ramadan in sombre mood with heightened security measures by Israeli police and the spectre of war and hunger in Gaza overshadowing the normally festive Muslim holy month as talks to secure a ceasefire stalled.

Thousands of police have been deployed around the narrow streets of the Old City in Jerusalem, where tens of thousands of worshippers are expected every day at the Al Aqsa mosque compound, one of the holiest sites in Islam.

The area, considered the most sacred place by Jews who know it as Temple Mount, has been a longstanding flashpoint for trouble and was one of the starting points of the last war in 2021 between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls Gaza.

That 10-day conflict has been dwarfed by the current war, which is now in its sixth month. It began on Oct. 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, by Israeli tallies.

Colombo, March 10 (Daily Mirror)- President Ranil Wickremesinghe is opting to hold the Presidential election first while the Rajapaksas want the General Elections held first, National People's Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.

Speaking at the Colombo District Women's Convention, he said the President prefers the Presidential election held first than to the General Elections as he has no strong support at the grassroots level.

He said the Rajapaksas prefer the General Elections first as they deem that going for a Presidential election is disadvantageous to them as they have no strong candidate to contest for the Presidency.

"The SLPP knows Rajapaksas cannot be brought in again as a leader. Basil came to the country recently. But, he has no chance to contest for the Presidency. So, they think that the General elections is more advantageous to them," he said.

And a leader of one of Ukraine‚Äôs Christian churches on Sunday said that only the country‚Äôs determined resistance to Moscow‚Äôs full-scale invasion, launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 24, 2022, had prevented a mass slaughter of civilians.

In an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI and partially released on Saturday, Francis used the phrase ‚Äúthe courage of the white flag‚Äù as he argued that Ukraine, facing a possible defeat, should be open to peace talks brokered by international powers.

They explained that nearly 40% of the female employees, including pregnant women, face difficulties due to this, adding that the Central Mail Exchange is an eight-storied building, therefore making it a rather difficult task to move around mail bags.

Thus, the UPTUF warned that if the government fails to resolve the matter within a month, the trade union action will continue.
