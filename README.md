அரசியலமைப்புத் திருத்தம் தொடர்பிலான பணிகள் துறைசார் அனுபவம் மிக்கவர்களிடமே கையளிக்கப்படுமெனவும், அந்த பணிகளை கே.என்.சொக்ஸி போன்ற சட்டத்தரணிகளுடனேயே முன்னெடுத்தாகவும் ஜனாதிபதி சுட்டிக்காட்டினார்.

எவ்வாறாயினும், 2015 ஆம் ஆண்டில் அரசியலமைப்பு மறுசீரமைப்பு செய்யப்பட்ட வேளையில் சொக்‌ஸி இறைபதம் அடைந்திருந்த காரணத்தினால் அந்த பணிகளை சட்டத்தரணி ஜயம்பதி விக்ரமரத்னவிடம் கையளிக்க வேண்டியிருந்தாகவும் ஜனாதிபதி தெரிவித்தார்.

### A Machiavellian exercise?

*2024-07-19 23:25:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-Machiavellian-exercise/4-764497) · `en`

Why is the Government now, nine years later, without any issue having been raised by the Supreme Court or by any other court or tribunal, or in Parliament, or in any other forum, seeking to amend the Constitution for the sole purpose of replacing the words “six years” in Article 83 with the words “five years”?

In the 16th century, the Florentine diplomat Niccolo Machiavelli, in his book “The Prince”, outlined ruthless ways to achieve and retain political power. The events of the past two weeks lead one to wonder whether attempts are now being made to give practical effect to some of those techniques in this country.

### Post-Aragalaya challenge to minorities

That uprising exposed at last the vacuity of SBM as a constructive national ideology and signalled the need for a model of governance that would deliver those ideals

The 2022 Aragalaya was a landmark event in Sri Lankan politics. It was the harbinger for a new era in which the old political culture and governance with all its accoutrement would be thrown out and a new system of governance free of all past evils would be put in place. It was therefore an opportunity for the minorities who had suffered continually and immensely in the previous era to welcome this occasion. Instead, and shockingly, they are caught in a quandary and appear to have become saboteurs of the new and guardians of the old era.

Media, journalists, and other communicators play an important role in shaping the perception and understanding of climate change and enabling effective action

Climate change is one of the key global challenges of the 21st century.

For this reason, effective climate communications are vital not only for creating public awareness and providing relevant information but also for building momentum and facilitating ambitious climate action, green growth, and a just transition.
