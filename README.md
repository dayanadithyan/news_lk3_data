இந்நிலையில் அவர்கள் காங்கேசன் கடல் எல்லைப் பகுதியில் மீன் பிடித்துக் கொண்டிருந்தபோது, அப்பகுதியில் ரோந்து வந்த இலங்கை கடற்படையினர் எல்லை தாண்டி மீன்பிடித்ததாகக் கூறி 23 மீனவர்களை கைது செய்ததோடு, 2 விசைப்படகுகளையும் பறிமுதல் செய்தனர்.

இதைத் தொடர்ந்து இலங்கை சிறையில் அடைக்கப்பட்ட மீனவர்கள், நேற்றைய தினம் இலங்கை நீதிமன்றத்தில் ஆஜர்படுத்தப்பட்டனர். இதில் 20 பேரை விடுதலை செய்த இலங்கை நீதிமன்றம், 2 விசைப்படகுகளின் உரிமையாளர்களுக்கு 6 மாத சிறை தண்டனையும், ஒருவர் 2ஆவது முறையாக எல்லை தாண்டி மீன்பிடித்த குற்றச்சாட்டில் கைது செய்யப்பட்டதால் அவருக்கு 1 வருட சிறை தண்டனையும் வழங்கி தீர்ப்பளித்தது.

### Britain’s oldest warship named HMS Trincomalee

*2024-02-17 16:17:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Britains-oldest-warship-named-HMS-Trincomalee/108-277239) · `en`

The HMS Trincomalee which was constructed in 1817 in Mumbai stands as the Royal Navy's last ship built in India, boasting over two centuries of history.

According to the National Museum of the Royal Navy, prior to its current mooring in Hartlepool, this illustrious ship sailed more than 100,000 miles worldwide. Remarkably, HMS Trincomalee never engaged in battle but holds a rich narrative of service, ranging from patrol and protection to exploration.

Now anchored in Hartlepool, HMS Trincomalee represents one of the two Leda-Class Frigates commissioned by the Royal Navy in 1812. Its name commemorates the 1782 Battle of Trincomalee off the coast of the Indian subcontinent, the historic clash between British and French fleets during the Anglo-French War (1778-1783).

The choice to build in India was influenced by a scarcity of oak in England, exacerbated by the ongoing Napoleonic Wars, and the strategic location of Bombay.

It is extremely distressing to hear news from Gaza and about Palestinians. Within the last four months, over 28, 000 Palestinians have been killed, and over 50,000 people have been terribly injured. Earlier the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, ordered the Palestinians to go South. Now he is asking them to leave the South! To where? There is no answer.

The ceasefire discussions held in Cairo recently failed as the Israeli delegation adamantly left the discussions without listening to the other side or the mediators. ‘War, War and War’ seems to be their slogan.

(New York Times) - A New York judge on Friday handed Donald J. Trump a crushing defeat in his civil fraud case, finding the former president liable for conspiring to manipulate his net worth and ordering him to pay a penalty of nearly $355 million plus interest that could wipe out his entire stockpile of cash.

The decision by Justice Arthur F. Engoron caps a chaotic, yearslong case in which New York’s attorney general put Mr. Trump’s fantastical claims of wealth on trial. With no jury, the power was in Justice Engoron’s hands alone, and he came down hard: The judge delivered a sweeping array of punishments that threatens the former president’s business empire as he simultaneously contends with four criminal prosecutions and seeks to regain the White House.

### Trump ordered to pay $354mn in New York civil fraud case

Former President Donald Trump must pay nearly $355 million (£281 million) to New York state for lying about the values of his properties, a judge has ruled.

Judge Arthur Engoron also banned him from serving as a company director or taking out loans from banks in the state for three years.

The New York real estate mogul escaped having some of his companies dissolved, which could have meant bankruptcy.

Speaking from his Florida estate, Mr Trump said he would appeal the ruling.

“A crooked New York state judge just ruled I have to pay a fine for $350 million for having built a perfect company,” the former president said from Mar-a-Lago on Friday, calling the ruling a political witch hunt.

In the ruling on Friday, Judge Engoron referred to previous allegations of wrongdoing in justifying the large amounts he ordered the defendants to pay, writing that they “are likely to continue their fraudulent ways” unless he imposed a “significant” penalty.
