### Singapore says dredger lost control and hit tanker causing oil spill

*2024-06-17 09:46:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99919/singapore-says-dredger-lost-control-and-hit-tanker-causing-oil-spill) · `en`

Singapore authorities said on Monday a dredger boat reported a sudden loss in engine and steering control that led it to hit a stationary cargo tanker, causing an oil spill that has blackened part of the city-island’s southern shores.

The Netherlands-flagged dredger Vox Maxima struck the Singaporean fuel supply ship Marine Honor on Friday.

It ruptured one of the cargo tanks on the Marine Honor, which leaked low-sulfur oil into the sea.

Although the leak has been contained, tides washed the spilled oil that had been treated with dispersants further along the shoreline, including to the popular resort island of Sentosa.

Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority, in a joint statement with the National Environment Agency, the National Parks Board and Sentosa Development Corp, said the master and crew members of Vox Maxima are assisting in the ongoing investigations.

### இனப்படுகொலையாளிகள் மீது நம்பிக்கை வைக்க தமிழர்கள் தயார் இல்லை - அருட்தந்தை மா.சத்திவேல்

*2024-06-17 09:29:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186236) · `ta`

இனப்படுகொலையாளிகள் மீது நம்பிக்கை வைக்க தமிழர்கள் தயார் இல்லை என சமூக நீதிக்கான செயற்பாட்டாளரும், அரசியல் கைதிகளை விடுதலை  செய்வதற்கான தேசிய அமைப்பின் இணைப்பாளருமான அருட்தந்தை மா.சத்திவேல் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

நாடு ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலை எதிர்நோக்கி கொண்டிருக்கையில் தெற்கின் வேட்பாளர்களாக அடையாளப்படுத்திக் கொண்டுள்ளோரில் பிரதானமானவர்களாக கருதப்படுவோர் தமது தேர்தல் களச் சந்தையை வடக்கிலும் விரித்து தமது முகவர்களோடு இரகசிய பேச்சு வார்த்தை நடத்துவதோடு திறந்த வெளியில் ஊடக சந்திப்புகள் நடாத்தி வடக்கு கிழக்கு தமிழ் மக்களை மதி மயங்கச் செய்யவும் வாக்கு சாவடிக்குள் அனுப்பவும் முயலுவதாக தோன்றுகிறது. இவர்களின் சதி வலைக்குள் சிக்க வேண்டாம் என தமிழ் தேச உணர்வாளர்களை கேட்டுக் கொள்கின்றோம்.

வடகிழக்கில் தமிழர்கள் மத்தியில் பேரினவாத கட்சிகளின் நேரடி முகவர்களாக செயற்படுவோரை மக்கள் அறிவர். தமிழர் தேசத்தில் தேசியத்தின் ஊற்று என்றும் தாமே சுயநிர்ணயத்தின் தோற்றுவாய் எனவும் பகிரங்கமாக மேடையமைத்து கொக்கரிக்கும் கூட்டம் தற்போது இனப்படுகொலையாளர்களுக்கு துணை முகவர்களாக பொதுவெளியில் செயற்பட தொடங்கி விட்டனர்.

### හජ් උත්සවය අදයි

*2024-06-17 08:20:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/197835) · `si`

ඉස්ලාම් ජනතාව මහත් හරසරින් සමරන හජ් උත්සවය අදට (17) යෙදී තිබේ.

පසුගිය සතියේ නව සද බැලීමෙන් පසු කොළඹ මහ පල්ලිය නිවේදනය කළේ අද දිනයේ එම උත්සවය සැමරීමට කටයුතු කරන බවය.

ඉස්ලාමීය මාස ක්‍රමය අනුව දුල් හජ් මස දස වැනි දිනයේ දී පවත්වන උත්සවය මෙම නමින් හැදින්වේ.

ඉස්ලාමීය බැතිමතුන් අනිවාර්යයෙන්ම ඉටුකළ යුතු ප්‍රධාන වගකීම් පහ අතරින් අවසන් වගකීම හජ් වන්දනාව වේ.

ඇති නැති පරතරය සහ විවිධ භේද දුරලා සමානාත්මතාව, සහෝදරත්වය ඇති කිරීම හජ් උත්සවයේ ප්‍රධාන අරමුණය.

### Road To Bankruptcy: The Role Of Foreign Currency Flows & Economic Vulnerabilities In Sri Lanka

Until 1978, Sri Lanka’s economy was mainly agriculture-based. In the 1970s, industrialization began to grow due to government and bilateral investments. However, the economy faced high inflation and product shortages due to supply-side shocks from the OPEC oil embargo. Despite these challenges, Sri Lanka remained free of foreign debt in the early 1970s due to strict trade and capital controls and policies focused on production.

### Adani wind farms in Mannar and procedural challenges in Swiss auction

*2024-06-17 04:01:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/adani-wind-farms-in-mannar-and-procedural-challenges-in-swiss-auction/) · `en`

India’s Adani Group, which has committed SL’s single largest FDI in the power sector by committing to invest over a billion dollars in setting up ~500MW wind projects in Mannar and Pooneryn region, is facing resistance from a lobby group. The reason is unclear, says Vinayak Maheswaran – an equity and economic analyst at an equity markets platform who was also a former analyst at Wells Fargo Advisors.

“Initially they said the project harms the environment. This when the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) was done by a renowned professor and the government promised to implement the suggestions made in it and by public to minimize environmental impact. Several other Renewable Energy Organizations, Climate Organizations, environment organisations like the National Environment Caucus, Youth for Renewable Energy Organization, Sri Lanka Blue Green Alliance too conducted their own studies and have decided to back the project.”

### ஹஜ்ஜுப் பெருநாள்; ஜனாதிபதி வாழ்த்து

*2024-06-17 02:47:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186225) · `ta`

ஆன்மிக மற்றும் உலக வெற்றியை அடைய, மனிதன் சுயநலத்தை விட்டொழித்து, தியாகம் மற்றும் நல்லிணக்கத்துடன் வாழப் பழகிக் கொள்ள வேண்டும் என ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்க விடுத்துள்ள ஹஜ் பெருநாள் வாழ்த்துச் செய்தியில் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

ஒவ்வொரு ஆண்டும் முஸ்லிம்கள் அந்த உன்னத நோக்கத்தின் அடிப்படையில் ஹஜ் பெருநாளைக் கொண்டாடுகிறார்கள்.

உலகம் முழுவதிலுமிருந்து முஸ்லிங்கள் அனைவரும் ஒரே நோக்கத்துடன் ஒரே புனிதத் தலத்தில் கூடி, மனிதகுலத்தின் எதிர்பார்ப்பான சமூகத்தின் ஒருமைப்பாட்டிற்காக இத்தினத்தில் பிரார்த்தனை செய்கிறார்கள்.

உலக மக்கள் அனைவருக்கும் சமத்துவம் மற்றும் சகோதரத்துவ உணர்வுகளை விதைக்கும் ஹஜ்  கொண்டாட்டம், உலக அமைதிக்கான சிறந்த செய்தியையும் தரும் என்பது எனது  எதிர்பார்ப்பாகும்.

மனித குலத்தின் அபிலாஷைகளை வென்றெடுப்பதற்காக அனைவரும் ஒரே இலக்கில் ஒன்றுபடும் ஹஜ்ஜுப் பெருநாளை மகிழ்ச்சியுடன் கொண்டாடுவதற்கு இலங்கை மற்றும் உலக முஸ்லிம்கள் அனைவருக்கும் நல்வாழ்த்துக்களை தெரிவித்துக் கொள்கிறேன் என்றார்.

உலகெங்கிலும் உள்ள முஸ்லிம்களின் மிக முக்கியமான கலாச்சார மற்றும் மதப் பண்டிகையாகக் கருதப்படும் ஈதுல் அல்ஹா பெருநாளை முன்னிட்டு தனது வாழ்த்துக்களை எதிர்க்கட்சித் தலைவர் சஜீத் பிரேமதாச தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

இத் தருணத்தில் அதன் முக்கிய விழுமியங்களைப் பற்றி நினைவில் கொள்வது சாலச்சிறந்தது என உணர்கின்றேன்.

வரலாற்றின் தொடக்கத்திலிருந்தே, மக்கள் பல்வேறு மத தியாகங்களுக்காக கூட்டாக கூடினர், அதில் தங்கள் சொந்த மதத்துடன் தொடர்புடைய மரபுகள் பாதுகாக்கப்பட்டு அவற்றுக்கிடையே தொடர்புகளை ஏற்படுத்திக் கொண்டனர்.  இஸ்லாத்தில் புனிய ஹஜ் யாத்திரையும் அவ்வாறானதொன்றாகும்.

இஸ்லாத்தின் ஐந்து பெரும் கடமைகளில் ஐந்தாவது கடமையாகக் கருதப்படும் ஹஜ் யாத்திரை இறைவன் மீதான பக்தி மற்றும் நம்பிக்கையை மீண்டும் மீண்டும் உறுதிப்படுத்துவதாகும். அந்த நம்பிக்கையின் காரணமாக, உலகெங்கிலும் உள்ள மில்லியன் கணக்கான இஸ்லாமியர்கள் ஒரே நோக்கத்துடன் ஒரே நேரத்தில் புனித மக்காவில் ஒன்று கூடி, மனிதகுலத்தின் எதிர்பார்ப்பான  சகோதரத்துவ கூட்டு மதிப்பைப் போற்றுகிறார்கள்.

### It is difficult to reduce the model

*2024-06-17 01:33:03* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/குறைப்பது-கடினம்/175-338997) · `ta`

Despite global lubricant price drops, immediate fuel price reductions in Sri Lanka are challenging due to the country's reliance on imported and refined fuel, influenced by international market prices, particularly from Singapore. About 35% of Sri Lanka's fuel demand is met through imports. While the cost of lubricant oil has decreased significantly since last September, affecting overall fuel prices, the situation remains complex.

🟩

The Ministry of Power and Energy has said that despite the decline in lubricant prices in the world market, it is difficult to reduce the prices of fuels in the country immediately.

According to the government -approved purchases, fuel prices should be carried out in Sri Lanka.

The refined fuel is imported according to the Singapore Business Index. Accordingly, the secretary also stated that fuel supply should be supplied in Sri Lanka in accordance with the prices that are determined there.

Sulakshana Jayawardena also said that about 35 per cent of the country's total demand is imported and refined, and that the prices of refined fuel in accordance with world market prices cannot be corrected.

However, Professor Vasantha Attukorala of the Economics University of Peradeniya University said that the price of lubricant oil fell by 27 per cent compared to last September.

He said this during a media briefing held at his party headquarters in Jaffna on Sunday (16).. In this regard, he said ..

In fact, I see this as an attempt to keep the problems of the Tamil people as long -standing problems.

Although they are all tied together in a potato bundle, they are scattered like a rolling in every direction, as Prabhakaran is not in the absence of today.

In this case, where is unity among them. What did you get for many years. Is it possible to control the destruction?Is there any improvement?In the absence of the election, they are talking about that again.

### Why Sri Lanka needs new leadership

Wickremesinghe’s track record suggests a pattern of governance that prioritises personal and political survival over genuine public service

In the complex and turbulent political landscape of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe has emerged as a figure of significant controversy. Despite holding the office of Prime Minister six times and now serving as President, his tenure has been marked by a series of strategic manoeuvres that have often sidelined democratic principles and prioritised political expediency over national interest.

Wickremesinghe’s political career is a study in resilience and opportunism, akin to a chameleon that changes its colours to blend with its surroundings. The leader of the United National Party (UNP), the oldest political party in Sri Lanka, he has managed to stay relevant through numerous political storms. However, his methods and motivations raise serious concerns.

The IMF second review has not properly guided the Government to execute its first responsibility of ensuring macroeconomic stability and its continuing efficacy

The IMF issued a Press Release No. 24/214 on 12 June completing the second review under the Extended Fund Facility for Sri Lanka.

The economy is a system. The way we understand any system might be different. We understand the economy as a system having a cause-and-effect relationship. In such a system, as Buddhism preaches, nothing will happen without necessary conditions. When we look at the IMF second review, economic vulnerabilities just arise not knowing proper causes.

Sri Lankans are finally ready to bid farewell to the three major parties. They are fed up with the old guard who have been cris crossing parties like leaches to remain in power, and eventually led our beloved homeland to financial ruin. It is widely believed and hoped that AKD will be elected to be our next President. I personally hope he will. Not so much know their agenda and policies but there is no other option.

But like thousands more, I am confused why Anura Kumara Dissanayake has not revealed his platform. Sri Lankans are screaming for a wholesale system change. They expect AKD and his team to deliver.

People are not expecting a change of face, but a change of the political structure that will create proper checks and balances, ensure independence of our criminal justice system, restore the rule of law and more.  With this in mind, here are my questions for AKD and his team

### Israel pauses military activity along southern Gaza road to facilitate aid

The Israeli military said on Sunday it would hold daily tactical pauses in military activity along a main road in southern Gaza to allow more aid to flow into the enclave, where international aid organisations have warned of a growing humanitarian crisis.

Fighting in the city of Rafah, where Israel is targeting the remaining brigades of the militant Islamist Hamas movement, would continue, the military said.

It said military activity would be paused from 0500 GMT until 1600 GMT daily until further notice along the road that leads from the Kerem Shalom Crossing to the Salah al-Din Road and then northwards.

Despite growing international pressure for a ceasefire, an agreement to halt the fighting still appears distant, more than eight months since the start of the war in the Palestinian enclave.

Rising US dollar rates and lower VND rates were also adding to the pressure he said.

Vietnam recorded a balance of payments surplus in the December 2023 quarter. If the liquidity is not mopped up the money eventually turn into imports through the credit system.

Meanwhile Qang said, from the beginning of the year to mid-May, the import sector has recovered strongly, estimated at 132.23 billion dollars, an increase of 19.7 billion over the same period in 2023.

### Rare twin elephants born in Thailand ‘miracle’

*2024-06-16 14:48:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/rare-twin-elephants-born-in-thailand-miracle/) · `en`

An Asian elephant in central Thailand has given birth to a rare set of twins, in what caretakers have described as a miracle.

The mother, 36-year-old Chamchuri, was not expected to deliver twins and when she gave birth to a male calf last Friday, staff at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal, had thought the delivery was done.
