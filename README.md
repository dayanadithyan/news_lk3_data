In countries with Chinese-funded development projects, like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, internal conflicts and riots have arisen. The National Freedom Front leader highlighted that understanding these issues is crucial for aspiring presidents. In Bangladesh, student protests against a quota system escalated into violence, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Similar tensions are observed in Sri Lanka due to China's investment in the Colombo Port. These examples illustrate how Chinese development zones can fuel internal disputes.

International contradictions are created in countries where a Zone of China is implemented by a Path Development Project. Such conflicts and riots were created in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.The National Freedom Front leader and Independent Opposition MP Wimal Weerasanshans said that all those who dreamed of being president needed to understand this fact.

Speaking at the debate on the Law Law Law Regulations on Wednesday (21) in Parliament, he said.

China has fully invested to the Colombo Port Development City. Therefore, Sri Lanka has not been affected by the port Urban Development Program.

🟩

Independent presidential candidate Roshan Ranasinghe said that black money, money, drug money and gambling money are heavily used in the presidential election.

He said this while addressing a special statement in Parliament on Wednesday (21).

Is the presidential election independent but is justice?Questions arising. Elections Commission first implement injustice. A separate place has been allocated to bring their assistants for some candidates.

When 39 candidates file nominations, only 4 candidates are encouraged.

Can this be done?Meanwhile, it has been announced that a voter can spend 20 rupees in the local government election. But the presidential election has announced that a candidate can spend 109 rupees. That is, 18,500 lakhs of rupees.

This is not a small amount. Similarly, some media also acts for each candidate. 39 people should be given equal rights. But not that happens like that. Meanwhile, February is also being treated unjustly. The company calls only 6 people for debate.

Subsequently, Kusal Mendis (24), Dinesh Chandimal (17), Kamindu Mendis (12) and Prabhat Jayasuriya (10) lost the game in a steady interval.

### Anura, Ranil, Sajith: Classism versus elitism

The much anticipated Presidential election next month has created seismic activity in and out of the political arena. While the candidates are focused on winning, those in the periphery, the cohorts and the plutocrats are in a dilemma. The biggest joke is that for most of the sitting Members of Parliament and other politicians it does not matter whether Ranil wins or Sajith wins. Among their selfish and opportunistic agendas, the formidable challenge is to make sure that Anura does not come to power.

### Political remnants and success for NPP

Under the NPP government after 21 September 2024, law and order will undoubtedly be relevant and applicable to all, from the president of Sri Lanka to the ordinary people or grassroots. In other words, if the law is violated, due punishment by the law will be ruled. The above will be a massive change in the right direction so people can sense and feel it is becoming part and parcel of life

The country’s people are currently grappling with severe economic problems or challenges, including the escalating cost of living and the repercussions of IMF programs aimed at economic recovery. However, the NPP is committed to addressing these issues, offering hope and optimism for a better future. Indeed, the escalating cost of living is the foremost burning issue for all low- and middle-income households. Given the above, the country witnessed an array of strikes by trade unions, and the Government addressed and resolved the workers’ concerns using tear gas and water cannons

### Election outcomes, best teams: Strategic advantages of political alliances

There were three surprises in Sri Lankan politics in the last week.

The unprecedentedly massive turnout for Sajith Premadasa in Kurunegala, August 16th which was evidence of a quantum leap after his formation of a broad Alliance on August 8th.

The entry into the Alliance campaigning for a Sajith presidency, of Champika Ranawaka, foremost ideologue and figure of the BJP-type Right, together with his compact but proficient group of followers (Karunatne Paranavithana being especially noteworthy).

The rock-star emergence of Namal Rajapaksa, starting outside the Election Commission on August 15th. The SLPP-SLFP ‘barons’ who defected en masse to Ranil, re-formed the UPFA, and entering through a virtual doorway paraded as on a catwalk at a ‘Sri Lanka Can’ signing on August 16th, should be afraid, very afraid. The renegades have no one who generates that type of enthusiasm among their voters. Namal’s vote fractures Ranil’s SLPP-SLFP political prop.
