National People's Power promises to prioritize Buddhism in Sri Lanka's constitution. They vow to maintain Article 9 giving Buddhism top status. The 13th Amendment will remain unchanged, with no police or land powers granted to provincial councils. This stance aims to preserve national unity, sovereignty, and security.

üü©

The National People's Power has promised that the government of the future national power will not change the 9th article of the Constitution that the Republic of Sri Lanka will give Buddhism a first place for Buddhism.

NPP MP Vijitha Herath made this promise during a meeting organized by the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress (ACBC) to discuss the pledge of Buddhism, Buddhism, Sinhala culture and the sovereignty of the country.

He said that a NPP government would maintain and uphold the 9th article of the Constitution while a NPP government would maintain the country's unity, sovereignty and national security, and promised that the JVP had played a major role for it.

He said that the 13th Amendment will be implemented only in the current form and the NPP will not grant police and land powers to the provincial councils.

"We have the idea that the 13th Amendment is not a national issue or a solution to provincial development," he added.

### Sri Lanka food prices sharply down after multiple VAT hikes: Analysis

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lankas basic food prices are sharply down after multiple value added tax hikes over the past two years, but politicians, who stay mum on import duties, continue to claim that they will reduce VAT to bring down food prices.

After years of pushing the ideology that direct taxes are the best system tax, and indirect taxes were ‚Äòregressive‚Äô both politicians and ‚Äòprofessionals‚Äô received shock when income tax rates were raised to pay state worker salaries in 2022.

Politicians are usually against tax in a knee-jerk reaction from Western ideology

Now they want to reduce personal income tax. Personal income taxes have a major disadvantage because they undermine individual choice and take taxes away before an economic decision and transaction is made.

Value added tax is collected after an individual makes a choice, guiding the economy towards their needs and then the government collects a tax, analysts say.

Here's a 200-character summary:



Hope vs Faith: "Hope Against Hope" concept in politics. Voters' expectations often unmet. Sri Lankan presidential elections highlight cycle of disappointment. Candidates promise change but fail to deliver. Public seeks real transformation beyond economic issues. Political system needs overhaul for lasting reform.

üü©

There is a traditional series called Hope Against Hope in English. It can be translated directly into Tamil as a confidence against trust. But, it does not give the object of the source. Although it knows that a thing is not a chance to happen, it will indicate that it will happen. This can be a mood for belief in one of the most confident environments. Hope Against Hope is the name of his wife Natasha Mandalstam, who wrote the tragic biography of Soviet poet Osip Mandalstam, which was the most vulnerable in Stalin's time.

This is how Sri Lankan politics believes that something good will happen and it does not happen. My own experience is like that. The experience of many of your. Who should vote in the presidential election in a few days?When I read many people in the face and WhatsApp, I appeared to be writing to my role.
