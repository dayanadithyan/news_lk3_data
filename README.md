*2024-05-26 14:21:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184514) ¬∑ `ta`

A Sri Lankan Tamil refugee living in London, known for running a chicken shop, has been arrested and faces deportation to France due to involvement in abductions. He was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by a French court for his role in abductions. Despite claiming his wife suffers from mental illness, his appeal for stay was denied, leading to his imminent deportation.

üü©

Sun has reported that Britain will be deported to France, who has planned to smuggle illegal immigrants into the UK.

The French court last year ruled that he was involved in the abduction and sentenced him to five years in prison.

The refugee who fled to Britain in 2003 from Sri Lanka gave him all the permission to live there.

He lived in a southwestern part of London and worked in a shop selling poultry meat in Brickton.

At the same time, he has also acted as the head of the gang who abducted Sri Lankan people in the last two years.

British officials first arrested him in 2022 on behalf of French officials. On November 2022, a judge ordered him to be deported based on the grip of France.

However, Sivagangan had filed a petition in court, saying that his wife was physically mentally ill.¬†However, the judge rejected his petition on Friday.

He was the main person of the European widespread gang operating in many countries of the world, the court document said.

Presidential candidate Donald Trump was booed and heckled by many in a raucous audience at the Libertarian National Convention on Saturday night, a marked change from the adulation he receives at rallies from his fervently loyal supporters.

Libertarians, who believe in limited government and individual freedom, blame Trump, a Republican, for rushing through the creation of a COVID-19 vaccine when he was president and for not doing more to stop public health restrictions on the unvaccinated during the pandemic.

When Trump took to the stage in Washington, there were loud boos and jeers. A smaller section of the crowd, Trump supporters, cheered him.

Shortly before he appeared, one Libertarian Party member shouted: ‚ÄúDonald Trump should have taken a bullet!‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the hostile reception.

### Beware of the Weather Gods

*2024-05-26 05:47:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/beware-of-the-weather-gods/) ¬∑ `en`

The one thing a pilot wishes for, when he lines up for take-off is a blue sky. He rolls his aeroplane down the runway with engines screaming at take-off power, and at rotational speed, he eases the aeroplane into the sky. Then he retracts the gear and the flaps, which is commonly called cleaning the aircraft and then sets the course in the direction of his destination. Whether it is an intercontinental 15-hour flight or a local one hour‚Äôs run from Ratmalana to Jaffna, the pilot has one ultra-important wish. That is to have a domed blue sky throughout his journey.

Aachchi (my paternal grandmother)‚Äôs claim to fame was a story about her mother‚Äôs bravery. My great-grandmother was 160-years old when the Krakatoa Volcano in the Javanese Sea erupted in 1883. She ran with her brother to the seabed to catch gasping fish left behind by the receding waves. When the sea swelled and exploded, it took her about a hundred metres before dashing her onto a building. If we pressed for more drama, Aachchi would say that her mother rode high waves and swam home over the railway track and coconut trees.

At the time of his death on May 19, in a helicopter crash that has yet to be fully investigated, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi had risen through the ranks. Sanctioned by the West and nicknamed the ‚ÄúButcher of Tehran‚Äù for his uncompromising attitude to protesters, he was seen as the successor to Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Under his watch Iran went through some pretty turbulent times, including a spate of protests in 2021 following the death in custody of a 22-year-old woman. But it also saw through a transformation in its foreign relations, signalling an outreach to Asia and the Global South.

He emphasized the importance of learning from the tragedy to prevent future injustices, promising continued efforts towards peace and a political solution for the Tamils.

British Labor Leader Gear Stramer has urged the recall of the victims of Mullivaikkal and the war and that it should be seen as a sign that the criminals involved in the past violations should be seen.

Labor leader Gear Stramer said this while addressing the Mullivaikkal Memorial event organized by the British Tamil Congress in London's Rabalkar Square. There he added:

On the day of Mullivaikkal, we remember the thousands of people killed in the final war in Sri Lanka and the victims of the worst human rights violations.. At this point, I recall the victims who are still living with the pain of the injustice they have been inflicted, and those who survived the violations and their loved ones.

At the same time, Mullivaikkal and the war should be viewed as symbolism that should be remembered that the victims of the past violations should be stopped before justice.

### Eighty years in Sri Lanka:The Life and Times of Fr. Vito Perniola SJ

I always wonder how he did it? A simple, slender Italian priest who used the bus to get about. He was one who never compromised on discipline. A stickler for proper diction who spoke a manifold of Western and Oriental languages. A first-rate scholar who realized there was a single door one could walk in and outof between history and social linguistics. He embraced the Lankan heritage by becoming a distinguished citizen of the country just after independence.

Generations not born here will laud and praise the memory of Father Vito Perniola of the Society of Jesus for his exemplary efforts in publishing 19 definitive volumes on the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka. Abstemious by nature, and frugal in food, drink, clothes, and lifestyle, Fr. Vito Perniola was a shining example of plain living and high thinking.

The workshop officials canceled the meeting and promised bilingual announcements, but the damage was done, highlighting communication issues within the education system.

The principals have accused the directors of the Zonal Education Workshop in the past that the directors of the Zonal Education Workshop have informed them of all the issues, including letters, and that the newly visited Zonal Education Director is continuing to engage in such activities.

It is also revealed that the letter has been sent on the date of the meeting.. Therefore, the educators have expressed their displeasure over the letters sent through the Education Workshop without any responsibility and have signed the letter without reading the letter of the Zonal Education Director of the Education Workshop.
