### Israel and Hezbollah trade heavy fire before pulling back, jolting a region braced for war

Israel launched a wave of airstrikes across southern Lebanon early Sunday in what it said was a preemptive strike on Hezbollah. The militant group responded that it had launched hundreds of rockets and drones to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders last month.

The heavy exchange of fire does not appear to have ignited a long-feared war, but the situation remains tense. Meanwhile, Egypt on Sunday is hosting high-level talks aimed at brokering a cease-fire in the 10-month-old Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, which diplomats hope will tamp down regional tensions.

The Israeli military said it struck because Hezbollah was planning to launch a heavy barrage of rockets and missiles toward Israel. Soon after, Hezbollah announced it had launched an attack on Israeli military positions as an initial response to the killing of Fouad Shukur, one of its founding members, in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last month.

During the ongoing debates, conversations and media shows, there is a strong focus on the IMF assistance we have obtained in the recent past. Some Political leaders and their spokesmen canvassing support for their candidacies, are repeatedly stating that the IMF agreements we have already concluded will be revisited by them if they come to power and revised according to their wishes.

In such a context it has become necessary for an independent review of these aspirations which unfortunately appear to gain ground and causing mind boggling confusions among the gullible public.

This is not the first occasion of our country getting IMF assistance. According to the known history last IMF assistance was the 17th in line with several other facilities granted before between 1966 and 2016  extending as follows. Four arrangements from 1965-70;  Four arrangements between 1970-80 ; 2 from 1980 to 1990; and –  In six occasions between 1990- to 2016.
