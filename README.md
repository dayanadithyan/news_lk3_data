ECONONYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs balance of payments is still strongly in surplus in 2024 under the current interest rate structure, but is running slightly behind 2023, official data show.

Sri Lanka had recorded a BOP surplus (as defined) of 1,761 million US dollars by June 2024, down from 1,957.6 million dollars a year earlier.

Broadly, the BOP surplus is an improvement in net international reserves, and is a reliable figure unlike numbers like тАШcurrent accountтАЩ balances which can be subject to large errors.

Sri LankaтАЩs central bank has run deflationary policy to collect reserves.

Under IMF programs, a central bank is able to collect reserves soon after hiking rates and contracting domestic credit, but misses reserve targets as the economy recovers and a narrow call money rate is targeted with excess liquidity on mathematical formulae (real interest rates or growth), critics have said.

The state of bankruptcy Sri Lanka experienced can happen again if there is no change in the way the country is governed contrary to the thinking history never repeats itself

The IMF may have their own agendas. But they are in the country because our politicians and officials failed to manage the economy leading it to bankruptcy. Some degree of economic and financial discipline is evident today, thanks to the presence of the IMF. Any proposed renegotiations should be on the basis of even greater discipline, and sustainable discipline, and not pandering to populism.

### Adapting concepts of Islamic Finance to an effective debt restructuring mechanism

Islamic Finance (IF) is based on the Shariah principles which are interpreted via Quran and Sunnah. It is operated currently globally not only in Muslim countries, in other Western and Eastern countries which are based on conventional banking principles. Hence, it is imperative to analyse how the IF can be adopted as a global financial system in order to address most of the current economic hazards in the world.

In Islam, it highly considers that the resources are needed to fulfil the material requirements of both individual and society. The high concern and knowledge on these ethical principles are directed to the personal and societal justice and tranquillity which is the way to the fair financial system. Especially, in the event of handling the distressed customers in the financial institutions, the principles of IF can be successfully adapted.

This growing faction of MPs, including Pavithra Wanniarachchi, signals a significant split within the party, as many choose to back WickremesingheтАЩs independent candidacy over the SLPPтАЩs official nominee.

*2024-08-09 01:36:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190617) ┬╖ `ta`

It seems like you've shared a comprehensive overview of the evolution of warfare, focusing on armored vehicles, drones, and the strategic shifts that have occurred over time. This narrative spans several decades, highlighting key moments such as the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, the US military's concept of "air war," the role of drones in modern conflicts, and the recent developments in Ukraine.



Your account underscores the significant technological advancements and strategic adaptations that have shaped contemporary warfare. It also touches upon the geopolitical implications of these changes, such as the reliance on industrial strength and the role of alliances like NATO in supporting military efforts.



Given the complexity and breadth of the topics covered, do you have any specific questions or aspects you'd like to delve deeper into? Whether it's the impact of drone technology, the evolution of armored vehicle tactics, or the influence of industrial capacity on military strategy, I'm here to assist further.

On February 24, 2022, Russia aims Russia's "Special Military Action" (Spetsialnaya Voennaya Operatsiya - SVO) aimed at the removal of Ukraine's "militarization". Russian forces launched their campaign as in 2014 in Crimea. Ukrainian forces do not oppose. There is evidence that the Russians did not expect the extent of the opposition they faced.

In the north, the Russians made good progress until they reached the Ukrainian capital, Kiiv, where the air force tried to capture the Antonov Airport. Here, the strong Ukrainian resistance stopped them in their ways and eventually pushed them backwards.
