### Sri Lanka to wrap up bond talks soon, seek to balance India and China ties

Sri Lanka will wrap up talks with international bondholders on its restructuring process in a few weeks, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said on Tuesday, a major step for the island nation to emerge from its worst financial crisis in decades.

“Hopefully within a couple of weeks,” Sabry said in an interview at the Reuters NEXT conference in Singapore, when asked when the nation’s bond restructuring efforts with creditors will be finished.

“Towards the end of this month, officially, we are done and dusted with the restructuring process, then of course, in line with that, we need to start payment,” he said.

### Sri Lanka will need Rs275bn to give Rs20,000 pay hike to state workers, hike VAT 4-pct: Minister

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will need an extra 275 billion rupees to give 20,000 rupee salary hike to state workers, requiring value added tax to be raised by 4 percent, State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe said.

To generate money for a 20,000 rupee salary hike, value added tax on the people will have to be raised from the current 18 percent to 20 percent, he said.

Meanwhile import duties will also have to be raised by around 42 percent.

Sri Lanka has already given a 10,000 rupee salary hike to state workers from taxes collected from the people.

Sri Lanka’s debt sustainability path set in an International Monetary Fund program will also be undermined, he said.

Sri Lanka’s current default was also linked to forex shortages that emerged when rates were cut with printed money claiming inflation was low (flexible inflation targeting), as deficits expanded in part due to 20,000 rupee salary hike in 2015, analysts have said.

### Politics of bankruptcy and solvency

President Ranil Wickremesinghe in conversation with his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa in the presence of former President and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa at the ceremony to mark 27 years in politics by SLPP MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena at the Kalutara Public Ground on Saturday – Pic by Pradeep Pathirana

The reason for RW’s premature declaration is simple. Just as it was politically advantageous for him to describe the 2022 economy bankrupt in order to create an impression that he was undertaking a Herculean challenge, so also his premature claim for solvency after two years of his reign to prove his financial wizardry. In short, RW is advertising his management credentials to strengthen his claim to continue as President with or without an election. All the plaudits that he is receiving from his parliamentary cabal and outside convey that strategy

“Anybody who knows about capitalism knows that bankruptcy is an essential part of capitalism” (Joseph Stiglitz)

### Social entrepreneurship: Beacon of hope for Sri Lanka’s recovery

Social entrepreneurial approaches often engage with local communities at the grassroots level in their development initiatives

Every form of entrepreneurship serves a social purpose. However, the hallmark of social entrepreneurship lies in its ability to combine social purpose with business practice to effect social change. The process of social entrepreneurship embedded the creative use of resources to generate both economic and social values

Sri Lanka stands at a critical crossroads in the wake of different reasons such as severe economic instability, social inequality and environmental crises. While many traditional approaches are falling short in this situation, it is time for Sri Lanka to gain traction for a new paradigm of ‘social entrepreneurship’ to come out of this crisis.

As Sri Lanka navigates a crucial period, it is essential to absorb all subgroups into the mainstream rather than isolating them as separate communities
