Lawmakers ratified Sweden’s accession protocol 287 to 55, with ruling party members saying the Nordic country’s tougher stance on Kurdish militants was key to winning approval. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also previously has linked the ratification to Turkey’s desire to buy fighter jets from the U.S.

The ratification comes into effect after its publication in the Official Gazette, which was expected to be swift.

Hungary then becomes the only NATO ally not to have ratified Sweden’s accession.

“Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO,” Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. In Washington, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan welcomed the news, saying having Sweden in the alliance will make it “safer and stronger.”

*2024-01-24 14:20:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-micro-finance-bill-challenged-by-community-organizations-148535/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – A planned bill to regulate micro-finance organizations has been challenged in the Supreme Court by traditional community organizations which provide savings and credit, according to a statement.

The proposed bill  is “intrusive and violate the autonomy of community organisations such as Death Donations and Welfare Societies, Sarvodaya Shramadana Societies and Women’s Organisations engaged in community savings and credit providing activities for generations before modern micro-finance began,” they say.

The community based organizations have also complained that larger finance companies which also provide micro-finance and where concerns have been raised about “predatory lending”, appear to be excluded.

Regulating for the sake of regulating will harm these community-based initiatives and trample on low-income people’s autonomy and traditional rights to organise their credit services, petitioners have said.

He was speaking to the Defense Minister during the hearing of today's parliamentary session.

The war in the North and East is now over 15 years after the end of the war. We cannot accept the claim that we have only protected military camps, especially in these North and East districts after 15 years.

Although the priests claim that the ground floor of the Math Math School is not under military control, the ground land is under military control.

You have said that you have set up another school instead of a school where a military camp has been set up in the Morakottan army.

The newly built school is found in a river area. This is not what village parents or children do not want.

Even if the school is used through a temporary alternative, it is unable to continue to be used.
