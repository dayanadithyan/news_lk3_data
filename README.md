### Reduced diesel price not sufficient for bus fare revision: Gemunu

*2024-05-01 12:49:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Reduced-diesel-price-not-sufficient-for-bus-fare-revision-Gemunu/108-281716) ┬╖ `en`

Colombo, May 1 (Daily Mirror) - Following the price reduction of Lanka auto diesel from last night, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijerathne said today that this fuel price revision is insufficient for a bus fare revision at this time.

Addressing the media he said that according to the National Bus Fare Policy, the recent amount of the fuel price revision cannot be calculated.

Accordingly, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) reduced the retail price of a litre of Lanka auto diesel by Rs. 30 with effect from last night.

"During the past months, we provided the service while incurring a loss of Rs. 27 per litre of diesel. Even after the previous fuel price revision the association had taken a decision not to go for a fuel price revision as it was not even 4% of the minimum fare hike needed for a fare revision.

"According to the policy calculation, only Rs. 3 will be reduced from the bus fare, but it is not more than the minimum calculation of 4%.

President of the association Indika Sampath Merinchige emphasized the need for the government to establish a committee inclusive of their associationтАЩs representatives to make decisions on this matter.

тАЬWhen importing vehicles to Sri Lanka in the past few years, specifically in 2017, 2018, and 2019, 85% of the vehicles imported were used vehicles with only 15% new vehicles were imported. Out of that, 95% of the vehicles were sourced from JapanтАЭ, he added.

тАЬIn the future, it is imperative to prioritize the preferences of the people when importing vehicles. If the agents prioritize matters that are not aligned with the requirements of the people, there will likely be a decline in demandтАЭ, Merinchige said.

### May Day rallies across Sri Lanka: Special security measures underway

*2024-05-01 12:05:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98951/may-day-rallies-across-sri-lanka-special-security-measures-underway) ┬╖ `en`

Today is International WorkersтАЩ Day, also known as Labour Day, which is observed annually on May 1 in Sri Lanka and the world at large.

The day, which has its origins in the labour union movement, specifically the eight-hour day movement, is a celebration of labourers and the working classes that is promoted by the international labour movement.

May 1 is observed as an ancient northern hemisphere spring festival, however, it became associated with the labour movement in the late 19th century after trade unions and socialist groups designated it as a day in support of workers.

The date was chosen to be International WorkersтАЩ Day to commemorate the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago in the US, in which a peaceful rally in support of workers led to a violent clash with the police, leading to the deaths of at least 38 civilians and 7 police officers.

While 60 police officers and 115 civilians were injured. Those who died due to the clash were hailed as тАЬHaymarket MartyrsтАЭ.

### Implement PremadasaтАЩs policies to overcome current economic crisis

The dynamic policies of President Premadasa came to an abrupt halt 31 years ago

As one who had the opportunity to serve as the Chairman and Director General of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission and later converted to the Board of Investment from 1991 to 1993 and prior to that as the Chairman of the PeopleтАЩs Bank during the period of President Premadasa, it will be appropriate for me to write about the importance to implement the economic policies of the Premadasa period to overcome the current economic crisis and achieve sustainable economic recovery on the 31st Death Anniversary of late President Premadasa. Although giving free handouts was the order of the day, Premadasa policies were able to change this concept by pushing economic development to the provinces. He did this by inviting the private sector businessmen to set up garment factories in the rural areas which provided employment and brought in the much needed foreign exchange.

A source familiar with the meeting told Daily Mirror that Premadasa made such an offer during the discussion between his party and the CPC delegation that visited Sri Lanka recently.

As Sri Lanka gets closer to the elections that are supposed to be held at the end of this year, a fierce contest seems to have occurred between the two main opposition parties, the Samaji Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Jathika Jana Balawegaya (NPP). Representatives of the SJB Economic Policy Committee, such as Eran Wickramaratne and Harsha de Silva, seem to have launched a strong attack on the NPP questioning the latter on economic policy matters.

One of the significant themes recurring in this attack is frequent references made to terms such as Socialism and Marxism. Addressing a press conference last week, MP Harsha de Silva stated that if the NPP Economic Council is not willing to come for a debate, the SJB economic committee trio would like to have the debate at the Galle Face Green, with cutouts of Marx, Engels, and Lenin in the opposing side.

The general public, including working people around the world, celebrates International Labor Day amidst the greatest crises and pressure of history.

The imperialist regime, the bankruptcy, and the unjust neo -liberal regime and the people of the working people, have been a tradition and a state of distress and disaster.

Although the world is traveling in the 21st century, the majority of the world's population has been transformed into poor people.

The number of people who die all over the world is hungry and the number of people who die. Children are expelled from education around the world.

Tourism Minister Harin Fernando has pledged to address technical issues┬а of the new visa system by May 7. This comes amid concerns of potential losses of 230,000 tourist arrivals and US$ 425 million in tourism earnings for the year.

Colombo district prices have declined by 0.8 percent in April from a month ago. This was helped by the drop in both food and non-food prices in the month, in what appeared to be an idiosyncrasy as typically prices get a bump up during the festive month.

Inflation measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) fell after declining 1.9 percent in March, but the prices measured annually recorded a 1.5 percent increase.

The inflation measured annually declined to 0.9 percent in March due to both lower prices and higher base effects last year.

As a result, there were expectations for slightly higher prices in April from the level recorded in March.

Food prices rose by 2.9 percent in April from a year ago, cooler than 3.8 percent in March while non-food prices rose by 0.9 percent, after declining by 0.5 percent a month ago.

However, measured on a monthly basis, food prices have been on a deflation for the third month in a row. In April food prices fell by 1.0 percent.

The country has suffered a huge loss due to the delay in completing the Umoya Multipurpose Development Program. Accordingly, the loss in the last nine years is estimated at $ 587 million. The initial estimate of the project was recorded at $ 529 million.

### May Day: Not capitalism, but dogmatism has almost killed trade union movement

Rarely any other time,┬а save the campaign rallies, would the politicians speak so passionately about labour rights as they would today, the International WorkersтАЩ Day. But, in this quirky interest reeking of opportunism, there is a sense of irrelevance of what May Day was supposed to be.

Consider today, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa and a horde of Ministers who would ride their Pajeros to the podium while the party members who are bused from four corners of the country march under the scorching sun to mark the historic gains of the labour movement born out of a campaign for eight- hour work day.
