Sylhet, March 24 (ICC) - Sri Lanka's Dhananjaya de Silva and Kamindu Mendis became just the third pair to partner in two 150-plus run stands in the same Test.

Bangladesh achieved early success on day three of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Sylhet, when they sent back night watchman Vishwa Fernando for merely four.

However, just like the first innings, Sri Lanka skipper Dhananjaya de Silva and Kamindu Mendis came together and helped Sri Lanka out of the trouble. Their positive strokeplay gave the island nation a big advantage in the game, as the lead bloomed past 300 by the 54th over. When their partnership hit the 150-run mark in the 77th over, it was only the third time in the history of the game that two 150-plus stands had been achieved in the same Test by the same pair.

### India extends ban on onion exports indefinitely ahead of general election

MUMBAI, March 24 (Reuters) - India has extended its ban on onion exports indefinitely - a surprise move that comes ahead of a general election and is set to exacerbate high prices in some overseas markets.

Imposed by India - the world's biggest exporter of the vegetable - in December, the ban was due to expire on March 31. Traders had anticipated it would be lifted as local prices have more than halved since the export restrictions were implemented and this season's crop is yielding fresh supplies.

However, the government issued an order late on Friday that the ban will remain in place until further notice.

"The extension is surprising and completely unnecessary, considering the falling prices with rising supplies from the new season crop," said an executive at a Mumbai-based export firm, who declined to be identified.

### Sri Lanka central bank says senior management decided to review salary hike

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì The senior management of the central bank decided to review a steep salary hike made after a currency crisis, a statement said amid legislative and public anger against the move.

The salary hike was initially defended on the basis of central bank independence.

Giving salary hike to offset the inflation created by the agency in the process of enforcing rate cuts by printing money has been a longstanding practice.

However legislators said the independence was only given to the agency to print money (and trigger inflation or currency depreciation) and it did not apply to salaries.

Under a new law the agency has got powers to trigger up to 7 percent inflation a year with no questions asked. Since September 2022, the agency has created lower levels of inflation and has appreciated the currency with deflationary policy.
