In 2019, the United People's Power addressed women's health issues, promising financial aid for those unable to afford healthcare. The Celine Foundation's program aims to provide health equipment to women, focusing on national production and economic development. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa highlighted the importance of protecting women's health and reducing healthcare costs. Despite women constituting 52% of the population, the program's implementation has been hindered by a male-centered social structure. The right to violate women's health rights should not be tolerated. The program, promised by the United People's Power Government, aims to tax women for healthcare, creating employment opportunities.

üü©

In the 2019 presidential election, the United People's Power was in the position that women were constantly resolved in the health problems faced by women in the country.. As a result, the Celine Foundation today presented a very important program for women affected by health poverty.

The Opposition Leader said that the health equipment will be provided to women who are unable to meet health problems due to financial problems, as in 2019, as promised in the United People's Power Government.

It is not only a welfare, but also the focus of national production, combining the objectives of promoting these production businesses, which contribute to the economic development of income and ensure the health care of women.. The Leader of the Opposition pointed out that this would protect women's health and reduce unnecessary health costs.

### President hints at vehicle import resumption; importers warn of possible cost increase

President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday hinted at a possible gradual resumption of private vehicle imports starting next year. However, local vehicle importers have warned that this development may not necessarily translate into positive news for buyers.

While the relaxation could breathe new life into the stagnant motor sector, importers have expressed concerns that duty structures for imported vehicles may see a significant increase.

In January, the government revised the duty structure, resulting in a significant rise in vehicle import costs. Despite the potential allowance for vehicle imports, importers caution that substantial restrictions may remain, implying it is too early to celebrate the statement made by the President.

The Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka‚Äôs survey indicates that local market prices are poised to climb alongside the resumption of imports.

Becoming an export oriented economy is a good solution but it is a long term solution as we cannot become an export oriented economy overnight either as that takes years to materialise.

The pause in repayment of external debt (except multilateral debt) for nearly 2 years is largely due to the creditors being reassured that the IMF is there.

There has been a lot of criticism about Sri Lanka‚Äôs 17th IMF program from people of various backgrounds. They have made all kinds of accusations against the IMF program and criticised it. I agree that the IMF program is not the perfect solution. But the question is, what is the alternative? I am yet to see anyone who has offered a sensible alternative to the IMF.

Due to the current economic environment, it is understood that tax revenue collection should be enhanced to increase the Tax to GDP ratio. However, the Government should take precaution to ensure this endeavour to enhance tax revenue does not lead to harassment or unfairness to the taxpayer.

There are many knowledgeable tax officers who understand both sides of the fence and act professionally by respecting the Rule of Law and the Taxpayer Rights. However, due to heightened pressure from the Ministry of Finance and Parliamentary Committees one could lose track of respecting the rights of the other party.

Previous experiments with socialist policies encountered challenges, stifling innovation and individual entrepreneurship.

It is difficult to find another instance in the history of central banking where the head of that bank with conscienceless audacity abused the constitutional independence of that institution to raise unilaterally the wages of his staff to such a height, between 36 and 79%, and made them an un-imitable elite of officers to be envied by the rest of the community of public servants. This is one of many and multiplying horror stories one hears almost daily from paradise Sri Lanka.

At a time when millions of hard-working heads of ordinary families and parents are found skipping meals or eating smaller portions to feed their children, when 30% of five-year-old children are found malnourished, and when the danger of starvation is knocking at the doors of the poorest, the unconscionable act of munificence by the big chief Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe (NW) fits into the proverbial robbery of Peter to pay Paul.

Ground-breaking initiative uses local newspaper cuttings documenting instances of abuse and harassment against women to mark International Women‚Äôs Day

In a poignant tribute, Ogilvy Sri Lanka, in partnership with Women in Need (WIN), revealed ‚ÄòMasterpiece of Abuse‚Äô, an art installation, designed to raise awareness and support for survivors of abuse on International Women‚Äôs Day.

Crafted from local newspaper cuttings documenting instances of abuse and harassment against women, this forsaken art serves as a powerful symbol of the harsh realities faced by women. It stands in stark contrast to the celebratory and empowering messages that often dominate media platforms exclusively on Women‚Äôs Day.

The installation captures the essence of the pervasive issue of abuse experienced by women across the island. By depicting the harsh realities of survivors, it seeks to illuminate the often-overlooked struggles that persist, urging society to confront this pressing issue head-on.

The statement issued by BASL President Kaushalya Nawaratne PC and Secretary Isuru Balapatabendi also said the following.

The recent retirement of a judge of the Supreme Court has further exacerbated the situation by creating an additional vacancy in the Supreme Court. This comes at a time when there is already an ongoing impasse between the Constitutional Council and the Executive over the appointment to fill an existing vacancy within the same court. The delay in resolving these appointments is not only undermining the efficiency of our appellate courts but also eroding public confidence in the legal system‚Ä∫s ability to deliver timely justice.

We are in an era where we have to make a struggle to live, study, find food, retain jobs and stand up for what‚Äôs right. For this we must ensure that our loved ones engaged in the struggle to live and prosper emerge as victors.

But there can be people out there who dedicate some time from their lives to defeat evil. There are citizens of this country who would want to defeat this ‚Äòunelected‚Äô regime; where its present president came to power not through the vote of the citizens, but from support inside the parliament. There are citizens in this nation who‚Äôd want to change this regime and install a new one after an election. And those who contribute to that change might not even stand in public with the winners, but prefer to play watchdog because ‚Äòpower‚Äô has the potential to corrupt lawmakers.

Just as the people sentenced to death are fed their best meal before they are executed, the Gaza Strip‚Äôs people, in the midst of a deadly famine, are being fed meals sent by the United States before they are slaughtered by Israel. Whatever is sent is not the best. But taste is not an option when survival is at stake.

The United States is completing a pier in the seas off the Gaza coast to send much-denied food aid. Its genocide-committing ally, Israel, also says it is trying to ‚Äúflood‚Äù Gaza with aid, unable to withstand mounting international pressure, including some harsh criticism from its hardcore allies. Among them is the European Union, which stands by Israel and stomachs its war crimes with a high tolerance bar that is not seen in its human rights witch hunt against countries like Sri Lanka.

### Sri Lanka may consider hangwomen if execution starts: State Minister

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any reason why a woman can‚Äôt be in that position. But since it‚Äôs not in the practice, that question has not come to us. But, one day if we start this execution and it comes to the ministry, we would consider it as long as the woman is fit and even we do consider they are fit,‚Äù Jayaratne told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo on Thursday (14).
