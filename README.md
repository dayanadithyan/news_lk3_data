### International transitional justice scholars call on SL to halt establishing truth commission

Over 70 international transitional justice and human rights scholars have urged the Sri Lankan Government to halt the establishment of a Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation (CTUR) as it has been rejected by victim groups and the broader national context is not conducive for such a process.

The statement signed by leading authors and researchers of transitional justice from across the world also highlights concerns over the Government’s lack of political commitment towards genuine truth-seeking that could lead to justice and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.

The statement said it recognises the right to truth as a key human right affirmed in UN treaties and other mechanisms and asserts that if conducted properly a truth-seeking process can contribute towards establishing the extent and the patterns of past violations, as well as their causes and consequences. In so doing, it can help reconcile deeply divided communities and help bring closure to victim-survivors, it said.

### Rupee expected to dip to Rs.310-320 range later this year: FCR

*2024-05-16 02:11:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Rupee-expected-to-dip-to-Rs-310-320-range-later-this-year-FCR/108-282689) · `en`

The Sri Lankan rupee is likely to depreciate in the range of Rs.310-320 against the US dollar in the latter part of the year, First Capital Research (FCR) said.

This will be driven by the heightened demand for imports and restart of foreign loan repayments upon completion of the External Debt Restructuring (EDR).

The rupee is expected to appreciate up to Rs.295 in the first half of the year, as the higher taxes eat into the rising consumer demand in the short term, amid the escalation in the cost of living.  The indicative rate of the USD/LKR spot exchange rate stood at Rs.300.83 yesterday.

“Slower consumer demand may lead to a reduction in imports, while the peak tourism season in the 1Q 2024 and higher worker remittances could further bolster the LKR. Subsequently, some stabilisation is anticipated as consumer demand improves and tourism income moderates,” FCR said.

### Telecom Act amendments don’t address the future: Are they at least fixing flaws from the past?

*2024-05-16 00:40:44* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Telecom-Act-amendments-don-t-address-the-future-Are-they-at-least-fixing-flaws-from-the-past/4-761833) · `en`

The country is changing. Apartments and condominiums are popping up everywhere. Technology and markets are changing. Navigating the streets without Google maps seems unthinkable. Data consumed in a month 25 years ago is now consumed in a few hours.

The world is changing. Stories about vehicles that are communicating our braking patterns back to the manufacturer and insurance companies do not seem like science fiction, though we know our cars (and our insurance companies) are not like that, yet.

The future is already here; it’s just not very evenly distributed, as William Gibson, the writer, says. Are our laws ready for the future? Are they at least adequate for the present?

### Sri Lanka’s amended Telecommunications Bill should be sent back to the drawing board

*2024-05-16 00:37:02* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-amended-Telecommunications-Bill-should-be-sent-back-to-the-drawing-board/4-761832) · `en`

It is critical that the Government puts a stop to its conservative and traditional approach to telecoms regulation and handles it in a way that will ensure that digital connectivity spurs the development of the nation

Sri Lanka’s Telecommunications Act first came into force in 1991. It was subsequently amended in 1996. There have been no further amendments or revisions to the Act since then, although there have been several (but failed) attempts to update this legacy Act over the years. An amended Bill has now been sent to Parliament for consideration and is expected to be debated by the country’s lawmakers in the next few weeks.

One would think that the legislation governing one of the most dynamic and critical sectors should have kept up with the times, but here we are 28 years later, attempting to maintain a historical artefact and supplement it with piecemeal amendments, in the hope that this will help sustain digital development for the next decade and more.

### Stolen Assets Recovery Framework: There is much room for improvement

*2024-05-16 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Stolen-Assets-Recovery-Framework-There-is-much-room-for-improvement/172-282665) · `en`

The rallying call for recovering stolen assets during the 2022 protests is still fresh in our minds. If the Abacha loot could be returned to Nigeria by Switzerland, could Sri Lanka not do the same?

In response to the protests and building on the work done by experts over many years, the agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and the IMF now contains a structural benchmark where the GoSL has committed to enact a Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) in keeping with international standards by April 2024.

In March 2023, the Minister of Justice appointed a committee chaired by Supreme Court Justice Yasantha Kodagoda. Dated April 10, 2024, the182-page report of the POCA Committee, now available on the website of the Ministry of Justice, sets out a framework for an upcoming Proceeds of Crime Act.

The current framework is a good start with room for improvement

### Family is the first essential cell of human society

Families stay together if they regularly pray or meditate together. This is a hallowed philosophy that goes a long way to show that good families make good societies and countries. We need to see unity in diversity in families with none dominating or having his/her way. Family members need to be sacrificial and forgiving, embodying values of love, peace, joy, patience, kindness, humility, gentleness and meekness. Some believe the husband is the head of the family and must take the final decision on important issues, but this has been proven to be wrong. The right way is a collective decision by the husband, wife and grown up children. If all family members have an attitude of foot-washing service to others, it will set a good example to the neighbourhood and provide a solid base for the country of good citizens who are concerned not only about themselves, but about the future of the country and the future generations.

### 2024-05-15 (Wednesday)

### Change, not continuity is imperative for consensus, stability and recovery

*2024-05-15 23:43:43* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Change-not-continuity-is-imperative-for-consensus-stability-and-recovery/4-761831) · `en`

Basil Rajapaksa’s idea of a snap Parliamentary election proceeds from the ruling party’s viewpoint that it has a better chance of survival while its partner Ranil holds office and controls the administration.

There is no guarantee though, that if and when that Parliamentary election is held, Ranil won’t tell the country “Ok, now you’ve had your election for this year”, and press ‘pause’ on the scheduled Presidential election.

That is almost exactly what happened in 1982. We had one national election but not the other. The Presidential election was in October 1982, and JR Jayewardene won. The Parliamentary election was scheduled for early 1983, but a Referendum was held instead in December 1982 which the UNP coercively and fraudulently won, and the Parliamentary election was postponed. That lit the fuse that led to Black July 1983, two civil wars (North and South), and foreign military intervention.

### Indian travelers’ boycott of Maldives is helping Sri Lanka, says Tourism Minister

Calls for Indian travelers to boycott the Maldives is “absolutely” helping Sri Lanka’s travel industry, the country’s Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said Wednesday.

“The Maldives issue is … helping us,” Fernando told CNBC, referencing a social media row in January that resulted in a sharp drop in Indian visitors to the Maldives this year.

India was the Maldives’ largest source market in 2023. But now it sits in 6th place, behind arrivals from China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany, according to Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Tourism.

By contrast, nearly 34,400 Indian travelers went to Sri Lanka in January, more than double the 13,759 that visited in January last year, according to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. Arrivals in the first quarter of 2024 outpaced the same time period in 2023, despite a dip in April caused by a visa controversy that saw Sri Lankan visa temporarily double in price.

### Benefits of aloe vera gel

*2024-05-15 22:35:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/benefits-of-aloe-vera-gel/) · `en`

From the comments I get from readers, it seems that aloe vera is what they like to dabble in to enhance their beauty. Believe me, aloe vera happens to be my favourite, as well.

Okay, here’s how to use fresh aloe vera gel to reap all its beauty benefits.

One of the best benefits of aloe vera gel is that it helps heal skin that has been sunburnt. Since the skin becomes sensitive and changes colour, too, it is important to apply a soothing ingredient on it. Aloe vera gel has cooling properties that help heal the skin faster.

In order to use aloe vera gel on sunburnt skin, store fresh gel in the fridge and let it get cool for a few hours. Now, apply the gel on the skin and let it stay there. The skin will absorb the gel and the gel that is left at the top will protect and act as anti-inflammatory agent.

“We have confirmed information about 16 who have been killed,” he told reporters in Colombo.

Tennakoon did not say which side of the conflict the soldiers had been fighting on.

But ruling party lawmaker Gamini Waleboda told parliament on Monday that most had been recruited to fight alongside the Russian army.

Those who joined had been duped with promises of high salaries and falsely told they would be given non-combat roles, Waleboda said.

Tennakoon said the recruitment of Sri Lankans was being treated as a human trafficking enterprise and urged military officers not to fall prey to the recruitment drive.
