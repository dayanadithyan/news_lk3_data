### Sri Lanka reports US$706mn current account surplus amid financial outflows

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka has recorded a 706 million US dollar current account surplus in the first quarter of 2024 as the financial account recorded a deficit amid private and official debt repayments and reserve collections, data show.

Sri Lanka has recorded current account surpluses, since the last quarter of 2022 when monetary stability is reached.

The current account is a mirror image of the financial and capital accounts, subject to errors and omissions.

The way external accounting is calculated, only the balance of payments surplus and deficit (as defined) can be accurately measured.

Whether there is a balance of payments deficit or surplus depends on the note-issue activities of the central bank.

When money is printed through reverse repo or standing facilities, regardless of a budget deficit or surplus, there are foreign exchange shortages, making it difficult to make foreign payments, especially in the capital account, leading to a run down of reserve and eventual default.

### Imputed rental income tax: Gateway to corruption on a massive scale

This flawed system provides the assessor a great deal of authority and gives them the opportunity to pocket a buck for themselves

By 1 April 2025 the Government proposes to implement a wealth tax by way of an тАЬimputed rental incomeтАЭ on property as a precursor to a land tax. In simple terms the meaning of тАЬimputed rental incomeтАЭ is the estimated rental income of a property if it were rented. The mere assumption of a rental income is very much subjective and cannot in any effect be a guide to govern taxes.

In reality, imputed rent is exactly what the Local Councils are already obtaining from property owners by way of Municipality Rates. Hence the new тАЬimputed rental incomeтАЭ is just a facade to re-tax the citizen who is already taxed twice over on the same income, first by the Municipality on the imputed rent and secondly by the Inland Revenue based on actual income of the same property.

In the late 1970s, during the rising tide of neoliberal globalisation, many countries in the Global South opened up their economies to foreign capital in order to build a so-called export-oriented economy. The ethos that drove such reforms can be divided into two camps:

In China, pragmatism prevailed, with Chairman Deng Xiaoping stating, тАЬTo cross the river, feel for the stones.тАЭ

In Sri Lanka, there was an ideological faith in markets and foreign capital, with then President J.R. Jayewardene stating, тАЬLet the robber barons come.тАЭ

Today, one of these countries has defaulted on its external debt and is undergoing its 17th IMF program. The other is the worldтАЩs factory, contributing to over 35% of global manufacturing value-added and expected to lead the next business cycle. No prizes for guessing which is which.

The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday as fighting raged in Gaza and Israeli tanks advanced deeper in parts of the enclave, residents and officials said.

The armed wing of Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas, said its fighters fired rockets towards several Israeli communities near the fence with Gaza in response to тАЬthe crimes of the Zionist enemy against our Palestinian peopleтАЭ.

The volley of around 20 rockets caused no casualties, the Israeli military said. But the attack showed militants still possess rocket capabilities almost nine months into an offensive that Israel says is aimed at neutralising threats against it.

Violence also flared on Monday in the Israeli occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian health ministry said a woman and a boy were killed in the city of Tulkarm during an operation by Israeli forces. A day earlier, an Israeli strike in the same area killed an Islamic Jihad member.
