Feb. 5 (BS) - The cricket boards of Pakistan and Sri Lanka are locked in a financial dispute over who should bear the additional $3-4 million burden incurred due to the shifting of the Asia Cup to the island nation last year.

With the BCCI unwilling to send its team to Pakistan, the original host, due to geo-political tensions, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) decided on a hybrid model and roped in Sri Lanka to host the majority of the matches.

This resulted in extra expenses being incurred on chartered flights, hotel bookings, venue hiring fees and travel, among others.

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) made it clear during the ACC council meeting in Bali last week that it was not willing to take the financial burden as it did not earn extra and was also not the official host of the tournament.

The expenses also reportedly soared because the former PCB chairman, Zaka Ashraf, changed the venue of the first match from Lahore to Multan.

Colombo, Feb 5 (Daily Mirror) - Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella's accusations over the import of substandard immunoglobulin injections should be considered as a fraud and a massacre, former Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) chairman Janaka Ratnayaka said.

Addressing the media, he said that the Minister had imported the immunoglobulin injections without following any procedures and had administered them to innocent people in the country.

"We do not know how many people have lost their lives. Therefore, we should work on this issue, considering it similar to a massacre by Hitler during World War II. Hitler also engaged in killing people using poisonous injections," Ratnayaka said.

He said the punishment given to Keheliya Rambukwella can be considered the best punishment in history given to a Sri Lankan politician.

"I don't know what will happen in the future. My take is that this vaccine should be administered to all parliamentarians to check the symptoms.
