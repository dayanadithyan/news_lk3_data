ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank staff could continue to get high salaries for up to five years, and not three years as set out in a collective agreement, a committee that went into the matter after a public outcry has recommended, a legislator said.

A panel that went into the salary hike that the central bank staff had paid themselves had criticized the salary hike and a defined benefit pension plan, but said changing it would lead to legal problems, Chairman of the Committee of Public Enterprises, Harsha de Silva said.

The Committee had said it was wrong to apply the same salaries to office assistants and management assistants as senior officers in ‘mission critical’ roles.

The office assistants and management assistants should be given the same salaries as the rest of the government.

The panel has said that individuals should be given increments on a ‘meritocracy’.

There was a recommendation that a human resources manager be appointed to carry out a study in 2025 and changes made.
