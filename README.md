### Sri Lanka cabinet gives ok to sign Thailand FTA

*2024-01-26 07:33:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-cabinet-gives-ok-to-sign-thailand-fta-148720/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers has given approval to sign a free trade agreement with Thailand, the state information office said.

A complete FTA of 14 chapters with the preamble and annexes has been prepared after nine rounds of negotiations.

The government hopes to improve trade and investment with Thailand which is one of the largest nations in South East Asia.

Sri Lanka has high levels of import duties and protectionism, which has kept local prices high and allowed domestic producers to exploit the public, critics say.

High tariffs also makes the economy inefficient and noncompetitive. (Colombo/Jan26/2024)

### Guns and Sri Lankan ‘Roses’ - EDITORIAL

*2024-01-26 00:38:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Guns-and-Sri-Lankan-Roses-EDITORIAL/172-275724) · `en`

Yesterday was a Poya Day (Duruthu Poya), and people placed flowers in front of Buddha statues all over the country, but we can safely say that roses have not been the favourite of Buddhists. This isn’t because roses are criminally expensive, but because this religion doesn’t have a close relationship with the ‘rose’. Buddhists prefer the lotus when an offering needs to be done; largely due to the lessons the flower symbolises.

But roses have entered our culture and quite secretly encroached the minds of peace-loving people as well as rebels and protesters. We remember in 2022 April (8) how a female undergraduate went in front of a barricade near the Sri Lankan Parliament and offered a rose to the Police, who were in their numbers to quell a protest. That gesture was ‘sweet’ like the rose itself, but those who love roses can love guns as well; in case you’re pushed to the wall and there is no solace from the law.

### Palestinian crisis: Obstacles on path to two-state solution

Palestinians fleeing Khan Yunis on a donkey cart with their belongings as Israel pressed its blistering assault on the city yesterday. AFP

As Israel’s inhuman onslaught on the Gaza Strip continues, the talk of a two-state solution is being bandied about by world leaders, especially those from the Global South.

Though the two-state solution requires thorough scrutiny and resurrection, some see this as an attempt to deflect global attention from the Gaza horror, which has killed more than 25,000 people; 70 percent of them being women and children. Whether this horror is gross genocide will be known today when the International Court of Justice delivers its provisional order.

### We must boost country’s income, transitioning to positive economic trajectory - President

*2024-01-25 22:59:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96731/we-must-boost-countrys-income-transitioning-to-positive-economic-trajectory-president) · `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday (Jan.25) underscored his commitment to guiding the country’s progress in the coming years, drawing inspiration from the success of Biyagama.

Reflecting on his early political career in the Biyagama Constituency, where the region experienced notable underdevelopment, the President emphasized the positive impact of strategic economic decisions, particularly the establishment of the Biyagama Investment Zone. He noted that Biyagama’s rapid progress stands as a testament to those decisions.

The Head of State underscored his vision for replicating such success nationwide by leveraging the advantages of an open economy.

He expressed plans to establish new investment zones across the country, with the aim of significantly boosting the national economy.

Recalling his recent visit to Switzerland, President Wickremesinghe said world leaders were amazed to hear how rapidly Sri Lanka has turned itself around and how its once-bankrupt economy has rebounded.

### Plans, Teams & Mis-Steps

*2024-01-25 22:22:24* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/plans-teams-mis-steps/) · `en`

There is much hope placed on direct foreign investments (FDI) and tourism, as the sectors most likely to help hoist us out of our current financial mess. Are they properly thought out plans, mere fantasies, deceptions or added follies? It is wise for us to frankly and rigorously examine and recognize possible perils or false expectations ourselves, rather than leave it for  others to do so. Confidence lost, is not easily regained. All geese cannot pose as swans.

Foreign investors are not Santa Claus’s in disguise. They are hard-headed business experts, looking for opportunities to maximize returns for their clients and profits for themselves. This is quite legitimate, and it is naïve to think otherwise. They are certainly not here for our good. Not ‘altruism’, but ‘profit’ is the name of the game. Who can blame them, seeking rules that are fair and promises that are honoured? To think otherwise is stupid.

Accordingly, the end user and bulk supply tariff proposals by the CEB for January to March 2024 were received by the PUCSL on January 16, 2024. Subsequently, though the Commission had requested certain clarifications from the CEB, the information is yet to be received.

In a recent speech delivered in Batticaloa, Patali Champika Ranawaka, a figure often scrutinized for party-switching, revealed a profound perspective on unity and forgiveness.

Batticaloa, a historically significant place in Sri Lanka, served as the backdrop for his message that transcends political boundaries and holds relevance not only for the nation but also for global political dynamics.

Amidst discussions about Patali’s political affiliations, his Batticaloa speech sheds light on his character and philosophy. *”Acknowledging past mistakes and expressing a commitment to move forward, Patali emphasized the importance of letting go of historical grievances”.*

His words echo a universal truth – dwelling on past pains, anger, and conflicts impedes progress. Instead, he advocates for forgiveness, urging society to collectively forge ahead.

Sri Lanka is currently grappling with a significant challenge – the escalating prices of vegetables. This surge in food prices has a direct impact on households, affecting their ability to afford essential and nutritious foods. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind the rising vegetable prices in Sri Lanka, discuss their implications for households, and propose measures to mitigate the impact.

Several factors contribute to the escalating vegetable prices in Sri Lanka. Climate change-induced weather patterns, fluctuating global commodity prices, and disruptions in the supply chain are some of the key contributors. Additionally, increased production costs, inadequate infrastructure, and inefficiencies in distribution channels have further exacerbated the situation.

### Meet The Brothers Size In A Local Backyard

The Sinhala language production of The Brothers Size, premiered in December 2023, in a Kumbukgahaduwa backyard. Directed by Prasanna Mahagamage, it was enacted by Hiran Abeysekera, Danushka Dias, and Chamara Gamaathige.

This Sinhala production was one-of-a-kind, in multiple ways. It was a collective translation from English to Sinhala by the director and actors. The open theatre space called LOVEARTLOVE was an unconventional, unknown, residential space, away from the city centre and other familiar theatre locations. The play itself had an ambiguous English title transliterated in Sinhala. The e-flyer announcing the play, displaying an architectural drawing, announced irregular seating, and possibly standing spaces for the audience. A mysterious charm, amidst risk-taking. Was the focus more on entertainment, and coming together with ‘sexy theatre lovers’, and ‘BYOB… clinking glasses’ later, than a theatre enactment?

The United States remains concerned about the potential impact of Sri Lanka’s newly passed Online Safety Bill, Ambassador Julie Chung said on Thursday (Jan.25).

Taking to X (formerly Twitter), the US envoy in Colombo expressed dismay at passing the legislation in the parliament by majority vote without incorporating important input from key stakeholders, including civil society and tech companies.

The new law has come under fire for the problematic aspects of several clauses of the Bill, which threaten the freedom of expression, innovation and privacy.

Chung emphasized that the ‘vague and overly restrictive’ Online Safety Bill can hinder investment and development of a digital economy, undermining Sri Lanka’s much-needed economic growth.

On that account, the United States has urged the Sri Lankan authorities to prioritize transparency and ensure any legislation does not stifle the voices of its people.

Spain, Jan 25 (BBC) - A Spanish judge has proposed that former football federation president Luis Rubiales should stand trial over the women's World Cup kiss involving captain Jenni Hermoso.

Mr Rubiales grabbed Ms Hermoso's head and kissed her during the presentation after Spain's victory in Australia.

She said the kiss was "not consensual", a statement denied by Mr Rubiales.

A judge has found there is enough evidence for the matter to proceed to trial.

During a hearing at the Audencia Nacional, or High Court, in Madrid, the judge described the kiss as "not consensual and... a unilateral and surprising initiative".

Prosecutors previously charged Mr Rubiales with sexual assault and coercion.

Penalties for such a kiss range from a fine to four years in prison.

The incident has involved several Spanish football executives including Ms Hermoso's former coach, a former marketing manager and the sports director of the men's team.

On Wednesday (24th), the UK Cabinet Office put out an official statement, disputing the method of making tea that had been suggested by the U.S. embassy in London.

”In response, to the statement put out by the US Embassy in the UK: We appreciate our Special Relationship, however, we must disagree wholeheartedly… Tea can only be made using a kettle.” the UK Cabinet Office said on X (formerly Twitter).
