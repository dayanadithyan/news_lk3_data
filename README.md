### Blinken says Israel accepts Gaza proposal, urges Hamas to do same

*2024-08-20 12:31:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101370/blinken-says-israel-accepts-gaza-proposal-urges-hamas-to-do-same) ┬╖ `en`

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had accepted a тАЬbridging proposalтАЭ presented by Washington to tackle disagreements blocking a ceasefire deal in Gaza, and urged Hamas to do the same.

Blinken spoke to journalists after a day of meetings with Israeli officials, including a 2-1/2-hour meeting with Netanyahu. The top U.S. diplomat had said earlier that this push was probably the best and possibly last opportunity for a deal.

Talks in Qatar seeking a ceasefire and hostage return agreement last week paused without a breakthrough, but were expected to resume this week based on the U.S. proposal to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas.

BlinkenтАЩs visit comes as U.S. President┬а faces mounting election-year pressure over his stance on the conflict, with his Democratic party starting its national convention on Monday amid pro-Palestinian protests and worries about Muslim and Arab American votes in swing states.

### The election promises are not enough - how many days will you implement them - Powell Plan to request candidates

*2024-08-20 11:05:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191509) ┬╖ `ta`

Election monitoring group Powell urges Sri Lankan presidential candidates to detail their policy timelines and funding sources. Candidates like Anura Kumaratisanayake and Ranil Wickremesinghe must address how they'll turn campaign promises into action, amid concerns over past discrepancies between manifesto pledges and actual governance. Powell emphasizes transparency and accountability, requiring candidates to specify deadlines and financial plans for their proposed initiatives.

ЁЯЯй

Election monitoring organizations will appeal to the presidential candidates to present a specific time for them to implement them in response to the presence of vast words.

The presidential candidate of the National People's Power, Anura Kumaratisanayake, will release his election manifesto on the 26th.He will publish the manifesto.

Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is contesting as an independent candidate, will soon release his election manifesto.

In the past, the presidential candidates have published their election manifesto but there has been a huge gap between their promises and their implementation.

The reason for this is that the matters they stated in the election manifesto were seen as a reality.

Or in the midst of their tenure, the circumstances changed their policies.

Sri Lanka is still trying to recover from the worst economic crisis after independence.

Powell candidates, the election monitoring organization, are also planning to put forward the implementation of their plans.

In Sri Lanka's upcoming presidential election, despite legal provisions for gender equality, no women have nominated themselves, marking a lack of female representation and highlighting ongoing challenges for women in politics. This election, with the highest number of male candidates in the country's history, is seen as reflecting a patriarchal culture despite international agreements aimed at eliminating gender discrimination. The absence of female candidates underscores the need for greater efforts to encourage women's participation in politics, given that more than half of Sri Lanka's population is female.

ЁЯЯй

Elections to elect the ninth executive president will be held on September 21st. With 40 people, only 39 filed nominations.This includes three Tamils тАЛтАЛand two Muslims. It is also a presidential election, with no female candidates, while the highest number of candidates are contesting in Sri Lanka's history.

Despite the legal provisions for gender equality, no women have come forward to contest the presidential election this year to illustrate the continued challenges faced by women in Sri Lankan politics.. Because of this, it is described as a patriarchal presidential election.

Besides breaching the Trump campaign, officials also believe that Iran tried to hack into the presidential campaign of Kamala Harris.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that even if he successfully resolves the economic crisis that others have failed to address, the countryтАЩs economy will collapse again if the necessary economic transformations are interrupted midway.

He pointed out that rapid economic growth has been hindered by ideologies like those of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, which advocate for a domestic economy.

### Why does women not present the presidential election in Sri Lanka with more women's population?

*2024-08-20 06:40:46* ┬╖ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c703r7e38n6o) ┬╖ `si`

In Sri Lanka, despite having a higher percentage of women in the population, few women participate in presidential elections. This is attributed to historical patterns where only four women have contested, with none winning since 1988. Cultural and societal norms often associate politics with men, discouraging women from entering the field. Additionally, political parties have historically lacked female representation, and when proposed, ideas to include women were met with resistance. Economic challenges and lack of political awareness among women further contribute to the underrepresentation of women in Sri Lanka's presidential elections.
