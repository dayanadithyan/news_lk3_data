Justice Sotomayor on SC Ruling on Presidential Immunity: With fear for our democracy, I dissent

President Biden had a dismal debate night on Thursday, June 28. There is absolutely no gainsaying that fact. However rose-tinted the glasses we may wear, Biden did no favors to his chances of re-election in November. Highly respected journals like the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune, joined with this lowly columnist, an ardent supporter of the Democratic cause and a virulent Never Trumper, in sending a message, immediately after the debate, to the 81-year-old incumbent president to drop out of the fray, for the greater good of the nation.

In fact, polls after the debate found that 72% of all voters did not want Biden running in November. Also, many of the mega donors of the Democratic Party are insisting that the party replaces Biden with a younger, more electable candidate – or else.

### Navigating ourselves out

This may be cynical posturing on my part, but recent announcements about Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring process reeks of a somewhat widespread tendency to credit everything to the political leadership at the cost of the suffering many. Legitimate concerns have been raised about whether Sri Lanka could have negotiated better; the debt haircut Ghana settled for, to give one example, is miles away from Sri Lanka’s figure. The extent of our haircut leaves us with very little breathing space. To stick to it, we need to engage in savage austerity, or more of what we have been inflicting on ourselves for the last two years.

### Lanka’s defense cooperation with India: Strengthening ties or strategic dependence?

*2024-07-07 01:21:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/lankas-defense-cooperation-with-india-strengthening-ties-or-strategic-dependence/) · `en`

Exposing a large segment of your military officers to the thinking and training of a foreign power, especially one so near, can have significant consequences.

Defense cooperation between Sri Lanka and India is growing. This is significant as India’s defense engagements with other countries in the region, such as the Maldives, for example, are reducing. This is a strategic move on India’s part to strengthen its influence in the Indian Ocean island at a time when the Chinese presence in the region has grown manifold.

By providing specialized training and military aid, India aims to foster a closer relationship with Sri Lanka, akin to the historical precedent set by the United States through its military aid programs with developing countries since 1880.

### Anita Desai – Indian Novelist

*2024-07-07 01:09:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/anita-desai-indian-novelist/) · `en`

I caught the infection of admiring almost anything Indian from my eldest brother – kind and pacifist like Gandhi; superb gentleman like Jawaharlal Nehru. His most prized possession was an autographed copy of  Discovery of India, given him by Nehru himself when he visited Ceylon in 1957 in celebration of the Buddha Jayanti. A cherished memory of his was seeing newly wed Nayantara, daughter of Vijayalakshmi Pandit, leave by train in the Delhi station with husband Sahgal on their honeymoon.

They were surrounded by family. And what was Aiya doing over there? Intrepidly he had taken Mother on pilgrimage to Gaya and other places, all by himself in 1949, when pilgrimages were rare and fraught with risks.

### On the verge of manhood

*2024-07-07 01:06:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/on-the-verge-of-manhood/) · `en`

Seniors’ ragging of ‘freshers’ was rampant on the Peradeniya campus. Marcus Fernando Hall, where I was a fresher, was notorious for ragging. A gang of nasty seniors woke us up at 4 am and forced us to crawl naked around the hall pond, pretending to be reptiles looking for water. Some seniors were lenient and wanted to have a good time with freshers. They asked us to sing, dance, or write letters promising to marry off sisters to their lordships – seniors. Once, I wrote a long letter promising to marry off my only sister to a senior. (I had only three brothers). He read the letter, thanked me for my generosity, and asked whether my sister was pretty. When I hesitated to reply, he told me he was uninterested in my sister.

UNITED NATIONS | 27 June 2024 (IDN) — When British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak addressed reporters outside his official residence, 10 Downing Street, to announce the next general elections, he stood there in pelting rain with a heavily water-soaked suit because no one was shielding him from the weather while dozens of reporters were armed to the teeth—both with rain coats and umbrellas.

The next morning the London newspapers had a field day. One of the tabloids ran with the headline: DROWNING STREET and another headline read: DROWN AND OUT. As for his chances of winning the upcoming elections, the Daily Telegraph had the headline: THINGS CAN ONLY GET WETTER.

Meanwhile, in a bygone era, when a British Labour Party politician MICHAEL FOOT was elected to chair a committee to look into nuclear disarmament in Europe, the legendary headline in the London Times in 1986 read: FOOT HEADS ARMS BODY.
