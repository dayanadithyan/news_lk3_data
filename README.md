While the credit card spend doesn‚Äôt show the full picture of consumer spending, the outstanding balance could see tangible movements from the second quarter onwards as people were taking more trips making use of the offers and discounts offered by banks for their credit cards.

### Govt. revenue in January surge 62% on economic turnaround, higher taxes

The revenue to the government, including the grants, rose by a staggering 61.8 percent in January 2024. This is a result of the government raking in billions of rupees out of people‚Äôs pockets to appease the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs revenue targets.

The government revenues and grants for January were Rs.283.19 billion, out of which Rs.257.57 billion was raised via taxes. This was 63.8 percent higher from the same period last year.

The staggering increase in the tax revenues in January compared to the same month in 2023 was predominantly due to the recovering economy which was supported further by the 3 percent increase in the value added tax rate from January 1, 2024 onwards.

Between then and now, there wasn‚Äôt a single other tax imposed or raised except for the value added tax, and hence the bulk of the growth in tax income came from the recovering economy due to the normalising foreign currency inflows.

It must be re -consider whether the military community has had to commit a proper duty after the victory of the thirty years of terrorist war.. Soldiers and their families are suffering from great difficulties and are facing an unbearable economic and social crisis.

Soldiers have gone to the lower level of the poverty line due to the lack of relief in the economic crisis, which has risen to the country.. So they have gone abroad in search of other income. Others have to go to Russia and go to the front of the battlefield.

### The presidential election will be ignored until the federal assurance is granted - the Tamil National People's Front calls

*2024-05-20 02:49:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183989) ¬∑ `ta`

It seems like you've shared a detailed perspective on the political and social dynamics surrounding the Tamil people's relationship with the Sri Lankan state, focusing on issues of rights, representation, and the impact of electoral processes on their struggle for recognition and autonomy. Your message highlights several key points:



1. **Boycott of Presidential Elections**: The idea of boycotting the Sri Lankan Presidential election as a means to assert the Tamil people's stance on their rights and demands.



2. **Compromise and Negotiation**: The call for the Sri Lankan government to engage in meaningful dialogue and negotiation with the Tamil people to address their grievances and concerns.



3. **Rejection of Sinhala Buddhist Hegemony**: The rejection of policies and structures that marginalize the Tamil people and promote Sinhala Buddhist dominance.



4. **International Recognition and Support**: The importance of international community involvement and support in addressing the Tamil people's plight.



5. **Historical and Current Injustices**: A recounting of historical injustices faced by the Tamil people, including forced displacement, denial of resettlement rights, and the lack of accountability for human rights abuses.



6. **Political Aspirations and Solutions**: The emphasis on self-determination, federalism, and the right to a political solution that recognizes the Tamil people's sovereignty and identity.



7. **Critique of Political Maneuvers**: A critique of attempts by certain political actors to manipulate the Tamil people's aspirations for personal gain or to further Sinhala Buddhist interests.



8. **Call for Unity and Collective Action**: The appeal for the Tamil people to unite and exert collective pressure through peaceful means to achieve their political and social objectives.



Your message underscores the complexity of the issues facing the Tamil people and the challenges they face in asserting their rights within the Sri Lankan state. It also reflects a deep-seated frustration with the current political landscape and a strong desire for change that respects and acknowledges the Tamil people's unique cultural, linguistic, and national identity.

The Tamil National People's Front (TNA) has called for a complete boycott until the unity of the Sri Lankan presidential election will be eliminated and the federal guarantee is granted.

The party said in a clarification report on the presidential election titled 'We will be thinking of the welfare of Tamil Nadu'.

In the Tamil nation, the Tamil Nadu state is acting as an enemy of the Tamil nation by continuing the Sinhala Buddhistization, militarization and systematic ethnic process through the construction of the ethnic groups.. The Sri Lankan government, which considers the Tamils to cause any crisis as long as the majority representation within the unity state structure is in their hands, is maintaining the interests of the Sinhalese nation, not considering the Tamil people as its enemies.

Yet, behind the fa√ßade of discord lies a disconcerting unity among MPs when it comes to safeguarding their own interests and privileges, even at the expense of the struggling populace.

The Office of United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) on Friday the17th issued a strident call to the Sri Lanka Government (SLG) to urgently establish an independent prosecutorial authority, appoint a special prosecutor and create special courts to try those accused of gross violations of international law and serious breaches of international humanitarian law.

In its report on accountability for enforced disappearances in our country, the OHCHR has suggested enhancing the capabilities of the Office on Missing Persons ensuring thorough investigation into mass graves and the prosecution of those responsible for these crimes.

From the early 1970s our country has faced three armed uprisings -the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) insurgency of 1971, the near three-decade ethnic war of 1983 and the JVP uprising in 1989.

Just 6,000 industrial entities account for 93% of the¬†industrial electricity

The CEA is now working to change the application process so that companies will be required to provide greenhouse gas-related data

Some industrial sectors are making changes to adopt renewable technologies

Of the 70,000 industrial entities supplied by the CEB, 350 consume 42% of all industry sector electricity

To change something, first you have to understand it. But unless you fully understand what you are trying to change, you will be moving forward with your eyes closed. You will be struggling to understand the situation as you will be feeling your surroundings in the dark.

### ‚ÄòA Death In An Antique Shop‚Äô: Challenge To Our Cognitive Capacity?

*2024-05-19 20:20:06* ¬∑ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/a-death-in-an-antique-shop-challenge-to-our-cognitive-capacity/) ¬∑ `en`

Asoka Handagama is notorious for challenging our cognitive capacity through his artwork, be it through poetry, fiction, stage drama, teledrama, or movies. His newest stage drama, ‚ÄòA Death in an Antique Shop‚Äô, is the best, or worst in some sense, in this tradition. You can watch it not on stage but on YouTube.

In many respects, watching the drama on YouTube is better than doing it in a theatre-environment. First, it is free from the attention deficiency which we will face in a theatre. As Salman Khan, creator of the Khan Academy, has told us in his autobiographical professional experience, The One World Schoolhouse: Education Reimagined, we can keep attention to a single object continuously not more than for about seven minutes; beyond that, we lose focus on the object. In a theatre where we sit for hours in an uncomfortable posture, it is certainly not possible to pay full attention to what is being unfolded on the stage for the whole duration of the drama.

‚ÄúIf a child can‚Äôt learn the way we teach, maybe we should teach the way they learn.‚Äù Ignacio Estrada. This is a quote that is lost on the Sri Lankan education system but bamboo rods and beatings still remain as the number one tool to teach. Contrary to our cultural beliefs, this method is the least effective way to teach and it‚Äôs particularly detrimental when it comes to children with learning disorders.

People with Dyslexia have difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and their relation to words and letters (University of Oxford , n.d.). Simply put, these are the children who struggle to read and write and saying ‚ÄúIdiot, open your eyes and read what‚Äôs on the page. For every spelling mistake, I will give you a beating with a ruler,‚Äù will not cure their dyslexia.
