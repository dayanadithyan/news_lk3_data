Colombo, June 6 (Daily Mirror) - The Anuradhapura Municipal Commissioner declared the Anuradhapura sacred area as a rabies-free zone, assuring devotees that there is no need for concern, the Association of Veterinarians for Humane Management of Animal Population said.

Municipal Commissioner Ruwan Wijesinghe said there is no danger of rabies within the Anuradhapura Municipal Council area due to the highly organized anti-rabies programmes over the last four years.

He said that rabies vaccinations had been administered to stray dogs during World Rabies Day every year for four consecutive years, and more than 90% of the stray dogs have been operated on.

As bringing animals from other areas into the city is still a problem, he requests the people to take care of the animals responsibly and not leave them stranded and helpless.

It is further requested that the people in the areas bring the animals to the clinics organized by the Municipal Council and get rabies vaccinations administered.

June 06 -¬† The Catholic Bishops' Conference of Sri Lanka (CBCSL) announced today that the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka had no involvement in the extension of the Attorney General's term.

Our attention has been drawn to news articles published in several newspapers and other social and electronic media during the first week of June 2024 regarding a purported statement by the President concerning an extension granted to the term of the current Attorney General.

These articles refer to an unfounded incident alleging that the Chairman of the CBCSL met with the President, resulting in the appointment of a three-member committee consisting of Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, Sagala Rathnayake, and Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnam to discuss the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Report into the Easter Sunday attacks.

### Indian Lok Sabha election - a view

*2024-06-06 20:30:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185482) ¬∑ `ta`

In the recently concluded Indian Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, did not secure the expected 400 seats but still achieved a significant majority. This result limits the BJP's ability to unilaterally implement reforms. Despite this, Modi was re-elected for a third term. The election saw several surprises, including independent candidates winning against major parties. For instance, Amrit Pal Singh, despite being imprisoned, won in the Katur Sahib constituency, and Mohammed Haneefa triumphed in Ladakh over both Congress and BJP candidates. These outcomes highlight the dynamic nature of Indian politics and the potential for independent voices to impact electoral results positively.

üü©

The completed Indian Lok Sabha election has many interesting features. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been ruling in India for the past ten years, and the Prime Minister of the party, Narendra Modi, have not received 400 seats in the NDA's campaign.. Instead, only a large -scale majority to rule is to the people.

This has created an environment where the BJP is no longer able to decide for reforms in the country.. Although Indian voters have been given the opportunity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the third time.This time the BJP and the party's Prime Minister Narendra Modi have made the position that Telugu Desam Party leader Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, the leader of the United Janata Party, can be operated only after consultation.. Political observers have said that this is healthy for democracy.
