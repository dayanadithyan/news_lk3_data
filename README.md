Sri Lanka is hopeful of making progress by next month on two delayed wind energy projects to be built by India’s Adani Green Energy Ltd, its energy minister said on Wednesday.

“Both are (happening) simultaneously, so I am hopeful that by March, we will have something,” he said.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected Hamas’s proposed ceasefire terms - saying “total victory” in Gaza is possible within months.

He was speaking after Hamas laid out a series of demands in response to an Israel-backed ceasefire proposal.

Mr Netanyahu said negotiations with the group were “not going anywhere” and described their terms as “bizarre”.

“There is no other solution but a complete and final victory,” Mr Netanyahu told a news conference on Wednesday.

“If Hamas will survive in Gaza, it’s only a question of time until the next massacre.”

Israel was expected to take issue with Hamas’s counter-offer, but this response is a categorical rebuke, and Israeli officials clearly see an effort by Hamas to end the war on its terms as utterly unacceptable.

Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told the Reuters news agency that Mr Netanyahu’s remarks “are a form of political bravado”, and show he intends to pursue the conflict in the region.

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) announced today a relaxation of restrictions on borrowing by commercial banks, aiming to stimulate the domestic money market and accelerate a decline in interest rates.

In January 2023, the CBSL imposed limits on banks' access to its overnight lending and deposit facilities (Standing Lending Facility and Standing Deposit Facility) to encourage them to rely more on the interbank call money market. This move aimed to revitalize the money market and reduce banks' overdependence on the central bank.

The CBSL reports that the initial restrictions achieved their intended goals, reactivating the money market and moderating competition for deposits among banks. The measures also helped align market interest rates with the central bank's monetary policy stance while maintaining financial system stability.

Colombo, Feb 8 (Daily Mirror) - Hot on the heels of the National People’s Power (NPP) undertaking a familiarization tour of India with interactions with the top Indian officials, the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has sought a similar opportunity from India, Daily Mirror learns.

The NPP led by its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake is currently in India on a five –day tour. The NPP leaders have already held talks with Indian External Affairs Minister Dr.S.Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan.

They were supposed to meet Chief Minister of Gujarat Bupendra Patel yesterday. Afterwards, they were expected to arrive in Kerala.

Sensing the political mileage from such engagements in India for a party like the NPP ahead of the presidential election, the SJB has sought a similar visit. According to an informed source, India has responded favourably to the request.

### Shotguns to control wild boar, toque monkeys, giant squirrels

*2024-02-08 06:59:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Shotguns-to-control-wild-boar-toque-monkeys-giant-squirrels/108-276563) · `en`

Colombo, Feb 8 (Daily Mirror) - The Agriculture Ministry has decided to reduce the extent of five acres stipulated earlier, to two acres of farmland for their owners to qualify to own shotguns to protect their crops.

The Ministry said that most farmers have abandoned their crops since wild boar, toque monkeys and giant squirrels have destroyed their crops, and the damage caused has exceeded fifty percent.

Therefore, the government has to implement the proposal of the farmers, as there is currently no viable alternative to reduce damages caused by wildlife.

In 2023, wild animals have destroyed 300 million coconut plantations in the country, the Ministry claimed.

In 2022, 96 million coconuts were destroyed by toque monkeys and giant squirrels. It has been confirmed that these wild animals destroy about 40 percent of the total crops.

"If we can protect crops from wild animals, we can be self-sufficient in food without cultivating new crops," the Ministry said.
