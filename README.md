The program aims to help drug addicts, but officers' involvement causes inconvenience and stress. Some addicts use drugs to support their families financially, complicating efforts to rehabilitate them. The program also faces criticism for not being effectively implemented, with concerns about its location and lack of legal backing."

Although the rehabilitation of the Superintendents of the Circular and Mental Health, the OICs including the Superintendents of the Circular Health and other police officers are also physically used to implement the details of the circulars.It is reported that they have been adversely affected.

Since all drug addicts are not stealing, the majority will work to maintain the use of drugs to maintain their children, as they spend money to use drugs.

Police say that if such persons are referred to rehabilitation to rehabilitate, the police say they have also been taken to maintain the child.

President Ranil Wickremesighe is expected to contest in an independent coalition. He became unpopulour after he implemented reforms including raising utility prices to a lever without incurring any losses in line with the commitments Sri Lanka agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after an unprecedented economic crisis in 2022.

Thondaman said the water tariff will come down because electricity is one of the key component in the water pricing.

The Cabinet this week approved a water tariff formula to be implemented from 2025.

The Bill seeks to amend present Article 83(b), according to which the maximum period to which such term or duration can be extended without a Referendum is six years. Article 83 also states that any Bill that seeks to amend Article 83 itself would require a two-thirds majority and approval at a Referendum. Thus, it is clear beyond doubt that the proposed Bill will require a two-thirds majority and a Referendum.
