### Romantic epic birds

*2024-08-18 21:17:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/191392) ┬╖ `ta`

The Hornbill, a unique bird known for its romantic behavior, exhibits a fascinating mating ritual. Males provide fruits and insects to females, who are only courted if they show interest. After pairing, both sexes engage in love flights, showcasing their bond. Nesting involves the female creating a natural wooden pod, where she lays eggs and later feeds the chicks through a small opening. The male then takes over, feeding and teaching the young to fly.

### River For Jaffna тАУ White Elephant In The Offing

Recently while opening the de-salination plant in eastern Vadamaradchy, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he would commission river for Jaffna project, which Tamils are not going to take seriously. However it is worth examining feasibilty of it. Already there is one river in Jaffna peninsula, Valuki Aru, originating in Alavedy and confluencing at Araly, which in most of the time of the year runs dry. Hence this would be the second.

One of the problem faced by people of Jaffna is the lack of potable and arable water supply. Ground water is the main source for agriculture in Jaffna through lift irrigation from wells, initially manually and now mechanised using pumps. While it is the preferred method for cash crops, rice cultivation is rain fed, where 90% of rain fall is in October to December. Due to excessive use of ground water, wells in some parts have turned brackish.
