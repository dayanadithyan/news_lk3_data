*2024-02-11 05:40:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/anura-kumara-dissanayake-in-india/) · `en`

Asokavanam, who was Sita, is now known as 'Sita Eliya' in Sri Lanka. 5 km from Nuwara Eliya in Sri Lanka. The "Sita Eliya" is located in the distance.

The area is a forest, river and mountains, and is a place where it is natural and can attract tourists worldwide.. There is a famous Sita Amman Temple, which is the founder of Sita.

Since Sita was swimming in the river running near the temple, it was named Sita River. The statue is located on the banks of the river, like Anumar, who was looking for Sita in Sri Lanka, first met Sita.

### Will Karu Jayasuriya be suitable as an Interim President?

It is no longer a secret that a progressive section of the Buddhist clergy (Sangha) and Tamil parties (for example the Global Tamil Forum) have met in Europe and North America and worked out a “Road Map” to put an end to repetitive riots and pogroms that have despoiled this country since Independence. Leaders SWRD, JR, Ranil, Premadasa and Mahinda, all of them, have racist blood on their hands. DS took away the citizenship of Upcountry Tamils but I don’t think he instigated race riots. Overall this is a sad commentary on our so-called national leaders.

### Horana Plantations and WNPS PLANT building an ambitious nine km Forest Corridor

Horana Plantations and WNPS PLANT have just announced the launch of an exciting new conservation initiative in the hill country which hopes to build a nine-kilometer-long forest corridor along the Maskeliya Oya, creating 55 hectares of new forest in the process.

Agricultural expansion and intensive settlement pressures over years have resulted in many parts of the beautiful Maskeliya Oya having lost its natural tree cover on either bank. The Oya flows down from the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary for over 40 kilometers to become one of the major tributaries of the powerful Kelani River. The lack of forest cover on either side has also contributed to erosion, floods, and numerous other issues.

### Spotlight On SCOTUS In The US. People Give The Finger In Pakistan

In the US, Former President Donald Trump is facing multiple indictments, involving numerous charges, in multiple courts. Perhaps no American before him, let alone a former President, has been simultaneously implicated in so many litigations. At the same time, even as he is mired in a myriad of trials, Donald Trump has also put on trial the entire American political system.

The spotlight is now on SCOTUS, the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court has come under compulsion to make two consequential rulings – one on the disqualification of Trump by the State of Colorado to be a presidential candidate in 2024, on account of his involvement in the insurrection in Washington, on 6 January 2020, to prevent US Congress’s certification of the November 2019 presidential election results; and the other to deal with Trump’s claim to immunity from being indicted for criminal conduct in trying to prevent the same certification process.

### Hopes AKD makes positive statements on his tour and bring investors to country

He hopes that National People's Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) makes positive statements regarding his visit to India and understands the need of investors in Sri Lanka, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

Addressing the media, he said that whoever had invited AKD to India, had done a good thing.

"AKD might have gained a vast amount of experience over the need for investors in our country from any country in the world, including India. After experiencing the development of India's energy sectors, I don't think that AKD would get a chance to chase away the investors who are coming to the country.

"AKD dressed according to the European dress code, ignoring his traditional dress. I don't think his trade unions understand how he behaves," he said.

It is very common to see political parties visit India every month, but this is the first time that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is in India, he said.

### Critical Atlantic Ocean current system showing early signs of collapse - report

A crucial system of ocean currents may already be on course to collapse, according to a new report, with alarming implications for sea level rise and global weather — leading temperatures to plunge dramatically in some regions and rise in others.

Using exceptionally complex and expensive computing systems, scientists found a new way to detect an early warning signal for the collapse of these currents, according to the study published Friday in the journal Science Advances. And as the planet warms, there are already indications it is heading in this direction.

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (the AMOC) — of which the Gulf Stream is part — works like a giant global conveyor belt, taking warm water from the tropics toward the far North Atlantic, where the water cools, becomes saltier and sinks deep into the ocean, before spreading southward.

### This is not the identity of Jaffna: Those who are responsible for the mistakes should be held - Anganan Show

Mixed criticism of the Hariharan Live in Concert and Star Night held at the Jaffna Idawn Ground yesterday has been observed in Sri Lanka, India and abroad.

Although the concerts are being held in Jaffna and the investments through which it is welcome, there should be no flexibility to look at when organizing the events.

Many people refer to the unusual state of the event that the abnormal condition at yesterday's event is controlled if proper planning is done.

Various controversies, such as the announcements of the show, the chaos caused by the tickets, the events made at the end of the event, the grounds, and the security defects are indicated as factors of yesterday's confusion.

On the other hand, some people also criticize people who have visited the event.. It is a systematic politics to turn the errors of some of them on the entire Jaffna people.

### Hikes, Marathons, Eco-trails

*2024-02-10 17:00:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/hikes-marathons-eco-trails/) · `en`

I got interested in the subject I write about today since Aravinda, who is a frequent Man Friday to me tackling all sorts of help jobs including cell phone manipulation, went on a hike from Hatton to Ohiya along jungle trails. He climbs Adams Peak out of season and along the Kuruwita climb which is the most arduous.

Hike is defined as distance walking for exercise or pleasure. Eco trails can, I presume, be termed nature walks. Googling these were two definitions I got: “Eco trails are long distance, way marked hiking and cycling routes” which “aim to build a sustainable ecological community of travellers with local tourism and cultural bodies and local commerce.” All types of walks are gaining popularity as people become more health conscious, but eco trails particularly are popularized in tourist countries noted for their ecological variety like Sri Lanka

### AKD in New Delhi: Some thoughts about the ‘Indian policy’ of a progressive government

Senior Lecturer, Department of Legal Studies, Open University of Sri Lanka

The recent visit of a delegation from the National People’s Power (NPP), led by Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, to India has sparked an intriguing discussion within our political circles. While some parties have seized upon this opportunity to mock the JVP, recalling their anti-Indian stance in the 1980s, others have raised concerns about the potential dangers of yielding to Indian regional hegemony. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that the invitation extended by the Indian government to an NPP delegation for discussions signifies a significant turning point. The NPP, with only three members in Parliament, was until very recently perceived as a marginal political party.

Imprisoned former prime minister of Pakistan Imran Khan was granted bail on Saturday by an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in relation to 12 cases involving the attacks on military installations on May 9.

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party founder Khan was granted bail by ATC Judge Malik Ejaz Asif after he paid a surety bond of Rs 0.1 million in all 12 cases, including the attack on the Army Museum and General Headquarters (Pakistan Army), according to The Express Tribune Pakistan.

The court ruled that since all of the accused in the cases from May 9 were free on bond, there was no reason to keep Khan, 71, under arrest.

### Unraveling The Complexity Of Racism, A Global Perspective – Patali & Modi

*2024-02-10 15:23:07* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/unraveling-the-complexity-of-racism-a-global-perspective-patali-modi/) · `en`

Racism, an age-old societal ill, has embedded itself in various corners of the world, manifesting in different forms and shades. It is a divisive force that no enlightened individual would willingly embrace. Unfortunately, racists exist in every society, often driven by a misguided belief that aligning with discriminatory ideologies is a means of survival.

A recent encounter with a photograph featuring Patali Champika Ranawaka and India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, sparked reflections on the accusation of racism. Criticisms arose, labeling both individuals as racists, but the context within which these allegations emerged unveils a nuanced reality.

Modi’s leadership in India has faced scrutiny, particularly concerning its impact on different ethnic and religious communities. While some may argue that his actions indicate racism, others assert that it stems from a sense of Nationalism. It is crucial to discern the thin line between nationalistic pride and discriminatory practices.

### Growth in Sri Lanka’s official remittances slows to 16-month low

ECONOMYNEXT – Growth in Sri Lanka’s remittances coming through official channels slowed to a 16-month low in January after it showed more than 80 percent following the central bank’s improved exchange rate policy.

The year-on-year remittance growth was 11.4 percent in January, the central bank data showed.

Sri Lanka saw less than the January growth in monthly remittances in September 2022 when it showed a gain of 1.7 percent. Since then Sri Lanka witnessed a booming remittance growth.

In January 2024, remittances went up to $487.6 million from $437.5 million in the same month a year earlier.

The remittances, Sri Lanka’s top foreign exchange earner, dropped to less than $250 million a month in early 2022 when the island nation’s economy saw a parallel exchange rate amid booming hawala and undiyal measures which foreign workers switched to send money at a higher exchange rate.

The remittances jumped 57 percent to its four-year high of $5.97 billion in 2023, from $3.8 billion a year earlier.
