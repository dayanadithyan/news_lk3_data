Fashion, as one of the world’s most enduring industries, has undergone a remarkable transformation, largely fuelled by the fourth industrial revolution. Its contribution to the global gross domestic product remains substantial.

Yet, in the fiercely competitive realm of branded fashion, the key to success lies in how consumers perceive a product. Traditional marketing practices have given way to digital strategies, with SMIs taking centre stage in delivering brand messages and cultivating customer loyalty. This is further underscored by world trends on social media usage.

Sri Lankan authorities continue to silence and repress families of victims and their communities 15 years after the armed conflict ended – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Says UN Human Rights Council engagement remains vital to ensure justice for atrocity crimes

The Human Rights Watch said on Monday that the Sri Lankan Government’s proposed law to create another body to investigate war-time abuses replicates previous failed efforts, ignores the needs of victims, and falls far short of meeting Sri Lanka’s international legal obligations.

Sri Lankan authorities continue to silence and repress families of victims and their communities 15 years after the armed conflict ended.

Despite the anger spat with hatred in most uncivilised language in social media platforms, how the voter selects candidates for preference voting does not change at elections – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

On last poya holiday, the first full moon this new year 2024, I was woken up pretty early in the morning by the tinkle of a WhatsApp message on my mobile phone. One from an expatriate Sinhala-Buddhist patriot, an old-time pal of mine. It was a hurried short message. His excitement and joy no less ingrained. “Macho, Good news for all…did you hear it? That mad thug from Puttalam had died in an accident on Katunayake Expressway… Just past midnight” read his message.

In fact, AKD is providing a theoretical framework and practical direction to realise the aspirations of a new generation of voters that rose in revolt with an aragalaya demanding “system change” and “No 225”. RW, who stood to benefit from that revolt, betrayed that generation by ending the aragalaya with brute force, and is now taking all precautions to protect himself and the old order he represents through repressive legislations such as, the PTA and OSB

### 76 Years of Independence - Looking Back in Retrospect - EDITORIAL

*2024-01-31 01:19:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/76-Years-of-Independence-Looking-Back-in-Retrospect-EDITORIAL/172-276017) · `en`

Sunday, 4th February will mark 76 years since our country gained independence from the British. Unlike India and Pakistan, we Lankans did not suffer a bloody struggle to free ourselves from direct colonial rule. Whether this was good is debatable.

For one, we Lankans’ did not unite as men and women of one country to overthrow the yoke of imperialism. To this day we remain Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and Burgher first. Being Sri Lankan often takes second place to our individual race, creed and religion.

Most times we lose sight of the fact that the Veddah community (Lankan aborigines) are in fact the original citizens of our motherland.

But there are many things we as citizens of Lanka can be proud of.

We gave the world its first female Prime Minister. But, according to the World Economic Forum, Sri Lanka ranks 55th in the world when it comes to the gender equality gap and 30th in political participation. Today in a Parliament of 225 members, only 23 are female!

### Sanath Nishantha and the Cheapness of Politics in Our Times

*2024-01-31 01:15:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Sanath-Nishantha-and-the-Cheapness-of-Politics-in-Our-Times/172-276016) · `en`

State Minister Sanath Nishantha Perera, at his death, upsurged another bout of deep political polarization in the country - a trait he personified in his political life. Some quarters in social media celebrated his death. “What a great day to wake up to…” said one poster in the Sri Lankan X (formerly Twitter). Fake news and doctored imagery amplified that rancour: A photo widely shared on social media platforms was revealed as an old imagery of the public in Borella celebrating the resignation of Nishantha’s political patron, Mahinda Rajapaksa, in 2022.

Public anger at the system can obscure a bigger picture of an assortment of defects that led to the economic and political decay of the country. Subpar individuals in politics are only part of the problem; the bigger malady is the destructive economic and social policies their governments followed to keep their constituencies satiated for the time being.

“A man who has been through bitter experiences and traveled far enjoys even his sufferings after a time.” ~Homer – Odyssey

No US President, former or incumbent, has suffered the humiliation that Donald Trump, the 47th President of the United States of America, is going through now. As per Associated Press report dated May 9, 2023, ‘A jury, consisting of six men and three women, found Donald Trump liable on Tuesday (May 9) for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5 million in a judgment that could haunt the former president as he campaigns to regain the White House’. It was further reported thus: The verdict was split: ‘Jurors rejected Carroll’s claim that she was raped, finding Trump responsible for a lesser degree of sexual abuse. The judgment adds to Trump’s legal woes and offers vindication to Carroll, whose allegations had been mocked and dismissed by Trump for years’.

### Are Hasaranga and Theekshana Sri Lanka’s Greatest Ever Spin Twins?

*2024-01-30 21:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Are-Hasaranga-and-Theekshana-Sri-Lankas-Greatest-Ever-Spin-Twins/108-275995) · `en`

Jan. 30 (Daily Mirror) - Muttiah Muralitharan has earned the right to be called the greatest spinner of all-times. Some Aussies might not agree with that statement, but statistically, no one even gets close to the magician spinner, and should English fast bowler James Anderson retire from Test cricket before turning 50, there is a good chance that the famous 800 remains iconic.

Muralitharan was a member of Sri Lanka Word Cup winning team in 1996. The off-spinner was also part of the national team which finished runners-up in 2007, 2009 and 2011. During his illustrious career, it’s fair to say he shouldered Sri Lankan cricket; particularly the bowling department.

Perhaps that would have been one of the reasons why he didn’t have a spin twin for a longer period of time. After Muralitharan, the best spinner Sri Lanka has produced, would be left arm spinner Rangana Hearth, but for some reason these two didn’t play together for many games.

The letter, which addresses crucial matters pertaining to the establishment of professorial units and student training, has been called into question for its authenticity and content accuracy.

“The letter is not done by students. Based on content, certain words and technical details, it is obvious that prominent individuals in the SLMC and few academics who wish the students to be sent to other faculties have done this to sabotage the measures taken by the Ministry of Health and Higher Education Authorities to resolve the issue. Further, some content in the letter is not factually correct," stated concerned sources familiar with the situation.

Somalia, Jan 30 (BBC) -  Indian naval forces have rescued 19 Pakistani sailors after their fishing vessel was hijacked by pirates off Somalia's coast.

This was the second rescue operation in 36 hours by Indian warship INS Sumitra.

Hours earlier, the ship had rescued the 17-member Iranian crew of a vessel which was also hijacked by pirates, the navy said.

India's navy has responded to several distress calls from vessels and sailors over the past few weeks.

Recent attacks on vessels off Somalia's coast have triggered concerns that pirates could be becoming active again in the region.

INS Sumitra has been deployed for maritime security operations along the east coast of Somalia and Gulf of Aden.

A navy statement said that the ship had responded to a distress message on 28 January and intercepted an Iranian-flagged vessel. Naval officers then "coerce[d] the pirates for safe release of crew along with the boat", according to a post on X (formerly Twitter).
