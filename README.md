In 1990, when I was the Acting Director of the School of Hotel Management at Schiller International University (SIU) and a doctoral student at the University of Surrey in the UK, my schedule was packed. One day, my boss, Dr. Richard Taylor, the Director of the London Campus of SIU, called me to his office.

‚ÄúChandi,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI know you teach a full load of four courses to our MA and BBA students in the Hotel Management programs. We have an Associate Business Administration (ABA) program in International Tourism Management at another campus. To establish a clear pathway for those ABA students to join the BBA program in their third year, I would like you to become familiar with this program, its students, curricula, and campus.

### Biden celebrates July 4 amid doubts about his political future

Justice Sotomayor on SC Ruling on Presidential Immunity: With fear for our democracy, I dissent

President Biden had a dismal debate night on Thursday, June 28. There is absolutely no gainsaying that fact. However rose-tinted the glasses we may wear, Biden did no favors to his chances of re-election in November. Highly respected journals like the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune, joined with this lowly columnist, an ardent supporter of the Democratic cause and a virulent Never Trumper, in sending a message, immediately after the debate, to the 81-year-old incumbent president to drop out of the fray, for the greater good of the nation.

In fact, polls after the debate found that 72% of all voters did not want Biden running in November. Also, many of the mega donors of the Democratic Party are insisting that the party replaces Biden with a younger, more electable candidate ‚Äì or else.

### Navigating ourselves out

*2024-07-07 01:21:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/navigating-ourselves-out/) ¬∑ `en`

This may be cynical posturing on my part, but recent announcements about Sri Lanka‚Äôs debt restructuring process reeks of a somewhat widespread tendency to credit everything to the political leadership at the cost of the suffering many. Legitimate concerns have been raised about whether Sri Lanka could have negotiated better; the debt haircut Ghana settled for, to give one example, is miles away from Sri Lanka‚Äôs figure. The extent of our haircut leaves us with very little breathing space. To stick to it, we need to engage in savage austerity, or more of what we have been inflicting on ourselves for the last two years.

### Lanka‚Äôs defense cooperation with India: Strengthening ties or strategic dependence?

*2024-07-07 01:21:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/lankas-defense-cooperation-with-india-strengthening-ties-or-strategic-dependence/) ¬∑ `en`

Exposing a large segment of your military officers to the thinking and training of a foreign power, especially one so near, can have significant consequences.

Defense cooperation between Sri Lanka and India is growing. This is significant as India‚Äôs defense engagements with other countries in the region, such as the Maldives, for example, are reducing. This is a strategic move on India‚Äôs part to strengthen its influence in the Indian Ocean island at a time when the Chinese presence in the region has grown manifold.

By providing specialized training and military aid, India aims to foster a closer relationship with Sri Lanka, akin to the historical precedent set by the United States through its military aid programs with developing countries since 1880.

### Anita Desai ‚Äì Indian Novelist

I caught the infection of admiring almost anything Indian from my eldest brother ‚Äì kind and pacifist like Gandhi; superb gentleman like Jawaharlal Nehru. His most prized possession was an autographed copy of  Discovery of India, given him by Nehru himself when he visited Ceylon in 1957 in celebration of the Buddha Jayanti. A cherished memory of his was seeing newly wed Nayantara, daughter of Vijayalakshmi Pandit, leave by train in the Delhi station with husband Sahgal on their honeymoon.

They were surrounded by family. And what was Aiya doing over there? Intrepidly he had taken Mother on pilgrimage to Gaya and other places, all by himself in 1949, when pilgrimages were rare and fraught with risks.

### On the verge of manhood

Seniors‚Äô ragging of ‚Äòfreshers‚Äô was rampant on the Peradeniya campus. Marcus Fernando Hall, where I was a fresher, was notorious for ragging. A gang of nasty seniors woke us up at 4 am and forced us to crawl naked around the hall pond, pretending to be reptiles looking for water. Some seniors were lenient and wanted to have a good time with freshers. They asked us to sing, dance, or write letters promising to marry off sisters to their lordships ‚Äì seniors. Once, I wrote a long letter promising to marry off my only sister to a senior. (I had only three brothers). He read the letter, thanked me for my generosity, and asked whether my sister was pretty. When I hesitated to reply, he told me he was uninterested in my sister.

In a recent interview, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Dr Nandalal Weerasinghe addressed misconceptions regarding Sri Lanka‚Äôs total debt, clarifying that the increase from USD 96 billion in December 2023 to a projected USD 100 billion by March 2024 is largely due to exchange rate fluctuations rather than new borrowing.

Joining an interview held at the Presidential Media Centre on Friday (05), the CBSL Governor said that despite a detailed explanation of this made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament recently, some have mistakenly interpreted the rise as an increase from USD 70 billion to USD 100 billion.

Commenting in this regard, Dr. Weerasinghe added: ‚ÄúThe status of the debt as of March 2024 was outlined in the Debt Bulletin you referenced. The entire loan amount is denominated in US dollars, totaling USD 100 billion. As you know, our country manages both domestic and foreign debts, with foreign loans typically in dollars.

### Explanation of the relief received

*2024-07-06 10:47:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/198530) ¬∑ `si`

Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Central Bank Governor of Sri Lanka, discussed the relief offered by bilateral debt restructurings, emphasizing that such relief is extended universally to all countries facing similar situations. He highlighted two main forms of relief: extending the repayment period and reducing interest rates, both aimed at easing the debt burden. Weerasinghe also addressed criticisms about unfair loan comparisons between countries, stating that the focus should be on each country's unique circumstances rather than direct comparisons. He clarified that the goal of seeking such relief is not to favor one country over another but to manage national debt effectively and ensure economic stability.

üü©

Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe says that the relief provided by bilateral debt borrowers has been given the relief to Sri Lanka.

He was speaking at an interview to educate the restructuring of debt.

The Central Bank Governor further explained that comparing Sri Lanka is not a right to provide credit relief to various countries.

"There are several ways to provide credit relief when it comes to agree with bilateral creditors. If you have to pay in 10 years, the basic debt, get paid 20 in 20 if you bought $ 100. In fact, the 100 rupees will be borrowed today and will be able to pay for 10 years in 10 years.. One is the relief. Bilateral borrowers give this process to all countries by extending the time to pay the debt. "

"The second relief is like 2% more than 3%, 4%, 5%, 5%, 6%. Decreases time to reduce interest rates. When the two adds, our debt is a significant amount of value. The end result, which is 30% less than 30%. "

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs remittances coming through official channels gained 11.4 percent to $3.14 billion in the first six months of 2024 compared to the same period last year, helped by more expatriates using the official banking channels.

The remittances in June were $519.6 million, 9.2 percent up from the same month last year, the official data showed.

The remittances have risen continuously after the central bank gave up a parallel exchange rate regime, which compelled most expatriates to switch informal Undiyal and Hawala money transfer methods.

The island nation witnessed a 57 percent jump in remittances coming through formal banking channels to $5.97 billion in 2023, from $3.8 billion a year earlier, helped by elimination of parallel exchange rate.

The island nation has been in the process of sending more migrant workers to bring in higher foreign exchange since the country declared bankruptcy in 2022.

This was made known during the course of a speech made by the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Faizal Salieh, at a seminar centred on ‚ÄòUnlocking Opportunities through Sustainable Bonds: Towards a Greener Economy‚Äô.

The event had been organized by the SEC, The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at Shangri-La Colombo on July 3.

‚ÄúThe challenge is how quickly can Sri Lanka socialize these bonds and attract ESG conscious foreign investors, whilst being mindful of Sri Lanka‚Äôs default sovereign rating hurdle. We also need to build an ESG conscious local investor base,‚Äù he said.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe's regime, facing criticism for its handling of Sri Lanka's economic crisis, has secured international debt relief totaling $580 million. Despite initial praise from key nations like the US, Japan, India, and the IMF, there's concern over transparency and equal treatment of all creditors, especially China. The government's strategy includes delaying bilateral loan repayments until 2028 and extending the repayment period until 2043. However, the public reception remains mixed, with no immediate economic benefits seen by ordinary citizens. The cost of living continues to rise, and despite promises to maintain social spending, actual reductions have occurred. The government's shift towards privatizing education has also sparked protests, highlighting broader discontent with the administration's economic policies and lack of engagement with public concerns.

### The government's democratic violations cannot continue - Professor GL Peiris

*2024-07-06 01:18:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187791) ¬∑ `ta`

He mentions a petition filed by the United People's Power against these delays, highlighting the impact on the people's right to vote.

The situation is seen as undemocratic, with concerns over human rights violations if the presidential election isn't held promptly. The case will be heard by a five-judge panel, emphasizing the importance of upholding citizens' rights under the constitution. The government's use of funds for election activities instead of development projects is also criticized, along with allegations of the ruling party abusing its majority and governors acting on party lines rather than representing the people.
