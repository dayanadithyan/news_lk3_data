### Why not meet the media?Prime Minister Narendra Modi

*2024-05-18 02:48:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183829) ¬∑ `ta`

Prime Minister Narendra Modi avoids media due to perceived bias and self-interest among journalists, preferring direct communication. He criticizes the current media landscape as lacking neutrality, contrasting it with the "faceless" media of the past. This stance reflects a shift towards a more controlled political culture, where the media's role is questioned. Political observers suggest this move could indicate uncertainty about electoral outcomes.

üü©

'' The media is currently not to work with neutrality. So there is no media meeting, ‚ÄùPrime Minister Narendra Modi explained.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi who interviewed a private television channel.. ': Why not hold a press conference for ten years in charge of the regime? ‚Äù

Currently journalists are identified with their own self -interest. The media is not neutral.

The media that needs to work neutral is not doing so today. That is why the press conference was not held.

Previously the media was faceless. Who writes?What is its policy?No one was worried about it before. The situation is not the case today.

A new political culture that focuses on the media is not worried about the activities of politics.

I have no confidence in going on this path. I can also cut the ribbon at Vigyan Bhavan. I am traveling for a small project in a small district in Jharkhand, though.

I have come up with a new job culture. Do you agree with it?Don't want?The media must decide. ‚Äù

üü©

War is not a victory, it is the failure of the country or the humanity. The 30 -year war has only made losses. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has urged the people of the country to express love instead of hatred.

The 30 -year war ended 15 years on Saturday 18th. This is the first time that a special media report was published.

War is not a victory, it is a major defeat to the country or mankind.. In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, mothers lost their children. Similarly the children lost their parents.

We have divided the Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims on the basis of ethnicity. I lost my eyes because of this war.Al many losses. Today, we will share love instead of hatred in the day, remembering the end of the final war.

Today we will pledge to sorry instead of revenge, to establish God instead of the demons and to transmit comfort to each other.

The first was the technology for converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia by the Haber / Bosch process. This technology tapped the abundant (72%) atmospheric nitrogen to link with hydrogen to produce ammonia, which was further processed to produce Ammonium Sulphate and Urea fertilizers.

The second was the production of Calcium Superphosphate. The earliest sources of fertilizer phosphate were guano and bone meal.

Prediction of the results of the forthcoming Presidential election would be the most difficult one in Sri Lankan history, since almost all traditional attachments of the voters with the main political parties seem to have been shattered to the core by the economic crisis that brought millions of people to the streets in 2022.

The unprecedented economic hardships within their household and the agitations with slogans on the streets against all present and past rulers of the country for nearly four months seem to have shaped a new political mindset among the majority of people in the country.

The impact of these two factors ‚Äì the economic hardships and the Aragalaya ‚Äì has been such that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the party that bagged 52.25 percent of votes has been ranked at the bottom of some poll surveys since mid-last year, with not even 10 percent of voter preferences in favour of them.

Media reports inform us that many MPs across the political divide have secured liquor permits in the names of their friends and relatives. These permits we all know will subsequently be sold for huge sums of money.

According to one report, the going price per permit is around rupees fifty million. The permit is for the establishment of new liquor shops in the country.

The peace of a nation does not lie on the pulpit of the United Nations or any other international body. The long-term stability and sustainability of a country which has paid the price in blood for peace can only come, when like Japan, one revitalises the entire nation, in every sphere, from education to recreation, to sharpen a mind towards a peaceful and holistic mindset. One that is devoid of Mohaya (which can be interpreted as false pride or illusion) or Dweshaya (anger/spite). Such a nation will not have to face the consequences of these base qualities which is Dukkha

Recognising that any political structure thriving on division and unrest is a maniacal terror

When the Indian cricket board is considering abolishing the tossing of the coin in local matches, the scientist has expressed his views on how the coin would be advantageous to the well-deserving higher ranking teams only.

"As we approach the end of the regular IPL season, all the teams in contention are vying for the first two spots (seed 1 and seed 2), and for good reason, since they get ‚Äútwo bites at the cherry‚Äù! However, what is the advantage of finishing first (as opposed to second)? NONE!! And, for that matter, there is no advantage in finishing third as opposed to fourth."

‚ÄúUntil they become conscious, they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled, they cannot become conscious.‚Äù

This is a review (perhaps imprecise) of the anthology ‚ÄúInterventions‚Äù ‚Äì Selected Political Writings of Dayan Jayatilleka edited by Uditha Devapriya and Uthpala Wijesuriya with a forward by Kamaya Jayatissa, published by Neptune.

I say imprecise, because I wrote this review before reading the entirety of this collection of writings by Dayan J. When reading this missive I hope you will understand why I hurried to pen this review before digesting it in its whole.

Dayan Jayatilleka as a public intellectual has been rediscovered by two millennial opinion journalists ‚Äì the type who seek the narrative that‚Äôs alternative to that of the mainstream.

I must declare my interest. I know Dayan since 1968 as the son of Mervyn De Silva who was my Editor at Ceylon Daily News. Mervyn was my friend and a mentor of sorts.

### What must Sri Lanka do to avoid a second default in the near future?

*2024-05-17 20:19:41* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-must-Sri-Lanka-do-to-avoid-a-second-default-in-the-near-future/4-761921) ¬∑ `en`

A second default by Sri Lanka could be more devastating than Sri Lanka‚Äôs first default in 2022

Past evidence shows that most countries that default on their external debt, have a history of defaulting once again within the next 10 years. Going by this data, there is a probability that Sri Lanka can default once again.

A second default by Sri Lanka could be more devastating than Sri Lanka‚Äôs first default in 2022. In case of a second default Sri Lanka will have to go once again to the lender of last resort, the International Monetary Fund as a bankrupt nation. The conditions by the IMF if we default the second time will be much harsher and rightly so. The bilateral creditors and bondholders will also not be as kind if Sri Lanka goes for a second default. With harsher terms by the IMF, bilateral creditors and bondholders, Sri Lanka if it defaults again will have very little space to breathe.

### 2024 presidential election

*2024-05-17 20:18:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183818) ¬∑ `ta`

The 2024 presidential election in Sri Lanka follows a five-year term, amendable only by a two-thirds parliamentary majority. Candidates must be citizens, over 30 but not older than twice the age limit. Voting requires registration. For multi-candidate elections, a simple majority wins; otherwise, preferences are considered. The new president appoints a PM and Cabinet, aiming for a parliamentary majority. Challenges include ensuring a stable government amidst calls for abolishing the executive presidency due to concerns over corruption and misuse of power.

üü©

The Constitution says that a president elected by the people will be in power for a five -year term. If he dies, if he resigns or fired from office. Any amendment that can be brought to extend the presidential term in the Constitution is passed by two -thirds of the majority of the votes in Parliament and the recognition of the people in a conference.

The constitution also states that the presidential election should be held within a period of less than a month before the end of the term of office in power and not two months.

Any citizen who has qualifications to take over the presidency can be a recognized political party as a candidate for the presidential election. Otherwise, a member of the Member of Parliament or the already Member of Parliament can be nominated by any other political party or any voter who is named in the voter turnout.

This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission," it said.
