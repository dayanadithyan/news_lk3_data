Colombo, May 19 - ¬†The Sri Lanka All Union Alliance of the Board of Investment (BOI) has issued a stark warning against the proposed Economic Transformation Act, set to be submitted to Parliament on May 22.

The alliance cautions that the Act will severely destabilize the investment sector, which is already grappling with economic challenges.

According to the coalition, the Act caters to a select few individuals without consulting field experts or investors. This could prompt the departure of existing investors, further jeopardizing the sector.

The alliance calls for a transparent revision of the Act, involving affected parties and economic experts.

While proponents claim the act will drive significant economic transformation, the alliance argues that its true aim is to secure financial gains by transferring 15 profitable investment zones under BOI control to private associates before upcoming elections.

### Frog species endemic to Sri Lanka rediscovered in India after 200 years

*2024-05-19 11:28:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99310/frog-species-endemic-to-sri-lanka-rediscovered-in-india-after-200-years) ¬∑ `en`

Researchers from the Zoological Survey of India, in partnership with the Andhra Pradesh Biodiversity Board, rediscovered the Sri Lankan golden-backed frog (Hylarana gracilis) after two centuries in the Koundinya wildlife sanctuary in the Chittoor district, the southernmost point of the Eastern Ghats in Andhra Pradesh. With this finding, the number of freshwater frog species in India rises to 20.

Bharath Bhupathi from the Zoological Survey of India, Hyderabad, encountered frogs of this species near a pond in the forest and suspected that it could be a new species. However, after consulting taxonomic experts and utilising morphological and DNA barcoding tools, the species was confirmed to be the Sri Lankan golden-backed frog Hylarana gracilis.

Mr. Bhupathi emphasizes that rediscovery is more significant than the discovery of a new species, as it provides evidence for the historic land bridge between India and Sri Lanka.

### SLT-MOBITEL reports marginal growth in Q1 2024 amidst cost optimization efforts

SLT-MOBITEL has reported a flat growth in Q1 2024 ending March 31, 2024, amidst a challenging business environment. However, the company‚Äôs proactive cost management initiatives have resulted in significant operational cost savings, enabling it to maintain profitability.

For the quarter, the SLT Group has recorded consolidated revenue of LKR 26.93 billion, reflecting a marginal 1.4% year-on-year increase.

However, compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year, i.e., Q4 2023, there was a modest increase of 3.7% in revenue, driven by enterprise and broadband revenues.

The Company has successfully implemented cost-saving measures, resulting in a decrease of 0.6% in operational expenditure (excluding depreciation and amortization) compared to Q1 2023. This was partly due to the decrease in dollar-denominated expenses such as Annual Maintenance Cost (AMC), international settlement, and internet backbone charges due to the rupee appreciation.

Since Ranil Wickremesinghe is the incumbent president, priority is being  given to him. However  after this series is concluded, I do intend writing about other presidential aspirants and their election campaigns also in the future.

### Thousands of Tamils Converge at Mullivaaikkaal On Mullaitheevu district coast  to remember  their Kith and Kin were killed 15 years ago in the Final phase of the war in May 2009

Thousands of Tamils on May 18 converged in Mullaivaikkal, along Sri Lanka‚Äôs north-eastern coast, to pay homage to their relatives killed in May 2009, in the final battle of the island‚Äôs protracted civil war.

As the war escalated before its gruesome end, lakhs of Tamil civilians were pushed to this narrow strip of land, declared a ‚ÄòNo Fire Zone‚Äô by the government. Tens of thousands, including women and children, died in the indiscriminate shelling of the armed forces, while scores were seriously injured.

Families gathered at the venue on Saturday and placed photographs of their loved ones in the sandy ground near the sea, offered prayers with flowers, food, and by lighting lamps. Antony Jesurathnam Mariapushparani, a Mullaitivu resident, has vivid images from May 18, fifteen years ago.

### Is s it too much to allow the North and the East to remember lives of their loved ones felled in the conflict as much as the Sinhala-South remembers their fallen soldiers?

*2024-05-19 00:54:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84064) ¬∑ `en`

If the Sri Lankan State tried with all its might and main to look ridiculous in the eyes of the world, it could not do better than the preposterous performance of law enforcement agencies in the North and East during the formal remembrance of those who died during the ending of Sri Lanka‚Äôs decades-old ethnic conflict on May 18th each year.

Fifteen years after that inexpressibly sad phrase of the country‚Äôs turbulent history with images of emaciated men, women and children of the Wanni emerging out of the blood soaked sands of Mullivaikkal with haunted eyes, we have state agents performing miserable antics that only play into global anti-Sri Lanka propaganda machines with gusto. This is the result of police panjandrums acting to the directive of an Inspector General of Police whose record stands in abrupt contrast even when compared to his less than perfect immediate predecessors and his patron, the Minister of Public Security whose own record is no better.

### Diana  Gamage‚Äôs  speech, body language and behaviour in parliament often outdid unruly behaviour usually associated with bullies and thugs.

*2024-05-19 00:36:00* ¬∑ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84062) ¬∑ `en`

It‚Äôs high time Diana Gamage took a hard look at herself in the mirror!

When the Supreme Court ruled in favour of petitioner Oshala Herath, that Diana Gamage is not a citizen of Sri Lanka, she told a media conference that she does not accept the ruling. She also went on to say that the ruling wronged all Sri Lankan women.

Her foray into parliament was through the Samagi Jana Balawegaya as one of their national list candidates. But she lost no time in switching loyalities, when she broke ranks to vote in favour of then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa‚Äôs 20th amendment to the Constitution.

Since then she has been at logger heads with the SJB, never losing an opportunity to browbeat their members during parliamentary debates. Despite switching party loyalties, Gotabaya did not return the favour, but current president Ranil Wikcremasinghe did, when he appointed her State Minister for Tourism.

Many journalists develop what may be called the grasshopper mind. In their work it is necessary to hop from one subject to another. If at the end of their lives they have little to show for their pains, they may have bitter sweet memories stored up squirrel-wise of unusual people and events.

There is of course, a certain vanity in being able to say, ‚ÄúOh yes, I knew Mahatma Gandhi‚Äù or I saw Bradman making his first century at Lords.‚Äù Such a display of self-esteem may even provoke the reaction if unexpressed, ‚ÄúSo what.‚Äù There is no reason why anyone else should be interested. But not always. If we have a hero or a favourite, we like to listen to someone who has met and talked with him.

So Browning‚Äôs ‚Äì Ah, did you once see Shelley plain, And did he stop and speak to you And did he speak to you again? How strange it seems and new. I recall a sentimental journey made with a friend in search of the house near La Spezia to which Shelley‚Äôs body was brought after the drowning.
