At least one suspected attacker was found dead in the front yard of a barricaded home after a standoff that lasted three hours, police said.

It is one of the deadliest assaults on US law enforcement in decades.

The officers were part of a US Marshals Service-led task force who were attempting to serve a warrant on Monday against a felon wanted for illegally possessing a firearm when gunfire erupted on the suburban street.

The officers returned fire at an assailant in the front yard, then more shots were fired at them from inside the home, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Johnny Jennings told a news conference. A high-powered rifle was found inside the property, he added.

"Today we lost some heroes who were out simply trying to keep our community safe," the police chief told reporters.

### Parties should publicize their election manifestos well in advance: PAFFREL

Colombo, April 29 (Daily Mirror) - The political parties should publicize their election manifestos well in advance of any election, be it a Presidential or Parliamentary poll, to create a better and responsible political culture in the country, the Peoples' Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) said.

What is actually happening in Sri Lanka right now is that the political parties present their policy statements merely a month or so in advance of an election. Thus, the public will get no chance to build a fruitful discussion on them, the polls observer said.

Executive Director PAFFREL Rohana Hettiarachchi made these remarks while addressing a programme held in Colombo to raise awareness on creating a responsible political culture by encouraging political parties to present responsible and timely policy statements.

### 2019 Easter Sunday tragedy: National Peace Council says intl. role in ascertaining truth remains relevant

The National Peace Council (NPC) in a statement said yesterday that the international role in ascertaining the truth of the 2019 Easter Sunday tragedy remains relevant even today.

On April 21, the country marked the fifth anniversary of the tragic Easter Sunday bombing that claimed the lives of approximately 300 persons and left more than 500 others injured and maimed. The enduring consequences of the Easter Sunday bombing need to be kept in mind. The economic repercussions, stemming from the decline in foreign investments and tourism, continue to haunt the country, contributing to the economic challenges faced today. The National Peace Council is particularly concerned that the erosion of trust in Government leadership, exacerbated by perceived failures in accountability and transparency, remains a pressing concern for all citizens. Unfortunately, this leads to frustration and loss of faith in the system, which can also lead to further injustices.

### A call to end  ‘Corporal Punishment’  and create a fear-free childhood

*2024-04-30 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/A-call-to-end-Corporal-Punishment-and-create-a-fear-free-childhood/172-281587) · `en`

School and home are the places where children spend most of the time of the day; hence corporal punishment should be absent in both places and they should feel safe in such environments

Research unequivocally shows that corporal punishment is linked to adverse outcomes, including increased aggression, poorer mental health, and diminished cognitive development, which could result in long-term psychological issues and social dysfunctions, ultimately contributing to a cycle of violence that affects the broader society and future generations

A study on the perceptions of Sri Lankan parents on the use of corporal punishment (2012) found that 74 per cent of parents resort to corporal punishment

The alternatives are rooted in communication, understanding, and mutual respect

Corporal punishment affects over 1.3 billion children worldwide and is the most common form of child abuse globally and in Sri Lanka, where complaints of cruelty against children have increased by three-fold in the past ten years.    As the world celebrates and respective governments pledge to do more to abolish a heinous crime against children on International Day to End Corporal Punishment on April 30th, neither the Government of Sri Lanka nor the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), the most powerful institution maintained by public funds to protect and promote children’s rights is recognizing the only day dedicated to a specific type of child abuse.

What are the proposed legal reforms to ban corporal punishment?

### Early Buddhism’s links with urbanisation and commerce

When land-based feudalism replaced urbanism and trade, Buddhism waned in India, says Indian scholar Balkrishna Govind Gokhale

In sixth century BC, Buddhism thrived in the Gangetic Plain in North India due to urbanisation and the development of trade. According to the renowned scholar of Buddhism in India, Balkrishna Govind Gokhale, Buddhism began to decline in India when urbanisation and trade yielded place to feudalism.

In his paper in the Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies (Vol Number 2, 1982, University of Wisconsin Madison), Gokhale says that the use of iron tools, beginning from the seventh century BC, increased agricultural productivity, which in turn led to larger commodity surpluses, which became available for exchange through trade.

Fahmy Nazick will be seen in action at the Anchorman’s 20th Anniversary Gala Dinner Dance, on 31st, May, in Canada, and he is eagerly looking forward to entertaining the large crowd expected with his style of music.

Says Fahmy: “Lots of events are taking place but not my style of music. I have nothing against oriental music but that seems to be the trend now.

“In fact, Binara, from Binara and the Clan, reached out to me recently and is keen to organise a dance and have me doing all my style of music because he says that some of the audience may not even know what western music is like.

Fahmy is a classy singer whose style of singing covers the Elvis Presley/Jim Reeves era.

*2024-04-29 22:53:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/redeemersbig-scene-this-year-as-well/) · `en`

### May Day, May Day! Collective Rights versus Individual Rights

*2024-04-29 22:45:07* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/May-Day-May-Day-Collective-Rights-versus-Individual-Rights/14-761173) · `en`

Weakening labour rights and a race to the bottom is never a recipe for inclusive, equitable and sustainable development

When employers are permitted to collectively represent their interests, it is an implicit acknowledgement that there is unity in strength. If so, why should workers, weakly placed in the labour contract, evidenced by the fact that they do not earn a living wage, currently in a poverty trap and earning poverty wages, be curtailed from union representation? The few unions in the apparel sector do have to change their officer constituency and make them more representative of their workers. We are aware that unions need change, but that does not mean we throw the baby out with the bathwater

### A working peoples’ pledge on May Day 2024

Following is a statement by UNITE – (a coalition of trade unions and mass movements) on May Day, pledging to fight against the inequalities which exist amongst us, and forging a struggle against the neoliberal State and international world order, which dispossess the working people

On 4 May 1886, workers in Chicago staged a protest in the Haymarket Square, fighting for an eight-hour workday. Workers withstood brutal attacks by the police and sacrificed their lives and bodies to make the eight-hour workday a reality. All of us in Sri Lanka enjoy an eight-hour work day, which became one of our fundamental rights as working people as a result of the struggles and sacrifices of our predecessors. Today, we have come full circle where our Government and employers are drafting a new labour law shredding sanctified labour rights, including the eight-hour workday, under the guise of a single Employment Act.

Today, I stand at the intersection of corporate leadership and social responsibility, deeply reflecting on the vital role we play in shaping a society that cherishes and protects its most vulnerable members—our children. Today, 30 April, is the International Day to End Corporal Punishment and I invite you to join me on a journey of reflection, action and commitment towards eradicating this deep-rooted societal ill.

A study on the perceptions of Sri Lankan parents on the use of corporal punishment (2012) found that 74% of parents resort to corporal punishment and believed it to be a necessary means of disciplining children. Meanwhile, a National Child Protection Authority (2017) study on disciplinary methods practiced in Sri Lankan schools found that 8 out of 10 students have experienced at least one episode of corporal punishment in the school setting.

### What’s Ranil’s secret?

*2024-04-29 22:39:25* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-s-Ranil-s-secret/4-761169) · `en`

Out of all the Lankan politicians, the most baffling case for me is Ranil Wickremesinghe. I mean, what leadership theory can explain his behaviour? What management theory can predict his actions? How can the same man ruin his party beyond repair and still become the president of a country? Who would even believe this stuff? It simply doesn’t add up, which makes it an interesting topic for research. Let’s try to analyse this anomaly, this outlier.

Well, for starters, Ranil is one tough cookie. The man knows how to survive in the treacherous hellhole of politics. He’ll climb over dead bodies or lie under dead bodies, depending on the situation, just to live another day. I mean, think about all the UNP leaders who died along the way. But Ranil survived. Maybe that’s it. The whole of RW phenomena can be defined with just that simple explanation. But I think it’s more complicated than that.
