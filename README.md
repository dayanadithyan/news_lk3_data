### Ottawa mass killing suspect not seeking bail, says lawyer

OTTAWA - The 19-year-old Sri Lankan national charged in the mass killing of a newcomer family in Ottawa has no plan to seek bail, his lawyer says.

Febrio De-Zoysa was arrested and charged in early March with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder, after police found the family dead in a townhouse in the suburb of Barrhaven.

He remains in custody, and his lawyer Ewan Lyttle told The Canadian Press ‚Äúthere is presently no plan to apply for bail.‚Äù

De-Zoysa, who was studying in Canada as an international student, is set to return to court next week where lawyers expect to set dates for a preliminary inquiry in his case.

Investigators allege the young man is responsible for the deaths of 35-year-old Darshani Ekanayake and her four children, who were between the ages of two months and seven years old, as well as a family friend.

They believe the family was attacked with a knife or ‚Äúother edged weapon.‚Äù

### Oil steadies after surge following reported Israeli attack on Iran

Oil slipped on Friday after prices spiked earlier on reports that Israel had attacked Iran as market fears of a major escalation to hostilities in the Mideast appeared to ease.

After the benchmark contracts jumped more than $3 in the session, Brent futures were down 46 cents, or 0.5%, at $86.65 a barrel by 1015 GMT. The most active U.S. West Texas Intermediate contract was down 34 cents, or 0.4%, to $82.39.

Israel launched an attack on Iranian soil on Friday, sources told Reuters. Iranian media reported explosions, but an Iranian official told Reuters those were caused by air defence systems. State media said three drones over the central city of Isfahan had been shot down.

Tehran played down the incident and indicated it had no plans for retaliation - a response that appeared gauged towards averting region-wide war.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged Asian Central Banks to not follow the Fed too closely.

IMF Director of the Asia and Pacific Department Krishna Srinivasan this week recommended Asian Central Banks to focus on domestic inflation and avoid making their positive decisions overly dependent on anticipated moves by the Federal Reserve.

‚Äú If central banks follow the Fed too closely, they could undermine price stability in their own countries,‚Äù Srinivasan said, addressing a press briefing on Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and Pacific.

IMF staff analysis shows that U.S. interest rates have a strong and immediate impact on Asian financial conditions and exchange rates. The Fund noted that expectations about Fed easing have fluctuated in recent months, driven by factors that are unrelated to Asian price stability needs.

Sri Lanka has a deeply flawed non-floating ad hoc soft-peg arrangement found in all defaulting IMF advised countries, with inconsistent policies where external and domestic anchors conflict, critics have pointed out.

In May 2023, after the central bank collected 666 million dollars amid panic sales by market participants when inconsistent peg was allowed to appreciate to 295 to the US dollar from 321 in April, the rupee came under pressure in the following two months.

As the inconsistencies of the deadly flexible exchange rate clash, the rupee is quoted wide, spot trading disappears, moral suasion comes in and the spot next and one week market becomes active.
