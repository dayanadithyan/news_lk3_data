### Ramadan begins in Gaza with hunger worsening and no end to the war in sight

Palestinians began fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Monday with cease-fire talks at a standstill, hunger worsening across the Gaza Strip and no end in sight to the war between Israel and Hamas.

Prayers were held outside amid the rubble of demolished buildings. Fairy lights and decorations were hung in packed tent camps, and a video from a U.N.-school-turned-shelter showed children dancing and spraying foam in celebration as a man sang into a loudspeaker.

But there was little to celebrate after five months of war that has killed over 30,000 Palestinians and left much of Gaza in ruins. Families would ordinarily break the daily sunrise-to-sundown fast with holiday feasts, but even where food is available, there is little beyond canned goods, and the prices are too high for many.

“You don’t see anyone with joy in their eyes,” said Sabah al-Hendi, who was shopping for food Sunday in the southernmost city of Rafah. “Every family is sad. Every family has a martyr.”

Colombo, March 11 (Daily Mirror) - In response to recent findings published in the British medical journal, The Lancet, concerning child malnutrition and underweight girls, Sri Lanka's health authorities have rejected the content referred to the portrayal of Sri Lanka.

According to the study, approximately 410,000 girls in Sri Lanka are categorized as underweight, representing a prevalence of 16.4%. Despite efforts and initiatives aimed at improving nutrition and healthcare access, the report claims no detectable change in this distressing statistic since 1990.

The Lancet publication, which covers data from 1990 to 2022 and was released on February 29, also ranked Sri Lanka second globally, trailing only behind India, for the highest prevalence of dangerously underweight girls aged 5 to 19 years.

The analysis estimates that nearly 880 million adults and 159 million children lived with obesity in 2022.
