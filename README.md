According to sources, Kodituwakku has filed the motion concerning the writ petition filed by him against the decision by the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) to reject the party registration application submitted by the front.

In his motion, Nagananda maintains that the registration of the NPP, a part of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) as a political party contravenes the law. According to him, it is against the law to register offshoots of the same party as separate political parties and it violates constitutional rights which assures a free and fair election.

### Plans to ship human ashes, drink container to Moon spark legal debate

*2024-02-06 23:30:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97065/plans-to-ship-human-ashes-drink-container-to-moon-spark-legal-debate) · `en`

An array of unconventional, privately funded plans to exploit the moon, including as a site for human ashes and sports-drink containers, has gathered steam in recent years as NASA pushes to make Earth’s natural satellite more accessible.

Concerns about possible gaps in U.S. oversight and legal questions about proper use of the moon have rocketed to the forefront.

Landers built by private companies and emerging space powers are expected in the next few years to join the U.S. flag and other vestiges of past programs to the moon. Other initiatives could include using the moon as a site for capsules of human remains, advertising sports drinks, and maybe even a two-story-tall Christian cross made of the moon’s own dirt.

“We’re just at the beginning of exploring the moon, and ... we need to be careful we’re not contaminating it - not just with biological and chemical contamination but with litter,” said Leslie Tennen, an attorney practicing international space law.

Colombo (News 1st) – Donald Trump’s hopes of avoiding a trial over alleged attempts to falsify the results of the 2020 presidential election that he lost, were dealt a serious blow on Tuesday (6th) when a Federal Court of Appeal handed down a scathing ruling that the former president does not have presidential immunity for such actions, U.S. media reported.

The federal appeals court in the District of Columbia, the nation’s capital, said his immunity claims would reject "the most fundamental check on executive power."

In addition, they said that Trump's stance "would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the President beyond the reach of all three Branches."

The all-female 3-judge bench also gave Trump very little time to appeal to the highest court in the land, with a deadline of next Monday (12th) to approach the Supreme Court to suspend their ruling. Trump’s attorneys said they would appeal.

### Tech horizons: Expanding markets via Singapore and India

India has rapidly emerged as an economic giant and a technology hub in the past two decades, while Singapore has solidified its position as a regional hub for businesses. Fortunately, Sri Lanka finds itself in close proximity to India and not far from Singapore. Yet, the key lies in leveraging these two economic powerhouses for enhanced collaboration to attract business, investments, and crucially, for market access.

Should Sri Lanka cultivate stronger ties with these hubs, as it stands to position itself as a crucial point in the value chain? Beyond considerations of South Asia and Southeast Asia, looking at the broader Asia Pacific region underscores the significance of partnering with Australia. However, the geographical distance may pose challenges.

### Thermal power generation increased to 57%: CEB Engineers’ Union

Colombo, Feb 06 (Daily Mirror) -  With the advent of dry weather conditions and insufficient rainfall in hydro catchment areas, thermal power generation has risen to 57 percent, leading to a reduction in hydropower generation, the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers' Union (CEBEU) said.

CEBEU President Saumya Kumarawadu told the Daily Mirror that hydropower generation was initially at full capacity, reaching 100 percent. However, with the commencement of dry weather conditions, the generation has now decreased to 87 percent.

Accordingly, thermal power generation accounted for 56.7 percent, with 45 percent of this generated through the use of fuel, while the remaining power generation was attributed to furnace oil.

Additionally, the Lakvijaya Power Station, commonly referred to as the Noracholai Power Station, plays a crucial role in contributing to Sri Lanka's overall electricity production, generating a substantial 900 MW.

A motion was filed before the Supreme Court today (Feb.06) challenging the registration of the National People’s Power (NPP) by the Election Commission.

Vinivida Foundation’s secretary Attorney-at-Law Nagananda Kodituwakku has put forward the motion pertaining to a petition filed against the Election Commission’s decision to reject the registration of ‘Vinivida Foundation’ as a political party.

Kodituwakku claims that the registration of NPP, which is part of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), as a political party is completely against the law.

Pursuant to Article 103(2) of the Constitution, registering different branches of one party as separate political parties is in violation of the election laws, he alleges.

It also violates the right to free and fair elections guaranteed by the Constitution, Kodituwakku pointed out further, seeking permission from the Supreme Court to make submissions in this regard.

Political leaders lacked wisdom to bring about an all-embracing national revival, but a Sinhala Buddhist revival

To consider what the future holds for Sri Lanka, a glance at its past and present should prove useful as we could thereby contextualise and perhaps begin to understand what that likely future could be. Unless we look at our past mistakes dispassionately, attempt to learn from them and take meaningful steps to re-chart our national course, we are most likely to continue to allow history to repeat itself.

### The allegation that has been passed by the Ceremony Building Bill in violation of the High Court ruling is baseless!- Speaker's Office

*2024-02-06 22:04:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175745) · `ta`

According to the Supreme Court's decision. Since the legislative process of Parliament is jointly accompanied by the Attorney General's Department and the Department of Law, there is no chance of acting in contrast to the High Court's decision on the Bill or in violation of the Constitution.

The Speaker's Office's dissatisfaction is that it is worrying that even those who are familiar with the legal system and the constitution are negatively speaking to the existence of the Supreme Court.

Any Member of Parliament is invited to discuss all the documents and actions regarding the implementation of the Ceremony Act and consult intellectual authorities on the issue.

It is not a beneficial tactic to dismantle the legislation or undermine its credibility. The Speaker's Office wants to remind all members that the overall assessment in the democratic system is based on the collective functioning of all parts, including legalization.

### Donald Trump does not have presidential immunity, US court rules

Donald Trump does not have presidential immunity and can be prosecuted on charges of plotting to overturn the 2020 election, a US court has ruled.

Mr Trump had claimed in the landmark legal case that he was immune from criminal charges for acts he said fell within his duties as president.

But Tuesday’s ruling in Washington DC struck down that claim.

It is a setback for Mr Trump who has for years cited presidential immunity while battling multiple cases.

The former president is expected to appeal against the ruling, meaning the case could ultimately go to the Supreme Court where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority.

US Special Counsel Jack Smith has charged Mr Trump, 77, with conspiring to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election and committing fraud to stay in office.

The trial in that case was initially scheduled for 4 March, but was postponed pending a ruling on the immunity claim.

It could be delayed for weeks, if not months, if the case ends up before the Supreme Court.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Egypt’s president on Tuesday as part of a 48-hour, four-nation flurry of shuttle diplomacy in search of a ceasefire in Gaza’s war, while Israel pressed its onslaught in the south of the enclave.

Israel said its forces had killed dozens of Palestinian gunmen throughout Gaza in the past 24 hours with fighting focused on Khan Younis in the south, with a threatened assault looming on a nearby border town teeming with displaced people.

Blinken arrived in Egypt after a stop in Saudi Arabia, and then departed for Qatar, for meetings with the main countries acting as mediators in the Gaza war. Palestinians hope the U.S. top diplomat’s Middle East swing will nail down a ceasefire before Israeli forces storm Gaza’s southern fringes where over a million displaced people are sheltering.
