බංග්ලාදේශයේ අන්තර්වාර පාලනයක් ස්ථාපිත කරන බව එරට හමුදාපතිවරයා පවසා ඇති බව ජාත්‍යන්තර මාධ්‍ය වාර්තා කරයි.

ඒ එරට අගමැතිනී, ෂෙයික් හසීනා සිය ධුරයෙන් ඉවත්වී ඉන්දියාවට පළායාම හේතුවෙනි.

හමුදාපති ජෙනරාල් වෙකර් උස් - සමාන් පවසන්නේ, විරෝධතා පවත්වන සිසුන් දැන් සිය නිවෙස් වෙත යා යුතු බවය.

මාධ්‍ය වාර්තා සඳහන් කරන්නේ හසීනා සහ ඇයගේ සහෝදරිය රැගත් හෙලිකොප්ටර් යානය ඉන්දියාවේ අගාර්තාලා නගරය වෙත ළඟා වූ බවයි.

1971 බංග්ලාදේශ නිදහස් සටනට එක්වූ යුද විරුවන්ගේ ඥාතීන්ට රජයේ රැකියාවලින් 30%ක් දීමට හසීනා රජය සැරසීමත් සමගම ඊට එරෙහිව ශිෂ්‍යයින් උද්ඝෝෂණ ඇරඹීය.

එම උද්ඝෝෂණ පාලනයට රජය බලය පාවිච්චි කළ අතර ඉන් විශාල පිරිසක් මරණයට පත්විය.

අනතුරුව එරට තුළ උද්ඝෝෂණ අඩු වුවද පසුගිය සතියේ උද්ඝෝෂණ නැවතත් ආරම්භ වූයේ දේශපාලන මුහුණුවරකිනි.

ඊයේ බංග්ලාදේශය පුරා නැවත දැනුම්දෙන තුරු ඇඳිරි නීතිය පැනවූ අතර නමුත් විරෝධතාකරුවන් එය නොසලකා හරිමින් ඩකා අගනුවරට එක්රැස් විය.

උද්ඝෝෂකයින් පැමිණීමට පෙර අගමැතිවරිය එම ස්ථානයෙන් ඉවත් කිරීමට ආරක්ෂක අංශ සමත්විය.

### Come September!

*2024-08-05 10:58:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/come-september/) · `en`

Of all the presidential contenders for the September 21 election, Ranil Wickremesinghe might be the only one who would have seen and possibly remember the 1961 movie “Come September,” a popular lighthearted comedy that starred Rock Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida. Come September – it will be for Sri Lankan voters as it is now confirmed that they will have their chance to vote and elect their next president on Saturday, September 21. A countdown of 49 days starting on Sunday, August 4.

The US presidential election, the campaign for which has been going on forever, is scheduled for November 5, the canonical Tuesday after the first Monday of November. To continue where I left last week, Kamala Harris is till riding high, and Donald Trump is finally being exposed for his crass limitations. But with 94 days to go there is plenty of time left for twists and turns, and ups and downs.

### Monster assembled from human flaws? Frankenstein would make a Trump

*2024-08-05 10:57:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/monster-assembled-from-human-flaws-frankenstein-would-make-a-trump/) · `en`

Someone asked “Why do some British people not like Donald Trump?” Nate White, an articulate and witty writer from England wrote the following response:A few things spring to mind. Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace – all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.

So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump’s limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.

Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing – not once, ever.

I don’t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility – for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.

The ruling party has lost a majority due to the split within the Sri Lanka PA.

There are more than one hundred MPs in support of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, and before that, nearly twenty -twenty MPs supported the government.

However, due to the split in the PA in the PA, there is a high chance of sitting in opposition to a group of Namal Rajapaksa.

As the majority of the ruling party has been challenged, many ministers are in the opinion of the Sri Lanka PA, and if the opposition is sitting in the opposition, the minister will leave the responsibilities.

### Child’s Guide To Debt & Debt Restructuring – Part V

Aseni and Sarath Mahatthaya are continuing their interactive conversation on debt and debt restructuring. They have concluded that a country should borrow from foreign sources – savings made by people in other countries by curtailing their consumption – to finance the high investments which cannot be met through inadequate domestic savings. In the case of Sri Lanka, the savings made by the private sector have been reduced by dissaving made by the Government by consuming more than the revenue. That latter dissaving had been about 1% of GDP in the post-independence period and about 7% of GDP in the recent years.
