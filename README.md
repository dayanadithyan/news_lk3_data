(Dallas) - Bangladesh emerged victorious from a gripping encounter with Sri Lanka in Texas with the two-wicket victory getting them off to a winning start in Group D of the T20 World Cup.

Rishad Hossain produced a brilliant spell of leg-spin as Bangladesh fought back to restrict Sri Lanka to 124-9.

Then Liton Das (36) and Towhid Hridoy (40 from 20 balls) put Bangladesh in command before some excellent pace bowling from Nuwan Thushara (4-18), in his second spell threatened a late twist in the plot.

But veteran Mahmudullah Riyad showed all his experience at the end to see Bangladesh over the line with an unbeaten 16.

It was the final of four games at the Grand Prairie Stadium and the Dallas crowd have been treated to some top entertainment on a surface which offered some bounce and produced good contests between bat and ball.

Anders' son Greg confirmed that his father was flying the small plane, and that his body was recovered on Friday afternoon.

"The family is devastated. He was a great pilot. He will be missed," a statement from the family reads.

Anders - who was a lunar module pilot on the Apollo 8 mission - took the iconic Earthrise photograph, one of the most memorable and inspirational images of Earth from space.

Anders later described it as his most significant contribution to the space programme.

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Two-time Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs less-than-expected win at the India‚Äôs parliamentary election may not change its foreign policy towards Sri Lanka, but aggressive push for connectivity and infrastructure projects in the island nation could be slowed, analysts say.

Broader coalition National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 293 seats in the 543-member lower house of parliament, where 272 constitutes a simple majority.

However, Modi‚Äôs BJP won only 240, less than outright majority, making two regional parties‚Äô leaders kingmakers in the alliance with their 28 seats in total.

India has been pushing for land, oil, gas, and power grid connectivity in Sri Lanka along with securing lucrative renewable energy and port projects in partnership with Indian private sector.

### The government should stop issuing liquor permits in public places

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa criticizes the government for issuing liquor licenses in non-tourist areas, arguing it contradicts national development goals. Religious leaders, civilians, and civil organizations also oppose these permits, especially near schools. The government is urged to cancel such permits and halt political bribery related to alcohol distribution, focusing instead on appropriate locations near the tourism industry.

üü©

The government distributed liquor license is against the policy of creating an inadequate nation. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said that permission has been granted within the villages that are not carried out in the tourism industry.

The government has rapidly launched a plan to issue a liquor license in the past. This is against the principle of creating an inadequate nation. Providing these facilities focusing on the tourism industry is part of the tourism industry, but permits have been granted within the villages that are not carried out.

Other religious leaders, civilians and civil organizations have expressed their opposition to this.. Therefore, if these permits are issued in areas where the tourism industry is not carried out in areas where the schools are adjacent to the schools, the government should take steps to cancel the liquor permits issued in the absence.

### Sri Lanka May 2024 remittances rise 13.5-pct to $544mn

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs remittances coming through official channels gained 13.5 percent to $544.4 million in May 2024 compared to the same month last year, helped by more expatriates using the official banking channels.

The remittances in the first five months were $2,624.4 million, 11.8 percent up from the same period last year, the official data showed.

The remittances have risen continuously after the central bank gave up a parallel exchange rate regime, which compelled most expatriates to switch informal Undiyal and Hawala money transfer methos.

The island nation witnessed a 57 percent jump in remittances coming through formal banking channels to $5.97 billion in 2023, from $3.8 billion a year earlier, helped by elimination of parallel exchange rate.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs external sector has now recovered after the central bank started to run balance of payments surpluses following a decision to end money printing to sterilize interventions made with Indian Asian Clearing Union money.

### Presidential election: Good and bad foreign meddling

The US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung meeting the officials of the Election Commission

What a big fuss would have been made by the embassies of Western countries had the Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Qi Zhenhong met with the members of the Election Commission (EC), as American Ambassador Julie Chung and several other Western diplomats had done recently?

Also, can we at least imagine a meeting between the Sri Lankan or Indian Ambassador to the United States and the election officials of the US, including those of the Federal Election Commission (FEC), to discuss the forthcoming US Presidential election? Answers to these questions would explain the world order that had been imposed by the West on others.

### The right to strike and motivated strikes

*2024-06-08 00:00:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-right-to-strike-and-motivated-strikes/172-284353) ¬∑ `en`

For over the past 35 days, the non-academic staff of government universities in the country has been on strike. There is no doubt that the working class of this country is burdened with low salaries. In some instances, workers‚Äô wages were reduced during the economic melt-down.

On June 6 the Locomotive Operating Engineers‚Äô Union of Sri Lanka Railways suddenly decided to go on strike. The trade union action according to the Union is being carried out over delays in second-class promotions of locomotive drivers and several other issues.

With the present cost of living far beyond the reach of a majority of workers, something needs to be done to correct the situation. Yet the country too is going through unprecedentedly bad economic times.

While most of the demands of the strikers are understandable, what the public find¬† difficult to agree with is the manner in which these strikes are called. Trade union action most always, inconveniences the public.

### Change is good: Provided it is for better and not for worse

People‚Äôs aspiration and hope for a change was short lived and short changed, widening the mistrust between policy makers and electorate further

One fact remains as an acceptable analogy; which is, those who cannot cope with change will never be able to initiate change in any circumstances. This applies to all stakeholders including those who caused and contributed to the current crisis. Fair share of responsibilities fall on to the electorate who got carried away with populism engineered by few; with an ultimate aim of state and regulatory capture for their advantage leaving the country into a dire state grappling with debt. Therefore, capacity and capability to initiate that essential change is absent in the DNA of politicians who deceived their constituents

Sri Lankan Buddhists are spoiled for choice these days. Depending on where your faith lies and what tugs at your heart, it seems you can choose the flavour of Theravada Buddhism that suits you best: from the traditional temple Buddhism of the great sects of Kandy to the radical orthopraxy of ascetic Buddhism in remote forest monasteries, and from the devotional Buddhism of Mahamevna to the contrarian, eclectic mix of teachings at Umandawa, the variety can be dazzling‚Äîso much so that one could be excused for thinking that this lack of homogeneity is a sign of decay.

### How Argentina‚Äôs once great economy was destroyed? Lessons for Sri Lanka

Argentina‚Äôs exemplary economic success took a wrong turn from 1946 when Juan Peron became president and he implemented economic policies to make Argentina self-sufficient

As Argentina was the fifth largest economy in the world in the early 1900s, Sri Lanka was one of the best economies in Asia and was referred to as the Switzerland of Asia. Sri Lanka‚Äôs downfall too was due to looking into import substitution starting in the mid 1950s. Sri Lanka went into a disastrous overdrive towards import substitution and self-sufficiency starting in 1970 which led to goods shortages and high prices and an economic crisis. Sri Lanka opened its economy in 1977. But the Sri Lankan economy has not remained fully open since then and many of the tough reforms were not done when Sri Lanka opened its economy leading to many lost economic opportunities for the country

The President said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre deliberating whether the TRC should wield judicial authority or if a separate court should be empowered based on TRC recommendations.

Colombo, June 07 (Daily Mirror) - Despite the Railways Department announcing that services could be restored by this afternoon due to the ongoing strike, nearly 100 train services were cancelled today leaving commuters in disarray.

The strike which began at midnight last night was launched by the Sri Lanka Railways Locomotive Operating Engineers‚Äô Union in response to issues regarding the promotion of locomotive drivers and continuous delays in recruitment.

The ongoing strike caused significant disruptions, especially for commuters returning home in the afternoon, including many office workers.

While trains arrived in Colombo from all railway lines this morning, many services were halted in the afternoon, leaving passengers stranded and inconvenienced.
