### Some ministers seem determined to promote immorality through Diana Gamage’s programs

*2024-05-12 22:13:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Some-ministers-seem-determined-to-promote-immorality-through-Diana-Gamages-programs/108-282426) · `en`

Colombo, May 12 (Daily Mirror) - It is clear that some Ministers seem determined to promote immorality and erode morality by perpetuating the illegal and immoral programmes initiated by former State Minister Diana Gamage, Venerable Omalpe Sobitha Thera said.

Addressing the media, the thera said that Diana Gamage does not seem to have done anything for the country.

"The only thing that was done was that she raised her voice about the promotion of ganja and the promotion of immorality," he said.

The conspiratorial act she tried to do by developing immorality in the country, destroying morals and showing the illusion of economic development has now stopped due to the court decision. But some Ministers want to continue those programmes, he added.

According to the court decision, the role of Diana Gama has been rejected. That character does not suit social leadership at all. Finally, since she is not a Sri Lankan, she has no right to engage in politics in this country, the thera said.

### Economic growth, national security, and what next for Sri Lanka

Economic growth and national security are complementary to each other

When States fail to observe the Rule of Law and maintain the Law and Order, markets will start disintegrating themselves leading to a collapse of the same. Collapsed markets will stunt economic growth and stunted growth, as we have explained earlier, will reduce national security. Consequently, the resources spent on national security is not a waste but an essential cost to ensure the smooth operation of all the needed economic activities. Hence, no nation should compromise the national security on the ground of saving resources. It will cause the nations to sacrifice all their gains on all the economic fronts

The desperation in western capitals is more than palpable. The looming defeat in Ukraine – the fulcrum of Washington’s strategy to dominate Eurasia – has all but sealed the fate of the Neo-Conservatives’ Project for the New American Century to bring about a virtually endless global US domination. The rise of China, a resurgent Russia and the emerging BRICS are trashing NeoCon Francis Y. Fukuyama’s absurd ahistorical notion. Following the collapse of the USSR, he imagined an irrational hegemony of almost endless universal capitalist Liberal-Democracy, centred in the US, as the epitome of human political evolution in his “The End of History and the Last Man”.

### Former President Rajapaksa calls for postponing sale of national assets and SOEs

### Does the bashil take the hand on the hand?

*2024-05-12 17:55:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183322) · `ta`

Basil Rajapaksa, a key political figure, is known for his strategic maneuvers in Sri Lankan politics. Despite facing criticism and legal issues, he has demonstrated a knack for turning enemies into allies and vice versa, showcasing his ability to navigate the complex world of politics. His role in the unexpected appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister in 2018, despite opposition, highlights his skill in political maneuvering. Basil is currently working to rebuild the PA party and aims to return the Rajapaksa family to power, employing various strategies to influence political outcomes. His approach to politics, characterized by efficiency and tact, serves as a lesson for other politicians.

🟩

Rajapaksa is one of the politicians who think of the finger of the sand and the rope.

This claim may not have agreement to many. It must be acknowledged that he has the ability to exceed any other politician in his politics and life or not.

This is not a praise for Bashil. Lesson that other politicians should learn in politics. In the 2015 presidential election, the defeat of the Rajapakse family is attributed to the autocraticity of the family. Such criticisms were openly presented.

Rajapaksa also had a significant share in Bashil. He is the one who left the hospital bed, not going to jail, although there are many corruption and fraud.

After the defeat of Mahinda, he created the PA and developed it in the next few years.

If the PA is strong in Sinhala politics today, Mahinda's leadership is not the only reason, but also Basil's efficient and tactfulness.

He is the one who can do anything for politics and power to make enemies a friend and an enemy of friends.
