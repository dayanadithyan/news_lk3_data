The Sri Lanka Plantation Association opposes a 70% salary hike for tea and rubber workers, citing concerns over productivity and global competitiveness. They plan to challenge this decision in court, arguing that such increases could harm the industry's viability and negatively impact Sri Lanka's position in the global tea market.

🟩

The Sri Lanka Plantation Association (PA) said that there is no choice but to oppose the decision of the Paying Council to increase the salaries of tea and rubber industrial workers by 70% without any extent.

The Federation said that the resolution would not be accepted and that the appeal would be appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.

The salary increase should be closely connected to the productivity of the businessmen to maintain the livelihood of workers' livelihoods. The Sri Lanka Plantation Employers Federation (PA) has urged.

In all the countries where tea produces, Sri Lanka already has the most expensive production, the largest nomination and the lowest productivity.. In particular, the wages board of the newly announced tea industry has noted that the salaries of workers in the newly announced tea sector will have an impact on the production of Sri Lankan tea in the world market as they are more than double the salaries of workers in India.
