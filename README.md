### Intended messages and their interpretation

*2024-02-26 12:40:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/intended-messages-and-their-interpretation/) · `en`

It is common for short clips of statements by public figures, often taken out of context, to go viral

Few things on social media go as viral as short clips of statements by public figures, often taken out of context. In platforms designed to capitalise on our shrinking attention spans, users rarely have the time or patience for context. Even if some may wish to trace a circulating video clip to its original, longer video source, it would have likely gone viral by then, prompting journalists to play catch up, although we may not report on it.

While it is hard to pin motivations based on short clips, the instant reactions they trigger can be interesting and telling. Among other things, they show us how an intended message and its interpretation can be very different while consumed on social media. A case in point is a remark made by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Mumbai, last month.

### Bangladesh court halts wild elephant adoption

Dhaka, Feb 26 (AFP) - A Bangladeshi court on Sunday barred the adoption of elephants from the wild, a move hailed by animal rights activists as a "landmark" order to help stop cruelty.

Rights groups said the high court order suspending licences will stop the torture of captive Asian elephants in the name of training.

"The high court today suspended all licences for the captive rearing of elephants," said Amit Das Gupta, deputy attorney general of the country.

Bangladesh was once one of the major homes for Asian elephants.

But poaching and habitat loss saw their number dwindle so much that they are now declared critically endangered in the South Asian country.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says there are nearly 100 captive Asian elephants in Bangladesh, nearly half the amount of elephants left in the wild in the country.

As logging and farming encroach on elephant territory, young animals are captured in the country's northern and southeastern hills.

### Sri Lanka central bank salary hikes show lack of accountability for its actions

*2024-02-26 08:17:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-salary-hikes-show-lack-of-accountability-for-its-actions-152064/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – The steep salary hikes of Sri Lanka’s central bank after the inflation the agency itself created, has drawn public and legislators’ ire, but the deeper problem is that it is yet another sign of the lack of accountability in the new monetary law.

Some legislators are upset that the Parliament’s control of public finances has been usurped by the ‘independent’ central bank.

But Sri Lanka’s central bank has a history of topping up pensions also to cover for inflation  – whether low or high  – while giving low interest loans for staff.

This is questionable because unlike other SOEs, the central bank itself is responsible for cutting rates and driving up inflation and interest rates to stabilize the currency after blowing a hole in the balance of payments.

The practice of transferring billions to defined-benefit pension staff funds when inflation and interest rates are down, can perhaps be excused as a reward for not triggering monetary instability.
