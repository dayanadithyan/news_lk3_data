### Icon of the Seas: World’s largest cruise ship sets sail

*2024-01-28 08:26:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96783/icon-of-the-seas-worlds-largest-cruise-ship-sets-sail) · `en`

(Reuters) - The world’s largest cruise ship is set for its maiden voyage on Saturday, but environmental groups are concerned that the liquefied natural gas-powered vessel - and other giant cruise liners to follow - will leak harmful methane into the atmosphere.

Royal Caribbean International’s Icon of the Seas sets sail from Miami with capacity for 8,000 passengers across 20 decks, taking advantage of the surging popularity of cruises.

The ship is built to run on liquefied natural gas (LNG), which burns more cleanly than traditional marine fuel but poses greater risks for methane emissions. Environmental groups say methane leakage from the ship’s engines is an unacceptable risk to the climate because of its short-term harmful effects.

“It’s a step in the wrong direction,” said Bryan Comer, director of the Marine Program at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), an environmental policy think tank.

Miami, Jan 28 (BBC) - The world's largest cruise ship has set sail from Miami, Florida, on its maiden voyage, amid concerns about the vessel's methane emissions.

The 365m-long (1,197 ft) Icon of the Seas has 20 decks and can house a maximum of 7,600 passengers. It is owned by Royal Caribbean Group.

The vessel is going on a seven-day island-hopping voyage in the tropics.

But environmentalists warn that the liquefied natural gas-powered ship will leak harmful methane into the air.

"It's a step in the wrong direction," Bryan Comer, director of the Marine Programme at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.

"We would estimate that using LNG as a marine fuel emits over 120% more life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than marine gas oil," he said.

Earlier this week, the ICCT released a report, arguing that methane emissions from LNG-fuelled ships were higher than current regulations assumed.

### ICJ Ruling On Israeli Genocide In Gaza; Stopped Short Of Ordering A Ceasefire

On Friday 26 January 2024, the International Court of Justice, ICJ,  United Nation’s highest judicial organ, ordered Israel to take steps to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza, but stopped short of ordering a ceasefire.

This ruling was not something unexpected as the  ICJ, based in the Dutch city of Hague, was established by US, British, European imperial powers to serve their interests.Thus one cannot expect ICJ to issue a verdict against Israel-a settler colonial entity planted by US European imperialism in the heart of Middle East to destabilize the region.

### Sri Lanka hoping to reach agreement ‘within couple of months’ on restructuring $13bn debt

Sri Lanka is aiming to negotiate a debt restructuring with holders of its defaulted US dollar bonds within “a couple of months”, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) told the Financial Times, despite complaints by private creditors that they are being left in the dark.

Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe further mentioned that Sri Lanka needs to reach an agreement “within a couple of months” on restructuring the USD 13bn of debt, but he went on to dismiss worries that negotiations have become bogged down, the Financial Times reported.

“There’s a lot of interest from private creditors to finish this as soon as possible. But because of the procedure it takes a certain time . . . We also want to do that fast,” the CBSL governor has said.

He noted that Sri Lanka must “ensure whatever proposals we have exchanged are consistent with the [IMF’s] debt sustainability analysis and also comparable [with] we have been discussing with other creditors. That’s a bit of a complicated process.”

ECONOMYNEXT – Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando has met the heads of the armed forces and the police to discuss tourism projects.

The forces will contribute to adding many new experiences to the tourism business, a statement by the Department of Government Information said after the meeting on Friday (26).

These include the police ensuring the safety of tourists, the air force increasing domestic flights within the island, developing marine tourism with the participation of the navy, and initiating a life-saving programme with the participation of the army.

Sri Lanka is eagerly focused on promoting tourism, a key foreign exchange source for the country, but lacks critical infrastructure and faces much red tape. However, the government has adopted an all hands on deck approach since of late.

Although surrounded by the sea, the island neither has a domestic yatch culture, nor yacht based tourism activities like liveaboard diving cruises.

### The turbulent brilliance of “Gia,” world’s first supermodel

From stardom to shadows, glamour, grit, and a runway tragedy

It was the year 2019 and it was one of my habits to visit the local library near my hometown here in Canada whenever I got a chance because, it was one of the quieter places in the city. I remember entering its empty hallways wondering when might have been the last time that someone may have set foot in there because for some reason, though I always felt welcome, there was always a sense of cold and emptiness around the place; as if it has accepted its fate of being unrealized and unnoticed.

During one of my visits, I was intrigued by a title of a book named “Thing of Beauty”, which at first seemed like a romance or some sort of a coming-of-age novel. But I was quite taken aback after carefully going through its faded brown pages with a taped back hardcover realizing it was a biography of “Gia Marie Carangi”, who was once dubbed one the most unstoppable forces in the fashion industry during the late ‘70s and early ‘80’s.

### Buddhists in Ancient Egypt?

*2024-01-27 16:35:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/buddhists-in-ancient-egypt/) · `en`

Researchers have discovered a two-foot-tall Buddha statue in Berenike, an ancient Egyptian port city on the Red Sea. The artifact is the first Buddha ever found west of Afghanistan, according to the New York Times Review of Books’ William Dalrymple. Made from Mediterranean marble, it provides new evidence of trade between ancient Rome and India.

Based on stylistic details, the researchers think it was made in Alexandria around the second century C.E. A halo around the statue’s head is covered with rays of sun, “which indicates his radiant mind,” says the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities in a statement. Founded in the third century B.C.E., Berenike eventually became one of the largest ports in Roman-controlled Egypt, according to the antiquities ministry.

The United States of America prides itself as the greatest nation in the world, the One Nation Under God (the Protestant Incarnation), the haven of peace and compassion. A thrice-blessed country where citizens are expected to live according to the sacred teachings of the Bible.

The macabre case of Kenneth Smith seems to be completely at odds with these sanctimonious claims.

Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58 years old, was convicted for the contract killing of Elizabeth Sennett of Colbert County, Alabama, 35 years ago. He was a part of a team hired by her husband, Charles Sennett, Sr. to commit the murder, which was carried out by stabbing Elizabeth to death at her Colbert County home in March 1988.

Charles Sennett committed suicide a week after the killing, when he learnt he was a suspect in the murder. After over three decades of appeals, the others involved in the killing have either died in prison or been executed by lethal injection. Smith alone remains on death row, 35 years later.

### Controversial new French immigration law promulgated by President Macron

*2024-01-27 14:30:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96769/controversial-new-french-immigration-law-promulgated-by-president-macron) · `en`

The administration of French President Emmanuel Macron published the formal text of a new immigration law in its Official Journal on Saturday, with the first instructions on applying the legislation already presented to officials.

The law’s promulgation comes after France’s Constitutional Council censured 35 of its 86 articles, including contentious additions insisted on by the right, such as measures restricting access to social benefits and the introduction of immigration quotas.

While the bill was seen as one of the signature reforms of Macron’s second term, some in his camp had baulked at the stricter version, with about a quarter of his allies in parliament voting against it or abstaining.

The final text upheld by the council retains key elements initially desired by the government, with a large part of it dedicated to simplifying procedures for expelling delinquent foreigners -- one of the objectives of Interior Minister Gerard Darmanin.
