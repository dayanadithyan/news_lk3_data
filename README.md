ECONOMYNEXT – The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a 100 million dollar policy-based loan, with an 800,000 dollar technical assistance grant, linked to water supply and sanitation sector reforms in Sri Lanka.

The reforms seek to enhance the country’s resilience to climate change impacts and promote long-term sustainability, the global lender said.

“Efficient delivery of safe and reliable water supply in Sri Lanka is limited by fragmented water resources management and exacerbated by climate change. This significantly affects the daily life of Sri Lankans—many of whom do not have access to piped water supply,” Senior Urban Development Specialist Pedro Almeida said.

“This program will not only strengthen mechanisms to ensure adequate access to safe water but also address governance and sustainability challenges of the sector that will enable the participation of the private sector.”
