Colombo, Jan 29 (Daily Mirror) - The Online Safety Bill will give rise to a local social media platform to disseminate information as all foreign online service providers are likely to leave the country once the legislation comes into effect, former MP Hirunika Premachandra said.

“It is just a simple task for the international service providers such as Facebook and X to leave Sri Lanka,” Ms. Premachandra told a media briefing.

“Sri Lanka will have to develop its own platform like China if all foreign service providers stop operations in Sri Lanka,” she added.

“Just imagine what you would feel if you are unable to log onto Facebook, Instagram or X through your phone to be aware of what is happening around the world,” she questioned.

Plot leader and parliamentarian Dharmalingam Siddharthan said that if the TNA is united again, it should be a registered party, and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) house symbol can be complied with the TNA.

He said that the Sri Lankan Tamil state party was broken into two or three split and that they could only look at the unity of the federation after they were united.

He was speaking to the media on Sunday (28) at his residence in Kandarodai.

He added that the leader of the Tamil state party has been elected. The new leader has not yet taken office. There is one problem. Its national conference has been postponed.

The most important thing is that the Tamil parties are broken in two. It does not know if it is second and three but broken.

Another committee opposes the decision taken by the leader of the TNA. So the Tamil state party should unite. Only then will we look at the unity of other Tamil national parties.

President Joe Biden said Sunday that the U.S. “shall respond” after three American troops were killed and dozens more were injured in an overnight drone strike in northeast Jordan near the Syrian border. Biden blamed Iran-backed militias for the first U.S. fatalities after months of strikes by such groups against American forces across the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.

Biden, who was traveling in South Carolina, asked for a moment of silence during an appearance at a Baptist church’s banquet hall.

“We had a tough day last night in the Middle East. We lost three brave souls in an attack on one of our bases,” he said. After the moment of silence, Biden added, “and we shall respond.”

With an increasing risk of military escalation in the region, U.S. officials were working to conclusively identify the precise group responsible for the attack, but they have assessed that one of several Iranian-backed groups was behind it.
