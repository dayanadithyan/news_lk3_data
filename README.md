### Remembering Mervyn de Silva on his 25th Death Anniversary

*2024-06-21 03:51:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/remembering-mervyn-de-silva-on-his-25th-death-anniversary/) ¬∑ `en`

When Mervyn de Silva left us on 22nd June 1999, it was not just the twentieth century that was drawing to a close. In retrospect one could sense, and now we know, that with his passing, an era in the literary history of Sri Lanka had ended. Because he was the last of a golden age of journalism, an illustrious tradition of English journalism in Sri Lanka that gave us H. A. J. Hulugalle, Jayantha Padmanabha, Tarzie Vittachi and Denzil Peiris. They were brilliant editors who provided us with not just world-class newspapers; they were also erudite men who helped build a Ceylonese literati that any society can be proud of.

I make no apologies for repeating what I have written before on my editor, my guru, my role model and my friend Mervyn de Silva, because all of it remains just as valid as it did a quarter of a century ago. The defining attributes of Mervyn and their importance bear repetition and deserve considered reflection.

He was speaking at a debate on the women's reinforcement bill held in Parliament on Thursday (20).

We have submitted the report of the Department of Education Department of the Department of Education on the Sri Lanka National Commission Bill for the UNESCO. The Commission should include state institutions including the Cultural Fund, Wildlife and the Department of Wildlife and the Department of Education.

Women's reinforcement Bill is spoken. In the social structure, women are resistant to many problems.

There are only 12 female representatives in Parliament. Fifty years ago, there was less representation. There was no major change. In the present state and private high positions, women should be given priority.
