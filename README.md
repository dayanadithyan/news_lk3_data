Somalia, Jan 30 (BBC) -  Indian naval forces have rescued 19 Pakistani sailors after their fishing vessel was hijacked by pirates off Somalia's coast.

This was the second rescue operation in 36 hours by Indian warship INS Sumitra.

Hours earlier, the ship had rescued the 17-member Iranian crew of a vessel which was also hijacked by pirates, the navy said.

India's navy has responded to several distress calls from vessels and sailors over the past few weeks.

Recent attacks on vessels off Somalia's coast have triggered concerns that pirates could be becoming active again in the region.

INS Sumitra has been deployed for maritime security operations along the east coast of Somalia and Gulf of Aden.

A navy statement said that the ship had responded to a distress message on 28 January and intercepted an Iranian-flagged vessel. Naval officers then "coerce[d] the pirates for safe release of crew along with the boat", according to a post on X (formerly Twitter).

### Do not allow the Consumer Safety Act to not be admitted to the Amendments of the Court - Media organizations and trade unions jointly letter to the Speaker

*2024-01-30 15:57:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175167) · `ta`

Media organizations and trade unions have jointly appealed to the Speaker not to grant the Speaker's approval to the Bill until the guidelines of the orders sent to the Speaker by the High Court are confirmed.

As civil society activists, we think that we should completely reject the Foundation Protection Bill, which we think we can be a major danger to expression.

We, who belong to the sovereignty of Sri Lanka, on January 24, ignore the guidelines of the court without any discussion with those involved in this issue and express strong opposition to the passage of Parliament.

Opposition MPs have pointed out that the legislation was passed in Parliament without the proper recruitment of the court guidelines.

The court had given guidance following the filing of more than 45 basic violation petitions against the copy of the Bill.

If the opposition parties are correct, it is the act of deducting the sovereignty of the people and thereby considering the contempt of court.

Islamabad, Jan 30 (Al Jazeera) - A Pakistan court has sentenced former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his close aide, former Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, to 10 years in jail in a case related to the leaking of state secrets.

The special court set up in a prison in Rawalpindi on Tuesday announced the sentence in the so-called cypher case, which pertains to a diplomatic cable that Khan claims proves his allegation that his removal from power in 2022 was a conspiracy.

The court established under the Official Secrets Act found Khan guilty of misusing the confidential cable sent by a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States.

Khan has repeatedly denied the charge, saying the document contained evidence that his removal as prime minister was a plot hatched by his political opponents and the powerful military, with help from the US administration. Washington and the Pakistani army reject the accusation.
