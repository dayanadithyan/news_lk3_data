Two citizens said they had heard massive explosions near the sea in Tripoli’s luxury Hay Andalus neighbourhood, the home to PM Dbeibah’s residence.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that new details on the Katchatheevu island issue “have unmasked DMK’s (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) double standards totally”. His remarks came a day after he attacked the Congress over its decision to hand over the strategic island to Sri Lanka in the 1970s.

In a post on X, the Prime Minister said, “Rhetoric aside, DMK has done NOTHING to safeguard Tamil Nadu’s interests. New details emerging on #Katchatheevu have UNMASKED the DMK’s double standards totally.”

“Congress and DMK are family units. They only care that their own sons and daughters rise. They don’t care for anyone else. Their callousness on Katchatheevu has harmed the interests of our poor fishermen and fisherwomen in particular,” he added.

Katchatheevu island is where fishermen from Tamil Nadu go to fish. But they are detained by the Sri Lankan Navy as soon as they cross the International Maritime Border Line (IMBL) to reach the island.

### Mannar Wind Farm Project: Another folly like the Sinharaja Logging Project on the horizon?

A wind farm consisting of 30 towers generating 100MW (Phase 1- Thambapavani) was established on the southern coast of Mannar Island in 2020, with financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The widespread criticism of this project due to its positioning within one of the main bird migratory corridors in the Asian region (detailed elsewhere in the article) was largely overlooked or ignored due to the economic priorities that prevailed at the time, as it happened with the now infamous Canadian-funded Sinharaja Mechanized Logging Project of the 1970s.

Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara on Friday described addressing the economic crisis was like a ‘suicide mission,’ and President Ranil Wickremesinghe has successfully completed the task of restoring the economy to normalcy.

He noted that an uninformed group believes that bringing down inflation, improving exchange rates, and increasing salaries can be achieved during an election to gain an advantage. He argued this clearly proves that such groups are being misled. He pointed out that recent statistics indicate the President has successfully tackled the economic challenges.

“New facts reveal how Congress callously gave away Katchatheevu…This has angered every Indian,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X.

Modi on Sunday (31 March) once again attacked the Congress about its decision to “callously give away” the island of Katchatheevu.

“Eye opening and startling! New facts reveal how Congress callously gave away #Katchatheevu. This has angered every Indian and reaffirmed in people’s minds — we can’t ever trust Congress!” he posted on X.

The prime minister’s post comes after documents obtained by BJP Tamil Nadu chief K.

According to the report, Jawaharlal Nehru once even remarked that he would not hesitate “in giving up claims to the island” altogether.

Mediation is used for the resolution of all categories of disputes ranging from Investor-State, Intellectual Property, Family, Trade and Business to Construction and Creditor-Debtor disputes.

Not only the rule of law but the spirit of the law is vital during a crisis

The last few weeks have seen a massive media interest and public attention on the salary hikes amounting up to 70% at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) at a time of an economic downfall in the country. I welcome the recommendations made by the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) at the Parliament and the acceptance of the recommendations by the CBSL governor and the staff to re-visit and reverse the proposed increase in the national interest.

There is a clear attempt to target the Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, and make him the scapegoat for the proposed increases. This in my view is politically motivated by many who were responsible for the economic downfall of the country.

### DDR for Sri Lanka and SLR for CBSL:  CB Governor’s rationale is puerile

Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe having made the blunder of unilaterally deciding to grant a phenomenal and unprecedented increase in the emoluments for the Central Bank (CB) staffers has further aggravated the issue by citing that for some employees the take home salary will be negative if the revised salary is not granted.

I would like the CB Governor to elaborate as to how the take home salary will be negative because of the loan given to the staff? It is normal that when an employer grants a loan to an employee, the loan amount is such that it is recovered in instalments over a period of time whilst the employee at the same time gets a reduced amount of take home pay (because of the deduction of the loan).

For the take home pay to be negative, I think that the Governor has made an additional blunder having given a colossal sum as loan which if it is to be recovered, within a short period of time, from the salary will make the take home salary negative!

### Why elections for Presidency all political parties have promised to abolish?

None in mainstream politics would lead this country on a right path to freedom, democracy and an inclusive society with socio-economic and cultural development. These political leaderships simply have no valid “development program” to back their criticism of the past and the present and their request for political power at the next “presidential” election. A larger crisis therefore is the timidity of the educated urban polity that has access to new information, new knowledge and new social discourses beyond geographical boundaries

President Ranil Wickremesinghe is reported to have told the cabinet of ministers, priority has to be given to the IMF program to ensure economic stability and elections will have to be postponed till the IMF program is concluded. One newspaper report had it, the President had in fact informed the Election Commission too about postponing elections.

*2024-04-01 01:56:25* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-is-wrong-with-Sri-Lanka/4-760143) · `en`

It is not the country per se, but the politicians and the people who are wrong. While politicians should take 70% responsibility, the people also should take the rest or 30%. It is true that these wrongs on the part of the politicians or the people are not limited to Sri Lanka. Even in a country like Australia where I now live, there are intermittent corruption, crime, gender abuse, killing, and misguided politics. However, the difference is extremely vast. Sri Lanka’s wrongs are perhaps 50 times higher than a country like Australia.

We have been removed from the positions. He called for a special discussion and would not allow us to present his comments and make any comments to us.. But even the correct allegations are not put forward on us.

### Bunker demand rises across Sri Lankan ports

*2024-04-01 00:07:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Bunker-demand-rises-across-Sri-Lankan-ports/108-279907) · `en`

As shipowners and charters continue to take longer voyages to avoid Red Sea, bunker demand across ports on India’s west coast has risen and VLSFO supplies at the ports of Kochi and Mumbai remain disrupted.

Despite the increased demand, price movements were mixed as of March 28. Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed 0.5 percent marine fuel oil delivered to Kochi at US $ 700/mt CFR, up US $ 20/mt on the week, while in Mumbai, prices fell to US $ 698/mt, down US $ 8/mt.

In Sri Lanka, prices at Colombo were assessed at US $ 700/mt, down US $ 7/mt on the week, according to S&P Global data.

“Demand has substantially increased, almost by 30 percent across Mumbai, Kochi and Gujrat ports. Long haul vessels are calling more often now. The volumes that were being lifted at King Abdullah port, Yanbu, Djibouti and Suez Canal have now shifted to Indian and Sri Lankan ports,” a Gujarat-based trader told S&P Global.

### Is the Chinese economy doomed as some forecasts say?

One should be cautious about making doomsday predictions, and should not  forget the resilience, determination and energy which made it possible  to lift millions of Chinese out of poverty in two decades

While social media is packed with doomsday predictions of the American economy (Europe isn’t doing any better, either), there is an equal or greater number of videos forecasting the decline of China, an economic juggernaut that looked set to overtake the US before the pandemic.

When navigating across this sea of negative analyses of China, from American, European or Indian sources, one must bear in mind that there are those who either dislike or fear China enough to wish it economic doom.

### Lanka’s foreign debt and Chinese puzzle - EDITORIAL

*2024-04-01 00:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Lankas-foreign-debt-and-Chinese-puzzle-EDITORIAL/172-279897) · `en`

In March this year, President Wickremesinghe in an interview said Lanka was committed to repaying its debt within the period 2027-2042. The president said he expected the ongoing debt restructuring negotiations would bring the annual external debt payments down to 4% of GDP.

The country’s foreign reserves, which stood at less than $20 million in April 2022 at the height of the economic crisis, now stand at over $3 billion, Wickremesinghe said.

For long, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Western nations have claimed the delay in rescheduling Lanka’s international debt was China-which holds the largest share of our foreign debt. It was also claimed Sri Lanka was caught in a Chinese debt trap caused by taking loans to an extent they cannot be repaid.

They warned Lanka would ultimately end up with China taking over assets of the country to meet the bill.

### Trade account reflects normalising economy

Both imports & exports up in a sign of synchronised reinvigoration across all sectors

The deficit in the trade account of the Balance of Payment (BoP) widened in February from a year ago on higher imports as the economy normalises. But it narrowed from a month earlier levels significantly due to less spending on fuel imports as the demand had been lower than expected.

Sri Lanka imported goods worth US$ 1,378 million and exported goods valued US$ 1,059 million to record a negative trade balance of US$ 319 million for February, nearly ten times the level of US$ 39 million a year ago as the economy was under pressure due to limited foreign exchange at the time.

However, on a month-on-month basis, the deficit was much lower than the US$ 541 million recorded in January as exports strengthened while imports fell due to aforementioned reasons.

### Anti-privatization statements will depress bid prices: Will JVP be held accountable?

Sunil Handunetti, a senior and respected leader of the JVP, has urged the government not to sell (and potential buyers not to buy) state-owned enterprises such as the SriLankan Airlines, SLT and Litro, for which requests for proposals have been called.

He implicitly threatens to expropriate the sold entities. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is also mentioned, but there is no such process underway for it.

This coincided with the government taking USD 210 million in dollar loans and LKR 41.4 billion in rupee loans off the Airline’s books. This has, understandably, angered many members of the public. They argue that wrong decisions led an airline that once paid dividends to the Treasury to come to this sorry state. They argue that those who made these decisions should be held to account.

Pope Francis called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all Israeli hostages in an Easter Sunday address that marked the most important day on the Christian calendar by deploring the suffering caused by wars.

The pontiff presided over Mass in a packed and flower-bedecked St Peter’s Square, and then delivered his “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) blessing and message from the central balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica.

Francis, 87, has been in poor health in recent weeks, forcing him on repeated occasions to limit his public speaking and cancel engagements as he did on Good Friday, skipping at short notice a procession at Rome’s Colosseum.

However, he took part in other Holy Week events leading up to Easter, and appeared in relatively good spirits on Sunday. Easter celebrates the day in which the faithful believe Jesus rose from the dead.

Since India is also planning to become a developed country just one year before Sri Lanka’s target year, it is important that Sri Lanka should ride the bandwagon of India

Sri Lanka should reduce the size of its Government progressively and reallocate its scanty resources for the promotion of the technological base in the economy. For this purpose, it should engage its universities and research institutes to conduct new research and come up with inventions which could be successfully converted to commercial products for sale in the global markets. For this, it is necessary for the country to establish a learning society at all levels, family, schools, universities, and workplaces. It is only a learning society that could create new things that will enable the country to generate wealth and prosperity

### Colombo University Business Economic Summit 2024: Keynote Address

President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressing Parliament in August 2022 pronounced that the target of his Government was to make Sri Lanka a fully developed country by 2048. The choice of the target year had some sentimental reason. It is that Sri Lanka will celebrate the centenary of independence from Britain in 2048.

Since Sri Lanka was a promising rich country in South Asia by the time it gained independence in 1948 prompting some analysts to brand it as Switzerland of Asia, it is ironical to target for prosperity after 100 years of independence. However, without any apparent connection, two weeks before Sri Lanka made this pronouncement, India’s Premier Narendra Modi too announced that India’s goal would be to make it a developed country by 2047 when it would celebrate centenary of independence from Britain. It seems that Sri Lanka is closely following the development path of its neighbour to the North.
