Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan had held the office of Solicitor-General under British rule and often acted as Attorney-General, a post reserved for officers recruited from abroad. He was a polished speaker, though in his old age he was inclined to be somewhat long-winded.

The Ambani wedding was an exceptional example of this tradition, elevated to unprecedented heights. Spanning an astonishing seven months, it was a fairy tale-like spectacle characterized by opulence and grandeur. At its heart, however, was the solemn exchange of vows to be with each other for тАЬSaat JanamтАЭ between Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant, a testament to their enduring love.

Now that the presidential election is round the corner and would be followed by a general election, the majority of law-abiding, patriotic, selfless and non-partisan people would want many changes in the system to bring this country back to where it was in the early nineteen fifties.

The first thing many are clamoring for is to abolish the executive presidency. This office has been a bane rather than a boon to this country and its people. It has only helped to enrich some who achieved this position. As we can remember, there were many previous occupants of this office who promised abolish it if they were elected, but reneged on their promise.

The powers attached to the executive presidency have been misused even by those with a good educational background and we have seen how the prerogative of the presidential pardon had been utilized to pardon murderers, drug dealers, child rapists, etc.

An attacker with a knife killed three people and seriously wounded at least five late Friday at a festival in the western German city of Solingen, authorities said.

Witnesses alerted police shortly after 9:30 p.m. to an unknown attacker having wounded several people indiscriminately with a knife on a central square, the Fronhof. Police said the perpetrator was on the run, and they had only very little information on the man so far.

They said they believe the stabbings were carried out by a lone attacker.

One of the festival organizers, Philipp M├╝ller, appeared on stage and asked festivalgoers to тАЬgo calmly; please keep your eyes open, because unfortunately the perpetrator hasnтАЩt been caught.тАЭ

At least one helicopter was seen in the air, while many police and emergency vehicles with flashing blue lights were on the road and several streets were closed off.
