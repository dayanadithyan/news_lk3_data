*2024-05-28 10:50:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184668) ¬∑ `ta`

It appears you've shared a detailed narrative involving political maneuverings and alliances within Sri Lanka's political landscape, focusing on the actions and reactions of various political figures and parties, particularly around the United National Party (UNP), Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), and attempts to sway Members of Parliament (MPs) between these factions.



Given the complexity and specificity of the situation, how may I assist you further? Are you looking for analysis, strategies, historical context, or something else related to this political scenario?

üü©

The United National Party suffered a shameful defeat in the 2020 election. Election defeats for the UNP, which is described by some as the oldest big party, are not new.. In 1956, the party received 8 seats in a 101 seat parliament. In the 1970s, the parliament of 157 seats received 17 seats. The 2020 was exclusively different.. For the first time in its history, not a single member was elected to Parliament. The UNP received a national list in compassion for 249, 435 (2.15 %). The party had only one member in the 225 -member parliament.

UNP leader and former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been a Member of Parliament for 43 years since 1977. In the 2015 general election, the Colombo district candidates came to the peak of over five lakhs of votes in the list of candidates.. Ranil, who was mocked as' Mr. Bean 'and' a 'fonder' by political opponents in the past. It was said that his political life had come to an end.
