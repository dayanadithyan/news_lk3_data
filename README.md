### UN Security Council demands immediate ceasefire in Gaza after US abstains

*2024-03-26 07:44:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98204/un-security-council-demands-immediate-ceasefire-in-gaza-after-us-abstains) · `en`

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council on Monday demanded an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages after the United States abstained from the vote.

The remaining 14 council members voted for the resolution, which was proposed by the 10 elected members of the body.

Washington had been averse to the word ceasefire earlier in the nearly six-month-old war in the Gaza Strip and had used its veto power to shield U.S. ally Israel as it retaliated against Hamas for an Oct. 7 attack that Israel says killed 1,200 people.

But amid growing global pressure for a truce in the war that has killed more than 32,000 Palestinians, the U.S. abstained from the vote on Monday to allow the Security Council to demand an immediate ceasefire for the month of Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which ends in two weeks.

### Sri Lanka central bank cuts rates 50 basis points to 9.50-pct

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has cut its policy corridor by 50 basis points to 8.50 percent (floor) and 9.50 percent (ceiling) citing stable external conditions and low inflation.

Subdued aggregate demand , the lesser-than-expected impact of the recent SriLanka taxes, cut in electricity prices, well-anchored inflation expectations and the absence of excessive external sector pressures made the rate cut possible, the central bank said in its March monetary policy statement.

The central bank itself by allowing the exchange rate to appreciate in the wake of deflationary policy has helped mitigate the effect of a valued added tax hike on traded goods, and also made possible an electricity price cut, analysts say.

Sri Lanka central bank mainly responsible for electricity price cut: Minister

Since external monetary stability was restored by the central bank in September 2022, index measured inflation in Sri Lanka had increased by only 5.9 percent over 17 months.

🟩

The United Nations Security Council has passed a proposal to immediately implement a ceasefire at Gaza.

It is reported that the Hamas has also requested the release of unconditional hostages.

After the opening operations in Gaza last year, several proposals to the Defense Council were not passed in the United States, but in the face of the United States.

However, the US has avoided the proposal yesterday (25th) and the US is not used against it.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has worked for the change in the United States.

Israel has also taken steps to cancel the discussion on Washington this week.

Critics say that this has received a signal of ancientity between Israel and the US.

However, UN Palestinian Representative Riyadh Mansoor, who accepted this proposal, said that the resolution was delayed when more than 100,000 IDPs were killed.
