It’s important to recognize this concept and its impact on the oppressed, as well as to explore potential remedies.

In many countries, the ruling class is made up of well-educated individuals who use their knowledge to maintain power and control. This often results in policies that benefit the minority at the expense of the majority, creating a capitalist system that perpetuates inequality.

The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the Twenty-Second Amendment to the Constitution Bill, the legal effect of which would be that a Bill that seeks to extend the term of office of the President or the duration of Parliament to over five years would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the People at a Referendum. The Bill seeks to amend present Article 83(b), according to which the maximum period to which such term or duration can be extended without a Referendum is six years. Article 83 also states that any Bill that seeks to amend Article 83 itself would require a two-thirds majority and approval at a Referendum. Thus, it is clear beyond doubt that the proposed Bill will require a two-thirds majority and a Referendum.
