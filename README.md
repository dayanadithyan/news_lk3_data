Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has suspended public duties to “stop and reflect” on whether to remain in the job, after a court opened a preliminary inquiry into his wife.

The court said it was responding to corruption claims against Begoña Gómez.

Mr Sánchez said his wife would defend her honour and work with the judiciary.

The complaint against Begoña Gómez was raised by anti-corruption campaigners Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), who have taken part in a number of high-profile court cases in recent years and are led by a man linked to the far right.

The Spanish prime minister said he would make a decision on his future before the media on Monday 29 April, after reflecting whether it was worth remaining in office “despite the mud” that the right and far right were trying to turn politics into.

If this bill is not amended at the committee stage, it will impose significant costs of compliance on small businesses who are already under stress from the crisis

The Gender Equality Bill has been gazetted. It requires every public institution and private institution to appoint a senior official to be responsible for gender mainstreaming and gender equality (“Gender Focal Point”). That person is legally required to prepare a plan of activities targeting their areas of responsibility and report directly to the Council on a quarterly basis with a copy to Women Parliamentarians Caucus in Parliament (section 17).

If this bill is not amended at the committee stage, it will impose significant costs of compliance on small businesses who are already under stress from the crisis.

### Dissecting digital disruption: The imperative of digital literacy for today’s CEOs

*2024-04-25 05:35:58* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Dissecting-digital-disruption-The-imperative-of-digital-literacy-for-today-s-CEOs/4-761008) · `en`

A golden rule for leaders embarking on digital transformation is to educate themselves. This education is not merely academic; it is a necessary step in becoming conversant in the language of technology, a prerequisite for the formulation and execution of effective digital strategies – adapted from Rewired, McKinsey, 2021.

We have never seen change like we experience today. In today›s VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world, corporate leaders find themselves rowing not in the calm waters but in the turbulent rapids of white-water rafting. The calm predictability of the past has given way to a landscape where constant change is the only constant.

Amidst this turbulence, one of the most significant drivers of change has been technology, whose capabilities are expanding at a staggering rate. There are three factors that create these ‘disruptive’ trends, which need to be understood in the right magnitude and scale.

Sri Lanka is an island nation situated in a strategically important location in the Indian Ocean Region at the centre of maritime trade routes in between East and West, as well as in the middle of Africa, the Arab, and Eastern worlds and is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.

Sri Lanka’s location enables the country to provide quick and efficient global and regional connectivity to move cargo to and from Asia to the rest of the world. More than 60,000 ships ply this route annually, carrying two-thirds of the world’s oil and half of the global containerised traffic.

Sri Lanka, also located very close to all major ports in the Indian subcontinent, especially those of India, with the rising middle class, makes it a prime location that is able to provide fast and easy connectivity to the Indian subcontinent through its feeder network.

### We need a revisionist president, not merely a reformist one

SJB presidential campaign manager Sujeewa Senasinghe and live-wire SM Marikkar accuse President Wickremesinghe of refusing the SJB its request of venue for May 1st and switching that preferred location to the JVP-NPP instead.

Meanwhile, six SJB MPs including shadow Finance Minister Dr Harsha de Silva accept decentralized funds from President Wickremesinghe allegedly without obtaining party permission. (https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/SJB-embroiled-in-controversy-after-its-MPs-secure-funds-from-Govt-without-party-approval/108-281121)

Is Ranil already a shareholder of the SJB, while simultaneously undermining it? Is he patronizing policy proxies in the SJB?

Little wonder then, as Prof Charitha Herath noted, that the SJB challenges the JVP-NPP to a debate on economics, but doesn’t challenge the incumbent and his administration with its austerity policies, to any such debate.

### Austerity, dispossession and injustice: Facets of the debt crisis in Sri Lanka

The widespread and ongoing debt crisis today is a wakeup call

Sri Lanka defaulted on its external debt for the first time in its postcolonial history in April 2022. The International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led process of recovery that followed has not only been disastrous in terms of the economic policy package proposed by the Government. The underlying analysis of the causes of the debt crisis itself is also flawed. Sri Lanka provides lessons about both the broken global financial system and the widespread consequences of an unjust debt resolution architecture affecting other countries in the Global South.

A similar injunction was also issued against the SLFP Acting General Secretary Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala.

The injunctions, in effect until 8 May, were granted considering a case filed by SLFP office bearers Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Duminda Dissanayake, and Mahinda Amaraweera.

Chandaka Jayasundara PC representing the plaintiffs told the courts that it is illegal and against the party’s constitution for the defendants to hold the positions.

Jayasundara noted that Rajapakshe’s membership status disqualifies him from holding any position within the SLFP, citing constitutional illegality in having a member of another party in such a role.

Additionally, Jayasundara highlighted that the Executive Committee convened on 21 April to appoint Rajapakshe was unlawful.

From the time of the Sinhala kings, the Muslim people have not been treated to betray the kings. This is the intrigue of the minority people. These are a lie that Gotabhaya says to wash his sin.

He came to power by spreading racism by exposing ideas against the minority people on the 2019 platform.. He eventually scored in the stomach of the Sinhalese people. This was followed by the struggle started. The people fought with fuel and gas problems. The minority people also attended. But he said he did not only chase the minority people.

At a commemoration event at St. Anthony’s Shrine in Kochchikade, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjit, maintained that The Roman Catholic church- in the majority Buddhist nation- no longer trusted the authorities to expose those behind the bombings

The National People’s Power of the JVP issued a seven-point agenda that it said would be implemented if it comes to power to hold accountable those responsible for the tragedy and serve justice to the victims

The politicization of the Easter Sunday attack is not only undermining the Sri Lankan state, but it also distracts the security agencies from the real threat of Islamist extremism

The whole discourse of the Easter Sunday attack is degenerating into a sordid freakshow

Islamization and the Arabization of some quarters of the Muslim community, leading up to the Easter Sunday attack, created permissive conditions for the Easter Sunday attacks

He called for independent and transparent investigations into the deaths, saying that “given the prevailing climate of impunity, this should include international investigators.”

Colombo, April 24 (Daily Mirror)- The closure of roads in Colombo without prior notice during evening rush hours as part of security arrangements for the visit of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi inconvenienced the public and motorists alike.

Incensed by the notice of road closures, they vented their anger by honking horns. The government made tight security arrangements in view of the visit of the Iranian leader for the inauguration of the Uma Oya project.

The roads were closed to facilitate the movement of his convoy without any prior notice as a security measure, but the motorists’ protest amounts to kind of an embarrassment for the government during the visit of a friendly country that has stood by Sri Lanka during its trying times. Iran and Sri Lanka have enjoyed excellent ties for decades and cooperated with each other in numerous international forums.

Following the cracking 195 against South African women's team, Chamari told the media that her 'retirement is very soon.'
