### Sri Lanka should export chocolates: President

*2024-01-26 14:20:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-should-export-chocolates-president-148786/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s confectioners should tap into international markets, President Ranil Wickremesinghe told a gathering of sweet makers.

Pointing to the success of Sri Lanka teas and cinnamon globally, Wickremesinghe asked “How long before I can take chocolates and go?” at the Lanka Confectionary Manufacturers Association AGM on Wednesday (24).

Sri Lanka however heavily taxes both milk and sugar, key ingredients of chocolates and confectionery. Milk is taxed to ‘protect’ domestic products.

Sri Lankan chocolates could become “a world-class product”, as there were limitations for expansion within the country, Wickremesinghe was quoted by his media division.

Since Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange crisis, the country has become hyper focused on export-oriented strategies.

Wickremesinghe pledged 8 billion rupees for research and development to foster a thriving confectionery industry, saying it was the “low hanging fruit” for economic growth.

### Saudi Arabia to get first alcohol shop in more than 70 years

*2024-01-26 13:40:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96744/saudi-arabia-to-get-first-alcohol-shop-in-more-than-70-years) · `en`

Saudi Arabia has said it will open a shop in Riyadh selling alcohol to a select band of non-Muslim expats, the first to open in more than 70 years.

The clientele will be limited to diplomatic staff, who have for years imported booze in sealed official packages known as diplomatic pouches.

Saudi officials said the shop would counter “the illicit trade of alcohol”.

Prohibition has been law since 1952, after one of King Abdulaziz’s sons drunkenly shot dead a British diplomat.

The new store will be located in Riyadh’s Diplomatic Quarter west of the city centre, according to a document seen by the AFP and Reuters news agencies.

A source familiar with the plans told Reuters the shop was expected to open within weeks. There will be limitations, however:

• Thirsty envoys would need to register beforehand and receive clearance by the government

• No one under 21 will be allowed in the store and “proper attire is required” at all times inside

• Drinkers will not be able to send a proxy, such as a driver

### Thai police to charge Sri Lankan over pet lion spotted cruising in Bentley

*2024-01-26 12:54:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/international/Thai-police-to-charge-Sri-Lankan-over-pet-lion-spotted-cruising-in-Bentley/107-275774) · `en`

Thailand, Jan 26 (BBC) - Police in Thailand have arrested a woman whose pet lion was pictured going on a joyride in the streets of Pattaya.

A video that has now gone viral shows the chained lion cub seated in the back of a white, open-top Bentley.

The lion was being driven about by a Sri Lankan man who has since left the country, and is believed to be a friend of the woman, Sawangjit Kosoongnern.

While it is not illegal to own a lion in Thailand, it needs to be officially registered.

Authorities in Thailand said Ms Sawangjit claimed to have bought the animal from a Thai man in Nakhon Pathom province, who successfully facilitated its delivery to Pattaya.

However he failed to have his facility checked by officials before doing so, which made both the transfer and ownership of the animal illegal.

She is therefore facing charges of possessing a controlled wild animal without permission, which carries a penalty of a year's imprisonment and a fine of up to 100,000 baht ($2,800; £2,200).

Railways Deputy General Manager (Traffic) M J Indipolage told reporters Friday January 26 that the CEB has not heeded a routine request of a few days’ grace period to settle outstanding bills.

“The accounts division takes measures to pay these electricity bills the moment they arrive. Sometimes, there are instances where it’s delayed. At those time, we talk to the CEB and request a grace period of a few days, without resorting to disconnection. It seems that this time that request was not heeded,” he said.

Indipolage said the request is made taking into account the inconvenience to the public as well.

The Sinhalese people have begun to experience the suffering suffered by the Tamil people. Thus the state is in fear. This is also the way to open the path to Tamils. Therefore, the new leader of the Sri Lanka Tamil National Party, Sivagnanam Sreedharan, said that we should all unite.

Kilinochchi District Parliamentarian S. Sreedharan was elected as the new leader of the Sri Lanka Tamil National Alliance (TNA) on Thursday evening at the Mannar office by members of the Mannar District Tamil National Party.

Likewise, in my history of my history, I am talking to the members of the Mannar Tamil party.

Although we have sacrificed many lives in this soil we are in a state of unable to breathe another free air. We are still alienating.

We have been a race that has been fighting for over 75 years. In 1949, Father Selva said that Tamils are a national race. He began to act to restore the lost sovereignty and live with our national identity.

Russia, Jan 26 (Russia Today) - Moscow and New Delhi on Wednesday held detailed talks on reviving the Eastern Maritime Corridor (EMC) connecting Vladivostok in the Russian Far East and Chennai on India’s eastern coast.

The route, which was operational during the Soviet era, is the object of renewed interest from businesses in both countries amid an unprecedented surge in oil, coal, and fertilizer exports from Russia to India, as well as tensions in the Red Sea impacting existing shipping routes.

Speaking at a conference in Chennai, the Indian Minister for Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Sarbananda Sonowal, called the Eastern Maritime Corridor a “game changer” that would save up to 16 days of travel, significantly cutting freight costs. At present, most of the trade between India and Russia is conducted via the Mumbai–St. Petersburg sea route, which traverses the Suez Canal and takes 35-40 days.

### Sri Lankan faces charges in Thailand over pet lion joyride

*2024-01-26 11:48:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96740/sri-lankan-faces-charges-in-thailand-over-pet-lion-joyride) · `en`

Police in Thailand have arrested a woman whose pet lion was pictured going on a joyride in the streets of Pattaya.

A video that has now gone viral shows the chained lion cub seated in the back of a white, open-top Bentley.

The lion was being driven about by a Sri Lankan man who has since left the country, and is believed to be a friend of the woman, Sawangjit Kosoongnern.

While it is not illegal to own a lion in Thailand, it needs to be officially registered.

Authorities in Thailand said Ms Sawangjit claimed to have bought the animal from a Thai man in Nakhon Pathom province, who successfully facilitated its delivery to Pattaya.

However he failed to have his facility checked by officials before doing so, which made both the transfer and ownership of the animal illegal.

She is therefore facing charges of possessing a controlled wild animal without permission, which carries a penalty of a year’s imprisonment and a fine of up to 100,000 baht ($2,800; £2,200).

The unions have requested that the drug tests be carried out inside the school premises.

The trade unions have said that the investigations carried out inside the school premises can cause physical psychology.

The students of Sri Lanka Asians Service Association, Mahinda Jayasinghe, said that such inquiries will be affected by their learning activities.

We have realized the need to eradicate drugs from schools but a complete plan can be eradicated by a complete plan, he said.

### Sri Lanka to amend penal code to criminalise rape of young boys

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will introduce amendments to the Penal Code to make raping of male children a criminal offense.

Sri Lanka’s law does not effectively recognise male rape. Section 363(e) of the Penal Code of Sri Lanka specifically protects girls and fails to recognize that boys can be victims of rape.

The country is also looking to close loopholes in the law on the rape of females, the Cabinet of Ministers decided at this week’s meeting (24), a statement said.

At previous Cabinet meetings (held on 18.01.2021 and 28.06.2021) approval was given “to introduce amendments to the Penal Code to amend laws on constitutional rape of females mentioned in the Penal Code, to correct the shortcomings in the law of raping of females and to institute raping of male children as a criminal offense,” the Cabinet Decisions announcement read.

The Attorney General has now cleared the draft bill formulated by the Legal Draftsman.

The verdict may be seen as political, despite the fact that the International Court of Justice is not required to implement the ruling of the International Court of Justice.

South Africa, which is vocal in support of the Palestinians, has appealed to Israel to court nine interim orders, including the suspension of its military actions.

Colombo (News 1st) – The International Court of Justice (ICJ) could order Israel to halt its Gaza offensive, in a sitting scheduled for Friday (26th) in The Hague, Netherlands.

The ICJ is the judicial body of the United Nations that decides on disputes between nations.  It comprises 17 judges from 17 nations, including one each from South Africa and Israel.

Judges are set to rule today on whether to order Israel to suspend its military campaign, as it responds to a case brought to the UN’s highest court by South Africa accusing Israel of state-led genocide in Gaza. The ICJ is set to rule on South Africa’s request for “provisional measures” against Israel over its alleged genocide in Gaza; the top UN court could order Israel to halt its offensive against the Palestinian territory.

The court will not rule today on whether Israel has committed acts of genocide. That process could take several years.

Alabama executed a convicted murderer with nitrogen gas Thursday, putting him to death with a first-of-its-kind method that once again put the US at the forefront of the debate over capital punishment. The state said the method would be humane, but critics called it cruel and experimental.

Officials said Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, was pronounced dead at 8:25 pm at an Alabama prison after breathing pure nitrogen gas through a face mask to cause oxygen deprivation. It marked the first time that a new execution method has been used in the United States since lethal injection, now the most commonly used method, was introduced in 1982.

The state had previously attempted to execute Smith, who was convicted of a 1988 murder-for-hire, in 2022, but the lethal injection was called off at the last minute because authorities couldn’t connect an IV line.

### Card payments’ merchant fee shouldn’t be borne by customers: CB Deputy Governor

Merchant fees which are at most times conveniently passed on to the customer should not be borne by the customer, the Central Bank asserted this week.

As per agreements inked between banks and vendors, the fee must be absorbed by the merchant himself.

Speaking on the issue, the Central Bank’s Senior Deputy Governor, Yvette Fernando said they have made aware the merchants at times who should bear the merchant fee which often gets added to the cost of purchase, and has made even the banks aware to pass on the message and to ensure that this doesn’t recur.

Although the practice has been known and in public for a very long time, no one or nothing has been done to address the issue. And it appears even the continuous awareness campaigns the Central Bank claims to have been conducting have not been followed by the merchants and even the banks.

### Sri Lanka cabinet gives ok to sign Thailand FTA

*2024-01-26 07:33:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-cabinet-gives-ok-to-sign-thailand-fta-148720/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s cabinet of ministers has given approval to sign a free trade agreement with Thailand, the state information office said.

A complete FTA of 14 chapters with the preamble and annexes has been prepared after nine rounds of negotiations.

The government hopes to improve trade and investment with Thailand which is one of the largest nations in South East Asia.

Sri Lanka has high levels of import duties and protectionism, which has kept local prices high and allowed domestic producers to exploit the public, critics say.

High tariffs also makes the economy inefficient and noncompetitive. (Colombo/Jan26/2024)
