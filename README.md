Despite the postponement, the LG polls have not been officially canceled, meaning that standard election laws, including restrictions on political parties engaging in development projects or distributing funds, remain in effect.

Both Sri Lanka and South Africa have stars who shone in the recently concluded IPL.

It‚Äôs not just Pathirana who brings express pace for Sri Lanka. Dishan Madushanka and Dushmantha Chameera can also bowl express pace. Nuwan Thushara, meanwhile, has had his highs and lows but his figures of 5/20 against Bangladesh in a T20I n March will act as an inspiration of sorts to do better.

David Wiese was the hero for Namibia, contributing 13 runs in the Africans' super over total of 21 before then restricting Oman to 10 runs with the ball in hand to seal a crucial win at Kensington Oval.

The match had gone to a decisive extra over after a tense duel saw both teams finish with 109 runs from their allotted 20 overs.

Oman had looked to be heading for defeat after a superb four-wicket bowling display from Ruben Trumpelmann saw them all out for 109 off 19.4 overs.

Khan finished with figures of three wickets for seven runs off three overs.
