Sri Lanka's milk consumption has slightly increased post-crisis, but overall, it's less than before. Economic recovery has seen over a million families return to the market, but the dairy industry needs at least two years to reach pre-crisis levels.

🟩

Following the economic crisis, a senior industry representative said the use of Sri Lanka's monthly milk, which has been reduced by almost half of the price rise, has seen a slight increase.

Consumption of 7,000 metric tonnes of milk powder in the last three years has declined to 3,000 metric tonnes in the last three years due to the rise in US dollar prices, milk prices in the world market and government tax hikes.

However, with the slightest improvement of economic conditions, more than one million families have returned to the market, although the overall consumption is less than the previous level, said Ravi Jayawardena, CEO of the Maliban Group.

He shared his views while addressing a group debate by the Kabital Alliance Limited, which examines the current trends of Sri Lankan consumer spending and the post -crisis view.

According to Jayawardena, the domestic dairy industry will take at least two years to return to Kovit's previous consumption.

Gross official reserves also include fiscal balances of the Treasury, which may rise when IMF or other budget support loans are given and fall when loans are repaid.

Colombo, April 2 (Daily Mirror) - India has no intention to reverse the agreement that ceded the Katchatheevu Island to Sri Lanka despite the political debate in India that is primarily meant for domestic consumption in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Daily Mirror learns.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday targeted the DMK over the Katchatheevu island issue, alleging the ruling party of Tamil Nadu did nothing to safeguard the state's interests. New details emerging on the issue of India handing over the Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka have unmasked the DMK's double standards totally, he said on X.

It is apparent that the current Indian ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is not in favour of the position taken by the then Indian National Congress government. However, the agreement has now been signed, and an informed source said the current debate in India has nothing to do with Sri Lanka.

Monthly milk powder consumption dropped from 7000 MT to 3000 MT over last few years

Sri Lanka’s monthly milk powder consumption, which almost halved following the economic crisis, due to the price escalation, is witnessing a slight increase, a senior industry representative said.

The monthly milk powder consumption, which was about 7,000 MT pre-Covid, dropped to about 3,000 MT over the last three years, due to the price increases caused by the increase in the US dollar, an increase in global market milk prices and a hike in government taxes.

However, with the economic conditions slightly improving, over one million households have returned to the market, although the overall consumption remains lower than the pre-COVID levels, Maliban Group Chief Executive Officer Ravi Jayawardena said. He shared his views while addressing a panel discussion hosted by Capital Alliance Limited, which delved into the current trends in consumer spending and post-crisis outlook in Sri Lanka.
