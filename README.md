### Central Mail Exchange employees to strike over broken elevator

*2024-03-10 18:15:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97856/central-mail-exchange-employees-to-strike-over-broken-elevator) ¬∑ `en`

The employees of the Central Mail Exchange in Colombo have decided to launch a 24-hour token strike from midnight today (10 March).

Speaking at a media briefing held today, the United Postal Trade Unions Front (UPTUF) stated that the strike is being launched in view of the failure to repair the elevator at the building, which has been inoperable for almost one year.

They explained that nearly 40% of the female employees, including pregnant women, face difficulties due to this, adding that the Central Mail Exchange is an eight-storied building, therefore making it a rather difficult task to move around mail bags.

Thus, the UPTUF warned that if the government fails to resolve the matter within a month, the trade union action will continue.

Esteem for ancient values has a hold on Chinese society even today. One interesting matter is protection of wildlife, nature reserves and a willingness to share space. How sad that in this country (SL) people have little regard for pristine wildernesses, forests and wildlife; we have little respect for the message of Arahat Mahinda. The Yellow River (Huang Ho) carries massive quantities of muddy brown silt that fertilises thousands of acres and accounts for its name (yellow). This cradle of Chinese civilisation, known as the Sorrow of China, because frequent flooding, gives rise to much devastation, but the contradiction has long been stoically accepted.

### Half number of girls, women do not include sanitary napkins in household expenditures

Colombo, March 10 (Daily Mirror) - Due to the affordability of sanitary napkins half the number of girls and women in Sri Lanka do not include sanitary napkins in their household expenditures, the Advocata Institute said.

They said the affordability of sanitary napkins and its significant impact on the welfare of girls and women in Sri Lanka has become more pronounced in recent years.

This is particularly evident due to the decline in their purchasing powers stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis.

Approximately 4 million Sri Lankans have descended into poverty since 2019, making the total number of Sri Lankans living in poverty approximately 7 million.

Therefore, it is necessary to examine the ramifications of the lack of affordability of sanitary napkins which has been worsened by the imposition of high taxes on sanitary napkins.

Colombo, March 10 (Daily Mirror) - Deputy Director of the National Hospital, Colombo and Government Medical Officers' Forum (GMOF) president, Dr. Rukshan Bellana, claimed that in recent weeks, the police have been arresting fresh medical graduates who were practicing under the supervision of registered doctors while failing to apprehend quack doctors who claimed to be unlicensed practitioners.

He told the Daily Mirror that quack doctors are unqualified, unregistered medical practitioners practicing Allopathic medicine and Ayurvedic, Homoeopathy and indigenous medicines.

"Most of the fresh medical graduates usually practice under a licenced doctor until they get their government appointments. It is not illegal to serve like that because the fresh medical graduates can earn some money and experience before getting their licences. The medical graduates do not working as independent doctors, but under a registered doctor who is the responsible person," he said.

ECONOMYEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs power tariff cut was made possible by an appreciating exchange rate and falling interest rates (monetary stability) that cut costs of the Ceylon Electricity Board and reduced coal import prices, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

Sri Lanka slashed electricity prices as much as 33 percent for small users and 21 percent overall, after hiking them in October as losses mounted due to low rainfall.

Minister Wijesekera said the price cut went beyond the increase in October.

‚ÄúMost people think that the price reduction came only because of the hydro-electricity,‚Äù Minister Wijesekera told reporters.

‚ÄúProducing more hydro-electricity was only one factor. The main fact was the gradual emergence of the country from the unstable economic conditions, especially the strengthening of the rupee.

‚ÄúThe rupee was at around 370 to the US dollar, which has come down to 314 to 317 to the US dollar. Yesterday it was reported that was down to 307.
