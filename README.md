The MP was responding to a question raised by journalists at a media briefing as to why the party is depending on MPs such as Nalaka Godahewa when deciding on economic affairs.

Marikar responded to this question by recalling how President Ranasinghe Premadasa dealt with late SLMC leader A.H.M. Asroff in 1989. Asraff wanted President Premadasa not to give nominations to three UNP Muslim members in the East if he was to support the UNP in 1989. President Premadasa did not give the three UNPers nominations but appointed them to Parliament though the national list. He made one MP a member of the Cabinet and two others as State Ministers,” Marikar recalled.

Palestinians began fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Monday with cease-fire talks at a standstill, hunger worsening across the Gaza Strip and no end in sight to the war between Israel and Hamas.

Prayers were held outside amid the rubble of demolished buildings. Fairy lights and decorations were hung in packed tent camps, and a video from a U.N.-school-turned-shelter showed children dancing and spraying foam in celebration as a man sang into a loudspeaker.

But there was little to celebrate after five months of war that has killed over 30,000 Palestinians and left much of Gaza in ruins. Families would ordinarily break the daily sunrise-to-sundown fast with holiday feasts, but even where food is available, there is little beyond canned goods, and the prices are too high for many.

“You don’t see anyone with joy in their eyes,” said Sabah al-Hendi, who was shopping for food Sunday in the southernmost city of Rafah. “Every family is sad. Every family has a martyr.”
