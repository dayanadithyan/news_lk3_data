### She Walked Gently Into The Night: A Tribute To Roma De Zoysa

*2024-06-27 20:09:28* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/she-walked-gently-into-the-night-a-tribute-to-roma-de-zoysa/) · `en`

I did not know Roma de Zoysa prior to my arriving in Southern California. But her impeccable pedigree, which needed no exaggeration, had been a subject of many a conversation that occurred in the Los Angeles circles. When I met her for the first time, the immediacy of her presence was no surprise either. The impression she created has been embedded in me never to fade away, ever.

Roma’s journey of life through nine decades on earth has been one that most Ceylonese ladies would compete enviably to share; born into one of the most prestigious and elite Down-South families, Roma, amongst mostly men, led not only her own life in her own terms but also influenced a then patriarchal social environment with stoicism of a man and elegance of a graceful lady. She could not let a social event occur without her serene intervention nor could she wait without contributing her mite which was of enormous magnitude in material finesse and spiritual guidance.

Sri Lanka will have elections soon. In fact, right now, the country is engulfed and is swirling in the vortex of election fervour. People still hold on to the expectation that democracy will hold sway. The daily discourses are dominated by nothing but the most dismal of news – about debt restructuring and how to squander the IMF loan. How unfortunate is that? Notwithstanding those, I want to point out that there is still some hope.

A Nature news item by Benjamin Plackett (2024) reported that ‘by the end of this year, voters in some 65 countries and regions will have gone to the polls. That means close to half of the global population will have had the chance to cast a ballot of some sort, including almost 360 million people across the European Union’. The same article says: ‘Not all of the world’s political procedures will be free and fair, but this year is still expected to represent the biggest manifestation of the democratic process in history’.
