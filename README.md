Sri Lanka may reach a deal with investors to restructure its $12 billion in defaulted global bonds by mid-May, according to strategists at Standard Chartered.

The South Asian nation has been hoping to reach a deal in the next few weeks, though the first round of direct talks with dollar bondholders failed to yield a breakthrough. The remaining disagreements relate to the structure of ‚Äúmacro-linked‚Äù bonds, an instrument proposed by bondholders, whose payout would vary depending on the nation‚Äôs economic performance.

‚ÄúWe think timelines are critical and expect an agreement by mid-May,‚Äù strategists including Shankar Narayanaswamy wrote in a note.

Further delays would take the talks too close to the planned presidential elections, Standard Chartered said.

The government seems to have agreed to carry out debt restructuring in accordance with economic growth. But we think that it does not matter to it fully.

He further stated this at a press conference held at the Opposition Leader's Office in Colombo on Wednesday (17).

"What we were told by the Indian High Commission offices is to select the most suitable beneficiaries, but not to do it based on affiliation to any trade union," sources said.

The website says it is operated by companies called IVS-GBS and VFS Global.
