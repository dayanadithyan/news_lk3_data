Digital transformation, often seen as the domain of ICT professionals, frequently falls short due to a lack of comprehensive business understanding among these experts. A study by Harvard Business School emphasised that digital transformation is not about technology and IT professionals in Sri Lanka declared at a conference that they could contribute only up to 20% to the success of such initiatives. When IT professionals lead, they excel in technology but may overlook broader business implications. Thus, non-IT managers must step into leadership roles for digital transformation projects, although they may face knowledge gaps in ICT.

### Importance of renewable energy for future energy security and economic growth

It is time Sri Lankans considered in depth, the impact of energy on their day to day life and the national economy, as well as the sources of such energy. Leaving such matters entirely to the officials and the politicians to make all the decisions would only cause them to lament later on the hardships passed on to the consumers due to poor decisions, lacking in wisdom or vision for the future. It is increasingly evident that rampant corruption and deal making are in place as per comments made even by the Supreme Court from time to time as well as the findings of the Auditor General. The fact that no pressure is applied to follow up on these allegations and take action to bring the culprits to book, underscores both the lack of understanding and the apathy of the general public, that hitherto seem to believe they have no role to play.

Despite widespread criticism especially by some media groups which obviously have some vested interests, President Ranil Wickremesinghe – giving steady leadership to the heavily divided Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) government – is making  steady progress in pulling Sri Lanka out of its worst ever economic and debt crisis. These moves come in an election year but some critics are alleging that the President might try to put off the elections by changing the Executive Presidential system of government. While these areas are important, the politicians and the people need to focus on areas, which have long-term consequences and add beauty to this paradise island. One such area is wildlife, though most people do not have direct interests or connections with it.

Police said the Polonnaruwa High Court issued the verdict in the case, sentencing the driver to death on September 22 last year.

The driver, who last appeared before court on August 05, 2022, failed to attend subsequent hearings, leading to the issuing of warrants for his arrest.

The Welikanda Police arrested the accused today while he was avoiding courts.

The arrested individual is identified as a 39-year-old resident of Valaichchenai.

The accident occurred when a private bus carrying 70 passengers, including children from the Al-Hizma nursery in Valaichchenai and their parents, collided with a train at the railway crossing.

The 12-month yield fell 71 basis points to 10.02 percent, with 60 billion rupees of bills offered and 48 billion rupees sold.

Sri Lanka’s central bank has been selling down its Treasury bill stock to build forex reserves in recent months while fiscal corrections have helped moderate borrowings.

The central bank after selling bills outright at auctions is injecting money overnight and through term reverse repo auctions, in a policy that alters rupee reserves in individual banks and possibly encouraging them to overtrade, analysts say.
