### Technical malfunction leaves lives of hundreds of children with cancer at risk

Colombo, March 27 (Daily Mirror) - The prolonged breakdown of one of the linear accelerators at the Apeksha Hospital, Maharagama, which predominantly treats the pediatric patients has placed hundreds of lives at risk.

Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the linear accelerator, crucial for administering radiotherapy ‚Äî a vital cancer treatment, has been non-operational since February.

Despite the severity of the situation, the Health Ministry has turned a blind eye by not taking remedial measures to rectify the issue, exacerbating the concerns.

Apeksha Hospital currently houses five linear accelerators, each playing a pivotal role in delivering various treatments. However, the malfunctioning machine holds particular significance for pediatric patients due to its specialized features.

Furthermore, the breakdown has resulted in a backlog of over 500 patients awaiting treatment, plunging many, especially children, into precarious circumstances where their lives hang in the balance.

### Central Bank delivers 50bps policy rates cut

Says softer than expected inflation provided space to resume cuts

Expresses confidence of maintaining mid-term inflation at targeted range between 4% to 6%

The Central Bank yesterday resumed cuts by further reducing key policy rates by 50 basis points as inflation remains anchored. The move was also to further ease the financial conditions¬†with a view to support and accelerate the expansion of the economy.

The rates cut came after a four months hiatus since November 22 last year, when the Central Bank said they would pause any more reduction until both, the government securities yields and the lending rates, fall broadly in line with the policy rates.

Although both yields and rates eased thereafter, quite notably the yields showed some reversal in the last four weeks while the softening in lending rates slowed, the Central Bank said.

The Colombo High Court yesterday dismissed the preliminary objections presented by the counsels representing former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella in a case brought by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) against him for criminal misappropriation of funds during his tenure as the Minister of Mass Media.

The two defendants in the case, including Rambukwella, stand accused of misappropriating Rs. 230948 from the State Printing Corporation to settle Rambukwella‚Äôs personal telephone bill during the period from March to April 2012, when he served as the Minister of Mass Media.

The Commissioner of Elections made it clear to all Lankans that the presidential elections would be held in a timely manner in keeping with Constitutional requirements.

To him we owe a vote of thanks. Many a citizen had begun to doubt whether elections -presidential or general elections- would be held at any time in the near future, given the number of elections postponed via sleight of hand over the years.

Even as we pen these lines, our country is going through one of the hottest periods weather-wise. As though this were not bad enough, political party leaders and their followers are also breathing fire at their opponents, adding to the heat.

We continue witnessing intra-party squabbles in the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and dirty linen being washed in public. The ‚ÄòNational People‚Äôs Power is gaining in popularity. But in the past it has not been able to turn this into actual votes.

In the annals of history, the figure of Sir Walter Raleigh stands as a beacon of exploration and adventure. Yet, beyond his gallant exploits, lies a deeper narrative of maritime dominance and strategic prowess that shaped nations and empires. During Raleigh‚Äôs era, explorers were not mere cartographers, but rather daring adventurers who sailed the seas under state patronage, seizing goods and treasures from maritime trade routes.

These audacious exploits weren‚Äôt just acts of piracy; they were the seeds of national wealth and diplomatic influence. By enriching their coffers through maritime plunder, these seafaring knights ascended to diplomatic status, eventually earning knighthood and securing a lasting legacy for their descendants. This narrative, often overshadowed by tales of piracy, underscores the pivotal role of naval power in shaping the course of history.
