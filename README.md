ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì State-run Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd plans to float a new tender to resume work on the second terminal in mid -September after a bilateral debt restructure made funds from Japan available, Chairman Athula Galketiya said.

The original contractor self-terminated the contract, after completing only 5 percent of the terminal, when Sri Lanka defaulted on its debt in 2022.

As a result, Sri Lanka had to pay 52 million in termination fees under the contract terms.

The half-built sub-structure of the terminal, which was a safety hazard and was deteriorating, was then completed by a local contractor hired by the AASL.

Though the contractor pulled put when the Japan International Co-operation Agency had to suspend projects after the sovereign default, the consultants, Japan Airport Consultants were retained at Sri Lanka‚Äôs expense.

The original design had to be changed to accommodate new regulations and costs had also risen in the meantime, Galketiya said.

### The TNA will review the supporters of Samasti in the presidential candidates;Chitran

TNA plans to evaluate Tamil support in the North and East based on presidential candidates' stances on living there. Sreedharan mentioned a central committee meeting to decide support for a candidate promoting Samasti. He also addressed Wickeswaran's inability to lead the Northern Provincial Council, suggesting it's crucial for parties to voice their opinions. The mention of Mahinda Rajapaksa relying on Pillayan led to the choice of a former Justice Minister to ensure police funding.

üü©

Parliamentarian Sivagnanam Sreedharan has said that the TNA will review the support of the Tamils ‚Äã‚Äãin the North and East if any of the current presidential candidates insist on living in the North and East.

He was responding to a question asked by journalists after an event in Kilinochchi yesterday (28).

However, he said that the Central Committee would convene on the 10th and 11th of this month to support the general candidate or to support the candidate who urged Samasti in election science.

When Sumanthiran said yesterday that Wickeswaran was unable to hold the Northern Provincial Council, Wickeswaran should be given the right thing to give our party the opinion of the party.

If the present situation is confused by the unity, there is a problem with bringing basic politics.

Mahinda Rajapaksa had asked the police to rely on Pillayan. That is why we have chosen the former Justice and demanded that the police authority be financed.

The study, published Sunday in the journal JAMA, found that about 90 per cent of the time the blood test correctly identified whether patients with memory problems had Alzheimer‚Äôs. Dementia specialists using standard methods that did not include expensive PET scans or invasive spinal taps were accurate 73 per cent of the time, while primary care doctors using those methods got it right only 61 per cent of the time.

The results, presented Sunday at the Alzheimer‚Äôs Association International Conference in Philadelphia, are the latest milestone in the search for affordable and accessible ways to diagnose Alzheimer‚Äôs, a disease that afflicts more than 32 million people worldwide.

In Kollan's Komiyam, workers pee in towers due to a lack of descent facilities. Many hospitals conduct numerous tests but fail to reduce kidney disease cases significantly. A patient with a urinary tract issue visits a doctor, complaining of irritation during urination. Despite the doctor's advice to return after a week for medication and re-examination, the patient brings two large plastic bottles filled with urine for testing, causing confusion and highlighting issues with medical guidance and patient compliance.

The person who works in the tower cannot come down to urinate down. So there will be urinating there. Like a proverb, Kollan's Komiyam tower.

Many hospitals go to many tests, and the number of people with kidney disease will not decrease. The instructions for the coming elderly are not correct. Thus, there are various incidents.

A patient who was suffering from a urinary tract goes to meet the doctor claiming to be irritated when urinating. After examining the patient, the doctor has said that the patient has been given the medication a week later and re -examined.

### The developing picture as elections approach

There‚Äôs a political poster that‚Äôs been splashed on the walls of Colombo. Black letters on a yellow background mean that the author or the party cannot be identified. It is obviously a teaser campaign. It comes with a promise, which of course is the bread and butter of all politicians. Apparently, ‚Äòthe lie will come to an end,‚Äô and on the 29th, the name of the messiah who will take all Sri Lankans to some yet-to-be-named promised land will be revealed.

This is the season for that kind of thing, so the timing is not bad at all. After all, people are talking about elections these days. They are wondering if elections will be held soon and, if so, whether it would be a presidential or parliamentary election. They talk about candidates, those who have announced their intentions and those who might very soon.

### US Politics: Trump in trouble after Biden‚Äôs Sacrifice and Kamala Harris‚Äôs Surge

In one master stroke last Sunday afternoon, the beleaguered American President Joe Biden turned the tables on Donald Trump and the Republican Party. From his home in Delaware, Biden tersely announced that he was withdrawing from the race and endorsing his Vice President Kamala Harris to be the nominee of the Democratic Party for the November presidential election. If that was stunning, the even greater shock and awe is the speed and manner in which Kamala Harris has rolled out her campaign; secured her nomination within hours; energized the Party at every level; enthused the youth in their own network worlds; raised millions of dollars by the minute; and served notice to Trump that she is the prosecutor, he is the felon, and she knows his type.

### Bandaranaike, Chelvanayakam and the collapse of their Grand Collaboration

*2024-07-29 11:35:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/bandaranaike-chelvanayakam-and-the-collapse-of-their-grand-collaboration/) ¬∑ `en`

The 1956 elections brought to the forefront of Sinhala-Tamil political divide two former classmates at St. Thomas‚Äôs College, SWRD Bandaranaike and SJV Chelvanayakam. SWRD rode to power as Prime Minister, heading the ideologically motley MEP coalition, on the well-orchestrated Sinhala Only wave. SJV and his Tamil Arasu Kadchi or Federal Party swept the elections in the North and East to present a defensive phalanx in parliament supplemented by non-violent protests outside parliament.

Yet there was more in common between the two men than what appeared on the surface as Sinhala-Tamil political confrontation. Just as there is more in common between the Sinhalese and the Tamils socially and culturally than what would appear to be the case on the surface of politics.
