Sri Lanka Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa confirmed that the islandwide curfew which was extended until 12 noon today will not be further extended.

Accordingly, the curfew will be lifted at 12 noon today (22), he said.

The decision to impose a curfew had been taken by the incumbent President Ranil Wickramasinghe under the provisions of the Public Security Ordinance, in view of the release of the results of 2024 presidential election tonight.

However, the Police Media Division had stated that although the post-election situation in the country is very peaceful, this curfew was imposed for further safety of the public. Furthermore, Sri Lanka Police urged the general public to stay in their houses during the curfew period.
