### Transforming Government institutions: A beacon of development in Sri Lanka’s fishing industry

Effective management is the cornerstone of success. Leaders must prioritise transparency, accountability, and collaboration. A well-functioning team, aligned with a shared vision, can overcome obstacles and achieve remarkable outcomes.

### Dayasiri urges SL to foster new generation of visionary leaders

*2024-03-21 05:17:39* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Dayasiri-urges-SL-to-foster-new-generation-of-visionary-leaders/56-759733) · `en`

Humane Peoples’ Alliance Leader Dayasiri Jayasekra yesterday said Sri Lanka urgently requires a  new program aimed at nurturing leaders who, through their political campaigns, can articulate their vision and strive to progress accordingly.

Speaking at the new alliance’s launch in Colombo, Jayasekara said the current system does not have such leaders.

“We must emphasise the necessity of a robust political program for the forthcoming decade,” he emphasised.

“Are we content with a system where 250,000 individuals live in luxury while millions suffer, or should we aspire for a more equitable future?” he asked.

Jayasekara emphasised the significance of establishing a new generation of leaders who are incorruptible, refrain from using political power to enrich their families and demonstrate foresight.

Over 20 political parties and civil society organisations joined the newly formed alliance during the event yesterday.

Alhambra Hotels commemorated five decades of unwavering dedication to hospitality excellence today. What began as a visionary endeavour by founding Chairman Jabir A. Cader, a prominent businessman, has evolved into a cornerstone of Colombo’s hospitality landscape.

Originally envisioned as a modern cinema, the venture transformed with the changing tides, capitalizing on the burgeoning tourism industry generated by the ‘Tourism Development Act’ and in 1974, a pivotal partnership with the Holiday Inn group propelled Alhambra Hotels into the international spotlight, becoming the second International Hotel Chain in Sri Lanka to do so at that time.

It was also the introduction of the first-ever North Indian restaurant, Alhambra which serves up the most tantalizing and delicious Moghul Cuisine in the city to this date and is renowned for its famous Mutton Biryani, Thalis, and much more.

### New EU regulation on deforestation-free products applicable for Sri Lanka’s exports

New European Union (EU) regulations on deforestation-free products (EUDR) are applicable for Sri Lanka’s exports, the Foreign Ministry announced yesterday.

Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane chaired a meeting at the Foreign Ministry with the participation of the EU Ambassador Carmen Moreno to brief key industry stakeholders on the new EUDR.

As a direct beneficiary of the EU GSP+ concessions, Sri Lanka’s rubber exports to the EU market will have to adopt due diligence to prove that products do not originate from recently deforested land or have contributed to forest degradation.  The EU adopted the EUDR in June 2023, to ensure that agricultural products consumed by EU citizens do not contribute to global deforestation or forest degradation. The regulation will apply to the production of commodities like cattle, wood, cocoa, soy, palm oil, coffee, rubber, and their derived products.

“…Fulfilling the California dream…the basic principles of the program of making Lanka, California…are already with us…”

- Dr. Harsha de Silva, SJB Youth Convention, Kurunegala, 16 March 2024 -

President Wickremesinghe’s first public political rally at Kuliyapitiya was odd. He delivered a zestful, even rollicking speech, remaining in the high spirits he displayed in the Mustang’s tent at the Royal-Thomian Big Match. He was rude and crude about his former lecturer at Colombo’s Faculty of Law, Prof. G.L. Peiris. He praised his pet members of the SJB, Dr. Harsha de Silva and Eran Wickramaratne. He insulted SJB leader Sajith Premadasa while pitching for the SJB to join him. He lavished praise on himself. A vintage Wickremesinghe performance, it elicited no praise outside the (small) UNP.

### Books & Elections: President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s Claim Of Foreign Conspiracy

Gotabaya Rajapaksa has well explained his own tragedy where the protagonist comprehends his insignificance. To comprehend a self-diagnosis with an insignificance is neither an act of cowardice but the opposite; this value of Gotabaya’s self-diagnosis must be appreciated.

Bombs directly impact election results in South Asia, as discussed in my book ‘Conundrum of an Island’. The last major bomb attack in Sri Lanka, the Easter Sunday Terror attack, certainly altered the voter path towards restoring National Security upon the election of Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019.
