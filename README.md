Republican nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he would not participate in another presidential debate against Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 5 election, after several polls showed his Democratic rival won their debate earlier this week.

“THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!” the former president wrote on social media site Truth Social. Trump had participated in a debate against President Joe Biden in June before his debate against Harris on Tuesday.

Although Trump touted his performance on Tuesday against Harris, six Republican donors and three Trump advisers who spoke to Reuters earlier this week said they thought Harris had won the debate largely because Trump was unable to stay on message.

The debate attracted 67.1 million television viewers, according to Nielsen data.

Harris, speaking at a rally shortly after Trump’s post went live, said: “I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate.”

### Election promises: Where’s the money?

Before you vote, consider how the promises in the manifestos will be

“Show me the money!” – Tom Cruise in the movie Jerry Maguire

The bottomline is money. How will the Government pay its bills: manage the debt mountain that has been accumulated; pay the salaries and pensions of the bloated bureaucracy and armed forces; and not least, the cost of the many new programs that are being promised as part of the bidding war that we call the Presidential election?

For example, both the SJB and the NPP are promising major housing initiatives, such as low-interest and long-repayment loans and official residences for State employees. Low-interest loans may be given by commercial or State banks, but the subsidy element will have to be borne by Government. Housing for State employees will have to be fully paid by the Government.

### Shallow manifestos and the 12-point economic challenge

Irrespective of who becomes President, implementation of any of these manifestos, as usual, would be impossible – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Election manifestos of all main contenders are out, and by and large it has followed the precedence over the last so many decades. Increase salaries for the public sector, lower PAYE tax, and long lists of prosperity. There is little indication as to how all these would be achieved, how much funds would be allocated to accomplish each task and how these funds would be obtained, etc.

There is a more recent tendency to show lengthy 200, 300 page manifestos to give the impression of a detailed study. On the contrary, although the problems are complex, a truly detailed analysis should result in a short, concise and simple action plan which is implementable. Complex, lengthy solutions are unlikely to be implemented and what could be achieved in a period of five years is limited (remember the infamous lengthy Budget speech of 2015?).

Excessive money printing is harmful to the economy as it could fuel inflation caused by too much money chasing too few goods, and destabilise the economy

An evaluation one year into implementation of Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act

Printing money to finance Government budget deficit (also called monetary financing) has been a major concern in recent years in Sri Lanka

Exterminators PLC, Sri Lanka’s premier pest management and environmental technology company, has remarkably demonstrated financial resilience during FY24, achieving notable profitability despite prevailing economic challenges. The company reported a staggering 167% increase in net profit and an extraordinary 352% rise in profit before tax, alongside a 143% growth in operating profit compared to the previous fiscal year. Notably, while overall sales dipped by 7%, revenue from service activities saw a modest increase of 3%. This commendable performance, however, was not without its hurdles. A significant decline of 85% in revenue from international brands can be attributed to stringent import restrictions and diminished consumer purchasing power, primarily due to economic instability. The impact of increased corporate tax, along with the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) and (SSCL), further exacerbated the challenges.

### The Conscience: The Birthright Tool For Integrity – Can Politicians Help Restore It?

In a world that often celebrates external achievements, wealth, and influence, true visionary leadership lies in something far deeper: a steadfast commitment to inward integrity and honesty. Visionaries are not only those who have achieved great things in their respective fields but also those who have turned inward and aligned their actions with an unwavering moral compass. This self-honesty transcends academic qualifications, social status, or political power. In fact, anyone with an average education or rational mind and a deep sense of self-integrity can become a visionary, one who influences the world by playing with the human mind and spirit through honesty.

### “Far Horizons”

*2024-09-12 22:55:01* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/far-horizons/) · `en`

“There was one daily newspaper in the Ivory Coast, at least, only one came my way. It was called Fraternite’ Matin. Every day on its front page, in the top left -hand corner, it carried a ‘thought” of the President’s. The thoughts were mainly about development and the economy; and so were big front- page stories” – The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro – VS Naipaul

Of all the extra-parliamentary convulsions that have happened all too regularly in this country since independence, the mass protest movement which occurred two years ago, commonly referred to as the ‘aragalaya’ (struggle?), is certainly unique.

The ‘aragalaya’ was primarily against a popularly elected President, who was relatively new in office then. That fact alone is not exceptional in this troubled country, in our recent history there have been several large scale uprisings against elected governments, even new governments, the 1971 April insurrection being one example.
