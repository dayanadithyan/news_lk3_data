The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday as fighting raged in Gaza and Israeli tanks advanced deeper in parts of the enclave, residents and officials said.

The armed wing of Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas, said its fighters fired rockets towards several Israeli communities near the fence with Gaza in response to ‚Äúthe crimes of the Zionist enemy against our Palestinian people‚Äù.

The volley of around 20 rockets caused no casualties, the Israeli military said. But the attack showed militants still possess rocket capabilities almost nine months into an offensive that Israel says is aimed at neutralising threats against it.

Violence also flared on Monday in the Israeli occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian health ministry said a woman and a boy were killed in the city of Tulkarm during an operation by Israeli forces. A day earlier, an Israeli strike in the same area killed an Islamic Jihad member.

Ranil Wickremesinghe has continued to investigate the registration of the coalition and consistently made an attempt to continue as a people's ungodly president. We suspect that he was doing the full job of disregarding the elections and doing a democratic improper action.

When there is a matter of fact that the president has come into parliament without a public order, he is acting in the hope that he should continue to hold power without holding any election.

Not only that, but we have formed this alliance with three parties from the South.

Behind the scenes at the¬†first debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the buzzy atmosphere of the spin room¬†descended into horror-struck silence¬†within a first few minutes of Biden opening his mouth. Watching the exchanges between them, the debate looked akin to participating in elder abuse, pestering old men with incessant questions as if to deny them the dignity of their dotage. Biden from the moment he shuffled onstage and muttered his first answer in a hushed and wheezing monotone, made it clear that he will be too old for the job whether now, and surely for another four-year term.

### Politics and the Plantation Wage

*2024-07-01 11:00:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/politics-and-the-plantation-wage/) ¬∑ `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe chose the Ceylon Workers‚Äô Congress May Day platform, in Kotagala, to announce the increase of the plantation workers‚Äô daily wage to Rs 1,700.00. An unexpected presidential fiat, delivered just a few months before a possible election by a potential presidential candidate, was made public from the political platform of a major plantation trade union, generally seen as pro-government. The self-evident political implications do not merit either debate or elaboration.

In a rational world, in any industry, the employer and the employee should arrive at a fair wage through a consultative process. The unsolicited intervention of a third force with an agenda unrelated to the interests of either party, is undesirable from all points of view. Still, there are precedents, when sitting presidents have mandated wage increases in the plantation sector, for patently political reasons, ignoring the possible toxic economic consequences.
