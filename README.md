ECONOMYNEXT тАФ Research by free market think tank Advocata has found that persistent disparities in financial and digital literacy are major hindrances to women achieving financial independence in Sri Lanka, a country whose female labour force participation is half of that of men.

The study has found that, despite a commendable literacy rate, disparities in financial and digital literacy hinders access to financial services.

The Advocata Institute said in a statement on the study that Sri Lanka has been struggling with inadequate digital infrastructure and a regulatory environment where vulnerable populations, notably women, face exploitation and marginalisation which contributed to restricting womenтАЩs access to finance. Other barriers, which include the lack of digital and financial literacy, drove consumers, especially women, towards informal financial services.
