The Sectoral Oversight Committee on Alleviating the Impact of the Economic Crisis has emphasised the need to foster entrepreneurship and has instructed officials to organise awareness programs across all districts in Sri Lanka.

This recommendation came during a recent committee meeting in Parliament, chaired by Member of Parliament Gamini Waleboda.

The committee inquired about the current engagement of investors in the stock market. Officials reported that approximately 850,000 accounts are linked to stock market investments, with about 200,000 of these accounts being actively used.

In efforts to strengthen the progress of the Colombo stock market, the committee discussed potential actions that the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka could undertake.

The Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front mourns the loss of Rajavarothayam Sampanthan, a key figure in the Tamil National Alliance advocating for Tamil rights in Sri Lanka. Sampanthan, known for his efforts towards establishing a dignified and secure life for Tamils, both through peaceful means and armed struggle, leaves behind a legacy of fighting for self-determination within a unified Sri Lanka. Despite criticism, his contributions to Tamil nationalism and human rights advocacy are undeniable.

The voice of Sampanthan Iyer, who voiced for the Tamil people, silenced the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front to express its deepest condolences to the demise of Rajavarothayam Sampanthan, a member of the Sri Lanka Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and Trincomalee.

The full details of the media report issued by Surosh Premachandran, the leader of the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front:-

The news that the Tamil people of the Eelam Tamil people have been relentlessly for the rights of the Tamil people, who has been in the mood for the rights of the Tamil people to live with all the rights on this soil and live with dignity and security.

He came together in a long -standing democratic heritage and worked with the armed struggle during the armed struggle.

### Imputed rental income tax: Gateway to corruption on a massive scale

*2024-07-01 23:21:49* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Imputed-rental-income-tax-Gateway-to-corruption-on-a-massive-scale/4-763721) ¬∑ `en`

This flawed system provides the assessor a great deal of authority and gives them the opportunity to pocket a buck for themselves

By 1 April 2025 the Government proposes to implement a wealth tax by way of an ‚Äúimputed rental income‚Äù on property as a precursor to a land tax. In simple terms the meaning of ‚Äúimputed rental income‚Äù is the estimated rental income of a property if it were rented. The mere assumption of a rental income is very much subjective and cannot in any effect be a guide to govern taxes.

In reality, imputed rent is exactly what the Local Councils are already obtaining from property owners by way of Municipality Rates. Hence the new ‚Äúimputed rental income‚Äù is just a facade to re-tax the citizen who is already taxed twice over on the same income, first by the Municipality on the imputed rent and secondly by the Inland Revenue based on actual income of the same property.

### When one thing leads to nothing

In the late 1970s, during the rising tide of neoliberal globalisation, many countries in the Global South opened up their economies to foreign capital in order to build a so-called export-oriented economy. The ethos that drove such reforms can be divided into two camps:

In China, pragmatism prevailed, with Chairman Deng Xiaoping stating, ‚ÄúTo cross the river, feel for the stones.‚Äù

In Sri Lanka, there was an ideological faith in markets and foreign capital, with then President J.R. Jayewardene stating, ‚ÄúLet the robber barons come.‚Äù

Today, one of these countries has defaulted on its external debt and is undergoing its 17th IMF program. The other is the world‚Äôs factory, contributing to over 35% of global manufacturing value-added and expected to lead the next business cycle. No prizes for guessing which is which.

‚ÄúI have safely brought the Titanic, entrusted to me, to port. While other captains fled from the iceberg, we faced a critical decision: sink or navigate to safety. Now that we‚Äôve reached port, the question is what to do next with this ship. We must decide whether to refurbish it for the next 50-100 years or hand it over in its current state to a fleeing captain.

When I arrived here today, memories of the hardships faced by the Matara people flooded back. I vividly recall spending the Sinhala New Year 2022 in Kamburupitiya, where a filling station near my hotel was constantly crowded with long queues of vehicles. Witnessing the people‚Äôs suffering and frustration, I resolved that such scenes must not recur in our country.

### Palestinian militants fire rockets into Israel, tanks advance in Gaza

The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday as fighting raged in Gaza and Israeli tanks advanced deeper in parts of the enclave, residents and officials said.

The armed wing of Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas, said its fighters fired rockets towards several Israeli communities near the fence with Gaza in response to ‚Äúthe crimes of the Zionist enemy against our Palestinian people‚Äù.

The volley of around 20 rockets caused no casualties, the Israeli military said. But the attack showed militants still possess rocket capabilities almost nine months into an offensive that Israel says is aimed at neutralising threats against it.

Violence also flared on Monday in the Israeli occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian health ministry said a woman and a boy were killed in the city of Tulkarm during an operation by Israeli forces. A day earlier, an Israeli strike in the same area killed an Islamic Jihad member.

### Government's efforts to postpone elections - Leading negotiations with election commissioner

*2024-07-01 16:40:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187412) ¬∑ `ta`

The People's Movement Front accuses the government of plotting to delay elections, citing discussions with the Election Commissioner and concerns over President Ranil Wickremesinghe's actions. They allege his attempts to maintain power without conducting elections and form alliances with southern parties, questioning his commitment to democracy.

üü©

The People's Movement Front has today held talks with the Commissioner of Elections on the government's conspiracies to postpone the elections

Social political activist Rajkumar Rajeevkan said that the meeting was also investigated on the registration of the people's struggle and the preparation for elections.

Ranil Wickremesinghe has continued to investigate the registration of the coalition and consistently made an attempt to continue as a people's ungodly president. We suspect that he was doing the full job of disregarding the elections and doing a democratic improper action.

When there is a matter of fact that the president has come into parliament without a public order, he is acting in the hope that he should continue to hold power without holding any election.

Not only that, but we have formed this alliance with three parties from the South.
