The U.S. military launched an air assault on dozens of sites in Iraq and Syria used by Iranian-backed militias and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Friday, in the opening salvo of retaliation for the drone strike that killed three U.S. troops in Jordan last weekend.

The massive barrage of strikes hit more than 85 targets at seven locations, including command and control headquarters, intelligence centers, rockets and missiles, drone and ammunition storage sites and other facilities that were connected to the militias or the IRGC’s Quds Force, the Guard’s expeditionary unit that handles Tehran’s relationship with and arming of regional militias. And President Joe Biden made it clear in a statement that there will be more to come.

### CBK back in the fray to lead SLFP-LED People’s Alliance

*2024-02-03 09:46:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/CBK-back-in-the-fray-to-lead-SLFP-LED-Peoples-Alliance/108-276270) · `en`

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has reinstated the membership of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, enabling her to lead the party-dominated Podujana Eksath Peramuna (People’s Alliance), the Daily Mirror learns.

SLFP leader former President Maithripala Sirisena has already informed Ms. Kumaratunga about the membership reinstatement. The party has now decided to revive the People’s Alliance under its chair symbol. The alliance was originally formed ahead of the general election in 1994 as a move to defeat the 17-year rule of the United National Party (UNP). The People’s Alliance remained in power until 2001 when it was defeated by the UNP again.

In 2004, the SLFP took the lead in forming the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA).

Since then, the People’s Alliance remained idle in politics. In what appeared to be a new political development ahead of the presidential elections, it will be revived with Ms. Kumaratunga as the leader.

Jaffna offers little hope of recovery. People talk much of an intellectual revival but I see few signs of it. Indeed, there is no sign of English revival. Without it, there can be no intellectual revival. I see greater hope in the visibly evident emerging service industries doing more for us than the university where there is a great problem in the use of English. The much touted Engineering Faculty is running aground with few Ph.D holders teaching. The signs are that the Dean too will flee as his term ends. His efforts at recruitment are opposed by his staff threatening to strike should he bring in people of good quality.
