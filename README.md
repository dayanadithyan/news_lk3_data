### Can workers get the salary of the lease agreement?

*2024-03-04 14:37:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177873) · `ta`

Workers' salaries in lease agreements are a complex issue. The Ceylon Workers Congress and unions argue for higher wages, but companies warn of stopping welfare services if basic salaries increase. The 1995 lease agreement between the government and plantation companies led to a joint contract for workers' welfare, but it's unclear if this affects the lease agreement's terms. The 2003 Labor Welfare Joint Agreement, made every three years, includes provisions for fair additional allowances and specific conditions for workers. Despite these agreements, plantation workers' welfare has declined over the years, leading to calls for negotiations and reforms. The government has decided to extend the lease agreement, but unions argue that companies have not complied with agreed salaries.

🟩

Talks about the agony of plantation workers may have begun a goal. When the General Secretary and Minister of the Ceylon Workers Congress, Jeevan Thondaman, during a media briefing held last week, responded to this, the companies say that if the basic salary was paid Rs 1,700, other welfare services would be stopped.. If that happens, he said he would have to lease with companies in this regard.

The unions must understand that the workers' pain and the leasing agreement with the government with the government. At the same time, the unions have forgotten that there is a joint venture on the welfare of the workers.

### Globally, a rightward political shift is visible

*2024-03-04 13:24:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/globally-a-rightward-political-shift-is-visible/) · `en`

The global political scene was very left-inclined from about the mid-1960s to say 10 or 15 years ago. The sweeping trend to social democracy in post-war Europe, a surge to the left throughout Asia (Chinese Revolution, defeat of US Imperialism in Vietnam, post-war USSR, our own JVP) and a little later in Africa (Patrice Lumumba, revolution in Mozambique, Nelson Mandela etc), signposted what may be loosely called a period of global shift to the left. That ended about 10 years ago. The last spurt was perhaps Obama’s re-election. The reverse trend became prominent in the US with Trump and internationally a dynamic that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.

### Factum Perspective: Increasing tensions in the Indian Ocean

*2024-03-04 12:59:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177862) · `ta`

Increasing tensions in the Indian Ocean due to Israel's attack on Hamas, leading to indiscriminate opposition and the involvement of Houthis, Yemen, and Somali pirates. The conflict escalated globally, affecting the US-led coalition and the global economy, with Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, and Syria also involved. The US's handling of the situation, including its contacts with Israel, has been criticized. The situation has become a "universal conflict," with governments supporting different sides, impacting global behavior and order. India plays a significant role in the Indian Ocean, dealing with the Middle East crisis alongside the US. However, India's own issues, including the Gaza crisis and the Maldives, complicate the situation. The situation is further complicated by Sri Lanka's actions in the Red Sea. The UN's role, particularly through Article 99, could have mitigated the conflict.

🟩

When Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, the world's sympathy was seen with the Israeli people. This is a terrorist act and it was formally condemned.

By November, the world began to reflect differently as Israel's opposition became indiscriminate. Palestinian politicians failed to use the support and help of the Arab states to develop their country, thereby allowing Hamas to ensure their position and to undermine the legalization of their justification, and the suffering of the world was so vulnerable.

Then the Houthis began to respond from Yemen, first targeting the ships associated with Israel and gradually expanded to the Western team. We found that the Somali pirates began to work again as a combination of this crisis.

Colombo, March 04 (Daily Mirror) -  The skyrocketing prices of coconuts will have a serious effect on the packed rice and curry meals in the future, as most of the curries are prepared with the coconut cream, food industry trade unions said.

All Island Canteen Owners Association President Rukshan Harshana told the media yesterday the usual price of a coconut, which was at Rs.60 to 80, has increased to almost double. A coconut is currently sold between Rs.120 to 150.

He said the canteen and eatery owners are faced with a serious situation to prepare the rice and curry meal packets under the increased coconut prices, thus in uncertainty of having to sell meal packs for a very high rate.

The unexpected price hike of coconuts comes at a moment when everything else including rice, chicken, eggs and gas has significantly gone up.

Harshana warned that the prices of coconut oil will also go up in the coming days owing to the sudden hike of coconuts.
