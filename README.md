Elections provide a unique situation where people become equal regardless of their class or ethnic and religious identity. This offers space to rival politicians to address their unmet needs. The government has commenced several development initiatives that will take resources to the community level in a targeted manner. These initiatives would be beneficial to the government in mustering support for it at the grassroots level. Those who wield governmental power have the ability to make tangible offerings to the people to secure their vote in a time of elections. The intervention of the Election Commission and civil society organisations in disapproving some of these governmental actions and ensuring free and fair elections needs to be seen in this light.

The police, armed with a court order prohibiting such commemorative events, apprehended the four persons amidst a tense situation, as depicted in video footage showing the women being forcibly taken away.

The arrested were further remanded until 27 May after being presented to the Mutur Magistrates Court yesterday.

In 2016, the Human Rights Commission urged the Government to uphold the right to remember deceased relatives. However, activists view recent police arrests as a grave concern, considering this recommendation.

Born in March 1864, Herbert Rayner Freeman was elected to the Legislative Council-(LG) under the Colebrook Constitution in 1924, representing the North-Central Province

Freeman was known to traverse miles along jungle trails, visiting the ill and those in need, always carrying his iconic umbrella. Remarkably, he even attended court sessions to advocate for individuals he believed had been unfairly accused in criminal cases

Abolish the National List; empower the electorate to choose their representatives. The current system is flawed, with party leaders and secretaries often lacking insight. They appoint individuals with dubious backgrounds, including terrorists and non-citizens, merely for financial gain. This practice undermines the credibility of our democratic principles and turns them into a farce. LetтАЩs restore integrity to our electoral process by allowing people to have a direct say in who represents them.

August was the best month for schools in Kandy Lake Round. We used to get a long school vacation as schools closed to house the forces providing security to the Esala Perahera. Ice cream carts, cotton candy vendors, popcorn, isso-wadai, balloon animals, sadda-nalaa  [whistles for the lack of an English equivalent], glowsticks; August was carnivalesque for my childhood self.

### Government proposes law to co-opt and control non-governmental activity

*2024-05-13 22:53:13* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Government-proposes-law-to-co-opt-and-control-non-governmental-activity/4-761732) ┬╖ `en`

While we challenge these individual attempts to dismantle our freedoms and rights, it is important to take a step back and see the monstrous governance apparatus that is growing

The proposed scheme appears to introduce legal legitimacy for the current oppressive treatment of non-governmental organisations. The scheme explicitly requires organisations to comply with governmental policy and agenda, rendering unlawful those who may criticise, challenge and question Government policy and agendas. It seeks to assert authority over all forms of non-governmental associations, groups and activities by introducing mandatory registration, whilst retaining powers to give directions to institutions that are specifically excluded from registration. The Government investment in the institutional mechanism and apparatus to oversee, supervise and direct non-governmental resources and activity is quite simply a taking control of the vast breadth of institutions and groups

### Electricity sector: What Rohan Samarajiva didnтАЩt say

Samarajiva bemoans the fact that wind projects in Sri Lanka must pass an environmental impact┬а assessment whereas those in India need not. And that is somehow a good thing?

In his article, тАЬElectricity sector: Without investment we will be in the dark againтАЭ (Daily FT, 7 April, 2024), Professor Rohan Samarajiva, evidently the latest apologist for IndiaтАЩs Adani Group, writes, тАЬAn eminent public intellectual, Rohan Pethiyagoda, bemoans the fact that a unit of electricity produced by the wind power facility proposed by Adani will cost more than wind-produced electricity in the US and in India.тАЭ He goes on, in the manner of a gifted prestidigitator, to cite a litany of excuses that argue for waiving the rules to help Adani cream of more than $ 700 million in excess profits from Sri Lankan electricity consumers. Much of what he writes consists purely of smoke and mirrors. But letтАЩs cut to the bone.

(Reuters) - France won a record 15 billion euros ($16.17 billion) in foreign investment pledges on Monday, allowing President Emmanuel Macron to bask in the limelight with global CEOs and forget about strained public finances and weak polls for a while.

The bumper crop of pledges, in sectors ranging from artificial intelligence to pharmaceuticals and energy, stood Macron in good stead as he hosted business leaders for the annual тАЬChoose FranceтАЭ summit at Versailles Palace.

This yearтАЩs figure is up from 13 billion euros announced in 2023.

The French presidency said the investments included 56 different business projects and could lead to the creation of 10,000 jobs.

Microsoft said it would invest 4 billion euros in France in its cloud and AI infrastructure, expanding its centres in Paris and Marseilles and adding a new data centre in the eastern city of Mulhouse.
