### Gotabaya inherited a collapsed govt, not the strong one built by Mahinda, claims Namal

SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa has claimed that a serious conspiracy was underway to overthrow the government established by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

He stated that this conspiracy involved several forces even within the government itself.

тАЬThe conspiracy was internal, with international forces and terror groups also attempting to destabilize the government. As a result, the тАШYahapalanaтАЩ (good governance) government was formed. Gotabaya Rajapaksa inherited a collapsed government, not the strong one built by Mahinda Rajapaksa,тАЭ he added.

He made these comments while addressing the inaugural constituency conference of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) held in Thalawa on Sunday (26), under the patronage of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Despite attending the event, Mahinda Rajapaksa did not address the gathering during the conference.

### SLFP faction led by ex-President Maithripala relocates operations

In light of the current political situation, the faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by former President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to carry out the future activities of the party from a new location instead of the party headquarters.

Reportedly, this new location in Colombo will replace the SLFP headquarters on Darley Road, Colombo 10, for future political activities.

The partyтАЩs internal sources said that ongoing internal conflicts and court orders have made it impractical to convene constituency and district organizers of the party at a permanent location.

Therefore, the faction led by former President Sirisena has deemed it more appropriate to operate from a different location. The new political center will serve as a venue to convene district and constituency organizers from across the island to discuss upcoming political matters, as per sources.

### Hundreds of birds and fish dead in Anawilundawa sanctuary: Cause under investigation

Hundreds of birds and fish in the bird sanctuary in Anawilundawa Ramsar wetland and its watercourses have been dying for the last several days, much to the anxiety of the residents of the area and the environmentalists.

Residents of the area said flocks of migratory birds live and breed freely during this season in Anawilundawa Ramsar bird sanctuary, which is a tourist attraction.

They were of the opinion that chemical waste dumped haphazardly from a factory in the area resulted in the death of birds and fish in this manner.

Meanwhile, Range Forest Conservator W.L. Upananda said he referred specimens of the dead fish and birds to the Peradeniya Special Veterinary Unit for laboratory tests to determine the cause of death. He said the results of the laboratory tests were yet to be received.

However, officials of the Aqua Culture Development Authority said watercourses had been contaminated due to neglect of clearing algae, resulting in the death of fish and birds.

The Students Visa, a premier student migration consultancy hosted the тАЬEducate to ElevateтАЭ panel discussion at Hatch Works, Colombo. This event aimed to shed light on the boundless educational opportunities available in the United Kingdom, a country renowned for its prestigious higher education system.

Sri Lanka is a significant market for UK higher education, particularly in the realm of transnational education. In recent years, Sri Lanka has recorded the third-highest number of students pursuing UK qualifications internationally. Each year, approximately 160,000 Sri Lankan students are ready for tertiary education. However, with state universities able to enrol only 42,000 students annually, competition for these limited spots is fierce. In 2022, only 23% of the 166,938 qualifying students gained admission to state universities. As a result, around 29,000 students seek higher education abroad each year, with an additional 60,000 engaging in various academic programs.

The trending theme in Sri Lanka in the recent past are the probable alliances and crossovers between political parties/politicians targeting the Presidential elections 2024. Whilst there can be merit to this approach of influencing a Sri Lankan voter, what many forget is that this type of тАШconsumer behaviourтАЩ will not be the reality this year. For instance, a research insight shows that when voting happens in Sri Lanka, the floating vote is around forty percent. Some speculate that the floating percentage can be higher given the low confidence the public has towards politicians. LetтАЩs accept the fact that environmental conditions together with poor decision making by politicians made Sri Lanka become a bankrupt state. The IMF clearly stipulates that the Governance Diagnostic Assessment report reveals severe Governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities across functions contributed to the financial collapse of Sri Lanka.
