### The Falcon and Falconer

*2024-04-11 05:24:15* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-Falcon-and-Falconer/4-760583) ┬╖ `en`

No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable.

тАЬThe difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones.тАЭ

It is showdown time. I borrowed the caption from the тАШThe Second ComingтАЩ by W.B. Yeats. Things fall apart and the centre cannot hold. Passionate intensity dictates debate.

The next election, Presidential or Parliamentary will be a тАШhead-to-headтАЩ encounter between the тАШdominantтАЩ and the тАШdominated.тАЩ

Despite polls and engineered parades, the dismantling of the hegemony of the dominant class is not a certainty. Since hope is not optimism, I would say that it is a near certainty.

The Bastille will be breached. If not totally, substantially. 2024 is the year when people of Sri Lanka will prove Heraclitus right. тАЬNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for itтАЩs not the same river and heтАЩs not the same man.тАЭ

Paris, April 10 (The Guardian) - Sebastian Coe has defended World AthleticsтАЩ decision to break with 128 years of Olympic tradition by becoming the first sport to give athletes prize money if they are victorious in Paris this summer.

Coe said the surprise move, under which gold medal-winning athletes in each of the sportтАЩs 48 events will walk away with $50,000 (┬г39,360), was merely a reflection that the world has changed and said it was time his sport gave more to its stars.

However the decision clearly blindsided the International Olympic Committee, which has never awarded money for participating or winning a medal, as it believes that to compete at a Games is reward enough.

Asked whether the announcement would violate the Olympic spirit, Coe was clear. тАЬI donтАЩt think it does,тАЭ he replied.
