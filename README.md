Australian employees can now ignore work emails and calls thanks to a new ‚Äúright to disconnect‚Äù law designed to curb those and other intrusions into personal lives.

The new rule, which came into force on Monday, means employees, in most cases, cannot be punished for refusing to read or respond to contacts from their employers outside work hours.

Supporters say the law gives workers the confidence to stand up against the steady invasion of their personal lives by work emails, texts and calls, a trend that has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic scrambled the division between home and work.

‚ÄúBefore we had digital technology there was no encroachment, people would go home at the end of a shift and there would be no contact until they returned the following day,‚Äù said John Hopkins, an associate professor at Swinburne University of Technology.

‚ÄúNow, globally it‚Äôs the norm to have emails, SMS, phone calls outside those hours, even when on holiday.‚Äù

### Israel and Hezbollah in major missile exchange as escalation fears grow

Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel early on Sunday, as Israel‚Äôs military said it struck Lebanon with around 100 jets to thwart a larger attack, in one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare.

Missiles were visible curling up through the dawn sky, dark vapour trails behind them, as an air raid siren sounded in Israel and a distant blast lit the horizon, while smoke rose over houses in Khiam in southern Lebanon.

On Sunday evening, sirens sounded in Rishon Letsiyon, central Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said, and added that one projectile had been identified crossing from the southern Gaza Strip and falling in an open area. The armed wing of Hamas said it had fired an ‚ÄúM90‚Äù rocket at Tel Aviv.

Any major spillover in the fighting, which began in parallel with the war in Gaza, risks morphing into a regional conflagration drawing in Hezbollah‚Äôs backer Iran and Israel‚Äôs main ally the United States.

As long as the people keep asking for giveaways as against conditions for life improvement, the takaran era will not end ‚Äì Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

The politician who some time back promised to zero out VAT, has now retreated to saying that VAT will be removed for educational and healthcare services (leaving aside the fact that most of these services are already exempt from VAT). Even then, he is being challenged to explain how the shortfall is going to be covered

The country stands at a critical juncture, where the only viable path forward is the digitalisation of customs and trade operations.

These antiquated, paper-based customs processes are no match for the demands of the modern global economy, where speed, accuracy, and transparency are paramount. Instead, they are plagued by errors, deliberate delays, and a lack of accountability, allowing corrupt practices to thrive unchecked. As global trade standards become stricter, the need for transparent, secure, and efficient customs operations has never been more urgent.
