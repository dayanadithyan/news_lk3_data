### ‘As long as country faces budget deficit, borrowing is necessary’ – CBSL Governor

*2024-07-06 11:28:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100329/as-long-as-country-faces-budget-deficit-borrowing-is-necessary-cbsl-governor) · `en`

In a recent interview, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Dr Nandalal Weerasinghe addressed misconceptions regarding Sri Lanka’s total debt, clarifying that the increase from USD 96 billion in December 2023 to a projected USD 100 billion by March 2024 is largely due to exchange rate fluctuations rather than new borrowing.

Joining an interview held at the Presidential Media Centre on Friday (05), the CBSL Governor said that despite a detailed explanation of this made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament recently, some have mistakenly interpreted the rise as an increase from USD 70 billion to USD 100 billion.

Commenting in this regard, Dr. Weerasinghe added: “The status of the debt as of March 2024 was outlined in the Debt Bulletin you referenced. The entire loan amount is denominated in US dollars, totaling USD 100 billion. As you know, our country manages both domestic and foreign debts, with foreign loans typically in dollars.

### Explanation of the relief received

*2024-07-06 10:47:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/198530) · `si`

Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Central Bank Governor of Sri Lanka, discussed the relief offered by bilateral debt restructurings, emphasizing that such relief is extended universally to all countries facing similar situations. He highlighted two main forms of relief: extending the repayment period and reducing interest rates, both aimed at easing the debt burden. Weerasinghe also addressed criticisms about unfair loan comparisons between countries, stating that the focus should be on each country's unique circumstances rather than direct comparisons. He clarified that the goal of seeking such relief is not to favor one country over another but to manage national debt effectively and ensure economic stability.

🟩

Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe says that the relief provided by bilateral debt borrowers has been given the relief to Sri Lanka.

He was speaking at an interview to educate the restructuring of debt.

The Central Bank Governor further explained that comparing Sri Lanka is not a right to provide credit relief to various countries.

"There are several ways to provide credit relief when it comes to agree with bilateral creditors. If you have to pay in 10 years, the basic debt, get paid 20 in 20 if you bought $ 100. In fact, the 100 rupees will be borrowed today and will be able to pay for 10 years in 10 years.. One is the relief. Bilateral borrowers give this process to all countries by extending the time to pay the debt. "

"The second relief is like 2% more than 3%, 4%, 5%, 5%, 6%. Decreases time to reduce interest rates. When the two adds, our debt is a significant amount of value. The end result, which is 30% less than 30%. "

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s remittances coming through official channels gained 11.4 percent to $3.14 billion in the first six months of 2024 compared to the same period last year, helped by more expatriates using the official banking channels.

The remittances in June were $519.6 million, 9.2 percent up from the same month last year, the official data showed.

The remittances have risen continuously after the central bank gave up a parallel exchange rate regime, which compelled most expatriates to switch informal Undiyal and Hawala money transfer methods.

The island nation witnessed a 57 percent jump in remittances coming through formal banking channels to $5.97 billion in 2023, from $3.8 billion a year earlier, helped by elimination of parallel exchange rate.

The island nation has been in the process of sending more migrant workers to bring in higher foreign exchange since the country declared bankruptcy in 2022.

### The government that makes agreements for the future of the country must win the confidence of the people and the opposition

*2024-07-06 01:43:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187795) · `ta`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe's regime, facing criticism for its handling of Sri Lanka's economic crisis, has secured international debt relief totaling $580 million. Despite initial praise from key nations like the US, Japan, India, and the IMF, there's concern over transparency and equal treatment of all creditors, especially China. The government's strategy includes delaying bilateral loan repayments until 2028 and extending the repayment period until 2043. However, the public reception remains mixed, with no immediate economic benefits seen by ordinary citizens. The cost of living continues to rise, and despite promises to maintain social spending, actual reductions have occurred. The government's shift towards privatizing education has also sparked protests, highlighting broader discontent with the administration's economic policies and lack of engagement with public concerns.

🟩

President Ranil Wickremesinghe has spoken to the victory of his regime that has rescued Sri Lanka from its international bankruptcy, while still less than a month before the presidential election.. The agreement signed by the Official Credit Committee Committee, which has given bilateral loans to Sri Lanka, has been celebrated in various ways on the International Debt Relief for US $ 580 crore.

The President delivered a special speech to the nation. Fireworks celebrations were held in various cities. The president proudly declared that he was the sculptor of the Economic Recovery of Sri Lanka.

The systemic stigmatisation of minority religious groups during a global health crisis not only violates medical ethics but also exacerbates societal divisions, especially in a country scarred by decades of civil war

Sri Lanka initially stood out as a success story in South Asia during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020. However, this success wasn’t merely luck or a reflection of a robust health system. Instead, it was largely attributed to the impending parliamentary elections.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s forex reserves rose 221 million dollars to 5,642 million US dollars in June 2024 from a month earlier.

### 7 g - Review

*2024-07-05 17:11:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187771) · `ta`

"7G," a ghost film directed by Haroon, revolves around IT professional Rajiv (Roshan Bashir) and his wife Varsha (Smriti Venkat), who move into a haunted apartment named '7G.' Unsettling occurrences begin when Rajiv's ex-girlfriend, Nisha (Sneha Gupta), performs black magic. The plot thickens with the revelation that the house belonged to Manjula (Sonia Agarwal), who died there under mysterious circumstances. Varsha aids Manjula's spirit, leading to its departure from the house. Despite initial intrigue, the film lacks novelty and tests the audience's patience with predictable ghostly elements.
