The trending theme in Sri Lanka in the recent past are the probable alliances and crossovers between political parties/politicians targeting the Presidential elections 2024. Whilst there can be merit to this approach of influencing a Sri Lankan voter, what many forget is that this type of ‚Äòconsumer behaviour‚Äô will not be the reality this year. For instance, a research insight shows that when voting happens in Sri Lanka, the floating vote is around forty percent. Some speculate that the floating percentage can be higher given the low confidence the public has towards politicians. Let‚Äôs accept the fact that environmental conditions together with poor decision making by politicians made Sri Lanka become a bankrupt state. The IMF clearly stipulates that the Governance Diagnostic Assessment report reveals severe Governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities across functions contributed to the financial collapse of Sri Lanka.

State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya announced that preliminary work to modernise the Customs Department auction process will commence via online this week.

‚ÄúThe initiative aims to allow all interested parties to participate in customs auctions remotely, thereby reducing undue influence and ensuring transparency,‚Äù he added.

Siyambalapitiya highlighted that this reform will enable individuals and businesses to bid on auctioned goods from the comfort of their homes. This move is intended to mitigate the influence of various constitutive groups that have previously affected the clearance of goods by customs.

In response to several reported instances of such undue influence, he emphasised the necessity of this overhaul to safeguard the integrity of the auction process. By facilitating remote participation, the Government aims to create a fair and competitive environment for all bidders.

Cites UN report calling for international prosecutions for enforced disappearances

Sri Lankan authorities have threatened and detained Tamils commemorating those who died or went missing in the country‚Äôs civil war, Human Rights Watch said last week.

On 17 May the United Nations human rights office issued a report calling for international prosecutions and other accountability measures to address the thousands of unresolved cases of enforced disappearances in the war, which ended on 18 May 18, 2009.

‚ÄúThe Sri Lankan Government is in denial about atrocities its forces committed during the civil war, so it tries to silence victims and their communities instead of providing truth, justice, and reparations,‚Äù said Human Rights Watch Asia Director Elaine Pearson. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that more international action is needed to bring relief to victims and prevent a recurrence of abuses.‚Äù

### 15 years after end of war, victims and survivors still await justice and accountability: ICJ

*2024-05-27 00:43:55* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/15-years-after-end-of-war-victims-and-survivors-still-await-justice-and-accountability-ICJ/56-762178) ¬∑ `en`

As Sri Lanka marked 15 years since the end of a decades-long armed conflict on 18 May, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) deplored the near total impunity that has prevailed, and lack of victim-centred justice and accountability for war time atrocities.

The ICJ calls on the responsible authorities to reverse course and take measures that will provide real access to justice for the conflict‚Äôs numerous victims and survivors and bring those responsible for crimes under international law to account.

The bleak picture is reinforced by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in a report released on 17 May, titled Accountability for Enforced Disappearances in Sri Lanka. The report notes the near total impunity enjoyed by perpetrators of widespread enforced disappearances over four decades and a systematic failure to account for the fate and whereabouts of victims.

### Why Sri Lanka needs to ditch post-dated cheques

*2024-05-27 00:26:09* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-Sri-Lanka-needs-to-ditch-post-dated-cheques/4-762177) ¬∑ `en`

A post-dated cheque represents a future promise to pay, not a¬†completed transaction

A post-dated cheque is a regular cheque with a future date written on it. This means the cheque writer instructs the bank not to pay the cheque until that future date arrives.

Purpose: People use them to ensure the recipient waits to deposit the cheque. There are a couple of reasons for this:

The writer doesn‚Äôt have enough funds currently but expects to by the future date.

The cheque is for a prepayment, like paying for a service before it‚Äôs completed.

Validity: The rules around post-dated cheques can vary depending on the country. In some places, like the US and UK, banks can process them even before the written date. In other places, like India and Australia, the bank has to wait until the date on the cheque.

Legality: Post-dated cheques are generally legal and considered negotiable instruments.

Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs state visit to China is more than a show of friendship and unity in adversity.

### Presidential pardons -for whose benefit? - EDITORIAL

*2024-05-27 00:01:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Presidential-pardons-for-whose-benefit-EDITORIAL/172-283379) ¬∑ `en`

The large-scale pardoning of prisoners by Lankan Presidents for the commission of minor crimes has become customary during particular festivals, for example the day marking the country‚Äôs independence, Vesak and Christmas.

Often these pardons have been granted to persons who were among those taken in for commission of petty criminal activity.

The Task Force on Judicial and Legal Causes for Prison Overcrowding and Prison Reforms reveals that nearly 52 percent of the prison population consists of persons unconvicted of any crime.

While the total prison capacity in the country in 2022 stood at 11,291 inmates, the report added the number of imprisoned reached 26,176 individuals by the end of 2022. The number comprised 16,727 suspects and 9,449 convicts.

To make matters worse, during these trying times, the state spends around Rs. 8.3 billion to look after the prisoners.

Given these circumstances, many of our people hardly ever opposed the freeing of prisoners by the head of state.

‚ÄúOur ability to reach unity in diversity will be the beauty and test of our civilisation,‚Äù said Mahatma Gandhi. In fact, it is our duty to ensure that beauty of unity in diversity. It is encouraging to see people from all walks of life coming forward with rare unity despite typical blame games of opportunistic politicians. Vesak as a festival of light was a reassurance of ‚ÄúApekema‚Äù (the ‚ÄúSriLankanness‚Äù) dispelling the darkness of chaos and confusion. The starting point of such a rich experience is the inner serenity or stillness.
