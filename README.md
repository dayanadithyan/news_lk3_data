### Reduced diesel price not sufficient for bus fare revision: Gemunu

Colombo, May 1 (Daily Mirror) - Following the price reduction of Lanka auto diesel from last night, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijerathne said today that this fuel price revision is insufficient for a bus fare revision at this time.

Addressing the media he said that according to the National Bus Fare Policy, the recent amount of the fuel price revision cannot be calculated.

Accordingly, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) reduced the retail price of a litre of Lanka auto diesel by Rs. 30 with effect from last night.

"During the past months, we provided the service while incurring a loss of Rs. 27 per litre of diesel. Even after the previous fuel price revision the association had taken a decision not to go for a fuel price revision as it was not even 4% of the minimum fare hike needed for a fare revision.

"According to the policy calculation, only Rs. 3 will be reduced from the bus fare, but it is not more than the minimum calculation of 4%.

Today is International WorkersтАЩ Day, also known as Labour Day, which is observed annually on May 1 in Sri Lanka and the world at large.

The day, which has its origins in the labour union movement, specifically the eight-hour day movement, is a celebration of labourers and the working classes that is promoted by the international labour movement.

May 1 is observed as an ancient northern hemisphere spring festival, however, it became associated with the labour movement in the late 19th century after trade unions and socialist groups designated it as a day in support of workers.

The date was chosen to be International WorkersтАЩ Day to commemorate the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago in the US, in which a peaceful rally in support of workers led to a violent clash with the police, leading to the deaths of at least 38 civilians and 7 police officers.

While 60 police officers and 115 civilians were injured. Those who died due to the clash were hailed as тАЬHaymarket MartyrsтАЭ.

Although giving free handouts was the order of the day, Premadasa policies were able to change this concept by pushing economic development to the provinces. He did this by inviting the private sector businessmen to set up garment factories in the rural areas which provided employment and brought in the much needed foreign exchange.

Representatives of the SJB Economic Policy Committee, such as Eran Wickramaratne and Harsha de Silva, seem to have launched a strong attack on the NPP questioning the latter on economic policy matters.

One of the significant themes recurring in this attack is frequent references made to terms such as Socialism and Marxism. Addressing a press conference last week, MP Harsha de Silva stated that if the NPP Economic Council is not willing to come for a debate, the SJB economic committee trio would like to have the debate at the Galle Face Green, with cutouts of Marx, Engels, and Lenin in the opposing side.

The Gampaha High Court the Trial-at-Bar has deferred delivering the verdict in the case against a Brigadier and three soldiers of the Sri Lanka Army over the shooting to death of three persons and injuring several others during a protest by villagers demanding clean drinking water at Weliweriya Gampaha.

The court was scheduled to deliver its verdict yesterday, however when the case was taken up the Trial-at-Bar announced that the verdict will be delivered on 17 May 2024.

On 1 August in 2013, army personnel opened fire at unarmed locals at Weliweriya, killing three and injuring several others, as they protested against a factory which they said polluted their groundwater and demanded clean drinking water.

In 2019, then Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya appointed a Trial-at-Bar consisting of High Court Judges Menaka Wijesundara (President), Nimal Ranaweera and Nishantha Hapuarachchi to hear the Rathupaswala case, after considering the Attorney GeneralтАЩs request.
