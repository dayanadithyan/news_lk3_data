   - Competition with other countries like Vietnam



3. Education reform proposals:

   - Improve school infrastructure

   - Reduce distance between homes and schools

   - Expand curriculum to include emotional intelligence, physical health, and spirituality

   - Implement a more holistic approach to education

   - Monthly allowances for families struggling financially

   - Remove taxes on food, education, and healthcare

   - Reduce electricity and fuel prices

   - Ensure equal opportunities regardless of location, nationality, or disability



### Suggestions

   - Invest in infrastructure development to attract foreign investment



2. Education reform:

   - Implement a modular education system allowing students to choose courses based on interests

   - Incorporate vocational training to prepare students for the job market

   - Increase teacher training and resources



3. Social welfare programs:

   - Implement a targeted subsidy system to reach those most in need

4. Foreign investment strategy:

   - Develop clear policies and regulations for foreign investors

   - Offer tax incentives and other benefits for strategic sectors

   - Establish a dedicated agency to facilitate foreign investment



5. Infrastructure development:

   - Improve transportation networks to connect rural areas with urban centers

   - Invest in digital infrastructure to enhance connectivity and e-commerce capabilities



6. Environmental sustainability:

   - Accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources

   - Implement sustainable agriculture practices



By implementing these strategies, Sri Lanka can potentially accelerate economic growth, improve education outcomes, and enhance overall quality of life for citizens.

üü©

The government of the National People's Power is a government that conducts all citizens. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the National People's Power and the Presidential candidate, said that it was a human being.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake, president and presidential candidate of the National People's Power and Presidential candidate, was held at the Monak Imperial Hotel in Sri Jayawardenapura on Monday (26).

The moment we have evolved here today, as a political movement, is the most systematic basis in many sectors. First, we need to build a power to build this degraded country.

We moved forward with those who represent different fields in our country. But it will not only be enough for us. We must carry out a multi -faceted ideology among our people.

How to dissolve the causes of the disaster about the disaster that has occurred to our country?We have been talking to the public for a long time. I think the next step is to present a program that summarizes them all.

I met President Ranasinghe Premadasa on my seventh birthday (25 January 1993) when he came to open our garment factory. I remember President Premadasa wishing me back then.

### Uncertainty, stability and the Executive Presidency

The total change of a system of government which has stood for 46 years is a very serious matter and anyone proposing to change it should present a convincing argument and show us how the new system will work. We need to remember that going back to the old system may no longer work, as the world and our country has changed around us, and we sit next to a giant economically powerful neighbour. A change of the Executive Presidency also means that the provincial councils will need to change

It is said that the beauty of cricket is in its uncertainty. This could be the reason why we are so preoccupied with politics; we love its uncertainty. We should be thankful, for if it were certain, we would no longer be living in a democracy. While uncertainty in the outcome of an election is democracy, the breakdown of the system of government could become anarchy.
