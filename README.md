### Ranil‚Äôs Tamil Nadu obsession, comparative Anura-Sajith progressivisms, and North-East solutions

‚Äú‚Ä¶key growth drivers along with greater integration with giant and prospering neighbour India. With regard to the latter, he [Wickremesinghe] singled out land connectivity between Sri Lanka and burgeoning South India as a critical development.‚Äù

Whatever the outcome, a Kamala Harris presidential run will have a powerful positive impact on the consciousness of Asian (especially South Asian) women and girls, and on women and girls of colour throughout the world, thereby acting as a progressive factor in history.

I hope Vice-President Harris picks Senator Bernie Sanders as her running-mate because Republican JD Vance is a formidable aspirant Veep with a compelling story. The US Democratic party establishment will probably block Bernie, though he is faring very well in public opinion polls.

### SOERU and insulation it provides against bad privatisations

*2024-07-25 03:49:02* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/SOERU-and-insulation-it-provides-against-bad-privatisations/4-764710) ¬∑ `en`

For decades, Sri Lanka‚Äôs SOEs have been plagued by inefficiency, corruption, and a lack of transparency. Apart from the burden on the public purse, the consequences for citizens have included substandard medicines to exploding gas cylinders. Over the past 20 years vested interests have mushroomed around SOEs.

The opposition to privatisation in Sri Lanka stems from a mixture of ideology and vested interests. On the ideological front, there‚Äôs a lingering sentiment, rooted in post-independence nationalism, that views state ownership as a bulwark against foreign exploitation. This perspective sees SOEs not just as economic entities, but as symbols of national sovereignty and social welfare, regardless of how well these entities actually serve the purpose for which they were set up.

### Forty-one years after ‚Äò83 July do prez candidates have answers for ‚ÄúTNQ‚Äù?

*2024-07-25 03:44:00* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Forty-one-years-after-83-July-do-prez-candidates-have-answers-for-TNQ/4-764708) ¬∑ `en`

The continuing lack of a political leadership in the Sinhala South that accepts the Tamil and Muslim people as equals and as citizens with equal rights and dignity, is what denies a decent political solution to the TNQ

The Sinhala South and its leaders cannot for a moment leave all responsibility with Tamil leaders for all these sectarian and extremist developments that make solutions more and more difficult. Political leaders in Sinhala South even now avoid discussing political answers to post-war issues in North-East and for their long-standing issue of sharing political power. Everything belted out on Southern Sinhala political platforms are issues for Sinhala-Buddhist consumption, no different to Sinhala-Buddhist politics of Black July, 41 years ago. No political leader in the South can be heard here in the South saying his or her political party would negotiate power sharing for Sri Lanka with Tamil and Muslim political parties
