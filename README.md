### Gambia‚Äôs parliament upholds ban on female genital mutilation

Lawmakers in the West African nation of Gambia on Monday rejected a bill that would have overturned a ban on female genital cutting. The attempt to become the first country in the world to reverse such a ban had been closely followed by activists abroad.

The vote followed months of heated debate in the largely Muslim nation of less than 3 million people. Lawmakers effectively killed the bill by rejecting all its clauses and preventing a final vote.

The procedure, also called female genital mutilation, includes the partial or full removal of girls‚Äô external genitalia, often by traditional community practitioners with tools such as razor blades or at times by health workers. It can cause serious bleeding, death and childbirth complications but remains a widespread practice in parts of Africa.

This decision has caused political upheavals as PTI is the largest opposition party. The reasons for the ban include allegations of PTI engaging in anti-state actions and illegally obtaining foreign funding, which have been confirmed by Minister Ataullah Tarar. The government has also decided to register treason cases against Imran Khan and former President Arif Alvi.

### The National People's Power must present an acceptable solution to the ethnic problem - the Intellectual Group request

*2024-07-15 16:39:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/188525) ¬∑ `ta`

Intellectuals in Sri Lanka call on the National People's Power to resolve the country's ethnic issue with a solution that gains northern majority trust, echoing the missed opportunity in 1947. They stress the importance of uniting leftist forces against racism and neo-liberalism, referencing the 1947 election where the LSSP could've won but didn't due to internal divisions. The plea is for the National People's Power to learn from past mistakes and lead effectively in 2024 elections, prioritizing a practical and widely accepted solution to the ethnic conflict.

üü©

A group of intellectuals and educators in Sri Lanka have appealed to the national people's power to come up with a solution that all ethnicities can accept to the ethnic problem of Sri Lanka.

The committee has also appealed to it to be a practical solution that can gain the confidence of the majority of the North.

The National People's Power is the main movement of the people's aspirations that emerged through the people's struggle in 2022.

This situation was similar to the situation that was seen during the 1947 Ceylon's first national election - we missed a precious opportunity.

Therefore, we urge you to win the forthcoming election and to address the national issues, including the ethnic problem that continues to create severe disagreements in the Sri Lankan community.

The unity of the people by uniting all the left -wing forces against racism and neo -liberation.

### The latest condition of children who were allergic to drugs

*2024-07-15 15:56:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/198838) ¬∑ `si`

Children admitted to Minnetale Hospital for drug allergies underwent investigations related to their condition. Twelve children affected by drug allergies were transferred to Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. The allergy was caused by two types of medications administered for vomiting and abdominal pain. Children aged 5-11 years were hospitalized due to this condition. All children have now received treatment and been discharged from the hospital after being monitored for 24 hours without any adverse effects. The director suspects environmental changes could also cause similar allergies. Some patients refused vasoconstrictor administration due to fear, but no one should be unnecessarily scared; efforts are made to administer vasoconstrictors as needed.

The Supreme Court has dismissed the Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed seeking an order to prevent holding of the Presidential Election as the 19th Amendment to the Constitution has not been properly passed in Parliament, subject to costs.

This verdict was issued when the relevant petition filed by Attorney-at-Law Aruna Laksiri was taken up for cosideration today (15) before a Supreme Court judge bench comprising Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, Justices Arjuna Obeysekara and Priyantha Fernando.

Accordingly, the court ordered the petition dismissed with costs of Rs 500,000 to be paid by the petitioner before July 31, 2024.

The petition argued that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was not properly passed in Parliament and therefore called for a referendum to ensure its proper passage.

The Election Commission and its members, the General Secretary of Parliament and the Attorney General had been named as respondents of this petition.

The High Court directed the Tamil Nadu government to respond to a petition investigating events surrounding Jayalalithaa's hospitalization due to ill health. The court's intervention was sought due to numerous discrepancies in the events that occurred during her stay at Apollo Hospital in Chennai. A request was made for a CBI investigation under the direct supervision of the High Court, following a petition filed by a member and lawyer of the AIADMK party. Despite recommendations from the Arumugasamy committee to investigate suspicions about Jayalalithaa's death, no action was taken based on the report. Additionally, there were allegations that incorrect information was disseminated regarding Jayalalithaa's body before her death announcement and that the hospital administration was criticized for this.

Additionally, Thailand introduced the Digital Nomad Visa (DNV), valid for up to 180 days and valid for five years, aimed at digital nomads, freelancers, and those interested in culinary and martial arts. This initiative aims to boost tourism, which saw a 35% increase in arrivals, earning $24 billion in 2023, with projections indicating significant growth from Chinese, Malaysian, and Indian tourists by 2024.

It has been announced that people from 93 countries, including Sri Lanka, can go to Thailand without a visa today.

But the Thai Embassy said the project would be implemented only after the official announcement of the Sri Lankan authorities.

In this case, Sri Lankans received no confirmation from Bangkok yesterday regarding the visa free of Thailand. Therefore, the Sri Lankan Immigration and Air Transport Officers will be informed once the official announcement is received. At the time, the project will come into effect. ‚Äù

Meanwhile, no announcement has been made on the new project on the Internet of the Thailand Embassy in Sri Lanka.

Meanwhile, this is the first time that Sri Lankans are allowed to travel to Thailand without a visa.
