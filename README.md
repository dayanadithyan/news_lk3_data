ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Fitch Ratings has confirmed a ‚ÄòBBB(lka)‚Äô insurer rating of Sri Lanka‚Äôs National Insurance Trust Fund, with a stable outlook but warned on its inability to get re-insurance cover on time.

The NITF‚Äôs major source of revenue is riots, civil commotion and terrorism (SRCCT) premium it gets from other insurers, where claims were not high.

‚ÄúNITF‚Äôs risk-management practices continue to be weak, as evident from its inability to renew reinsurance contracts on time,‚Ä¶‚Äù Fitch said.

‚ÄúWe believe facing unforeseen losses without reinsurance cover could result in heightened volatility for NITF‚Äôs capital position and earnings.‚Äù

NITF‚Äôs retrocession cover had expired in January 2023 and reinsurance cover for SRCCT in July 2023, but firm has not been able to renew them, Fitch said.

Fitch said NITF‚Äôs gross premiums would surge in 2024 following a after directive requiring primary insurers to remit 100 percent of motor SRCCT premiums to NITF, up from the previous 12 percent.

This approval comes after thorough evaluation by the Technical Evaluation Committee and the Standing Procurement Committee appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers.

The Plusgrade system allows passengers holding economy class tickets to bid for available business class seats, thus offering a chance to upgrade their travel experience.

### Govt. amps up funding for Nanu Oya Railway Station modernisation

*2024-07-18 04:24:30* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/Govt-amps-up-funding-for-Nanu-Oya-Railway-Station-modernisation/34-764420) ¬∑ `en`

The Government has decided to provide additional funding for the Nanu Oya Railway Station modernisation project, which aims to enhance the station‚Äôs facilities to boost tourism and improve passenger experiences.

The move follows a previous Cabinet decision made on 3 April 2023. Initially, the project was set to be implemented with a budget of Rs. 74.63 million, funded by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) and the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTDA).

However, the contract value has now increased to Rs. 101.81 million due to rising costs and expanded project scope.

The proposal for the increased funding was presented by the Tourism and Land Minister Harin Fernando on Monday allowing the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) to complete the modernisation activities.

The additional amount required will be sourced from the SLTDA and the SLTPB based on recommendations from the Department of Railway.

*2024-07-18 03:49:15* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-can-t-that-great-idea-get-funded/4-764405) ¬∑ `en`

Ultimately, the success of any startup hinges on a strong idea, a capable and resilient team, and the relentless pursuit of excellence

The startup world is founded on daring dreams, fuelled by relentless passion and the fearless pursuit of innovation. Yet, for most, the path to success is obstructed by a crucial obstacle ‚Äì securingg adequate funding. While headlines celebrate lucrative funding rounds, many would-be founders have quit steady jobs, invested their lifetime savings, and work night and day for a venture that was teetering over before it had a chance to get started, all thanks to lack of funding.

When promising ventures fall short of an investor‚Äôs expectations, bridging the funding gap seems near impossible. Here, are some of the major culprits behind fundraising failures.

### Clean energy or clean Government?

*2024-07-18 03:37:55* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Clean-energy-or-clean-Government/4-764404) ¬∑ `en`

Clean energy, such as wind energy, can never be clean unless its procurement is also clean

This is my final response to Gerald L. Samaranayake (my time is precious), who keeps repeating himself ad nauseam while erecting ever more strawmen (see Daily FT, 13 July: https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Adani-wind-project-Is-it-a-controversy-created/14-764216).

### What will it take to keep the lights on?

Sanjiva Weerawarana, whose software company WSO2 was recently acquired for $ 600 million, was asked by an interviewer what he wanted of Government. Keep the lights on, he said.

It‚Äôs a succinct answer that embodies much. It can be interpreted as a statement that the State should focus on providing what we cannot provide for ourselves: law and order, most infrastructure services, and even things like identity and authentication services. But for the moment, let‚Äôs take just the literal meaning: uninterrupted electricity.
