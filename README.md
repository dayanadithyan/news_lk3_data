“The ongoing growth momentum is indicative of the Indian economy’s resilience, notwithstanding global headwinds,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, economist at India Ratings, noting that industrial growth continued its good run in the quarter.

There are a number of reasons to still be optimistic about the future

Sri Lanka, despite being a nation with a rich history once known to be self-sufficient as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean and a strategically located trading hub on the maritime Silk Route fostering a vibrant culture, has long grappled with achieving consistent and sustainable economic independence, especially since after the worst economic crisis the country ever faced recently in 2022. One of the key areas where this struggle is most evident is in agriculture which has been the backbone of the island nation’s economy for centuries, still employing nearly a third of the population, especially made up by daily wage-earning rural communities, particularly women, and contributes substantially to Sri Lanka’s GDP as well as food security.

There was a recent report in the Daily Mirror stating the inconveniences caused to locals due to businesses conducted by Israeli, Russian and Ukrainian nationals in the southern part of Sri Lanka. This report demands deep pondering investigation.

As much as such businesses are eating into the earning opportunities of locals, we also must think that there are hidden opportunities for business here when some people think that all is lost in this sun-kissed paradise island. These foreign nationals are operating bars, restaurants, giving surfing lessons, buying or leasing lands and renting out tuk-tuks; the latter to cut down on travel expenses. Wow! The message that foreign nationals are giving to all of Sri Lanka is that ‘if you cannot do business here in this country we’ll show you how’.

Displaced Palestinian children gather for food in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. AFP

The October 7, 2023, attacks the Palestinian resistance group Hama launched on Israel did not happen in a vacuum. In October last year, weeks after the Hamas attack, the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, told the UN Security Council that “it is important to recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum.”

Intellectuals avoid jumping to conclusions. They investigate all sides of an issue, including its history, context, and surrounding narratives, to form an opinion grounded in justice. The Secretary-General was not taking sides in the Israel-Palestinian question. His speech conformed to what was expected of an intellectual and a UN official committed to standing up for justice.

### Retelling the story of China and why it’s important

*2024-03-01 00:10:20* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Retelling-the-story-of-China-and-why-it-s-important/4-759015) · `en`

China appears to continue doing what it does best – move forward. And this perspective, whether for China, or any other country of the Global South, remains vital

A debt trap. A dispute at sea. A trade threat. An anomaly. A friend of Russia. The many names China has been called in recent years doesn’t require much reiteration, because they are already so engrained in our minds; either by label-repetition, international media-unison and perhaps also because of China’s Achilles’ heels – limitations with the English language and Western expression.

Meeting with Chinese counterparts over the last month, I only had one question. Why don’t they fight the provocation much harder? And moreover fight it in public spaces rather than behind closed diplomatic doors where the risk for facts to be eluded and stereotypes resorted to being much higher. A case in point is perhaps the blatant press leaks to a closed door diplomatic meeting at the G20; a clear unapologetic breach of pacta sunt servanda.

### Economic stability in Sri Lanka: Myth or reality?

*2024-03-01 00:04:47* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Economic-stability-in-Sri-Lanka-Myth-or-reality/4-759014) · `en`

While inflation may have decreased in real terms, stagnant wages and rising taxes have eroded the purchasing power of citizens, exacerbating poverty and inequality

The economic landscape of Sri Lanka has been a subject of fervent debate in recent times, with conflicting narratives surrounding the notion of stability. On the surface, there are indicators suggesting positive growth and progress, yet beneath the veneer lies a stark reality of pervasive instability, particularly for a significant portion of the population.

### The President and Government on self-destruct mode

*2024-03-01 00:00:17* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-President-and-Government-on-self-destruct-mode/4-759013) · `en`

If the people do not change themselves, there is never going to be any form of change whatsoever

The above verse from the Holy Quran is a reminder to the entire mankind contextually adapted for the current political climate. Broadly, the condition of any people revolves around two major generic areas. The good and bad. It is only when bad has taken root, there will be a need for mankind to change towards goodness. And, until and unless man himself has decided to change the badness in him, nothing is going to change.

### Go to court if the Speaker's decision is error - Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa

*2024-02-29 23:54:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177633) · `ta`

Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakse said that the Speaker's decision to head the Constituent Assembly on the appointment of the new Inspector General of Police could go to court.

He was speaking to the media at a function held on Thursday (29) in the Pannipitiya area of Maharagama.

Many people are criticizing the Speaker's decision during the appointment of the new Inspector General of Police. But the main reason for this problem is that even though the constitutional amendment has taken steps to appoint 10 members to the Constituent Assembly, the representative of the small parties will not be named.

Due to this problem, the Speaker is facing practical problems. So if you think that there is any legal problem in the Speaker's decision, the best place for the constitution is the best place for legal issues in the Constitution.

### Sri Lanka’s economy in the woods: But there is a way out

*2024-02-29 23:52:59* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Sri-Lanka-s-economy-in-the-woods-But-there-is-a-way-out/14-759012) · `en`

We do have the ability to tackle our economy and make things ourselves, training the unemployed youths to get cracking

Thanks to Cabinet Spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena for revealing that the Sri Lankan Government “is running a shortfall of Rs. 10 trillion to meet its expenditure with its revenue...We collect only Rs. 3 trillion while the expenses are Rs. 13 trillion” (The Morning 20/02/2024). This reveals a situation of sheer bankruptcy, a situation out of which we can perhaps, never recover.
