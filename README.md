### What is the line?

*2024-02-04 15:03:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175517) · `ta`

These arguments often notice the key role in financing to essential public services such as health, education, infrastructure and social security nets.. To ensure adequate funds for public services and balance the need for economic growth, Sri Lanka and many countries are facing a complex challenge.

Of course, there are arguments against taxation. Some argue that taxes are high and they are free of economic growth. Others argue that the taxes are unfair and that they are burdened with proportions for the poor.

The debate on taxation will continue for many more years. However, one is clearly. Taxes are essential in any modern society, and they play an important role in financing the public goods and services we all believe in.

In any case, the bill has been passed as most of our MPs voted in favor of the deepest and widths of the status law.. The law has come into effect with the similarity of the Speaker. So people need to understand this reality and act very carefully.

What is important here is that the issue in Sri Lanka is a law or legalization;Is not about. Its proper implementation is on. Whatever the laws are written, it is not properly implemented. We have repeatedly condemned the law that the law does not go on all.

Therefore, the government should not forget that if the new law is implemented in that way or against freedom of expression, its consequences may not be predicted.
