### Train services on Coastal Line limited to single track

*2024-06-13 15:44:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99858/train-services-on-coastal-line-limited-to-single-track) ┬╖ `en`

The train operations on the Coastal Line have been further limited to a single track, following the derailment of a train at Panadura Railway Station this morning (13).

A slow train plying from Panadura to Maradana derailed near the Panadura railway station, disrupting services on the coastal line.

Furthermore, one of the compartments of the derailed train had collided with a nearby railway signal board, causing a complete breakdown of the railway signaling system in the area.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Sri Lanka Railways stated that it will take a considerable amount of time to restore the railway line for regular train operations.

However, the Department of Railways announced that one of the two railway tracks on the coastal line has now been re-opened for train operations.

### Aura Lanka chairman Thambugala to make confidential statement to court

*2024-06-13 15:31:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99857/aura-lanka-chairman-thambugala-to-make-confidential-statement-to-court) ┬╖ `en`

The Colombo Chief MagistrateтАЩs Court has scheduled the consideration of Aura Lanka Chairman Viranjith ThambugalaтАЩs request to provide a confidential statement before the court for July 18.

The case, filed over alleged financial fraud committed by Thambugala, was taken up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Pavitra Pathiraja today (June 13).

However, the officers from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) were not present in court at the time.

Accordingly, the Additional Magistrate ordered the relevant request to make a confidential statement to be re-submitted to the court at the next hearing.

On May 22, the Chairman of Aura Lanka, businessman Viranjith Thambugala was arrested by police over allegations of misappropriation of nearly Rs. 70 million and was later granted bail after being produced before the Colombo MagistrateтАЩs Court.

### A warning from former police officers

*2024-06-13 15:10:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/197717) ┬╖ `si`

Former IGP Chandra Fernando stated at a press conference that he doesn't believe current political groups are involved in violent activities, despite past incidents. He mentioned the government's efforts after the 1989 rebellion and expressed concern over recent events, questioning the lack of action against similar occurrences.

ЁЯЯй

Former IGP Chandra Fernando says that political groups engaged in violent political activities in the past are not believed to be engaged in such activities.

He was speaking at a press conference on the former IGP and former DIGs.

The news discussion was called at a private hotel in Pitakotte this morning.

"After the rebellion, the government performed a major rehabilitation. We each thought that the rebellion would end here. But unfortunately 1989, once again, this violent act was destroyed by the property and lives of Sri Lanka. We later thought it would be stopped by this violence. Unfortunately, 91 houses were organized in the same night on May 9, 2022. Will you not do this in making such things? "

The Hindu community fears this could lead to future disruptions in the pilgrimage route.

### Competition against the West Indies is decisive to New Zealand

*2024-06-13 01:48:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185957) ┬╖ `ta`

In the R20 World Cup, New Zealand's C team faces the West Indies after losing to Afghanistan. A win against the West Indies could secure New Zealand's spot in the Super 8 round, enhancing their chances. Historically, New Zealand has performed well in World Cups, reaching the semi-finals or finals multiple times since 2015 but struggled against Afghanistan this year. The match against the West Indies is crucial for New Zealand, who leads 10-4 in international T20 encounters but faced a tie and loss in previous meetings. Both teams aim to advance to the Super 8 round, making this match pivotal.

ЁЯЯй

The New Zealand C team, which lost its first match against Afghanistan, will oppose the West Indies in its second match in the R20 World Cup.

The tournament will begin at 6.00 am on Thursday (13).

If the West Indies wins the match, the fourth team will qualify for the Super 8 round, while New Zealand's Super 8 round chance will be questioned.

So in today's match, New Zealand will try to increase its Super round chance by defeating the West Indies.

New Zealand, which has revealed the best in the World Cup since 2015, has advanced to the semi -finals of 2015, 2019, 2019 and 2023 in 2016, 2021 and 2022. On 3 occasions, he played in the final game, but did not hesitate.

However, there is suspicion that New Zealand will leave the first round of Afghanistan by 84 runs this year.

So the rivalry against the West Indies will be a knock out of New Zealand.

On the other hand, the West Indies will also try to win the Super 8 round.
