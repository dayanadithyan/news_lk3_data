பங்களாதேஷ் நிலைவரத்தை இலங்கையோடு ஒப்பிட்டு தொடர்ந்தும் கருத்துக்களை முன் வைப்பது ஏன்?  அதேபோன்று  இலங்கையிலும்  மீண்டும் நெருக்கடி ஏற்படும் என்றா  எதிர்க்கட்சியினர் கூற வருகின்றனர்? தவறான தீர்மானங்கள் மூலமே  மீண்டும் நெருக்கடிகளே ஏற்படும் என்பதை நாட்டில் அனைவரும் புரிந்து கொள்ள வேண்டும் என அமைச்சர் ஜீவன் தொண்டமான் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

🟩

This time the presidential election is more important than other presidential elections, said MP Professor Saritha Herath.

The presidential election is being held when the country needs to have a multi -dimensional change in the country.Ranil Wickremesinghe, on the other hand, is leading the tendency to socialize lies that I have saved from this position.

He said this at a media briefing held at the United People's Power Headquarters Office in Bidakottai on Tuesday (06).

He shows false issues on economic recovery.He is not the rest of the. He said he was a partner of this economic problem.

No one else has come forward to accept. So it is absolutely wrong to say that I accepted the post of Prime Minister. Sajith sent a letter with conditions. It doesn't matter. Sarath Fonseka expressed his choice. The last government did not listen. That's why he automatically accepted their post.

While it is too far-fetched for us to imagine reaching Indian standards, it consoles us to see RW taking some such initiatives in the current context under all odds he is handicapped with

Sri Lankan electors are awaiting a change from the status quo of a sluggish and slow-moving economy towards a more seriously planned progress. With fresh memories of extreme hard time sufferings of the recent past, only palliatively handled with haphazard responses to meet emergency situations, the body politic is hopeful of a dawn of an economy progressing under a planned pursuit of a clear vision.

### Demise of Rajapaksa power and triumph of Rajapaksaism

*2024-08-07 01:09:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Demise-of-Rajapaksa-power-and-triumph-of-Rajapaksaism/4-765215) · `en`

The Rajapaksas have nothing to gain from a Ranil Wickremesinghe victory. He was never a Rajapaksa creature. He saved the Rajapaksas from popular fury and used their backing to implement his own politico-economic agenda. If he wins the Presidential election, he would go his way, irrespective of whether the Rajapaksas back him or not. So the Rajapaksas decided to cut their losses, a decision that makes sense from the perspective of familial power. For them, defeat and a stint in the opposition would be less ruinous than growing irrelevance under a victorious President Wickremesinghe. Their only way out was persuading President Wickremesinghe to publicly anoint Namal Rajapaksa as the next prime minister. They made the demand and he refused, because he is not Ranil Rajapaksa. With that correct refusal, the raison d’être of the Wickremesinghe-Rajapaksa alliance vanished
