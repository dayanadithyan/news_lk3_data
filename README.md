During the time of former President Rajapaksa, via amendments to the Constitution, checks on the arbitrary use of power were diluted, and institutions to protect the independence of the judiciary were tampered with.

Enterprise Risk Management is pivotal in addressing emerging risks through its multifaceted approach

Enterprise Risk Management has become an increasingly essential solution for mitigating emerging risks, mainly because it provides a structured, systematic, and holistic approach to identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks across an entire organisation. As emerging risks are often characterised by their unpredictability and potential to rapidly evolve, Enterprise Risk Management’s comprehensive framework is particularly suited to address these challenges. Enterprise Risk Management enables organisations to respond to emerging risks in a strategic, coordinated, and agile manner. It’s not just about mitigating risks but also about seizing the opportunities that arise during times of uncertainty, turning potential threats into drivers of innovation and growth

National plans have not worked in Sri Lanka or anywhere else. The Indian Planning Commission has been redesigned and renamed. Can there be sectoral policies? Yes, there should be national policies for specific sectors that are based on evidence and broad stakeholder consultation, even in rapidly changing fields such as digital. They should not change every time a Government changes or a minister is appointed. But they should be reviewed and modified as circumstances change. Should efforts be made to articulate sector policies? Yes, to a limited extent. An approach that accepts the imperfection of information and difficulties of articulation and seeks a balance between workable certainty and flexibility is what will work

These was Ronnie’s observations: central banks in countries like Singapore and Hong Kong were much more efficient than the central banks in this part of the world, including the central bank in Sri Lanka. But the central banks in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh were worse than even the bad central bank in Sri Lanka. Why the central banks in Singapore or Hong Kong were successful was because those countries continued with open economy policies. They did not adopt socialist systems. They were going on modifying or developing the open economy systems. According to Ronnie, that was the secret to their success. What Ronnie implied was that if the country adopts a set of a good flexible economic policy package, its central bank also becomes an institution of worth

Colombo, March 3 (Daily Mirror)- While highlighting that the Suwaseriya ambulance service is fighting for its survival, its founder Harsha de Silva said its employee should be given a salary increment as a priority.

"The CEO of Suwaseriya is fighting to save the ambulance service. Its employees can easily obtain visas from countries like Canada. A battle is being fought to save the ambulance service in such a scenario," he told a media briefing.

He said it was most unfair for the Central Bank officials to increase their own salaries when Suwaseriya employees have not received any increments despite working 24 hours of the day," he added.

### “The farmers are a great profit for the country”

*2024-03-03 16:20:13* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/விவசாயிகளால்-நாட்டுக்கு-பெரும்-இலாபம்/175-334139) · `ta`

Farmers in Sri Lanka, led by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, have significantly reduced the country's reliance on imported rice, saving over $600 million in 2023 and 2024. They've achieved this by increasing rice production, with a record harvest of 12,000 kg per hectare. The government is promoting Giri Samba cultivation, giving farmers control over rice prices.

🟩

Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera says farmers and foreign workers have been dedicated to reduce the value of the increased dollar rate.

The Minister said that the value of the dollar against the rupee in recent years has increased rapidly and the value of the dollar has declined somewhat.

By 2022, Sri Lanka was imported about 800,000 metric tonnes of rice, for which the government had to spend $ 300 million.

But not a single rice was imported in 2023, and in the two years 2023 and 2024, farmers in the country saved over $ 600 million.

In addition, in 2023 and 2024, the people of this country will consume domestic rice, not the imported rice, but that respect and pride must join the Sri Lankan farmers.

Representatives of some political groups that claim to be farmers' representatives are trying to disrupt agriculture by acting like farmers, but farmers are not caught up in this trap.
