### Is the Chinese economy doomed as some forecasts say?

*2024-04-01 00:03:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Is-the-Chinese-economy-doomed-as-some-forecasts-say/172-279898) ┬╖ `en`

One should be cautious about making doomsday predictions, and should not┬а forget the resilience, determination and energy which made it possible┬а to lift millions of Chinese out of poverty in two decades

While social media is packed with doomsday predictions of the American economy (Europe isnтАЩt doing any better, either), there is an equal or greater number of videos forecasting the decline of China, an economic juggernaut that looked set to overtake the US before the pandemic.

When navigating across this sea of negative analyses of China, from American, European or Indian sources, one must bear in mind that there are those who either dislike or fear China enough to wish it economic doom.

### LankaтАЩs foreign debt and Chinese puzzle - EDITORIAL

*2024-04-01 00:02:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Lankas-foreign-debt-and-Chinese-puzzle-EDITORIAL/172-279897) ┬╖ `en`

In March this year, President Wickremesinghe in an interview said Lanka was committed to repaying its debt within the period 2027-2042. The president said he expected the ongoing debt restructuring negotiations would bring the annual external debt payments down to 4% of GDP.

The countryтАЩs foreign reserves, which stood at less than $20 million in April 2022 at the height of the economic crisis, now stand at over $3 billion, Wickremesinghe said.

For long, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Western nations have claimed the delay in rescheduling LankaтАЩs international debt was China-which holds the largest share of our foreign debt. It was also claimed Sri Lanka was caught in a Chinese debt trap caused by taking loans to an extent they cannot be repaid.

They warned Lanka would ultimately end up with China taking over assets of the country to meet the bill.

### Anti-privatization statements will depress bid prices: Will JVP be held accountable?

*2024-04-01 00:01:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Anti-privatization-statements-will-depress-bid-prices-Will-JVP-be-held-accountable/172-279896) ┬╖ `en`

Sunil Handunetti, a senior and respected leader of the JVP, has urged the government not to sell (and potential buyers not to buy) state-owned enterprises such as the SriLankan Airlines, SLT and Litro, for which requests for proposals have been called.

He implicitly threatens to expropriate the sold entities. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is also mentioned, but there is no such process underway for it.

This coincided with the government taking USD 210 million in dollar loans and LKR 41.4 billion in rupee loans off the AirlineтАЩs books. This has, understandably, angered many members of the public. They argue that wrong decisions led an airline that once paid dividends to the Treasury to come to this sorry state. They argue that those who made these decisions should be held to account.

Francis, 87, has been in poor health in recent weeks, forcing him on repeated occasions to limit his public speaking and cancel engagements as he did on Good Friday, skipping at short notice a procession at RomeтАЩs Colosseum.

However, he took part in other Holy Week events leading up to Easter, and appeared in relatively good spirits on Sunday. Easter celebrates the day in which the faithful believe Jesus rose from the dead.
