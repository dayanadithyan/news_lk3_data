### Do the Tamil Critics of the 13th Constitutional Amendment have the Political Strength to Force a Future Govt to Introduce a Devolution Scheme  better than what is Available in the Provincial Councils?

*2024-06-30 01:11:00* ┬╖ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84298) ┬╖ `en`

Sri Lankan Tamil politics has become more complicated due to contradictions among Tamil political parties regarding what position northern and eastern Tamils should take in the upcoming Presidential Election.

It makes no sense to expect Tamil parties to be inclined to act unitedly or to come to a unified position to find a solution to the national ethnic problem.

The idea of fielding a Tamil common candidate at the Presidential Election has occupied Tamil politics in recent times.

Though the Democratic Tamil National Alliance (DTNA), consisting of a few Tamil parties whose leaders formerly were prominent members of armed militant groups, have decided to support the attempts to field a common Tamil candidate, the initial enthusiasm among some Tamil parties is now absent in this regard.

There are conflicting views not only between parties but also within each party regarding the common candidate.

### Two aged US presidents square off in debate for the ages

The Biden-Trump debate, touted as the political face-off that would change the course of history, was held Thursday night at the CNN studios in Atlanta, Georgia. The rather unusual ground rules for the debate had been agreed upon by the candidates weeks ago. It was the earliest presidential debate in history, held as it was more than four months before election day in November.

These ground rules were considered to be essential to avoid a repetition of the debate between these two when they were candidates for the presidency in 2020. During that first debate nearly four years ago, the general consensus was that Trump was тАЬunhinged, bullied, bulldozed and obfuscatedтАЭ (CNN), talked тАЬincoherently and rattled off unfounded and baseless attacksтАЭ (NBC) spewed тАЬmisleading claims and outright liesтАЭ (New York Times) and showed he had тАЬnothing but contempt for the values and norms that are essential to democracyтАЭ (Washington Post). No one wanted to see that kind of confrontational fiasco again.

### The Idea of the Global South

*2024-06-30 00:42:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-idea-of-the-global-south/) ┬╖ `en`

It is easy to celebrate the return of Asia, the rise of the Global South, the resurgence of the Non-Aligned nations of the world. It is harder to chart a course for these countries and regions, to strategise the way forward for them.

The Global South, to be sure, has never been stronger before. The present moment is rife with many possibilities. The US and its allies have effectively lost the moral high ground, though some would argue and not incorrectly that it never held that high ground in the first place. South AfricaтАЩs intervention in the ongoing genocide in Gaza is an example of the immense potential of Global Southernism: the trial was launched at the behest, not of China or Russia or any of those countries that have a major issue with the US-led Western alliance, but of a state that had no rivalry or issue with that alliance.
