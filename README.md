### India extends ban on onion exports indefinitely ahead of general election

*2024-03-24 09:15:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98164/india-extends-ban-on-onion-exports-indefinitely-ahead-of-general-election) · `en`

India has extended its ban on onion exports indefinitely - a surprise move that comes ahead of a general election and is set to exacerbate high prices in some overseas markets.

Imposed by India - the world’s biggest exporter of the vegetable - in December, the ban was due to expire on March 31. Traders had anticipated it would be lifted as local prices have more than halved since the export restrictions were implemented and this season’s crop is yielding fresh supplies.

“The extension is surprising and completely unnecessary, considering the falling prices with rising supplies from the new season crop,” said an executive at a Mumbai-based export firm, who declined to be identified.

Onion prices in some wholesale markets in Maharashtra, the biggest onion-producing state, have fallen to 1,200 rupees ($14) per 100 kg from 4,500 rupees in December, the executive said.

### Sri Lanka central bank says senior management decided to review salary hike

ECONOMYNEXT – The senior management of the central bank decided to review a steep salary hike made after a currency crisis, a statement said amid legislative and public anger against the move.

The salary hike was initially defended on the basis of central bank independence.

Giving salary hike to offset the inflation created by the agency in the process of enforcing rate cuts by printing money has been a longstanding practice.

However legislators said the independence was only given to the agency to print money (and trigger inflation or currency depreciation) and it did not apply to salaries.

Under a new law the agency has got powers to trigger up to 7 percent inflation a year with no questions asked. Since September 2022, the agency has created lower levels of inflation and has appreciated the currency with deflationary policy.

(UCAN)At 58, Ruwani Mudalige chose to be baptized a Catholic in Sri Lanka after years of keeping away from Catholicism, her mother’s religion.

“I grew up in a house of Buddhists. But my mother was a strong Catholic. I used to attend Sunday Mass with her during my childhood, but I never felt a connection to the Church,” Mudalige said.

She moved further away from Christianity with her marriage to “a devout Buddhist” at the age of 22 in 1988.The family of her husband Aloka Weerathunga was one of the traditional dancers, who attended Buddhist religious festivals and ceremonies across the country.

Mudalige accompanied them as they — her husband, his father and other relatives — performed before temple processions with a decorated elephant in vibrant colors.

During these festivals, her family’s youngsters formed a fire-dancing team, performing outside Buddhist temples as part of the festivities.

### Sir Andrew Caldecott (1884-1951) Governor of Ceylon with special experience

*2024-03-24 01:37:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/sir-andrew-caldecott-1884-1951-governor-of-ceylon-with-special-experience/) · `en`

Sir Andrew Caldecott arrived in Ceylon as Governor of the Island seven years ago yesterday. He will be 60 years of age on the 26h of this month. No excuse is therefore necessary for making some attempt to review his career.

The roll of Ceylon’s past Governors includes many remarkable men who made their mark as pioneers, administrators, scholars or writers. Sir Andrew Caldecott will take his place among them on his merits, but also on the suffrage of those peoples among whom he has served. He may not be so brilliant a writer as Clifford, so profound a scholar as Chalmers, so eloquent as West-Ridgeway or so experienced a parliamentarian as Gregory but he combines in his character qualities which made him one of the most successful and popular proconsuls ever to leave England to carry the white man’s burden.

### The wistful musings of a reluctant émigré

It has been a cold and wet winter in London. As I snuggle-up in my rocking chair to write my thoughts I can hear the wind howling outside. The raindrops are carried horizontally by the strong south-westerly wind battering the window panes and dripping down in torrents.

I still have grateful memories of a happy 12 years at Wesley College. The school on Karlsruhe Hill was established with missionary zeal and some colonial vigour but it catered for all Ceylonese. The school became the cradle of multiculturalism. Protected from the polarised world outside, it remained secular and was driven by merit. Since the very beginning Wesley has strived hard to become a modern, forward-thinking school. The school has a strong record of academic achievements and a full programme of wider life activities, including the arts and sports.
