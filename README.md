### Surgeons perform first combined heart pump and pig kidney transplant

*2024-04-26 08:55:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Surgeons-perform-first-combined-heart-pump-and-pig-kidney-transplant/108-281400) · `en`

(CNN) - The first transplant surgery to combine a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney has been completed at NYU Langone Health, the system said Wednesday.

The subject, 54-year-old Lisa Pisano of New Jersey, had heart failure and end-stage kidney disease that required routine dialysis, NYU Langone said in a news release. But she couldn’t have a standard heart or kidney transplant because of other chronic medical conditions that “significantly reduced the likelihood of a good outcome” and because of an overall lack of donor organs in the US.

“When that opportunity first came to me, I was like, ‘I gotta try it,’ ” Pisano said during a news conference Wednesday from her bed in the intensive care unit.

“I’ve tried everything else, and I’ve exhausted all other resources. So when this opportunity came, I said, ‘I’m gonna take advantage of it,’ ” she said, hoping to “spend time with my grandkids and play with them.”

Colombo, April 26 (Daily Mirror) - Ahead of the presidential election scheduled for October this year, the foreign powers have ramped up their efforts in the assessment of ground political developments as was in the case of vital elections in the past.

The political situation is likely to heat up after May Day events in which the respective parties will try to show their political might as a launching pad for electioneering.

It is natural for foreign countries having bilateral relations with Sri Lanka to be watchful of political developments with key elections pending. However, countries such as the United States, India, China, Japan, the United Kingdom and other Western countries take particular interest in the possible outcome of elections. They have strategic and competing interests in the country.

### Not AirAsia bidding to acquire SriLankan: Capital A CEO clarifies

*2024-04-26 04:03:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Not-AirAsia-bidding-to-acquire-SriLankan-Capital-A-CEO-clarifies/108-281384) · `en`

Capital A CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes clarified that it is AirAsia Consulting Sdn Bhd that is bidding to acquire SriLankan Airlines, and not AirAsia.

If successful, the soon to be re-branded AirAsia Consulting will raise its own capital for the acquisition, Fernandes told reporters in Malaysia this week at a media conference that was held to announce the extension of his tenure as chief for another five years.

“Just to clear that up for everyone, AirAsia is not buying SriLankan Airlines. AirAsia Consulting, which will set up its own fund, is looking at buying SriLankan Airlines. So, it’s not AirAsia,” he said.

“I know it’s confusing, and AirAsia Consulting will be changing (its name) to Capital A Consulting very soon. So, that’s for airlines who want to consult our 23 years of experience, but AirAsia Consulting is also looking for opportunities to invest in airlines outside of ASEAN. AirAsia is fully focused on ASEAN. That’s our goal,”

### A common sense alternative

*2024-04-26 02:12:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/A-common-sense-alternative/172-281395) · `en`

Sri Lanka must integrate with global production networks that require trade reforms, removal of tariffs and protections across sectors and joining free trade agreements.

I hope to convince the reader that despite some of the commentary, Sri Lanka is not on the road to recovery. Numerous predictably dysfunctional policies with questionable rationalisations were implemented in 2019 and 2020; there was no discernible deliberative process. The underlying fragility of governance that precipitated the collapse is still prevalent. Two years on, the Wickremesinghe Government is exhibiting the same tendencies: a concentration of power in the office of the presidency with the executive holding the critical ministries of finance and defence; this Wickremesinghe Government has not materially altered the conditions that led to our crisis.

### Israel’s US-backed genocide in Gaza, 200 days on

What horrible times are we living in? “Never again” was the resolve that led to the formation of a rules-based world order in the aftermath of World War II, in which some 80 million people—3 percent of the then-world population—perished. But events that followed showed humans were incapable of living in peace. People continued to die in wars across the world.

But none of the myriad wars and conflicts could be as brutal as the war Israel’s hardline prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been waging against the hapless people of the Gaza Strip for the past 200-plus days. What is happening in Gaza is not a war; it is genocide, period.
