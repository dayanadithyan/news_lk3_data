Muslim leaders and others oppose the Uniform Civil Code initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu Nationalist party saying it interferes with their own laws and customs on such issues.

### Gemunu proposes plans to prevent abuses in buses

Colombo, Feb 9 (Daily Mirror) - Before targeting individuals who commit acts of abuse against children and women on public transport, the police must take action to implement the prepaid card system or the transporting of passengers to the seating capacity of buses, the Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) said.

LPBOA chairman Gemunu Wijerathne told the Daily Mirror that people who want to abuse children, women and pickpockets never buy tickets but travel freely.

"Implementing the prepaid card system will help prevent these kinds of abuses. Meanwhile, transporting passengers to the seating capacity of buses will also help reduce these kinds of abuses," he said.

"We have enough private and Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses to transport people according to the seating capacities of buses.

"Otherwise, deploying officials or people to apprehend pickpockets and those who abuse women and children will not be a practical solution to the issue," Wijerathne said.

Kyiv, Feb 09 (BBC) - Ukraine's president has sacked the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi.

It follows speculation about a rift between the president and Gen Zaluzhnyi, who has led Ukraine's war effort since the conflict began.

Battle-hardened Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi was announced as his replacement in a presidential decree.

It is the biggest change to Ukraine's military leadership since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said the high command needed to be "renewed" and that Gen Zaluzhnyi could "remain on the team".

"Starting today, a new management team will take over the leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine," he said on Thursday.

Gen Zaluzhnyi is a popular general trusted by Ukrainian soldiers and the public, and has been something of a national hero.

His recent approval ratings have been higher than those of Mr Zelensky.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has bought 113 million US dollars from forex markets in December 2023, taking the total collected in the year to 1.895 billion US dollars, backed by deflationary policy, official data shows.

The central bank allowed rates to go up from April 2022, in the first step to correcting a balance of payments crisis, triggered by rates cuts enforced with aggressive open market operations involving multiple liquidity tools.

Rate cuts enforced with liquidity injections by a reserve collecting central bank trigger forex shortages, then a rapid loss of confidence as the so-called ‘flexible’ exchange rate regime flips and attempts to float (exchange rate as the first line of defence).

After a massive confidence shock is delivered including credit downgrades, steep rate hikes and an economic contraction to kill credit is needed to restore the confidence in the currency and stabilize the monetary system.

### The unbearable selfishness of being “Maavai” Senathirajah

The heading of this article is inspired by the title of Milan Kundera’s novel “The Unbearable Lightness of Being”. That novel was set in the eventful Prague spring period of the then undivided Czechoslovakia. This article is about an octogenarian Tamil political leader who tries to cling on to power selfishly without stepping down gracefully.

The party leader I am referring to is Somasundaram Senathirajah known popularly as “Maavai” Senathirajah and/or Maavai. Until 27 January 2024, Senathirajah was the President of the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK) known as the Federal Party (FP) in English. Senathirajah however continues to act as the party president in a business as usual fashion.

reeling under economic dispossession from fighting a just economic arrangement

What can law do during an economic crisis? What is law actually doing during the current economic crisis in Sri Lanka? These are two questions that I thought I would reflect upon, when I was invited to speak at a panel discussion on the role of law in overcoming the current economic crisis held at the Jaffna Law Conference recently. Neither a lawyer nor an economist, I try to engage with these questions as a teacher of critical theory and as someone who lives and works amidst the economic crisis that is plaguing the country. With gratitude, I draw from the careful analyses of the recent legal reforms offered by lawyers, economists, trade unionists and activists who work for social justice in Sri Lanka.

### Cabinet approves import of 15,000 tons of cashew nut to address shortage

The Cabinet of Ministers approved importing a maximum of 15,000 tons of cashew nuts in the shell this year as the local production capacity falls short to 12,500 tons, leading to an urgent need for intervention.

The annual demand is 25,000 tons of cashew nuts but the cashew industry in the country is facing a very unfortunate situation as the crop has not been harvested as expected in the last season.

Additionally, a committee comprising senior officials from relevant Ministries will determine the quantity to be imported from December to April over the next four years, bridging the gap during the offseason when local cashew harvests are unavailable.

The proposal presented by the Agriculture and Plantation Minister received approval at the Cabinet of Ministers’ meeting on Monday.

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Nalin Bandara yesterday expressed the party’s inability to support the President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s endeavours to revive Sri Lanka, citing his collaboration with the leaders of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the same party responsible for the country’s bankruptcy.

“The President has made many statements of Government policy within the last two years. In turn, Government MPs are now singing the praises of the President. Yesterday President Wickremesinghe questioned why the SJB cannot support him as the Pohottuwa members have. That is the very reason we cannot support his efforts,” Bandara said.  He remarked that those responsible for leading the country to bankruptcy since 2005 are now praising Wickremesinghe, and they appear to view the President in a favourable light.  “SJB lawyers even filed cases against them, and they were found responsible for the crisis. Hence, we are unable to collaborate with them,” he said.

### When the ‘Weight’ of Bread is Too Much to Bear! - EDITORIAL

*2024-02-09 00:03:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/When-the-Weight-of-Bread-is-Too-Much-to-Bear-EDITORIAL/172-276625) · `en`

The study of the history of bread in Sri Lanka provides us with an interesting story. Despite Sri Lankan homes trying to dissuade eating bread - stating that such foods invite disease early in life - the baked meal made of flour has held on to its place on the dining table despite fighting for survival amidst government regulations imposed on bakery and restaurant owners.

The present regulation is that a loaf of bread must weigh a minimum of 450 grams. This was made mandatory following a government regulation confirmed through gazette notification recently. However, bakery owners are complaining that there must be a price control now because an unofficial price revision has taken place to balance costs with the increase in the weight of a loaf of bread.

### Covering Gaza: The imperialistic media deception

In east London, graffiti made by street artist Ed Hicks, also known as @ed_hicks, depicts Palestinian citizen journalist, Plestia Alaqad, as part of a peace project called “Heroes of Palestine” by the art platform Creative Debuts. AFP

Do as I say, not as I do. This is the mantra with which the imperialist West keeps its colonial or neo-colonial projects going. This duplicity is also evident in the imperialists’ media policy.

Often, developing countries’ mid-career journalists are invited to the West for training that lasts weeks, months, and even a year. The institutes to which they go meet the airfare, accommodation, and meal costs. They are even paid per diem. They are lectured on journalistic rules and dos and don’ts. They are taught that journalism’s first obligation is to the truth, which is sacred and cannot be warped or violated. The primary duty of the journalist is to find out the truth, verify it, fact-check it, and convey it to the people they are morally bound to serve.
