ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lankans building their new home should focus on the direction of the sun, and not just auspicious directions, officials at a Sectoral Oversight Committee on Energy have said.

Many Sri Lankans consult astrologers and mystics before building anything new, who advise on which direction a building must not face (ma-ru si-ti-na di-sha-va).

But house owners should also focus on the direction of the sun (hi-ru si-ti-na di-sha-va), officials of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) said.

“When building, constructors should consider a place to install solar panels in a new house,” a statement by the Department of Government Information quoted the officials as saying.

The officials pointed out that although people are concerned about the ‘direction of death’ based on occult science, they are not concerned about the direction of the sun. This has become a problem in the installation of solar panels, they said.

Colombo, Feb 14 (Daily Mirror) -  The healthcare services across the country have been paralyzed, inconveniencing patients as trade unions within the health sector have decided to continue the island-wide strike.

Furthermore, long queues can be seen at nationwide pharmacies owned by the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation since this morning as medications are not being dispensed from the medicine counters at government hospitals.

The strike, which commenced from 6.30 a.m. yesterday (13) was launched following unsuccessful discussions with officials from the Finance Ministry.

The focal point of the strike action is the prolonged and contentious disagreement surrounding the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance, according to the President of the Federation of Health Professionals Ravi Kumudesh.

The health workers have so far resorted to three trade union actions this year over the failure to provide an allowance similar to the DAT allowance granted to the doctors.

ECONOMYNEXT – With sixty-five per cent of her population under the age of 35 and the world’s fastest growing economy, India is attracting the attention of industrialised nations looking to increase trade relations.
