### CEB to reduce electricity tariff rates by 18 percent?

*2024-02-21 09:18:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/CEB-to-reduce-electricity-tariff-rates-by-18-percent/108-277460) · `en`

Colombo, Feb 21 (Daily Mirror) - The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is planning to reduce electricity tariff rates by 18 percent soon, Daily Mirror learns.

Earlier, the CEB said the price reduction is possible mainly due to the increased percentage of hydropower in the energy mix of the country. Sri Lanka received sufficient rainfall recently increasing the power generation capacity of major plants.

It is now expected to submit proposals for tariff reduction to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka. The tariff rates were increased for the last time in October, last year.

The decision to raise tariffs came after the Ceylon Electricity Board requested the PUCSL to adjust electricity prices to offset the costs incurred during periods of arid weather conditions in the South Asian country.

Also, the CEB raised the tariff by 66 percent in February, and there was a reduction in the rates by 14 percent with effect from July.

### False interpretation of secularism to deny freedom of religion to Buddhist students at Royal College

*2024-02-21 05:01:37* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/False-interpretation-of-secularism-to-deny-freedom-of-religion-to-Buddhist-students-at-Royal-College/14-758702) · `en`

An old boy who has expressed opposition in an article in the Daily FT recently, to the chanting of pirith in a Buddhist religious ceremony at Royal College on grounds that it is ‘anti secular’, has given a false interpretation of secularism.

Moreover, he has made false allegations against the school authorities that:

1) The authorities were forcibly collecting funds from non-Buddhist children

2) The giving of Atapirikara to 100 monks is being done based by forcing parents of children to contribute

4) Placing of Buddha statues within the school environment increasingly is intimidating to non-Buddhist students

The author of the article admitted in another correspondence last year that he is a “devout Christian, and an Elder of the St. Andrews Scots Kirk Galle Face where he has also been the Treasurer”.

The Royal College Principal has responded to these wild allegations as follows:

### Overseas Sri Lankans: The missing nexus between foreign policy and domestic policy

*2024-02-21 04:58:30* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Overseas-Sri-Lankans-The-missing-nexus-between-foreign-policy-and-domestic-policy/4-758701) · `en`

During my visit to Australia recently I took a keen interest to engage with several young persons of Sri Lankan origin in different cities. They were among the second and third generation youth from Sri Lanka’s migrant community resident Down Under.

The idea of engaging with the youth came in the backdrop of “Sri Lanka Fest” – an expatriate cultural event that took place at the Federation Square in Melbourne on 25 November 2023.

A good many people of Sri Lankan origin and others were thronging the venue at the time I entered. There were several food stalls selling Sri Lankan varieties. A stall run by the Consulate of Sri Lanka in Melbourne exhibited some Sri Lankan items, but ‘Appe Kade’ appeared to be the attraction and the big earner (two plain hoppers, one egg hopper and lunu miris at AUD 20).

Main Opposition SJB Parliamentarian Eran Wickramaratne yesterday questioned the Speaker by raising a question under the standing orders, whether the Constitutional Assembly, which has been established as an independent institution, has approved the rules for approving Bills adhering to proper methods.

He also questioned whether the Secure Transactions Bill, which was taken for debate in Parliament, was referred to the Consultative Council (CC) of the concerned Ministry and received its approval.

In the recent past when Parliament hastily passed online security Act, there was no required oversight committee report for it. Therefore, this question is especially directed because when an act is passed, it should be done constitutionally and in accordance with standing orders, he said
