Colombo, Feb 09 (PTI) - Sri Lanka is likely to extend visa exemption status for India after March to keep attracting travellers from the country and encourage repeat visits, Tourism and Lands, Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Harin Fernando said on Thursday.

Sri Lanka facilitated visa-free entry for Indian travellers from December 2023 to March. “We are working on extending it beyond March. We want to make Sri Lanka an easily accessible destination for Indians, who can just walk into our country for a hassle free holiday,” he said.

Kyiv, Feb 09 (BBC) - Ukraine's president has sacked the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi.

It follows speculation about a rift between the president and Gen Zaluzhnyi, who has led Ukraine's war effort since the conflict began.

Battle-hardened Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi was announced as his replacement in a presidential decree.

It is the biggest change to Ukraine's military leadership since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said the high command needed to be "renewed" and that Gen Zaluzhnyi could "remain on the team".

"Starting today, a new management team will take over the leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine," he said on Thursday.

Gen Zaluzhnyi is a popular general trusted by Ukrainian soldiers and the public, and has been something of a national hero.

His recent approval ratings have been higher than those of Mr Zelensky.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has bought 113 million US dollars from forex markets in December 2023, taking the total collected in the year to 1.895 billion US dollars, backed by deflationary policy, official data shows.

The central bank allowed rates to go up from April 2022, in the first step to correcting a balance of payments crisis, triggered by rates cuts enforced with aggressive open market operations involving multiple liquidity tools.

Rate cuts enforced with liquidity injections by a reserve collecting central bank trigger forex shortages, then a rapid loss of confidence as the so-called ‘flexible’ exchange rate regime flips and attempts to float (exchange rate as the first line of defence).

After a massive confidence shock is delivered including credit downgrades, steep rate hikes and an economic contraction to kill credit is needed to restore the confidence in the currency and stabilize the monetary system.

### The unbearable selfishness of being “Maavai” Senathirajah

*2024-02-09 05:46:39* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-unbearable-selfishness-of-being-Maavai-Senathirajah/4-758285) · `en`

The heading of this article is inspired by the title of Milan Kundera’s novel “The Unbearable Lightness of Being”. That novel was set in the eventful Prague spring period of the then undivided Czechoslovakia. This article is about an octogenarian Tamil political leader who tries to cling on to power selfishly without stepping down gracefully.

The party leader I am referring to is Somasundaram Senathirajah known popularly as “Maavai” Senathirajah and/or Maavai. Until 27 January 2024, Senathirajah was the President of the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK) known as the Federal Party (FP) in English. Senathirajah however continues to act as the party president in a business as usual fashion.

### Law making and the economic crisis in Sri Lanka

The proposed Anti-Terrorism Act and the recently adopted Online Safety Act aim to discourage people who are

reeling under economic dispossession from fighting a just economic arrangement

What can law do during an economic crisis? What is law actually doing during the current economic crisis in Sri Lanka? These are two questions that I thought I would reflect upon, when I was invited to speak at a panel discussion on the role of law in overcoming the current economic crisis held at the Jaffna Law Conference recently. Neither a lawyer nor an economist, I try to engage with these questions as a teacher of critical theory and as someone who lives and works amidst the economic crisis that is plaguing the country. With gratitude, I draw from the careful analyses of the recent legal reforms offered by lawyers, economists, trade unionists and activists who work for social justice in Sri Lanka.

### Cabinet approves import of 15,000 tons of cashew nut to address shortage

*2024-02-09 05:11:06* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/Cabinet-approves-import-of-15-000-tons-of-cashew-nut-to-address-shortage/34-758276) · `en`

The Cabinet of Ministers approved importing a maximum of 15,000 tons of cashew nuts in the shell this year as the local production capacity falls short to 12,500 tons, leading to an urgent need for intervention.

The annual demand is 25,000 tons of cashew nuts but the cashew industry in the country is facing a very unfortunate situation as the crop has not been harvested as expected in the last season.

Additionally, a committee comprising senior officials from relevant Ministries will determine the quantity to be imported from December to April over the next four years, bridging the gap during the offseason when local cashew harvests are unavailable.

The proposal presented by the Agriculture and Plantation Minister received approval at the Cabinet of Ministers’ meeting on Monday.

### SJB firm on non-support - Nalin Bandara highlights incompatibility with SLPP

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Nalin Bandara yesterday expressed the party’s inability to support the President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s endeavours to revive Sri Lanka, citing his collaboration with the leaders of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the same party responsible for the country’s bankruptcy.

“The President has made many statements of Government policy within the last two years. In turn, Government MPs are now singing the praises of the President. Yesterday President Wickremesinghe questioned why the SJB cannot support him as the Pohottuwa members have. That is the very reason we cannot support his efforts,” Bandara said.  He remarked that those responsible for leading the country to bankruptcy since 2005 are now praising Wickremesinghe, and they appear to view the President in a favourable light.  “SJB lawyers even filed cases against them, and they were found responsible for the crisis. Hence, we are unable to collaborate with them,” he said.

### When the ‘Weight’ of Bread is Too Much to Bear! - EDITORIAL

The study of the history of bread in Sri Lanka provides us with an interesting story. Despite Sri Lankan homes trying to dissuade eating bread - stating that such foods invite disease early in life - the baked meal made of flour has held on to its place on the dining table despite fighting for survival amidst government regulations imposed on bakery and restaurant owners.

The present regulation is that a loaf of bread must weigh a minimum of 450 grams. This was made mandatory following a government regulation confirmed through gazette notification recently. However, bakery owners are complaining that there must be a price control now because an unofficial price revision has taken place to balance costs with the increase in the weight of a loaf of bread.

Do as I say, not as I do. This is the mantra with which the imperialist West keeps its colonial or neo-colonial projects going. This duplicity is also evident in the imperialists’ media policy.

Often, developing countries’ mid-career journalists are invited to the West for training that lasts weeks, months, and even a year. The institutes to which they go meet the airfare, accommodation, and meal costs. They are even paid per diem. They are lectured on journalistic rules and dos and don’ts. They are taught that journalism’s first obligation is to the truth, which is sacred and cannot be warped or violated. The primary duty of the journalist is to find out the truth, verify it, fact-check it, and convey it to the people they are morally bound to serve.

Australia, Feb 8 (Independent) - Australia is set to pass a law that will provide employees the right to refuse unreasonable calls from bosses outside of work hours without facing penalty.

The "right to disconnect" is among the various changes to industrial relations laws proposed by the federal government in a parliamentary bill.

Prime minister Anthony Albanese’s government said these changes would safeguard workers’ rights and contribute to restoring a healthy work-life balance.

It would also mean potential fines for employers that breach the rule.

His Labor party’s so-called “closing loopholes” bill which is meant to plug gaps that undercut workers’ pay and conditions has won the support of the majority of senators for the legislation.

The left-wing Greens, which supports the rule and was the first to propose it last year, confirmed that the legislation was close to becoming a law after deals between Labor, smaller parties and independents to support this bill.

Sri Lanka is likely to extend visa exemption status for India after March to keep attracting travellers from the country and encourage repeat visits, Tourism and Lands, Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Harin Fernando said on Thursday.

“India is our number one source market and tourists from India helped our country on its path of recovery from the recent crisis we faced,” Fernando said in a session at OTM 2024.

Sri Lanka facilitated visa-free entry for Indian travellers from December 2023 to March. “We are working on extending it beyond March. We want to make Sri Lanka an easily accessible destination for Indians, who can just walk into our country for a hassle free holiday,” he said.

By offering visa exemption to Indians, Sri Lanka will attract more footfalls, especially those who make last-minute plans and find visa process a hindrance, he said.

“In the time of more options, we have to ease the travel process to encourage more tourists from India and repeat footfalls,” he added.

### Loneliness declared a public health emergency in part of Silicon Valley, California

Loneliness has been declared a public health emergency in a Californian county that includes part of Silicon Valley.

San Mateo County is the first in the US to make such a declaration.

About 17% of US adults questioned by Gallup in February last year said they had experienced loneliness the day before.

In San Mateo, however, about 45% of residents are struggling with isolation, according to David Canepa from the county’s board of supervisors.

Across the US there is an “epidemic of loneliness and isolation”, US Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy has said.

It is an “underappreciated public health crisis” which has “harmed individual and societal health”, he added.

Concerns in San Mateo are not confined to one demographic, Mr Canepa said.

Teenagers and young adults spend a long time on social media, he pointed out, while Silicon Valley’s high-achieving atmosphere may put stress on those still in education.

Many older residents became especially isolated during the pandemic, he added.

It is the duty of Parliament to properly implement the proposals proposed by the High Court on the Bill.

### ‘VAT surge threatens Sri Lanka’s housing and foreign investments’

*2024-02-08 20:21:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/vat-surge-threatens-sri-lankas-housing-and-foreign-investments/) · `en`

In the intricate case of Sri Lanka’s economic rejuvenation, the recent surge in the Value Added Tax (VAT) to 18 percent, coupled with the removal of certain industries from the exemptions list, has emerged as a focal point for concern among foreign investors assessing the country’s economic climate.

This shift, occurring within the context of an already sophisticated taxation structure, presents multifaceted challenges that, if left unaddressed, could potentially impede the nation’s growth trajectory, particularly within the critical housing development sector.

Investments in housing development surpass the realm of mere financial transactions; they are integral components of economic growth and societal development. The recent VAT hike, however, casts a shadow over the sector, raising the cost of projects and thereby creating formidable barriers for middle-class and first-time homebuyers.

COLOMBO (News 1st); In a significant development today, the opposition leader raised concerns over the Online Safety Act, pointing out nine clauses that are allegedly not in line with the determination given by the Supreme Court.

Despite these concerns, Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa maintained a firm stance, stating that no part of the passed Act can be altered.

A heated exchange erupted in the Sri Lankan Parliament today between Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena over the passing of the Online Safety Bill, which critics say violates Supreme Court rulings and disregards judicial guidance.

Premadasa accused the government of ignoring the court's recommendations on several key clauses of the bill, including those pertaining to revoking internet access and addressing contempt of court. He highlighted the court's emphasis on the need for due process and magisterial oversight, both of which he claims are absent in the current legislation.
