Facing societal pressures and economic challenges, the government is criticized for its handling of taxes and adherence to IMF directives, leading to a perceived "tax tsunami" affecting citizens. Despite these issues, efforts like the Universal Information Technology Program, investing in smart classrooms, and the push for digital literacy and green education are highlighted as steps towards addressing national concerns and fostering growth.

üü©

Today, people are facing difficulties with irreversible pressure in society. Even though people are in poverty, the tax tsunami is not standing on the tax topic. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has accused the government of creating a formula for taxation and taxation of the International Monetary Fund.

This government has not been ordered to do everything the IMF says. If the government is efficient, there is no such thing as the opportunity to reach a good agreement for the people. The country is the toy rule in the rhythm of the International Monetary Fund. He said the government has imposed a tax tsunami on the shoulders of the people.

Under the Universal Information Technology Program, smart classroom equipment worth Rs 1,177,000 lakhs was held on Monday (17).

Basheer Segudaoud urges for a Tamil-speaking minority candidate to represent Tamil, Muslim, and Upcountry communities in Sri Lanka's presidential election, emphasizing the importance of unity among minorities to influence the outcome. He highlights the need for a candidate with strong ties to these communities, capable of securing support from Sinhala progressives and leading towards a more inclusive future.

üü©

United Peace Coalition Chairman Basheer Segudaoud said that a Tamil -speaking minority general candidate should be suspended as the overall representative of the Tamil, Muslim and Upcountry Minority Communities in the country.

He said this in a media statement issued to the media on Monday (17) regarding the general candidate in the presidential election.

The upcoming presidential election has become a speech. The proposed candidates of the Great Forces have come to the North, East and the hill country to seek the support of minority communities.

Vishwaroopam is the biggest match that the election has not existed before. Winning any candidate with a uniqueness can be as difficult as fiber in the stone.

Beyond that, it is no exaggeration if any candidate wants to get 50 percent of the votes.

A president could not appear from minority communities in Sri Lanka. But who is the President?Minority communities can become a power that determines.

Wanindu Hazaranga, Sri Lanka's captain, refrained from criticizing the US pitches or scheduling after losses, emphasizing the team's responsibility to adapt their strategies. Despite early preparation and practice matches, the team struggled with quick adjustments to the US conditions, affecting their performance in the R20 World Cup. Hazaranga highlighted the importance of adapting to varying pitches within the US, attributing their losses partly to this challenge.

üü©

Sri Lankan captain Wanindu Hazaranga has refused to criticize the US pitch or competition schedule for defeats in Sri Lanka.

'The other teams played the same pitch we played. It is our duty to change our game strategies, ‚Äùhe said.

The Sri Lankan team reached the United States about 10 days before the start of the R20 World Cup. Sri Lanka also played two training matches with the Netherlands and Ireland.

But Hazaranga feels that he is unable to quickly change themselves in accordance with the pitch given in the United States.

Sri Lanka scored 77 runs at the New York Nasav County Stadium against South Africa.

Sri Lanka then scored 124 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in Dallas in Dallas against Bangladesh. However, Sri Lanka lost due to the absence of leading bowlers to throw Death overs.

Sri Lanka's Super 8 round dream was scattered when the game with Nepal was completely abandoned.

Sri Lanka won by 83 runs in the match with the Netherlands. Or it would have returned to the country barefoot.

A proposal by Pathfinder Foundation Founder Milinda Moragoda to all presidential candidates and political parties

The Presidential and possible parliamentary elections are expected to take place later in 2024 and will be the most important set of elections in our post-Independence history. Sri Lanka can come out of the prevailing economic and political crises only if leaders and citizens are willing to recognise that the economy will have to grow by at least 6% per annum for the next 10 years, which is twice the growth rate projected by Sri Lankan authorities and international economists at the moment.

SMEs play a pivotal role in the economic development of the nation. Hence, priority should be provided to SMEs whenever new policies are articulated

Tax is an important source of revenue stream of any economy as it contributes significantly to national revenue. Amounting to approximately 88% of total national revenue, tax revenue is then utilised by the Sri Lankan Government to settle ongoing national loans, recurrent expenditures, and capital expenditures. Tax systems in Sri Lanka have undergone significant changes since inception of the taxation policies. In late 2019, the tax revenue drastically dropped due to the new policies articulated by the Government. The situation worsened during the COVID pandemic in 2020 until recovery.

The move was widely expected following Benny Gantz‚Äôs departure earlier this month, which he said came after mounting frustrations over Netanyahu‚Äôs handling of the war. Gantz‚Äôs absence makes Netanyahu more dependent on his ultranationalist allies to govern and the dissolution of the War Cabinet underlines that shift is underway as Israel continues its eight-month-long war in Gaza.
