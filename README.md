COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka currently has the highest electricity charges in South Asia, with households paying 2.5 to 3 times more for electricity than the average price paid by households in other South Asian countries, according to analysis that was published this week.

Published on PublicFinance.lk, Sri Lanka’s premier economic insights platform, this analysis by Verité Research looked at what households are charged for their electricity when consuming 100, 200 or 300 units, at the start of 2024.

The calculation only took into account the charges of the supplier, and did not include government taxes such as the Social Security Levy, which is charged additionally in Sri Lanka.

The second highest household electricity charges in the region are in Pakistan; yet they are far less than in Sri Lanka. Households consuming 100 units are charged 50% more in Sri Lanka than Pakistan; and those consuming 300 units are charged 97% more in Sri Lanka.

### Sri Lanka in talks to push wind projects forward, minister says

*2024-02-08 13:07:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97111/sri-lanka-in-talks-to-push-wind-projects-forward-minister-says) · `en`

Sri Lanka is hopeful of making progress by next month on two delayed wind energy projects to be built by India’s Adani Green Energy Ltd, its energy minister said on Wednesday.

The cash-strapped south Asian island nation, which has suffered from crippling power blackouts and fuel shortages, has been trying to speed green power generation to hedge against surges in imported fuel costs, but the wind projects are still being evaluated because of disputes over pricing and plant efficiency.

“Maybe in the next four weeks, we will see some results on the negotiation process, and there is another negotiation for the transmission lines that is also being evaluated,” Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the India Energy Week event in Goa.

“Both are (happening) simultaneously, so I am hopeful that by March, we will have something,” he said.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected Hamas’s proposed ceasefire terms - saying “total victory” in Gaza is possible within months.

He was speaking after Hamas laid out a series of demands in response to an Israel-backed ceasefire proposal.

Mr Netanyahu said negotiations with the group were “not going anywhere” and described their terms as “bizarre”.

“There is no other solution but a complete and final victory,” Mr Netanyahu told a news conference on Wednesday.

“If Hamas will survive in Gaza, it’s only a question of time until the next massacre.”

Israel was expected to take issue with Hamas’s counter-offer, but this response is a categorical rebuke, and Israeli officials clearly see an effort by Hamas to end the war on its terms as utterly unacceptable.

Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told the Reuters news agency that Mr Netanyahu’s remarks “are a form of political bravado”, and show he intends to pursue the conflict in the region.

### CBSL eases borrowing limits for banks

*2024-02-08 08:19:00* · [`newsfirstlk`](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/02/08/cbsl-eases-borrowing-limits-for-banks/) · `en`

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) announced today a relaxation of restrictions on borrowing by commercial banks, aiming to stimulate the domestic money market and accelerate a decline in interest rates.

In January 2023, the CBSL imposed limits on banks' access to its overnight lending and deposit facilities (Standing Lending Facility and Standing Deposit Facility) to encourage them to rely more on the interbank call money market. This move aimed to revitalize the money market and reduce banks' overdependence on the central bank.

The CBSL reports that the initial restrictions achieved their intended goals, reactivating the money market and moderating competition for deposits among banks. The measures also helped align market interest rates with the central bank's monetary policy stance while maintaining financial system stability.
