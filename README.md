### Oil falls as US recession fears offset Mideast tensions

*2024-08-05 11:40:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101002/oil-falls-as-us-recession-fears-offset-mideast-tensions) ┬╖ `en`

Oil prices fell on Monday as fears of a recession in the United States, the worldтАЩs top oil consumer, offset concerns that escalating tensions in the Middle East may affect supplies from the largest producing region.

Brent crude futures inched down 4 cents, or 0.1%, to $76.77 a barrel by 0035 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $73.39 a barrel, down 13 cents, or 0.2%.

Prices were supported by persistent fighting in Gaza with an Israeli airstrike hitting two schools and killing at least 30 people on Sunday, Palestinian officials said, the day after a round of talks in Cairo ended without result.

Israel and the United States are bracing for a serious escalation in the region after Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah pledged to retaliate against Israel for the killings of HamasтАЩ leader Ismail Haniyeh and Fuad Shukr, a top military commander from Lebanese armed group Hezbollah last week.

### Monster assembled from human flaws? Frankenstein would make a Trump

Someone asked тАЬWhy do some British people not like Donald Trump?тАЭ Nate White, an articulate and witty writer from England wrote the following response:A few things spring to mind. Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace тАУ all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.

So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw TrumpтАЩs limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.

Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing тАУ not once, ever.

I donтАЩt say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility тАУ for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.

At least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes in Bangladesh on Sunday as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse tens of thousands of protesters calling for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign.

The death toll, which includes at least 13 policemen, was the highest for a single day from any protests in BangladeshтАЩs recent history, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on July 19 when students took to the streets to demand the scrapping of quotas for government jobs.

The government declared an indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Sunday, the first time it has taken such a step during the current protests that began last month. It also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday.

The unrest, which has prompted the government to shut down internet services, is HasinaтАЩs biggest test in her 20-year regime after she won a fourth straight term in elections that were boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

He can vote during the referendum by coming to the polling station, which is registered in the voting of the polling district, and by promoting his vote in the office of the Postal Voting Officer's Office.

An official voter card mentioned in the name of the charioteer's name, voting vote, the date of the election, the date and the time of the election.

There will be no chance of voting at a polling station at the referendum mentioned in it,

Therefore, the Election Commission will announce to all the media that the official announcement of the Election Commission is to be released to all the media and all the voters to go to the polling station mentioned on its official voter card, rather than cheating on such unrealistic news.
