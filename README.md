“Though stringent regulations have been introduced, a lack of capacity in the application of these regulations results in the continued mismanagement of chemical imports to the country,” the UNDP said in a statement.

The ‘Integrated Management and Environmentally Sound Disposal of POPs Pesticides in the Agricultural Sector and Mercury & Waste in the Healthcare Sector in Sri Lanka’ project is implemented by the Environment Ministry and the United Nations Development Programme.

A number of fuel stations were closed across Pakistan on Friday morning following a strike called by petroleum dealers against a new taxation measure introduced by the government to boost revenue and cover its financial shortfall.

The Pakistani government has set a challenging revenue collection target to help clinch an International Monetary Fund bailout but faces public anger over new taxes, including taxes on dealers, which were introduced in the annual budget last month.

“There is a nationwide strike by dealers and pumps are shut in every city except Islamabad and Rawalpindi,” Abdul Sami Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA), told Reuters, adding that the strike is due to the government’s decision to impose a 0.5% tax on dealers’ turnover. Khan said it was too soon to give statistics on the number of pumps on strike.

*2024-07-05 11:26:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187733) · `ta`

Coastal guards in Moetania have retrieved the bodies of 89 migrants from the Atlantic, while nine survivors, including a child, were rescued.

This tragedy highlights the dangers faced by migrants attempting to reach Europe via Moetania, a key transit point. In 2023, over 40,000 migrants reached Spain's Canary Islands, marking an increase from the previous year. The Spanish government reported that more than 4,000 individuals lost their lives in the Mediterranean Sea within the first five months of 2024 alone, underscoring the perilous journey many undertake in search of safer shores.

Moetania is the main intermediate country for immigrants trying to travel from West Africa to Europe. It is customary for thousands of boats to leave here with immigrants.

Boats traveling on this dangerous route are heading towards Spain's Kanari Islands - the Spanish government, which reports that more than 40,000 people arrived on the island last year, said it was more than the previous year.

Migrants who are trying to go to Europe are making dangerous trips on boats loaded.

More than 4,000 people have died in the sea in the first five months of 2024, the Spanish government said.
