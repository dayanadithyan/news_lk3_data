### Human Rights Watch alleges crackdown over civil war anniversary

*2024-05-27 00:47:32* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Human-Rights-Watch-alleges-crackdown-over-civil-war-anniversary/56-762179) · `en`

Cites UN report calling for international prosecutions for enforced disappearances

Sri Lankan authorities have threatened and detained Tamils commemorating those who died or went missing in the country’s civil war, Human Rights Watch said last week.

On 17 May the United Nations human rights office issued a report calling for international prosecutions and other accountability measures to address the thousands of unresolved cases of enforced disappearances in the war, which ended on 18 May 18, 2009.

“The Sri Lankan Government is in denial about atrocities its forces committed during the civil war, so it tries to silence victims and their communities instead of providing truth, justice, and reparations,” said Human Rights Watch Asia Director Elaine Pearson. “It’s clear that more international action is needed to bring relief to victims and prevent a recurrence of abuses.”

### 15 years after end of war, victims and survivors still await justice and accountability: ICJ

*2024-05-27 00:43:55* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/15-years-after-end-of-war-victims-and-survivors-still-await-justice-and-accountability-ICJ/56-762178) · `en`

As Sri Lanka marked 15 years since the end of a decades-long armed conflict on 18 May, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) deplored the near total impunity that has prevailed, and lack of victim-centred justice and accountability for war time atrocities.

The ICJ calls on the responsible authorities to reverse course and take measures that will provide real access to justice for the conflict’s numerous victims and survivors and bring those responsible for crimes under international law to account.

The bleak picture is reinforced by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in a report released on 17 May, titled Accountability for Enforced Disappearances in Sri Lanka. The report notes the near total impunity enjoyed by perpetrators of widespread enforced disappearances over four decades and a systematic failure to account for the fate and whereabouts of victims.

### Why Sri Lanka needs to ditch post-dated cheques

*2024-05-27 00:26:09* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-Sri-Lanka-needs-to-ditch-post-dated-cheques/4-762177) · `en`

A post-dated cheque represents a future promise to pay, not a completed transaction

A post-dated cheque is a regular cheque with a future date written on it. This means the cheque writer instructs the bank not to pay the cheque until that future date arrives.

Purpose: People use them to ensure the recipient waits to deposit the cheque. There are a couple of reasons for this:

The writer doesn’t have enough funds currently but expects to by the future date.

The cheque is for a prepayment, like paying for a service before it’s completed.

Validity: The rules around post-dated cheques can vary depending on the country. In some places, like the US and UK, banks can process them even before the written date. In other places, like India and Australia, the bank has to wait until the date on the cheque.

Legality: Post-dated cheques are generally legal and considered negotiable instruments.

### China and Russia together: A new world order?

*2024-05-27 00:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/China-and-Russia-together-A-new-world-order/172-283380) · `en`

The vision of Putin and Xi Jinping is not about creating a new empire challenging the American version. But they want to be taken seriously

China is more ambitious about countering American power through trade. This is where Xi Jinping is walking a fine line between Russia and Western Europe (the European Union)

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s state visit to China is more than a show of friendship and unity in adversity. It shows ambition on both sides to create a new multi-polar world order challenging the unipolar status enjoyed by the United States since the dismemberment of the former USSR, ending decades of bipolar politics, the Cold War and détente.

### Presidential pardons -for whose benefit? - EDITORIAL

*2024-05-27 00:01:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Presidential-pardons-for-whose-benefit-EDITORIAL/172-283379) · `en`

The large-scale pardoning of prisoners by Lankan Presidents for the commission of minor crimes has become customary during particular festivals, for example the day marking the country’s independence, Vesak and Christmas.

Often these pardons have been granted to persons who were among those taken in for commission of petty criminal activity.

The Task Force on Judicial and Legal Causes for Prison Overcrowding and Prison Reforms reveals that nearly 52 percent of the prison population consists of persons unconvicted of any crime.

While the total prison capacity in the country in 2022 stood at 11,291 inmates, the report added the number of imprisoned reached 26,176 individuals by the end of 2022. The number comprised 16,727 suspects and 9,449 convicts.

To make matters worse, during these trying times, the state spends around Rs. 8.3 billion to look after the prisoners.

Given these circumstances, many of our people hardly ever opposed the freeing of prisoners by the head of state.

The Aragalaya had been launched with the demand “Gota go home” or “Go Home Gota”. This objective was realised in July 2022. Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country and resigned from abroad as President. Ranil took over as acting president on  July 14, 2022

President Ranil Wickremesinghe welcomed to the Ceylon Workers’ Congress May Day rally at Kotagala

Sri Lanka’s  United National Party (UNP) suffered a humiliating electoral defeat in the 2020 Parliamentary elections. Electoral debacles were nothing new to the UNP which is  referred to by some as the grand old party.

### Resilience and revival amidst revered rituals: A post-Vesak pondering

*2024-05-26 23:36:16* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Resilience-and-revival-amidst-revered-rituals-A-post-Vesak-pondering/4-762166) · `en`

We have just witnessed a colourful Vesak amid heavy showers. Amidst the economic woes, enthusiastic devotees resorted to various rituals with reverence. Sri Lankans have begun to show their serenity, synergy, and solidarity, in steadily moving through a turbulence. Today’s column reflects our resilience and revival, with inherited prospects and pitfalls.

“Our ability to reach unity in diversity will be the beauty and test of our civilisation,” said Mahatma Gandhi. In fact, it is our duty to ensure that beauty of unity in diversity. It is encouraging to see people from all walks of life coming forward with rare unity despite typical blame games of opportunistic politicians. Vesak as a festival of light was a reassurance of “Apekema” (the “SriLankanness”) dispelling the darkness of chaos and confusion. The starting point of such a rich experience is the inner serenity or stillness.
