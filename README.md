### Amid election fever a dark horse rises - EDITORIAL

Polls fever in the country is heating up. Yet, ‘we the people’ are not certain whether the poll would be for a general election, presidential poll or whether a poll will be held at all. Our constitution however, dictates a presidential election is due during the fourth quarter of the year.

One thing seems certain; we still see the same faces who played a major role in bankrupting the country, putting themselves forward to lead us and our country into new vistas of prosperity.

While political parties are busy blaming each other for bringing this country to a state of bankruptcy, we do not hear any one of them raising a hand and saying ‘mea maxima culpa’ – through my most grievous fault or even saying ‘I am sorry’. Rather, we are being treated to a number of political dramas.

Solving social issues can be considered as the fundamental responsibility of the Government in a democratic country

It is vital to convert these social issues into political issues to get a reasonable solution for the issues. However, despite this critical nature, all these issues are not always translated into the political agenda of the political parties. You might observe even some crucial issues are not getting the attention of the policymakers in the country

Even though each of us has individual desires to achieve, we all live in a society in which the activities of various actors are interconnected as seen in a spider web. Thus, it is difficult to progress as an individual in society while ignoring these interactions. Social issues are problems or conditions that negatively impact individuals, communities, or society as a whole. These problems can affect different aspects of people’s lives due to various interdependencies existing in society.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has decided to explore the option of relocating Ceylon Petroleum Corporation’s oil refinery to Trincomalee, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.

The cabinet of ministers this week approved a proposal to spin off the refinery as a separate company to raise capital from local and foreign investors to modernize the 1969 structure.

### Bangladesh mocks Sri Lanka after series defeat

Mar. 19 (Daily Mirror) - Bangladesh clinched the third ODI against Sri Lanka by four wickets to secure a 2-1 series win on Monday (18) which was followed up by a celebration from their veteran wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim who brought his helmet as they were lining up to pose for the post-match photograph adding more fuel to the fire.

At the conclusion of the T20 series, Sri Lanka team brought out the 'timed-out' celebration which appeared to upset Bangladesh captain Najmul Shanto who claimed that the Islanders needed to move on from it, but on Monday Rahim probably made him eat his words when he went as far as taking his helmet to take the photographs after post-match presentation.

It doesn't look like either team is going to move on from the 'timed-out' celebration anytime soon as an unlikely rivalry is growing strong between a team that has won two ICC World Cups and played in six World Cup Finals, against a team that is yet to play ICC World Cup semi-final.

Global ocean surface temperatures started breaking daily records in mid-March last year, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, fueling concerns for marine life and extreme weather across the planet.

“The amplitude by which previous sea surface temperature records were beaten in 2023, and now again in 2024, is remarkable,” said Joel Hirschi, associate head of marine systems modeling at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK.

Global average ocean temperatures in 2023 were 0.25 degrees Celsius warmer than the previous year, said Gregory C. Johnson, a NOAA oceanographer. That rise is “is equivalent to about two decades’ worth of warming in a single year,” he told CNN. “So it is quite large, quite significant, and a bit surprising.”
