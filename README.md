### பொருளாதார செயற்திட்டத்தை இடைநிறுத்துவது மீண்டும் நெருக்கடிக்குள் செல்வதற்கே வழிவகுக்கும் - நந்தலால் வீரசிங்க

*2024-08-28 03:18:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/192180) · `ta`

தற்போது முன்னெடுக்கப்பட்டுவரும் பொருளாதார செயற்திட்டத்தை இடைநிறுத்துவதானது சுமார் இருவருடங்களுக்கு முன்னர் நாடு முகங்கொடுத்த பொருளாதார, சமூக நெருக்கடி மீண்டும் தோன்றுவதற்கே வழிகோலும் என இலங்கை மத்திய வங்கியின் ஆளுநர் கலாநிதி நந்தலால் வீரசிங்க எச்சரித்துள்ளார்.

கொழும்பில் நடைபெற்ற இலங்கை தொழில்வல்லுனர் அமைப்பின் 37 ஆவது வருடாந்தக் கூட்டத்தில் கலந்துகொண்டு உரையாற்றுகையிலேயே அவர் மேற்கண்டவாறு எச்சரிக்கை விடுத்துள்ளார்.

நாட்டின் பொருளாதார மீட்சியை இலக்காகக்கொண்டு தற்போது முன்னெடுக்கப்பட்டுவரும் மறுசீரமைப்பு செயற்முறையானது நடுத்தர - நீண்டகால பொருளாதார வளர்ச்சிக்கு இன்றியமையாதது எனவும் ஆளுநர் சுட்டிக்காட்டியுள்ளார்.

அத்தோடு குறுங்கால மறுசீரமைப்புக்கள் கடினமானவையாக இருப்பினும், நீண்டகாலமாக நிலுவையில் இருந்த இந்த மறுசீரமைப்புக்களை நடைமுறைப்படுத்துவதற்கு சகல தரப்பினரும் அர்ப்பணிப்புடன் செயற்படுவது நிலைபேறான வளர்ச்சியை நோக்கிய பாதையில் நாட்டை நகர்த்திச்செல்வதற்கு அவசியம் என்றும் அவர் வலியுறுத்தியுள்ளார்.

*2024-08-28 02:12:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/192136) · `ta`

ஜனாதிபதித் தேர்தலில் சஜித் பிரேமதாச வெற்றி பெற்றால் நாட்டை ஆளப் போவது அவரல்ல. மாறாக அவரது மனைவி, சகோதரி உள்ளிட்ட "பிரேமதாச" குடும்ப உறுப்பினர்களே என நகர அபிவிருத்தி மற்றும் வீடமைப்பு அமைச்சர் பிரசன்ன ரணதுங்க தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

சபிக்கப்பட்ட குடும்ப ஆட்சியில் இருந்து நாட்டைக் காப்பாற்ற வேண்டுமானால் இந்த ஜனாதிபதித் தேர்தலில் ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்கவுக்கு வாக்களிக்க வேண்டும் என அமைச்சர் வலியுறுத்துகிறார். ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்க இந்த நாட்டின் அரசியலில் பலரால் தவறவிடப்பட்ட ஒரு ஜனநாயகத் தலைவர் என்றும் அமைச்சர் கூறினார்.

குடும்ப ஆட்சி என்பது ஒரு நாட்டுக்கு சாபக்கேடு. குடும்ப ஆட்சியில் எந்த நாடும் வளர்ச்சி அடையவில்லை. குடும்ப ஆட்சி பற்றி பேசும் போது அனைவரும் ராஜபக்ச குடும்ப ஆட்சி பற்றி பேசுகிறார்கள். ஆனால் பிரேமதாச குடும்ப ஆட்சி பற்றி பேசப்படுவது குறைவாகவே உள்ளது.

### Knowing When To Step Aside: Mark Of True Leadership

Presidential aspirant Wickremesinghe’s recent appeal to Sri Lankans to vote for the Gas Cylinder symbol, with the ominous warning that failure to do so will result in long queues for essentials, reflects a troubling mindset.

This statement, which seems to equate the temporary resolution of gas shortages with his qualification to lead the nation, is out of touch and a poor Marcom strategy. It suggests that Wickremesinghe and his advisors believe that merely avoiding crises is enough to secure the presidency, ignoring the deeper, more pressing needs of the country.

Wickremesinghe’s approach is similar to his previous attempts to appeal to the masses with shallow gestures, such as his infamous offer of chewing gum to farmers, a tone-deaf proposal that highlighted his disconnection from the realities of rural life.
