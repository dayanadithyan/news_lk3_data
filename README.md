These attacks came just after my friend Lasantha Wickramatunge implored me to leave the country and not too long before he himself was killed. It was a time not just of exile but abandonment; for reasons of convenience or fear almost all those I considered friends avoided me. There were a handful who didnтАЩt give a damn about possible consequences or cared enough to be supportive. I didnтАЩt count Harry among them.
