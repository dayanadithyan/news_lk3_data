The Speaker said this while commenting on the appointment of the Inspector General of Police in Parliament today (26).

We have not taken any wrong decision. We have taken a reasonable, right resolution of the constitution deeply. That resolution may seem incorrectly for you (awakening the opposition). But we made that decision in the right way.

I have taken this decision from the house and is completely false. 41 (d) - I used the word for me in Article 5. The appointment of the Inspector General of Police with the approval of the Constituent Assembly and the approval of the Parliament was unprecedented.

So there are steps to solve this post in case of vacuum. Or the court must provide a solution for this. He said that even the president could not decide on this.

Zambada, who is believed to be in his 70s, and Guzman Lopez, who is in his 30s, were detained after landing in a private plane in the El Paso area, two U.S. officials told Reuters.

### Sri Lanka election announcement triggers unexpected constitutional conundrum

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì The formal announcement of the presidential elections on Friday has triggered limitations on the executive that will complicate its uneasy relations with the judiciary and plunge the country into a constitutional conundrum, as an acting police chief was not immediately appointed following a court order.

Incumbent Inspector General, Deshabandu Tennakoon, was barred from exercising the powers of his position by the Supreme Court, which decided to hear nine petitions against his controversial appointment in February.

Election officials said the executive loses its power to make any appointments or even transfer public servants when an election has been called. This restriction could hinder the appointment of an acting police chief.

Although the court has said President Ranil Wickremesinghe can appoint a suitable officer as the Acting Inspector General, no immediate action was taken, and the operation of election law from Friday bars him from doing so.
