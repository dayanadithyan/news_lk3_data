Sri Lanka is set to hold a Presidential Election in September this year, followed closely by a General Election. However, the country continues to grapple with widespread allegations of malfunction, corruption, fraud, nepotism, and the pervasive influence of party politics across nearly every facet of society.

Over the last 70 years since independence, our governing political parties and coalitions have introduced policies under the guise of Capitalism, Socialism, and Liberalism. They have also advocated local and foreign policies based on Americanisation, Europeanisation, Neutralisation (non-aligned), Globalisation, тАЬChineseisationтАЭ and more recently possible тАЬIndianisation.тАЭ All political parties and their coalitions came to power insisting that there was тАЬno other wayтАЭ to develop the nation other than through the emulation and absorption of one of these political cultures and their policies for economic, social, and political development.

### To All Presidential Candidates: Harnessing The Ocean: A Strategic Economic Plan For Sri Lanka

*2024-08-12 20:56:12* ┬╖ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/to-all-presidential-candidates-harnessing-the-ocean-a-strategic-economic-plan-for-sri-lanka/) ┬╖ `en`

As the race for the presidency intensifies, it is disheartening to see some candidates failing to present concrete economic plans. Instead, they resort to empty rhetoric, hoping to win over voters with hollow promises. However, politics is not a game of words; it requires well-thought-out strategies. Among the most critical elements that any serious economic plan must include is the oceanтАФan invaluable resource that has long been overlooked.

Sri Lanka is often described as a nation sitting on a treasure chest, surrounded by the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean. This includes a large Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and a significant confidential shelf landmass rich in valuable graphite. Yet, despite the wealth of resources it offers, there has been no comprehensive plan to unlock its true potential. The ocean is not just a body of water; it is a reservoir of economic opportunities that could propel our nation to new heights.

The two teams are in the same position as the ICC World Test Championships ended in the face of the World Test Championships.

South Africa continued to rank 26.67 percent with 16 points and the West Indies continued at 9th with 20.83 per cent.

If we are to thrive, as a nation, in this dynamic landscape, we must adopt a mindset that is not fearful of change

As we prepare to vote in the 9th Executive President of Sri Lanka, let us recognise some hard truths. Sri Lanka has very little to show after 76 years of independence. Selfish, sleazy, sly, corrupt and unaccountable leaders and their Governments have, through their policies, actions, and inactions, over the past several years, led the country into various political and economic crises ranging from ethnic conflicts including a 30-year-long civil war, insurrections, constitutional uprisings, race-based riots, тАШEaster bombingsтАЩ to economic collapse, social discord and bankruptcy. Bribery and corruption pervade every nook and corner of the system. It has been the scourge of our society particularly in the past half century
