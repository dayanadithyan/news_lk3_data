Leasing and debt installment payers  voiced concerns over Central Bank’s silence regarding the questionable practices of unregulated online loan providers in Sri Lanka.

Under the banner ‘Association of Leasing and Debt Installment Payers (ALDS)’, the group asserted that borrowers have no legal obligation to repay loans obtained from these unauthorised online lenders.

“Despite numerous complaints passed over to the Central Bank (CB), there has been no response, leading to suspicions that CB officials may be benefiting from these institutions,” ALDS Deputy Secretary Asanka Sumedha Amarasingha alleged during a press briefing in Colombo recently.

According to Robocash which is rebranded as UNA Financial, the user base of Sri Lanka’s digital lending services have seen a 125-fold increase from 10,600 users in August 2021 to a staggering 1.3 million by November 2023.

### Valentine's Day: 'There's more than sex. There's a lot of love there '

Valentine's Day: 'There's more than sex. There's a lot of love there '

"Love is felt. No one can label the love of that heart. There are times when Valentine's Day will love to stay with freedom with the man who loves them so much. But they have no freedom. "

In love, the king's abundance is the most beautiful of the world, as well as those who have left their lives for their love for their love.

Shashini, who joined the Valentine's day on February 14, told the BBC Sinhala service that they were banned from Sri Lankan society to love with his partner.

Shashiy and her companion's love story has begun about 4 years ago. Yet, BBC told the Sinhala.

"I and I went to a restroom. We saw a Straight Cuppal (Straight Cuple), watching the eating and talking to us, we saw one thing. I didn't have any problem. But for a while, I thought it was tortured and worried for us. So we returned to pack the bill, packing the food that quickly carped. "

### Political aspirations with greed for power still continue with our present politicians too

Time is ripe for the voters to elect politicians who are honest, educated, and young, and people with principles and a vision to change the systems management and implementation – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

It is most unfortunate that the bungling of national issues commenced with the greed for power by one of our most educated politicians in Sri Lanka, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, in bringing the “Sinhala Only” bill into effect in Parliament after his victory in 1956. That caused the division in Sri Lanka driving away some of the most educated and qualified public officers, including the “Burgher” population, to leave the country in search of better pastures. It reversed the economic and political stability we had.

The long drawn out war commencing from the assassination of the Mayor of Jaffna Alfred Duraiappah in 1975 till 2009, saw the darkest period of racial riots in this country caused by blatant mistakes committed by our leading politicians.

### Anura Bandaranaike: “Always the bridesmaid, never the bride”

What do Ranil Wickremesinghe, Dinesh Gunawardena and Anura Bandaranaike have in common? They were born a year after independence in 1949 and were classmates together at Royal College, Colombo. All three were from illustrious families involved in politics and went on to be brightly shining stars in the Island nation’s political firmament.

Anura Bandaranaike born on 15 February 1949 was regarded as the crown prince of Lankan politics due to the fact that he was the son of SWRD and Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Both of them served as Prime Ministers. Despite this impressive political pedigree, Anura was never a Prime Minister or President. That honour went to his elder sister Chandrika Kumaratunge who was both premier and president. Anura however held many posts like MP, Leader of the Opposition, Cabinet Minister and Speaker but was never “crowned as a King.” Anura passed away 16 years ago at the age of 59 in 2008.

“The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving servants of tyranny a good conscience “

History will remember President Ranil Wickremesinghe elected by a secret vote in Parliament to serve the remainder of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s presidential term for another curiously distinctive reason. He will be remembered for the number of policy statements and ceremonial openings of Parliament during his tenure.

Moral high ground is not a podium to preach from. It is an arduous mountain; one climbs on one’s own.

In his latest address he asked - “Why can’t we unite in a shared vision for the country’s well-being and the future?” Why can’t we reach a collective understanding for the benefit of our nation’s youth? Why can’t we join hands to reach great heights?” Rhetoric failed to conceal past failure.

Once the foreign employment term is completed, and the worker returns to Sri Lanka, payments can be made in rupees.

People waiting for hours to refill liquefied petroleum gas cylinders during Sri Lanka's economic crisis of 2022

There are worrying signs that policymakers and political parties simply have not grasped the magnitude of the problem at hand. The current direction of Sri Lanka’s economy and the overall mindset of a majority of economic and policy elites within and beyond the State, suggests a trajectory that will keep Sri Lanka dependent on foreign debt-financed trade deficits, vulnerable to shocks from energy prices, and unprepared for the next wave of transformation and economic growth.

### NGO Activities Amid Closing Civic Spaces - EDITORIAL

*2024-02-14 02:42:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/NGO-Activities-Amid-Closing-Civic-Spaces-EDITORIAL/172-276954) · `en`

On 10 February, this newspaper drew attention to a ‘not so new’ law – the ‘Non-Governmental Organisations (Registration and Supervision) Bill’, which the government claims is now ready. The Bill itself has been in the making for a long period, dating back to the era when our present President was Prime Minister of the country in 2017.

The aim of the bill as its name suggests is to register and supervise the activities of the NGOs in the country. Many Lankan leaders have attempted to use NGOs to promote their particular agendas. Unfortunately, at different times NGOs have fallen for the ruses of politicians.

Rather than involving themselves in meeting emergency situations or human needs, a number of NGOs have entangled themselves in narrow party political affiliated activities. However, whatever the rights and wrongs of the situation, what is frightening about the ‘Non-Governmental Organisations (Registration and Supervision) Bill’ is its timing.

### Counterfactual History: ‘Rohana Wijeweera visiting New Delhi in 1987.’

On the eve of JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s much-talked-about visit to India, let’s take a journey into counterfactual history!

Imagine the late JVP leader, Rohana Wijeweera travelling to New Delhi in 1987, or more plausibly, an industrious J.R. Jayawardene coaxing his Indian counterpart to invite Wijeweera (Granted, that is a tall order, considering that in the JVP’s assessment, payoffs of perpetuating violent opposition to the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord, favoured it over striking a compromise). That favourable context for a violent takeover remained so until Black Cats, PRA, and all the other assorted state-backed anti-JVP para militaries came to life. The JVP started targeting families of military personnel (or someone else did it and conveniently put it on the JVP account), shifting the military attitude into outright hostility towards the JVP.

### It is impossible to abolish the executive presidency - Pradeepa Mahanama

*2024-02-14 01:56:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/176317) · `ta`

If the executive presidency is to be abolished, the parliament must go to a two -thirds majority in parliament.. Pradeepa Mahanama, former chairman of the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission, said that it is not possible to abolish the executive presidency.

The abolition of the executive presidency is seen as the current main speech.

The 'Executive Presidential System' is the main feature of the second Republican Constitution in 1978.

The leaders who came to power after 1994 promised to abolish the executive presidency. But the promises made by the people have not been fulfilled. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has taken action through Parliament twice to abolish the executive presidency.

In most of the countries that promote democracy, the executive presidency is not in effect. The Cabinet -led governments that highlight the Parliament are currently in operation, so it is best to abolish the executive presidency.

But in an environment where the country today is present, there is a need for executive power. The reason is that we believe that we can solve many problems through executive power.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board has appointed Najmul Hosain Santo as the captain of the trio cricketers next year.

According to the new appointment, he will lead the Bangladesh team in the United States and the Caribbean Islands in June this year.

Shakib al -Hasan has said that he will quit the post of international ODI captain with the World Cup in India.

Due to this, the problem arose on the post of captain of the Bangladesh team. And in his left eye, he could not continue to play due to a retina problem last month.

The Bangladeshi Cricket Board said that although we consider Shakiba as our first choice, he had to hand over the responsibility to Santo in view of his physical condition.

Addressing the media, he highlighted that healthcare workers used to be involved in tasks such as transporting patients using wheelchairs and trolleys, as well as handling the transportation of blood and urine samples to and from patients.

"In foreign countries, healthcare workers are assisted by private companies in carrying out these activities. Turning these tasks into government services was a significant mistake on the part of the government. Those who engaged in election campaigns and poster campaigns were elected for their satisfaction in these roles," he said.
