Despite pro-regime claims of economic recovery, Sri Lanka‚Äôs prospects remain grim.

This has been the most rainy and squally Vesak that I can recall in my eight decades on this planet and it has made me grumpy. The depression in the Bay of Bengal has prepared all of for the couch of some psycho-quack conning folks with fictious talk of depressions.

This essay is in two separate parts unconnected with each other; a) Feeding the 225 and b) people taking the initiative into their hands and not relying on the state.

Jesus fed 5,000 with two fishes and five loaves (Mathew 14:13-21) and you may reckon that to be a great achievement but he did it only once. Our people in Sri Lanka have to keep feeding the 225 day-in-day-out every day of their lives. And where does it all go? Into political pockets! Import permits for luxury cars, insurance cover for wives, mistresses and sons and of course plain rip-off.

India, June 1 (BBC) - India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to win a third consecutive term in office, exit polls suggest.

Analysts warn the polls, released by various news agencies, have often been wrong in the past and are not impartial.

However, they have placed Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the frontrunner in the general election.

The BJP, the main opposition Congress party and regional rivals battled it out in a fierce campaign over seven phases of polling.

A party or coalition needs 272 seats in parliament to form a government.

The BJP led-coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), will cross this target - according to exit polls.

If Mr Modi wins, he will be only the second prime minister in India to hold office for three consecutive terms. The first to do so was Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first PM.

Addressing a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (31), State Minister Raghavan emphasized that the government, including President Ranil Wickremesinghe, is committed to finding the best possible resolution.

He stressed that the ongoing strike is causing a direct financial loss of around Rs. 150 million and wasting 1.8 million man-hours. ‚ÄúTherefore, our government must not waste any more time.‚Äù

### Sir Aldo Castellani (1877-1971), a great medical scientist

The Twentieth Century Impressions of Ceylon, that massive volume of Ceylonians published in 1910, records that the man who came to be known as Marchese Sir Aldo Castellani, KCMG, was born on the September 8, 1874, or just a 100 years ago (as this is being written). But who, a reader of the younger generation may well inquire, was this man, and why should we take note of this centenary of his birth? Well, he was a versatile character who had a distinguished career in Ceylon for 12 years as a physician and medical scientist. Thereafter in a long life, he continued to hit the headlines in many foreign fields.

Castellani‚Äôs name appeared in such reference books as ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Who‚Äù, the ‚ÄúInternational Who‚Äôs Who‚Äù and the ‚ÄúAuthors and Artists Who‚Äôs Who‚Äù, but in each case with a different year of birth. I am inclined to accept the date of birth given in ‚ÄúTwentieth Century Impressions of Ceylon‚Äù because the information would have been furnished when he was a comparatively young man.

Colombo, June 1 (Daily Mirror) - Those who dislike seeing progress achieved by the underprivileged have labelled entrepreneurs like Elon Musk as "economic hitmen", Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said at a meeting held in Badulla.

"Elon Musk is the number one billionaire in the world. Tesla, SpaceX, eBay, Bitcoin and Starlink Satellite are all under his leadership. He has informed the President that he will start a Tesla branch in Sri Lanka.

"Elon Musk is a powerful entrepreneur who brought technology to the world and is someone from whom we can learn about life. Despite not having a university education, his actions have made a significant impact globally," he said.

Yesterday, I saw NPP Economic Council member Sunil Hadunnetti call Elon Musk an 'economic hitman.' This is not true. Elon Musk is a man who changed the world economy and propelled it forward.

Each school day started with a standard set of prayers. A 90-minute catechism class followed morning prayers. After that, students learned other subjects. At the beginning of each study period, students got up, acknowledged that they were in God‚Äôs presence, and prayed for his help. Each study period ended with a prayer of gratitude. A day at the College ended at 3.15pm with another standard prayer, which took about 10 minutes.

Those lunching in office travel to work from far so that they cannot go home for their meal and return within the stipulated hour.

During our schooldays, schools used to start at 8.00 am and go on till 3.00 pm with an hour long lunch interval. The day scholars who travelled from far brought their lunch from home. They used to eat either in the tuck shop or in a separate room allotted for the purpose. Those living close to the school went home for lunch and returned in time for classes.

### Shortage of 5,000 buses hampers private passenger transport services

Colombo, June 1 (Daily Mirror) - A shortage of 5,000 private buses is making it difficult to provide adequate passenger transport services, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) chairman Gemunu Wijerathne claimed.

He told the Daily Mirror that 70% of buses with valid route permits are running in the country, while the remaining buses are not operating properly.

He noted that buses with valid route permits cannot provide proper services because some are undergoing major repairs or are engaged in other services.

As a result, the existing private bus fleet has been reduced to 13,000, and even these buses sometimes do not operate properly, Wijerathne said.

"As a result, people have to pay Rs. 100 for three-wheeler fares to travel a minimum distance of one kilometre. The shortage of private buses has severely impacted the transport sector, with people suffering the most when relying on public transport," he said.

### Hope, wisdom and cynicism: Voices from rural Sri Lanka

*2024-06-01 16:22:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/hope-wisdom-and-cynicism-voices-from-rural-sri-lanka/) ¬∑ `en`

The lakes, paddy fields and forests of the ancient village of Dutuwewa are a world away from Colombo‚Äôs high-rises and colonial buildings. As elsewhere, decisions taken by ‚Äòold men‚Äô in the corridors of power impact life here, just as these rural voters will impact politics nationally

Times are tough and it‚Äôs hard to make ends meet. A refrain heard from just about anyone in my home country Pakistan where the rupee has dropped to around 300 to the dollar. This is now comparable to the rupee in Sri Lanka, recovering from the biggest economic crash in its history.

Stories of hardship echo from the island nation‚Äôs largest city Colombo to the farming heartlands around Anuradhapura district, a little over 200 km to the north-east. At the core of Anuradhapura lies the irrigation tank called Dutuwewa which sustains several villages.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs rural landscape is dotted with as many as 14,000 such large and small irrigation lakes, known as wewas, built by kings thousands of years ago.

### 2024 Lok Sabha election campaigns Modi

*2024-06-01 16:20:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185045) ¬∑ `ta`

In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, faced unexpected challenges and criticism. Despite initial predictions of an easy win, the BJP engaged in aggressive tactics against opponents, including disabling Congress party bank accounts and arresting two chief ministers. The Election Commission's handling of the elections, especially regarding electronic voting machines, drew controversy and accusations of bias. Modi's campaign focused heavily on his leadership, with less emphasis on Hindu-Muslim politics until late in the game, where he addressed concerns directly. The Congress party responded with a focus on caste and class issues, criticizing the BJP's alleged favoritism towards wealthy capitalists. The unpredictable nature of the campaign highlighted the complexities and potential flaws in India's electoral system, raising concerns about democracy and fairness.

üü©

The Indian Lok Sabha elections are over and the results are being released.This time the general election campaigns were held. They were completely different for what we thought.

Most people thought that winning this election was an easy task for the Bharatiya Janata Party and that Prime Minister Narendra Damodaradas would consider himself a small work ahead of his third coronation.. We thought that he would be proudly proudly proudly, ignoring the opposition parties and taking the achievements of his ten -year regime to the people.

But most of us do not have campaigns as expected. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) falsely lied to all expectations and carried out attacks against its enemies with self -esteem and behaved in a defensive style. Congress party bank accounts disabled. Two chief ministers in office were arrested and jailed. Non -Bharatiya Janata Party of India was afraid that they could be arrested in their homes.

### Earliest and most distant galaxy ever observed

(BBC) - The James Webb Space Telescope has smashed its own record for detecting the most distant known galaxy. Called JADES-GS-z14-0, the collection of stars was spied as it was a mere 290 million years after the Big Bang.

Put another way - if the Universe is 13.8 billion years old, it means we're observing the galaxy when the cosmos was only 2% of its current age.

Webb used its huge 6.5m-wide primary mirror and sensitive infrared instruments to make the discovery.

The telescope's previous record holder was a galaxy seen at 325 million years after the Big Bang.

Astronomers say the most interesting aspect of the latest observation is not so much the great distance involved - as amazing as that is - but rather the size and brightness of JADES-GS-z14-0.
