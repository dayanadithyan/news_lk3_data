Cocoa prices briefly surged to all-time highs on Tuesday, touching over $10,000 (€9,234.3) per ton, before settling back at $9,622 per ton on Wednesday morning, following disappointing harvests in key cocoa-producing countries such as Ghana and Ivory Coast. Cameroon, another cocoa-producing nation, has also been seeing much of the same conditions.

The crop also saw a 19.8% gain in the past week, as well as a 42.4% rise this month. In the past year, cocoa prices have jumped about 231%.

Cocoa is widely used in a number of chocolate products and confectioneries, with by-products such as cocoa nibs, cocoa butter, cocoa pod husks and pulp also being used for soft drinks, alcohol, vinegar, cosmetics, health supplements, fragrances and more.

However, due to chocolate being by far the most common cocoa product, the rising cocoa prices have led to more worries about higher chocolate prices, as well as a chocolate shortage.

Colombo, March 29 (Daily Mirror)- The Special Commodity Levy that was imposed to protect the local famers and producers will be scrapped from January, next year and a new tax system based on seasons will be introduced, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said today.

The top United Nations court on Thursday ordered Israel to take measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including opening more land crossings to allow food, water, fuel and other supplies into the war-ravaged enclave.

The International Court of Justice issued two new so-called provisional measures in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of acts of genocide in its military campaign launched after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Israel denies it is committing genocide and accused South Africa of trying to ‘undermine Israel’s inherent right and obligation to defend its citizens.’

Thursday’s order came after South Africa sought more provisional measures, including a cease-fire, citing starvation in Gaza. Israel, which had urged the court not to issue new orders, said it places no limits on aid entering Gaza and vowed to ‘promote new initiatives’ to bring in even more assistance.

### In the political arena, South Asian women face similar hurdles

ECONOMYNEXT – In South Asia, women face similar hurdles when breaking into the male-dominated political arena, a webinar on Empowering Voices: Exploring the Political Landscape for Women in South Asia heard.

Across the region, more often than not, women are nominated to fill a seat falling vacant by the death of a male family member, as the party leadership made up of men is confident of winning on the ‘sympathy vote,’ or simply to fill a quota, and not for their qualifications and capabilities.

In Sri Lanka, despite a hard-won battle for a 25 per cent quota for women at the Local Government level six years ago, the drive to have more women at decision making levels continues. It is yet to be seen if the new electoral system at the provincial level will yield the results women seek. Representation of women in the Sri Lankan Parliament is a dismal 5.3 per cent (only 12 of the 225 MPs are women), Dr Sudharshani Fernandopulle, MP pointed out.

### Bunker demand surges in Sri Lankan ports as India grapples with supply shortages

### Polar ice is melting and changing Earth’s rotation

*2024-03-29 10:48:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Polar-ice-is-melting-and-changing-Earths-rotation/108-279823) · `en`

CNN - One day in the next couple of years, everyone in the world will lose a second of their time. Exactly when that will happen is being influenced by humans, according to a new study, as melting polar ice alters the Earth’s rotation and changes time itself.

The hours and minutes that dictate our days are determined by Earth’s rotation. But that rotation is not constant; it can change ever so slightly, depending on what’s happening on Earth’s surface and in its molten core.

These nearly imperceptible changes occasionally mean the world’s clocks need to be adjusted by a “leap second,” which may sound tiny but can have a big impact on computing systems.

Plenty of seconds have been added over the years. But after a long trend of slowing, the Earth’s rotation is now speeding up because of changes in its core. For the first time ever, a second will need to be taken off.
