Each year in April, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) marks its first armed insurrection against the government in 1971, as ‘April Heroes’ Commemoration Day. The second JVP insurrection is memorialised by way of the ‘November Heroes’ commemoration marking the death of JVP founder and leader Rohana Wijeweera in 1989.

Wijeweera led two rebellions, one in 1971 and a second in 1989. Thousands of young Sinhalese men and women died in the two insurgencies led by the then-JVP leader. In those dark days, civilians were involuntarily disappeared by state forces, while the JVP too killed many civilians.

The ‘Mothers of the Disappeared’ was a coming together of female Sinhalese, who lost relatives during the JVP insurrections to government forces. They came together under a common umbrella to demand information as to what had happened to their sons, daughters, husbands and wives.

Despite President Wickremesinghe yet to officially announce his candidature the prospect of him contesting is increasing

Following the Election Commission’s announcement on May 9 that the Presidential election would be held between September 17 and October 16, President Ranil Wickremesinghe  informed the Cabinet on Wednesday that only the said election would be held this year putting an end to speculations that Parliament might be dissolved before the Presidential election.

However, the race for the top most post started months ago with the Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) or the National People’s Power (NPP) and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), the apparent two front-runners having commenced their campaigns in a huge way. They have been organising public meetings for various interest groups such as women, farmers and retired armed forces personnel with large crowds attending.

### Sajith-Anura Debate, that never happened

Sajith, with his haphazardly acquired knowledge, lacked the courage to face Anura directly.

Both leaders should be held responsible for sabotaging the debate. They repeated their 2022 strategy of evading responsibility by refusing to address the task of revitalizing the bankrupt economy. However, they deserve commendation for declining the offer, as they had the wisdom to recognize the enormity of the challenge, and acknowledging it as beyond their capabilities.

A single pivotal moment or a well-made point can indeed have a significant impact on the

The government wanted Sri Lankans to mourn over the demise of an Islamic ultra-conservative nicknamed ‘Butcher of Tehran’

The death of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman in the custody of Iran’s moral  police over charges of not properly covering up hair, unleashed  nationwide protests in Iran, followed by a brutal crackdown by a regime  devoid of semblance of legitimacy, until Iranian proxies, Hamas  momentarily shifted the global spotlight from Iran’s suppression of its  people by carrying out an industrial scale massacre in Israel on October  7 last year.

As the monsoonal rains are set to wreak havoc and a climate emergency is in the making, the government had other pressing priorities. It declared a day of national mourning over the death of Iranian President and Islamic hardliner Ebrahim Raisi, whose VIP chopper crashed during a trip from Azerbaijan.

May 24 (BBC) - The UN's top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), has issued a dramatic ruling, ordering Israel to "immediately halt its military offensive in Rafah".

It acted in support of a South African application last week which sought a number of measures against Israel, accusing it of stepping up what it says is a genocide.

Presiding judge Nawaf Salam said the situation in Gaza had deteriorated since the court last ordered Israel to take steps to improve it.

Israel has vehemently denied the allegation and signalled it would ignore any order to halt its operation.

Reading the court's ruling on Friday, Nawaf Salam said "Israel must immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate" which could bring about "the physical destruction" of the Palestinians - alluding to what constitutes genocide under international law.

Israel, he added, must also allow unimpeded access to Gaza to any UN body investigating allegations of genocide.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will revoke the privatization of plantation companies that do not pay government dictated wages, by cancelling land leases and find new investors under a ‘competitive system’, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has said.

Sri Lanka privatized the ownership of 22 plantations companies in the 1990s through long term leases after initially giving only management to private firms.

Management companies that made profits (mostly those with more rubber) were given the firms under a valuation and those that made losses (mostly ones with more tea) were sold on the stock market.

The privatized firms then made annual lease payments and paid taxes when profits were made.

In 2024 the government decreed a wage hike announced a mandated wage after President Ranil Wickremesinghe made the announcement in the presence of several politicians representing plantations workers.

(This story has originally been reported by Japanese media 'The Mainichi')

MITO -- Two Sri Lankan students in Japan were arrested over an illegal abortion, and an expert points out that international students' unstable resident status may be a factor behind the incident.

Ibaraki Prefectural Police on May 23 announced the arrests of Rubasing Liyanage Udeshika Ayomi Jayalath of Toride, Ibaraki Prefecture, for allegedly aborting her baby when she was about nine months pregnant, and her boyfriend Munasingha Sudesh Dilshan De Soysa of Utsunomiya in the neighboring prefecture of Tochigi, for allegedly aiding the abortion.

According to the police, Jayalath used a drug to abort her baby at De Soysa's home around April 29. The suspects, both 30, have admitted to the allegations. Jayalath had visited an obstetrician in Tochigi Prefecture in late March to ask for an abortion, but the doctor refused as she was beyond the period allowed for an abortion under Japan's Maternal Health Act.

### Scientists find Earth-like planet that could be home to alien life

*2024-05-24 15:35:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Scientists-find-Earth-like-planet-that-could-be-home-to-alien-life/108-283301) · `en`

May 24 - Scientists have found a new Earth-like planet that could support alien life – just 40 light-years away.

The planet is a remarkable discovery in the search for habitable worlds: it is slightly smaller than the Earth, and thought to be just a little hotter. Many planets outside our solar system, called exoplanets, tend to be much larger and hotter than our own world.

The newly discovered planet is called Gliese 12b and researchers say that even if we cannot find whether it is home to alien life then it will help in our search for other worlds that might be.

The planet planet orbits its host star every 12.8 days, and is comparable in size to Venus - so slightly smaller than Earth.

It has an estimated surface temperature of 42C, which is lower than most of the 5,000-odd exoplanets (planets outside of the solar system) confirmed so far.

ECONOMYNEXT – After working 11 years in Saudi Arabia as a driver, Sanath returned to Sri Lanka with dreams of starting a transport service company, buoyed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s 2019 presidential victory.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and an unprecedented economic crisis in 2022 shattered his dreams. Once an aspiring entrepreneur, he became a bank defaulter.

Facing hyperinflation, an unbearable cost of living, and his family’s daily struggles, Sanath sought greener pastures again—this time in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

“I had to pay 900,000 rupees ($3,000) to secure a driving job here,” Sanath (45), a father of two, told EconomyNext while having a cup of tea and a parotta for dinner near Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi.

Working for a reputed taxi company in the UAE, Sanath’s modest meal cost only 3 UAE dirhams (243 Sri Lankan rupees). Despite a monthly salary of around 3,000 dirhams, he limits his spending to save as much as possible.

### ආර්ථික පරිවර්තන පනත් කෙටුම්පතට එරෙහිව නඩු පැවරීමට යයි

UNP plans to sue Supreme Court over Economic Transformation Bill, which aims to improve economic governance and was recently presented to Parliament. The move comes after criticism from the national folk regarding the government's handling of the country's economy and suggestions from BOI to abolish itself. The party argues the government should clarify its intentions behind such a bill, as it hasn't received support from business councils, trade unions, or private sector entities.

The UNP has decided to prosecute the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court against the Economic Transformation Bill.

ආර්ථික පරිවර්තනය පිළිබඳ පනත් කෙටුම්පත සහ රටේ රාජ්‍ය මූල්‍ය කළමනාකරණය ප්‍රශස්ත මට්ටමක පවත්වාගෙන යාම වෙනුවෙන් “රාජ්‍ය මූල්‍ය කළමනාකරණ පනත් කෙටුම්පත” ද පසුගිය දා පාර්ලිමේන්තුවට ඉදිරිපත් කරනු ලැබීය.

However, the national folk pointed out that the present government has a serious bill of the country's economy and the BOI points out that the BOI has proposed to be abolished.

මෙවැනි පනතක් පිළිබඳ ඉල්ලීමක් වාණිජ මණ්ඩලය හෝ කර්මාන්තකරුවන්ගේ සංගම් හෝ පෞද්ගලික අංශයේ කිසිවෙකුගෙන් ලැබී නොමැති අවස්ථාවක එහි අභිලාශය කුමක්දැයි ආණ්ඩුව පැහැදිලි කළ යුතු බව එම පක්ෂය සඳහන් කරයි.
