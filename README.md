Firms remain cautious on potential uncertainty associated with upcoming election

Jayasuriya noted that the failure to appoint a new member to the vacancy is deeply affecting the performance of the Council in carrying out its duties.

### Marikkar dismisses significance of 92 MPs supporting Wickremesinghe

SJB MP S.M. Marikkar stresses President is elected through public vote and not through Parliament

Questions if Wickremesinghe being backed by 92 MPs will translate into broader voter support

Points out pointed same MPs who are now backing Wickremesinghe had previously voted no on NCM against Minister Keheliya Rambukwella

Claims many MPs backing Wickremesinghe are those with corruption charges levelled against them

Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar has downplayed the significance of 92 MPs extending their support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, asserting that the President is elected by the majority of the electorate rather than by Parliamentary votes.

Speaking to the media outside the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) yesterday, where he was accompanied by party members to place the cash deposit for the Presidential Election on behalf of party leader Sajith Premadasa, Marikkar argued that the backing of 92 MPs does not necessarily translate into broader voter support.

### CMC to rollout new parking system in Colombo soon

The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) yesterday announced that steps are being taken to introduce a new parking management system within the city limits to improve vehicle parking availability for drivers.

‚ÄúThe new system is expected to be rolled out within three months,‚Äù CMC Deputy Director Traffic and Road Design Eng. Manjula Kularathna said.

He also said that the CMC plans to employ one contractor for one designated zone, instead of the current system, where a contractor and an administrator are assigned to each road.

Kularathna also noted that under the current system, a parking ticket cannot be reused within the same zone for short-term parking whereas the new system is expected to enhance the convenience of the drivers by allowing them to park the vehicles in two or three places within an hour in the respective zone using the same parking ticket.

He said the new system will see features of advanced technologies to enhance vehicle parking services within the Colombo city limits.

### Easing Sri Lanka‚Äôs fiscal burden: Who needs a State pension?

Public sector workers‚Äô pensions are paid by tax revenue, with 12% of Government revenue allocated for pensions

An IPS analysis shows that public service pensions are not a progressive welfare program, with half of the publicly funded pensions benefitting the top 20% wealthier group

Implementing a contributory pension fund is crucial to creating a more sustainable and equitable retirement system

The recent economic crisis has highlighted the need to address weaknesses in Sri Lanka‚Äôs economic policies for long-term structural change. One significant issue is the financial burden of public sector pensions. The Public Services Pensions (PSP) is the largest pension scheme for permanent public sector employees in Sri Lanka. However, its non-contributory nature has become a critical burden on the country, wherein pension benefits are funded directly from Government revenue, supported by general taxation.

### Supreme Court interim ruling only a direction given to President

The recent Supreme Court interim ruling has two components. On the first, that is restraining Deshabandu from ‚Äúthe powers, functions and responsibilities‚Äù of the office of IGP, the interim order is broad and straightforward.

The second pertains to the appointment of a suitable officer to act in the office of IGP. The SC ruling states: ‚Äú...His Excellency the President may, should he wish to, consider making appointment, in terms of the law, of a suitable person to act in the post of IGP for the duration of the afore-stated interim order.‚Äù

Strictly speaking, this is only a direction given to the President, respecting the legal provisions under which he has the power to make acting appointment. In effect, it suggests to him that he may, if he wants to, consider making an acting appointment, in terms of the law.

It has been made clear that the President is in no mood to consider this direction of the Supreme Court, to go by the special statement made by the PM in Parliament today.

‚Äú‚Ä¶In short, the global democratic trend this year is a resounding rejection of the status quo.‚Äù

‚Äì ‚ÄòA Global Movement Against The Status Quo‚Äô By Ian Bremmer, TIME, 5 Aug. 2024¬†‚Äì

Given the global trend as summed-up by Ian Bremmer, one of the world‚Äôs best-known think-tank gurus, a win for incumbent Wickremesinghe is virtually unthinkable.

Given the decision by Mahinda Rajapaksa‚Äôs SLPP to fend-off Wickremesinghe‚Äôs political piracy and field a candidate under the party banner, a Ranil win is logically impossible.

As PM in 2001-3, Ranil overstepped the mark and encroached on President Kumaratunga‚Äôs terrain. She tossed him out. As PM in 2015-2019, he did the same with President Sirisena, was turfed out, made a comeback thanks to the Supreme Court he now derides, and was evicted by the electorate.

Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam‚Äôs legacy is one of profound intellectual and humanitarian impact, rooted in a steadfast commitment to nonviolence, human rights, and inclusive dialogue

The Sri Lankan civil war ended with a brutal and decisive Government victory in May 2009, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 40,000 Tamil civilians during the final stages of the conflict. If the LTTE and the Sri Lankan political parties had formed a consensus and worked to implement the constitutional reform proposals which Dr. Tiruchelvam helped formulate, the war likely could have ended much sooner, potentially saving countless lives

The Sri Lankan leopard ‚Äì ‚Äòpanther pardus kotiya‚Äô ‚Äì Pic by Srilal Miththapala

Of all the charismatic animals seen in Sri Lanka, there is none that has created so much interest and popularity, than the Sri Lankan leopard. And today it has become arguably one of the most sought-after tourist attractions in the country. But is the leopard‚Äôs own popularity leading to its own destruction?

1 August is Sri Lanka Leopard Day, a day proposed by the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka in 2020 to celebrate our very own leopard sub species.

So this maybe an overtime moment to reflect on the problems that the Sri Lanka leopard is facing today.

The Sri Lankan leopard is a distinct subspecies ‚Äì ‚Äòpanthera pardus kotiya‚Äô (after Dr. Sriyanie Miththapala 1966). It is the only large carnivore found in Sri Lanka, and is therefore the apex predator in the wild, with no threats to it other than man.

### Hair Growth Mask Recipe

*2024-07-31 23:13:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/hair-growth-mask-recipe/) ¬∑ `en`

Although I still haven‚Äôt finished with my Cucumber beauty tips, I thought I‚Äôll tackle the hair growth problem this week and then go back to my Cucumber scene‚Ä¶probably next week.

You will need 01 medium-size onion (helps in stimulating hair follicles), a handful of curry leaves (promotes hair growth and strengthens hair roots), 02 tablespoons of coconut oil (moisturizes the scalp and adds shine), and the contents from 02 vitamin E capsules (nourishes hair follicles and promotes growth).

Heat the coconut oil in a pan, over low heat, and then add the chopped onion and curry leaves to the heated coconut oil.

Saut√© them together until the onions turn translucent and the curry leaves become crispy. This helps infuse their nutrients into the oil.

Strain the oil, using a fine sieve or cheesecloth, to separate the solid particles (onion and curry leaves) from the oil. You should be left with infused coconut oil.

Pierce the vitamin E capsules and squeeze out the oil into the strained mixture.
