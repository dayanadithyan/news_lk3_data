### Tamil Leader, Sritharan - the New Target of Racist and Majoritarian Communalists

*2024-02-27 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Tamil-Leader-Sritharan-the-New-Target-of-Racist-and-Majoritarian-Communalists/172-277760) · `en`

MP Sritharan has clearly stated his vision is NOT for the setting up of a separate state

Ever since Mr S. Sritharan was elected leader of the “Federal Party” or the “Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi” (ITAK), numerous articles with a racist bent have begun appearing in a number of ‘national news outlets’ in Colombo.

The articles have a common thread running through them - Sritharan’s visit to the LTTE war heroes’ cemetery in Killinochchi - and their (nationalist writers) interpretation of the symbolism of that visit.

One of these Prophets of Doom even went to the extent of giving a time-line when the next round of bombings would hit the country! In their myopic vision, Sritharan’s visit exposed him as an apologist of the LTTE and an unmitigated separatist. He is now being paraded via the media as an enemy. Most of these writers’ knowledge and interaction with the new ITAK leader is superficial.

### Sweden to join NATO in historic move as Hungary ratifies bid

Sweden’s NATO accession was approved by Hungary’s parliament Monday, clearing the last hurdle before the historic step by the Nordic country whose neutrality lasted through two world wars and the simmering conflict of the Cold War.

Hungary’s vote ended months of delays to complete Sweden’s security policy shift and followed a visit by Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Friday during which the two countries signed an arms deal.

Sweden’s NATO membership was supported by 188 lawmakers in Hungarian parliament, with 6 against and no abstentions.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government has faced pressure from NATO allies to fall in line and seal Sweden’s accession to the alliance.

“Finally it is done, Sweden is the 32nd member of the alliance, and this way NATO has become stronger,” Agnes Vadai, a lawmaker of the opposition party Democratic Coalition (DK) told parliament.

In the unessential we see the essential, in the essential we see the unessential, anyone who entertains such wrong thoughts will never realise the truth.

Royal College, Colombo is planning to have a pirith chanting ceremony on 1 March this year. The intention is to do it in style with an accompanying perahera and an open invitation to the entire school community involving students, parents, and teachers. The required funds are being collected from the school students. The event is promoted as a collaborative religious program. Perhaps recent discussions in public forums that the school needs to be secular has some bearing on this repackaged message.

This letter does not aim to discuss the pros and cons of this event. The focus is to come up with a pragmatic approach to address the scenario at the school, based on the Buddha’s universal teaching.

These imperative changes are pivotal for upholding democratic principles and ensuring the welfare of our nation

Of paramount significance is the imperative for the candidate to operate with a selfless commitment devoid of personal ambitions or an inclination towards an extended political career for personal gain. This ensures that the candidate focuses on the nation’s and its citizens’ well-being. After a successful election, the candidate should commit to the predetermined time-bound action plan. Post-implementation, a pivotal step involves willingly stepping down from office, thereby facilitating the instigation of necessary electoral and structural changes that will fortify the democratic state parliament and curtail opportunities for malpractice

### Wanindu - Worthy Wildcard?

Feb. 26 (Daily Mirror) - Wanindu Hasaranga has already become one of the most popular Sri Lankan captains in the recent past just a few games into his new tenure as the skipper of the Sri Lanka T20 team.

Sri Lanka may have lost their third T20 against Afghanistan last week, but the manner in which the team was able to play, has clear indication that under Hasaranga, Sri Lanka would not mind taking an aggressive approach against any team.

There was however, an incident which appears to become one of the talking points at the conclusion of the T20 game which Sri Lanka lost where one of the on-field umpires in Lyndon Hannibal failed to call a clear no-ball on the height. This triggered a very angry reaction from the newly-appointed captain who had a go at Hannibal as the teams were shaking hands. The leg spinner then went on to take a swipe at the umpire during his post-match press conference when he stated that the umpire needs to find a job in another field.

Intelligent Harvesting Technologies Ltd. (IHT) unveils its latest, urgently needed innovation – the Automated Rubber Harvesting Robot, which is set to address a serious concern in Sri Lanka’s declining rubber industry.

Since 1876, the Sri Lankan rubber industry has been deeply rooted in the cultivation of rubber trees and the meticulous processing of latex into various products such as tires and gloves and has been known for its worldwide quality recognition.

However, the industry faces dire challenges, especially the drastic declining availability of skilled tappers and the lack of protection from adverse weather conditions. This shortage has led to severe under-tapping and the abandonment of plots, plummeting the rubber output in the country. From 150,000 metric tons (MT) in 2012, Sri Lanka’s rubber output sharply dropped - to below 70,000 MT in 2023.

### Israel attack on Rafah would be ‘final nail in coffin’ of Gaza aid: UN chief

A full-scale Israeli military operation in Rafah would deliver a death blow to aid programs in Gaza, where humanitarian assistance remains “completely insufficient,” the UN chief warned Monday.

Speaking before the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Antonio Guterres said that Gaza’s southernmost city, where more than 1.4 million Palestinians are crowded together in tent cities, was “the core of the humanitarian aid operation” in the Palestinian territory.

“An all-out Israeli offensive on the city would not only be terrifying for more than a million Palestinian civilians sheltering there; it would put the final nail in the coffin of our aid programs,” he said.

His comments came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday reiterated that his country was intent on a ground invasion in Rafah, in its bid for “total victory” over Hamas, whose October 7 attack triggered the war.
