### “The farmers are a great profit for the country”

Farmers in Sri Lanka, led by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, have significantly reduced the country's reliance on imported rice, saving over $600 million in 2023 and 2024. They've achieved this by increasing rice production, with a record harvest of 12,000 kg per hectare. The government is promoting Giri Samba cultivation, giving farmers control over rice prices.

🟩

Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera says farmers and foreign workers have been dedicated to reduce the value of the increased dollar rate.

The Minister said that the value of the dollar against the rupee in recent years has increased rapidly and the value of the dollar has declined somewhat.

By 2022, Sri Lanka was imported about 800,000 metric tonnes of rice, for which the government had to spend $ 300 million.

But not a single rice was imported in 2023, and in the two years 2023 and 2024, farmers in the country saved over $ 600 million.

In addition, in 2023 and 2024, the people of this country will consume domestic rice, not the imported rice, but that respect and pride must join the Sri Lankan farmers.

Representatives of some political groups that claim to be farmers' representatives are trying to disrupt agriculture by acting like farmers, but farmers are not caught up in this trap.

### Disturbing Echoes Of The Last Phase Of The Civil War In Sri Lanka & The Treatment Of Palestinians Under Zionist Occupation – Part III

*2024-03-03 12:15:27* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/disturbing-echoes-of-the-last-phase-of-the-civil-war-in-sri-lanka-the-treatment-of-palestinians-under-zionist-occupation-part-iii/) · `en`

In the Manichean universe of the Zionists and the Lankan state their actions are beyond reproach, but the actions of the oppressed are unjust and immoral. They make no allowance for the historical reasons for resistance. Violence by the oppressed is not new. The First Nations of Australia resisted the colonisers from 1788 to just before the Second World War; there were indigenous rebellions in many parts of what is now South America and in the United States, including the Nat Turner revolt by enslaved African Americans; there was the Mau Mau rebellion in the British colony of Kenya. There were many others less well known. What they share is resistance to a better armed and resourced enemy. Armed resistance follows a period where the possibilities of negotiation are narrowed until they are non-existent and violence seems for some the only other choice.

The Israelis “have more or less accepted” the proposal, which includes the six-week cease-fire as well as the release by Hamas of hostages considered vulnerable, which includes the sick, the wounded, the elderly and women, said the official.
