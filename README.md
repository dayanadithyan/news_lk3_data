### Sri Lanka CB warns against using personal bank accounts for business

ECONOMYNEXT – The Central Bank said that it was considering legal action against registered limited liability companies that were using personal bank accounts to conduct business for the purpose of tax evasion.

The Central Bank issued a warning against the misuse of personal accounts for ‘illegal activities’, last week (15).

“The reason for that was that we received complaints from banks that clients who had registered a business were conducting transactions not through the account established for that purpose, but through their personal accounts. This could most probably be for tax evasion purposes,” Enoka Mohotty Director of the FIU said.

“We have written to the Finance Ministry, and are in discussions with the Inland Revenue Department and the Registrar of Companies on what possible legal action can be taken,” Mohotty said in reply to question by a journalist at the central bank’s Monetary Policy Review No. 01 of 2024, held on Tuesday (23).

ECONOMYNEXT – The Central Bank has sought explanations from some banks which have not cut rates as fast as required by an order issued last year, Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

“It may have been lower than what we anticipated when we issued these orders back in August; Some banks had already started the process of bringing down interest rates. Other banks that have not started the process we have asked them to bring it down by 350 basis points by December.”

“There are a lot of banks that have reduced, but not to the extent that we hoped. We are closely monitoring the banks and we want all the bank to follow the instructions we have issued.”

Weerasinghe conceded that when the order was issued “we also had expectations about where the other market rates would be; for example yield rates, we expected a further decline but that did not happen. So there’s an impact on other factors.” (Colombo/Jan23/2024)
