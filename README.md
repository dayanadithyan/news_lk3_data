### Tamils in the presidential election must prove democratic strength - Sabah Kukadas

🟩

Relo's leadership committee member Saba Kukadas said that after the war silence, the people's basic aspirations were not revealed for 15 years after the war.

It is not easy to make a conclusion in other elections.

In the past, the presidential elections have not been racially advantageous but they must unite in the aftermath of the war, but it is imperative that all political parties and civil organizations in the Tamil homeland must unite in the same site to implement this.

The decisions of Tamils must be tactically beyond criticism that chauvinism can turn communalism into racism.

Whatever the decisions of the Tamils in the past, the South has turned it into communalism, for example, the separatism is the reality of separatism.

It is therefore stated that the aspirations of the ethnicity will be made in the international arena and the political liberation of the Tamil people in the international arena and the global regional conversation of the global regional countries.

“There are 765 schools chosen to offer English medium at present,” Gunawardena told reporters on Tuesday. “We want to increase this to 1,000 schools.”

Sri Lanka has approved 4,441 English medium teachers already, and the state plans to increase the teachers to 6,500, Gunawardena said.

However, low salaries have proved to be a problem in the recruitment of teachers. These English-medium teachers will get the same salaries as other teachers in the state sector, the minister said.

“But there are instances where people leave better paying private sector for state jobs.” (Colombo/Apr10/2024)

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka has posted a services account surplus of 400 million US dollars in February 2024, higher than a trade deficit of 319 million US dollars, central bank data shows.

Sri Lanka’s exports in February 2024 was 1,059 million US dollars, up 7.9 percent from 982 million dollars a year ago while imports surged 35 percent to 1,378 million US dollars, giving trade deficit of 319 million dollars.

The dollars have to be earned in some way to spend on imports.
