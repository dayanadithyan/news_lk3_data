Both Sri Lanka and South Africa have stars who shone in the recently concluded IPL.

It‚Äôs not just Pathirana who brings express pace for Sri Lanka. Dishan Madushanka and Dushmantha Chameera can also bowl express pace. Nuwan Thushara, meanwhile, has had his highs and lows but his figures of 5/20 against Bangladesh in a T20I n March will act as an inspiration of sorts to do better.

June 3 (Bridgetown) - Namibia scored a nerve-shredding victory over Oman in their T20 World Cup Group B clash in Barbados on Sunday after a low-scoring thriller was decided by a super over.

David Wiese was the hero for Namibia, contributing 13 runs in the Africans' super over total of 21 before then restricting Oman to 10 runs with the ball in hand to seal a crucial win at Kensington Oval.

The match had gone to a decisive extra over after a tense duel saw both teams finish with 109 runs from their allotted 20 overs.

Oman had looked to be heading for defeat after a superb four-wicket bowling display from Ruben Trumpelmann saw them all out for 109 off 19.4 overs.

But Oman's bowlers responded with a disciplined performance to contain Namibia's bats, with Mehran Khan conjuring a superb spell to leave the match on a knife edge.

Khan finished with figures of three wickets for seven runs off three overs.

*2024-06-03 11:04:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185175) ¬∑ `ta`

Kandy, Sri Lanka's capital, faces significant traffic congestion, with studies showing over 50% of its population relying on public transport. A multimodal transport terminal project, aimed at easing this issue, began in 2015 with World Bank funding. However, delays due to political and economic crises have hindered progress, causing inconvenience for locals and tourists alike. Despite initial promises of completion by early 2022, as of May 2023, only 25% of the work has been done, with no clear end date. The project, expected to cost around $300 million, aims to improve public transportation coordination and reduce vehicle regulations in Kandy, but ongoing delays have led to widespread discontent among the affected population.

### Australia lifts minimum wage as families grapple with higher living costs

*2024-06-03 10:42:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99615/australia-lifts-minimum-wage-as-families-grapple-with-higher-living-costs) ¬∑ `en`

Australia‚Äôs independent wage-setting body on Monday raised the national minimum wage by 3.75%, largely in line with inflation, as families tackle soaring living costs.

The minimum rate will rise to A$24.10 ($16.05) per hour from July 1, resulting in an extra A$33 per week for about a fifth of the Australian workforce or about 2.6 million employees.

In its annual review, the Fair Work Commission said cost-of-living pressures have hit low-income employees the most, though inflation is considerably lower now than it was at this time last year, when it awarded an increase of 5.75%.

But the report said it was not ‚Äúappropriate at this time to increase award wages by any amount significantly above the inflation rate principally because labour productivity is no higher than it was four years ago.‚Äù

Australian consumer price inflation rose at an annual pace of 3.6% in April, the highest level in five months, adding to risks the next move in interest rates might be upward.
