### My markers in the fight for four decades

*2024-08-22 02:00:49* · [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c3ej1y059gno) · `si`

Given the comprehensive overview of Sri Lanka's presidential elections, it's clear that each election has been marked by unique challenges, including political instability, violence, and issues related to voter turnout, especially in regions affected by conflict. The 2023 presidential election faces its own set of challenges, including the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic instability, and ongoing social issues.



To address these challenges effectively, the new President must prioritize several key areas:



1. **Economic Recovery**: Focus on stabilizing the economy, addressing inflation, and ensuring financial stability for all citizens. This includes implementing policies that support small businesses, agriculture, and job creation.



2. **Reconciliation and Unity**: Given the historical context of ethnic and religious tensions, the new President should champion initiatives aimed at national reconciliation, healing wounds, and promoting unity among all communities. This could involve truth and reconciliation commissions, educational reforms, and policies that ensure equal rights and opportunities for all.



3. **Good Governance and Anti-Corruption Measures**: Strengthening institutions, improving transparency in government operations, and implementing robust anti-corruption measures are crucial. This includes reforming the judiciary, enhancing fiscal responsibility, and ensuring accountability across all levels of government.



4. **Addressing Social Inequalities**: Work towards reducing socio-economic disparities, ensuring access to quality education, healthcare, and basic services for all segments of the population. This involves investing in social welfare programs and infrastructure development in underprivileged areas.



5. **Promoting Democracy and Human Rights**: Uphold the principles of freedom of expression, assembly, and the rule of law. Engage in dialogue with opposition parties, civil society organizations, and international partners to strengthen democratic institutions and practices.



6. **Environmental Sustainability**: Address environmental concerns, including climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. Implement policies that promote sustainable development, protect biodiversity, and ensure the well-being of future generations.



7. **International Relations and Diplomacy**: Strengthen diplomatic relations with other countries and international organizations. Seek partnerships for trade, investment, and cooperation in areas like technology, health, and security.



8. **Security and Law Enforcement**: Ensure the safety and security of all citizens, particularly in regions previously affected by conflict. Work towards demilitarization and civilian control of the security apparatus, while maintaining the ability to respond effectively to threats.



By focusing on these areas, the new President can address the multifaceted challenges facing Sri Lanka and pave the way for a more prosperous, peaceful, and united nation.

🟩

Parliament convened on Wednesday (21) chaired by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena. He resigned after addressing a special statement.

In the first Test cricket match at Manchester and Old Trafford Stadium, Sri Lanka batted first, scoring 236 runs in their first innings.

### Divisions and polarisation in our society

*2024-08-21 23:12:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/divisions-and-polarisation-in-our-society/) · `en`

Humans are not united as a species. Divisions based on geography, ethnicity, coloir, religion, opinions and other attributes present everywhere dominate the social and political dynamics of the world.

Nobody knows why this happens: a naïve explanation is that birds of the same feather flock together. A person feels more comfortable when he or she associates with people who look similar and think alike. Intolerances of differences leads to social segregation.

Human communities also polarise. Polarisation is the widening separation of a society into two physically unseparated opposing camps based on some identity or belief. The colour, the language spoken and the religion, the political ideology are examples of the former and latter.

Polarisation differs from division. Unlike in division, the polarised parties oppose or confront each other. However, division can be triggered to ensue polarization.

The much anticipated Presidential election next month has created seismic activity in and out of the political arena. While the candidates are focused on winning, those in the periphery, the cohorts and the plutocrats are in a dilemma. The biggest joke is that for most of the sitting Members of Parliament and other politicians it does not matter whether Ranil wins or Sajith wins. Among their selfish and opportunistic agendas, the formidable challenge is to make sure that Anura does not come to power.

Under the NPP government after 21 September 2024, law and order will undoubtedly be relevant and applicable to all, from the president of Sri Lanka to the ordinary people or grassroots. In other words, if the law is violated, due punishment by the law will be ruled. The above will be a massive change in the right direction so people can sense and feel it is becoming part and parcel of life

The country’s people are currently grappling with severe economic problems or challenges, including the escalating cost of living and the repercussions of IMF programs aimed at economic recovery. However, the NPP is committed to addressing these issues, offering hope and optimism for a better future. Indeed, the escalating cost of living is the foremost burning issue for all low- and middle-income households. Given the above, the country witnessed an array of strikes by trade unions, and the Government addressed and resolved the workers’ concerns using tear gas and water cannons

### Election outcomes, best teams: Strategic advantages of political alliances

There were three surprises in Sri Lankan politics in the last week.

The unprecedentedly massive turnout for Sajith Premadasa in Kurunegala, August 16th which was evidence of a quantum leap after his formation of a broad Alliance on August 8th.

The entry into the Alliance campaigning for a Sajith presidency, of Champika Ranawaka, foremost ideologue and figure of the BJP-type Right, together with his compact but proficient group of followers (Karunatne Paranavithana being especially noteworthy).

The rock-star emergence of Namal Rajapaksa, starting outside the Election Commission on August 15th. The SLPP-SLFP ‘barons’ who defected en masse to Ranil, re-formed the UPFA, and entering through a virtual doorway paraded as on a catwalk at a ‘Sri Lanka Can’ signing on August 16th, should be afraid, very afraid. The renegades have no one who generates that type of enthusiasm among their voters. Namal’s vote fractures Ranil’s SLPP-SLFP political prop.
