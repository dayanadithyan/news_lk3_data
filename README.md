Colombo, Feb 18 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka has the worst record among South Asian countries in blacklisting corrupt contractors in public procurement, according to a new report by Verité Research.

The report shows that Sri Lanka is the only country in South Asia that 1) does not recognise engaging in corrupt and fraudulent activities during procurement as a valid reason for blacklisting 2) has not blacklisted contractors that have defaulted on contractual obligations despite having the provisions to do so.

The first issue can be attributed to gaps in the procurement guidelines of 2006, which govern almost all public procurement in Sri Lanka — except in a few instances such as pharmaceutical procurement.

The report emphasises the importance of urgently fixing these gaps to combat corruption and restore fiscal governance.

The United Nations Security Council is likely to vote on Tuesday on an Algerian push for the 15-member body to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, said diplomats, a move the United States signaled it would veto.

Algeria put forward an initial draft resolution more than two weeks ago. But U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield quickly said the text could jeopardize “sensitive negotiations” aimed at brokering a pause in the war.

Algeria requested on Saturday that the council vote on Tuesday, diplomats said. To be adopted, U.N. Security Council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, China or Russia.

“The United States does not support action on this draft resolution. Should it come up for a vote as drafted, it will not be adopted,” Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement on Saturday.

### Former Thai prime minister released on parole

Bangkok , Feb 18 (BBC) - Thailand's convicted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has arrived at his mansion in the capital Bangkok after being released on parole.

The billionaire was freed from a police hospital, where he had been serving a one-year jail sentence for corruption and abuse of power.

Thaksin, 74, was detained as soon as he returned to Thailand last August from 15 years in self-imposed exile.

He did not spent a single night in jail after complaining of health problems.

Thaksin's original eight-year prison term was commuted to one year by Thailand's king - just days after he returned from exile.

### Sri Lanka upfront import duties, para tariffs keep foreign investors out: ex-BOI chief

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s excessive protectionist taxes with import duties and para-tariffs on capital goods are a barrier to foreign direct investments in the island rather than income tax, a former head of the island’s investment promotion office said.

Sri Lanka has been trying to phase out tax holidays and concessions given for Board of Investment approved firms, especially under a Strategic Development Project Act where discretionary concessions are believed to be fostering corruption.

But the excessive import protection and para tariffs on capital are not found in other countries with open or export-oriented economies. East Asian nations in particular are subject to stringent free trade requirements under the ASEAN.

Sri Lanka is taxing building materials in particular at high rates, including, steel, tiles, aluminum and also cement to some degree to give ‘rents’ or excessively fat profits to politically powerful ‘domestic industry’ businessmen, critics say.

*2024-02-18 01:11:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83632) · `en`

Today (Feb 17) is the birthday of Sri Lanka’s popular business magnate Philip Upali Wijewardene. If Upali Wijewardene  were among the living now, he would have celebrated his 86th birthday this year.  Alas, this was not to be as the Lear Jet he was travelling in  disappeared on 13 February 1983  just 4 days before his 45th birthday .

It was my privilege to be associated with Upali Wijewardene slightly and briefly during the years 1978 to 1983. As a journalist on the Tamil Daily “Virakesari” I covered the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC) or “free trade Zone” from 1978 to 1981. Upali was the first Director -General of the GCEC.

Later in 1981 I began working as a staff reporter on the English daily “The Island” published by Upali newspapers Ltd of which he was the proprietor. I was at “The Island” in 1983 when Upali went missing 41 years ago .The Island of Tuesday, February 15 broke the sad news with a banner headline “Plane carrying Upali Wijewardene feared lost.”

“I am not someone who expected to get into politics, but throughout my university life, and afterwards, I supported various political parties and figures hoping for one thing, and that is the hope that they will, some day, make the country that we love, a better country. But, we were continuously, let down, so as a result, ultimately we decided that we ourselves would come and make that change. That is what we are here for,” he stated.

### An immensely changed world order

If I have said it once I have said it a dozen times: The global status quo is undergoing dramatic changes and the post-WW2 arrangements signified by the following markers are being transformed.

· The post-war economic boom and the welfare state are finished.

· China has become a powerful economy and will overtake America in about a decade

· The uncontested global hegemony of US Imperialism is winding down

· The hegemony of the US$ as the global reserve currency is fading

· The unipolar world of the last 50 or so years is changing into a multi-polar world

· The new economic alignment BRICS+ is assuming great importance

· The South China Sea has become a contested strategic sphere

· The Middle-East and Palestine/Israel have become a boiling cauldron

· Russia has become assertive and assumed a new strategic role

· The Global South is shedding the leadership of US Imperialism

I will discuss some of these points in my essay today and in my usual style keep it short.

### Dilmah and Sport: Making a tea and cricket connection and sponsoring Sri Lanka Cricket

*2024-02-17 22:11:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/dilmah-and-sport-making-a-tea-and-cricket-connection-and-sponsoring-sri-lanka-cricket/) · `en`

Our Sri Lankan cricket team stunned the cricketing world when they won the One Day Cricket World Cup in 1996, defeating the more fancied Australian team in the final.

Whilst at that time, along with the rest of the country, I rejoiced in exploits of our cricketers, especially explosive batsmen like Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, the thought of associating Dilmah with cricket, or any other sport, had not occurred to me. Clearly, cricket had become the number one sport in Sri Lanka and one in which we could compete on equal terms with the best that the rest of the world could offer. Our World Cup victory proved that. So perhaps it did make sense to link that sport with Ceylon Tea, which is the island’s premier export and that which identifies this country globally.

### Sri Lanka sets 161-run target for Afghanistan in first T20I

Dambulla, Feb 17 (Daily Mirror) - In the inaugural T20I match at Dambulla today, Sri Lanka posted a challenging total of 160 runs for Afghanistan to chase down.

Despite early setbacks, skipper Wanindu Hasaranga's resilient innings of 67 runs provided a much-needed boost to the Sri Lankan innings.

Opting to bowl first after winning the toss, Afghanistan's decision seemed justified as they struck early, dismissing opener Pathum Nissanka cheaply.

Sri Lanka were four wickets down for just 55 runs when Hasaranga walked in.

Hasaranga's aggressive approach, featuring three sixes and seven boundaries, propelled Sri Lanka's total to a competitive score.

For Afghanistan, Fazalhaq Farooqi was the pick of the bowlers, picking up three wickets for 25 runs. Naveen-ul-Haq and Azmatullah Omarzai also chipped in with two wickets each.

Thousands of demonstrators have gathered in Senegal’s capital, Dakar, demanding swift presidential elections.

It comes after the country’s top court blocked President Macky Sall’s attempt to postpone the election, originally scheduled for this month.

Mr Sall’s last minute decree, backed by parliament, had triggered a political crisis in Senegal, once regarded as a bastion of democracy in West Africa.

On Saturday, opposition supporters held signs demanding a “Free Senegal”.

It is the first rally allowed by authorities since Mr Sall’s announcement two weeks ago.

“Today’s watchword is mobilisation,” said presidential candidate Malick Gakou on the march.

He told the AFP news agency there was “no room for error any longer” and elections must be organised in March in order for the handover of power between President Sall and his successor on 2 April - when the president’s second term in office is set to expire.

### PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN THE KANDY AREA IN THE LAST CENTURY

*2024-02-17 20:47:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/public-transport-in-the-kandy-area-in-the-last-century/) · `en`

Prior to the nationalization of the bus transport system on January 1, 1958, the road passenger transport system was handled by private bus companies. They ran the bus services to some order and after nationalization the Ceylon Transport Board(CTB) was able to incorporate some of their systems useful to run the bus services in an efficient manner.

The town services in Kandy from Peradeniya to Katugastota, Pendiniya to Tennekumbura, Ampitiya, Nattaranpota, Halloluwa, Dodanwela and Dangolla were served by the Kandy Omnibus Company.

### Israel’s Gaza Campaign Is the Gravest Moral Crisis of Our Time

*2024-02-17 20:47:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/israels-gaza-campaign-is-the-gravest-moral-crisis-of-our-time/) · `en`

The crisis in Gaza shows those nations that should be defending international law and humanitarian values to be openly betraying their commitments.

I write this essay as a senior American Buddhist monk of Jewish ethnicity who has been deeply distressed by Israel’s military assault on the population of Gaza. I see this campaign as perhaps the gravest moral crisis of our time. The blistering bombardments, the ever-mounting death toll, the deadly blockade of vital essentials, the annihilation of innocent human lives—all these events sear the moral consciousness like a red-hot iron and demand a loud shout from the depths of the soul: “For God’s sake, stop it!” Indeed, in its own discreet tones, the International Court of Justice has issued such a shout, yet it seems to have fallen on deaf ears.

### ABOLISHING THE EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY -IS TIME RUNNING OUT?

*2024-02-17 20:20:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/abolishing-the-executive-presidency-is-time-running-out/) · `en`

Earlier this week, the President’s Media Division issued a statement to the effect that the next presidential election will be held on schedule. What was the need for that statement? In terms of the Constitution, the President’s term of office ends not later than 18th November 2024. As far as I am aware, no member of Parliament has given any indication that he or she intends to introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution to extend the term of office of the President, as required by article 83 of the Constitution. Such a Bill, if passed with a two-third majority, will also need to be approved by the people at a referendum. In the absence of any such move, what was the need for the President’s Media Division to assert the obvious. Was it to stifle the movement for restoring the parliamentary executive that now appears to be gathering wide public support?

### Recollections of Law, Order and Discipline in the good old days

*2024-02-17 18:39:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/recollections-of-law-order-and-discipline-in-the-good-old-days/) · `en`

In an advanced state of age one cannot often remember the name of a person whose face is very familiar or for that matter, sometimes, what was eaten at dinner the previous evening. A younger friend recently said that when asked for the registration number of his car, he had to take a look at it from his office window.

Strangely however, some events, significant or not in school and thereafter going back decades, come readily to mind. For instance Mr. P A Buultjens (a most outstanding cricketer in his day) claimed in his civics class in Form II in Trinity College that all man needs to live well were food, clothing and shelter. When then did education, health care, transport and other needs like security, human rights, entertainment come to be added to the list?

### Transformation, Reinvigoration and Reinvention: The Art and Life of George Keyt (1901 – 1993)

*2024-02-17 18:31:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/transformation-reinvigoration-and-reinvention-the-art-and-life-of-george-keyt-1901-1993/) · `en`

The material for this article has been drawn from the recently published work, George Keyt. The Absence of a Desired Image by SinhaRaja Tammita-Delgoda (Taprobane Collection, Sri Lanka 2023)

Modernism appealed to Keyt’s temperament, liberating him as a man and an artist. Confined and stifled by the morals and conventions of the day, he had already broken with its social codes. Modern art and its innovation opened up a new path for him. Enabling him to be free, to be different and to be himself, it gave him the tools to interpret the new world and the new life he had carved out for himself.

A revolutionary painter is one who wantonly breaks rules in order to liberate his expression from the bonds of academic art. Why must they do this? In order to create new forms…
