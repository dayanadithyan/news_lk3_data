### Sri Lanka financial account turns negative in 2023 amid heavy net repayments

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äì Sri Lanka‚Äôs external financial account turned negative in 2023, official data show as bilateral lenders stopped financing the government, multilaterals had to be paid, and banks repaid credit lines which counterparties refused to roll over.

The financial account was 1.3 billion dollars in deficit in 2023, subject to errors and omissions of 318 million dollars.

Sri Lanka defaulted on official credit in April 2022 after money printed to keep an artificially low policy rate depleted forex reserves, but the country had to repay multilateral lenders and banks and to repay counterparties.

Though rates were hiked in April 2022, the Reserve Bank of India gave credits to the central bank, leading to more money printing to offset interventions, delaying a correction in the external accounts.

The balance of payments turned positive only in the third quarter of 2022 and monetary stability was restored. A positive overall balance of payments also denotes outflows through the central bank.
