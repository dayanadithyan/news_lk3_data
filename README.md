The whole discourse of the Easter Sunday attack is degenerating into a sordid freakshow

Islamization and the Arabization of some quarters of the Muslim community, leading up to the Easter Sunday attack, created permissive conditions for the Easter Sunday attacks

Colombo, April 24 (Daily Mirror)- The closure of roads in Colombo without prior notice during evening rush hours as part of security arrangements for the visit of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi inconvenienced the public and motorists alike.

Incensed by the notice of road closures, they vented their anger by honking horns. The government made tight security arrangements in view of the visit of the Iranian leader for the inauguration of the Uma Oya project.

The roads were closed to facilitate the movement of his convoy without any prior notice as a security measure, but the motorists’ protest amounts to kind of an embarrassment for the government during the visit of a friendly country that has stood by Sri Lanka during its trying times. Iran and Sri Lanka have enjoyed excellent ties for decades and cooperated with each other in numerous international forums.

### The whole discourse of the Easter Sunday attack is degenerating into a sordid freakshow where the state, and not the Islamists who blew up the innocents, stand accused.

*2024-04-24 18:00:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83936) · `en`

Five years ago, on Easter Sunday, a group of local Islamists carried out coordinated suicide attacks targeting three churches and tourist hotels, killing over 270 worshipers and tourists and wounding 500 others.

The fifth anniversary of that heinous crime, which fell last Sunday (April 21), turned out to be a sordid display of politicking by the political parties, the catholic clergy and other usual culprits, who claim to campaign for justice for the victims.

The National People’s Power of the JVP issued a seven-point agenda that it said would be implemented if it comes to power to hold accountable those responsible for the tragedy and serve justice to the victims.

Sajith Premadasa, the Leader of Samagi Jana Balawegaya, also made a similar pledge in Parliament, promising to launch a fresh commission of inquiry, with the participation of local and international experts within two months of his election.
