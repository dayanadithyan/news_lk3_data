Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has suspended public duties to “stop and reflect” on whether to remain in the job, after a court opened a preliminary inquiry into his wife.

In a statement, the Spanish leader said he urgently needed to decide “whether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour”.

The court said it was responding to corruption claims against Begoña Gómez.

Mr Sánchez said his wife would defend her honour and work with the judiciary.

The complaint against Begoña Gómez was raised by anti-corruption campaigners Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), who have taken part in a number of high-profile court cases in recent years and are led by a man linked to the far right.

The Spanish prime minister said he would make a decision on his future before the media on Monday 29 April, after reflecting whether it was worth remaining in office “despite the mud” that the right and far right were trying to turn politics into.

If this bill is not amended at the committee stage, it will impose significant costs of compliance on small businesses who are already under stress from the crisis

The Gender Equality Bill has been gazetted. It requires every public institution and private institution to appoint a senior official to be responsible for gender mainstreaming and gender equality (“Gender Focal Point”). That person is legally required to prepare a plan of activities targeting their areas of responsibility and report directly to the Council on a quarterly basis with a copy to Women Parliamentarians Caucus in Parliament (section 17).

If this bill is not amended at the committee stage, it will impose significant costs of compliance on small businesses who are already under stress from the crisis. It will also impose costs on State entities and large corporations, but the focus here is on small business which are least capable of meeting unfunded mandates.

### Dissecting digital disruption: The imperative of digital literacy for today’s CEOs

A golden rule for leaders embarking on digital transformation is to educate themselves. This education is not merely academic; it is a necessary step in becoming conversant in the language of technology, a prerequisite for the formulation and execution of effective digital strategies – adapted from Rewired, McKinsey, 2021.

We have never seen change like we experience today. In today›s VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world, corporate leaders find themselves rowing not in the calm waters but in the turbulent rapids of white-water rafting. The calm predictability of the past has given way to a landscape where constant change is the only constant.

Amidst this turbulence, one of the most significant drivers of change has been technology, whose capabilities are expanding at a staggering rate. There are three factors that create these ‘disruptive’ trends, which need to be understood in the right magnitude and scale.

Sri Lanka is an island nation situated in a strategically important location in the Indian Ocean Region at the centre of maritime trade routes in between East and West, as well as in the middle of Africa, the Arab, and Eastern worlds and is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.

Sri Lanka’s location enables the country to provide quick and efficient global and regional connectivity to move cargo to and from Asia to the rest of the world. More than 60,000 ships ply this route annually, carrying two-thirds of the world’s oil and half of the global containerised traffic.

Sri Lanka, also located very close to all major ports in the Indian subcontinent, especially those of India, with the rising middle class, makes it a prime location that is able to provide fast and easy connectivity to the Indian subcontinent through its feeder network.

SJB presidential campaign manager Sujeewa Senasinghe and live-wire SM Marikkar accuse President Wickremesinghe of refusing the SJB its request of venue for May 1st and switching that preferred location to the JVP-NPP instead.

Meanwhile, six SJB MPs including shadow Finance Minister Dr Harsha de Silva accept decentralized funds from President Wickremesinghe allegedly without obtaining party permission. (https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/SJB-embroiled-in-controversy-after-its-MPs-secure-funds-from-Govt-without-party-approval/108-281121)

Is Ranil already a shareholder of the SJB, while simultaneously undermining it? Is he patronizing policy proxies in the SJB?

Little wonder then, as Prof Charitha Herath noted, that the SJB challenges the JVP-NPP to a debate on economics, but doesn’t challenge the incumbent and his administration with its austerity policies, to any such debate.

### Austerity, dispossession and injustice: Facets of the debt crisis in Sri Lanka

The widespread and ongoing debt crisis today is a wakeup call

Sri Lanka defaulted on its external debt for the first time in its postcolonial history in April 2022. The International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led process of recovery that followed has not only been disastrous in terms of the economic policy package proposed by the Government. The underlying analysis of the causes of the debt crisis itself is also flawed. Sri Lanka provides lessons about both the broken global financial system and the widespread consequences of an unjust debt resolution architecture affecting other countries in the Global South.

The Colombo District Court issued an interim injunction against Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from performing duties as the Acting Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) yesterday.

A similar injunction was also issued against the SLFP Acting General Secretary Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala.

The injunctions, in effect until 8 May, were granted considering a case filed by SLFP office bearers Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Duminda Dissanayake, and Mahinda Amaraweera.

Chandaka Jayasundara PC representing the plaintiffs told the courts that it is illegal and against the party’s constitution for the defendants to hold the positions.

Jayasundara noted that Rajapakshe’s membership status disqualifies him from holding any position within the SLFP, citing constitutional illegality in having a member of another party in such a role.

Additionally, Jayasundara highlighted that the Executive Committee convened on 21 April to appoint Rajapakshe was unlawful.

*2024-04-24 23:54:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98825/un-calls-for-investigation-into-mass-graves-uncovered-at-two-gaza-hospitals-raided-by-israel) · `en`

The United Nations called Tuesday for “a clear, transparent and credible investigation” of mass graves uncovered at two major hospitals in war-torn Gaza that were raided by Israeli troops.

Credible investigators must have access to the sites, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters, and added that more journalists need to be able to work safely in Gaza to report on the facts.

Earlier Tuesday, U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said he was “horrified” by the destruction of the Shifa medical center in Gaza City and Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis as well as the reported discovery of mass graves in and around the facilities after the Israelis left.

He called for independent and transparent investigations into the deaths, saying that “given the prevailing climate of impunity, this should include international investigators.”

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s female prisoners have so far not got an opportunity to work for private companies unlike their male counterparts, Prison Spokesman Gamini Dissanayake said.

“There are only 208 convicted female prisoners and so far, no company has offered to use their labor,” Dissanayake told EconomyNext.

“However, if there are companies that are willing to hire these females, they will gain employment.”

Female prisoners are given sewing and weaving as part of a training program, and they are given a small allowance.

However, groups of male prisoners have been given work by some private companies for which they are paid 1024 rupees a day.

The prisoners are given 640 which they put in a savings account at National Savings Bank.

Male prisoners get a daily wage of 1180 for work done and 1024 in they work out of prison.

A catering company and a company involved in assembling air conditioning parts are the latest private firms to offer work, he said.

### A family affair, indeed…

*2024-04-24 23:05:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/a-family-affair-indeed/) · `en`

Hi! I’m Shivona Alexander, 35 years of age. I’m a wife, mom to two beautiful daughters, model, and founder of Party Bee.

Believe me, I never thought I would be a model at this age, especially after having two kids. But…I met Brian Kerkoven, in the year 2021, through one of my friends. I took a three-month course at his modelling academy and was lucky enough to join his agency as a professional model. This is my third year as a model, representing BK Model Management, and I’m proud and happy to say that I’m now a part of the BK family.

I would say maintaining a perfect physique, although being a mom of two kids, as well as my age!

Phew! With temperatures soaring high, the dreaded heat can certainly create problems for our skin, too.

Quite a few readers have indicated to me that they are having a tough time with this heat, with plenty of heat pimples cropping up.

The following skincare routine can help keep your skin stay fresh and hydrated during this scorching hot period…

Lemon juice is a reliable remedy to reduce heat pimples on the face, naturally. Mix a teaspoon of lemon juice with honey and dab the mixture on the pimples with a cotton ball.
