In 2020, six people from Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India were arrested by the Ramanathapuram Police for attempting to smuggle around 5000 explosive materials similar to gelatin sticks, purportedly for blast fishing. According to a Times of India report, one of the groups was contacted by a fisherman from Sri Lanka. Police investigations revealed that the suspects were anticipating gold or other valuable items instead of money in exchange to the smuggled explosives. While many such explosives including detonators are being manufactured in Tamil Nadu and are being smuggled by boats to be distributed among Sri Lankan fishermen, incidents of dynamite fishing or blast fishing along the Sri Lankan coastal belt has increased by manifold over the recent past, posing a threat to unique maritime ecosystems.

### Those whom Gods wish to destroy, they first make mad - EDITORIAL

*2024-04-24 02:45:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Those-whom-Gods-wish-to-destroy-they-first-make-mad-EDITORIAL/172-281223) ¬∑ `en`

The saying ‚ÄúWhom the Gods would destroy, they first make mad‚Äù is¬† believed to have been made by the Greek Tragedian Euripides and has been used in English literature since the 17th century. Leon Tolstoy in his novel ‚ÄòWar and Peace‚Äô uses the phrase in reference to Napoleon.

Wikipedia quotes Sri Lankan Catholic Priest Father Simon Gregory Perera, SJ using the phrase about the belief of Portuguese colonialists that the loss of Sri Lanka to the Dutch was divine punishment.

Today, our country is gripped in election fever. We are witnessing the applicability of this phrase in many a political party and candidate. The dramatic twists and turns of our political establishment bear ample testimony to this. According to media reports the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has barred party members from commenting on whom that particular party may nominate as its presidential candidate!

### Exploring FDI and export potential of Sri Lanka under the new normal

This article captures the core insights from the recent webinar hosted by the Daily FT, Board of Investment, SLID, CIMA, ACCCA and the International Chamber of Commerce. The event fostered dialogue with the diplomatic community from crucial markets about the critical role of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in Sri Lanka‚Äôs growth trajectory.

As Sri Lanka works to recover from its recent economic crisis through robust macroeconomic and fiscal policies, its future growth prospects remain constrained. The country faces challenges such as underperforming exports, which are projected to increase by only 5.27% annually from 2024 to 2028, and structural economic weaknesses, including persistently low labour productivity that has grown at a mere 1.4% over the past decade. To foster sustainable economic growth, Sri Lanka must enter new markets through efficiency-enhancing free trade agreements (FTAs), simultaneously addressing domestic constraints to unlock its FDI and export potential.

The World Bank recently held a press briefing to discuss the future of Sri Lanka's economy. World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka Faris Hadad-Zervos stated: "Sri Lanka's economy is on the road to recovery, but sustained efforts to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on the poor and vulnerable are critical, alongside a continuation of the path of robust and credible structural reforms."

Currently, Sri Lanka's overall recovery path is becoming clearer, especially through policy-level measures and structural reforms, particularly concerning state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that have been incurring losses. The maintenance of loss-making SOEs poses a significant burden on the Government's Balance Sheet. In 2023, the cumulative net losses of SOEs amounted to 1,323 billion rupees, with some showing marginal profits. However, overall, these entities face challenges in overcoming historical cumulative losses.

The core problem, the Gaza war continues to shock and anger the world community, which is why world perspectives are shifting

Two hundred days after it began last 7 October, the terrible, system-shaking, Gaza war, is now a whole West Asian regional crisis. The very prolongation of the military onslaught on Gaza and the violence in the West Bank as well as its highly controversial and socially devastating nature has very quickly expanded it beyond Israel-Palestine‚Äôs borders. Given the current global systemic intimacy, it is actually a global crisis.

Today, we, in Sri Lanka, are directly affected by the West Asian war crisis that the Gaza war has become. Leave aside the simple danger of long-range missile mis-targeting in our neighbouring region of West Asia. Long range missiles possessed by some of the combatant states, carrying nuclear payloads, can, with a possible targeting failure, easily come in Sri Lanka‚Äôs direction.

However, Catholic leaders say no justice have been served for the innocent followers who were killed brutally when they were on prayers.

(BBC) - The US space agency says its Voyager-1 probe is once again sending usable information back to Earth after months of spouting gibberish.

A computer fault stopped it returning readable data in November but engineers have now fixed this.

For the moment, Voyager is sending back only health data about its onboard systems, but further work should get the scientific instruments back online.

Voyager-1 is more than 24 billion km (15 billion miles) away, so distant, its radio messages take fully 22.5 hours to reach us.

"Voyager-1 spacecraft is returning usable data about the health and status of its onboard engineering systems," Nasa said in a statement.

"The next step is to enable the spacecraft to begin returning science data again."

Voyager-1 was launched from Earth in 1977 on a tour of the outer planets, but then just kept going.
