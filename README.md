### CBSL eases borrowing limits for banks

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) announced today a relaxation of restrictions on borrowing by commercial banks, aiming to stimulate the domestic money market and accelerate a decline in interest rates.

In January 2023, the CBSL imposed limits on banks' access to its overnight lending and deposit facilities (Standing Lending Facility and Standing Deposit Facility) to encourage them to rely more on the interbank call money market. This move aimed to revitalize the money market and reduce banks' overdependence on the central bank.

The CBSL reports that the initial restrictions achieved their intended goals, reactivating the money market and moderating competition for deposits among banks. The measures also helped align market interest rates with the central bank's monetary policy stance while maintaining financial system stability.

### Shotguns to control wild boar, toque monkeys, giant squirrels

*2024-02-08 06:59:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Shotguns-to-control-wild-boar-toque-monkeys-giant-squirrels/108-276563) · `en`

Colombo, Feb 8 (Daily Mirror) - The Agriculture Ministry has decided to reduce the extent of five acres stipulated earlier, to two acres of farmland for their owners to qualify to own shotguns to protect their crops.

The Ministry said that most farmers have abandoned their crops since wild boar, toque monkeys and giant squirrels have destroyed their crops, and the damage caused has exceeded fifty percent.

Therefore, the government has to implement the proposal of the farmers, as there is currently no viable alternative to reduce damages caused by wildlife.

In 2023, wild animals have destroyed 300 million coconut plantations in the country, the Ministry claimed.

In 2022, 96 million coconuts were destroyed by toque monkeys and giant squirrels. It has been confirmed that these wild animals destroy about 40 percent of the total crops.

"If we can protect crops from wild animals, we can be self-sufficient in food without cultivating new crops," the Ministry said.

### UNICEF welcomes start of amendments to Children and Young Persons Ordinance

The UNICEF said yesterday it welcomes the long-awaited amendment to the Children and Young Persons Ordinance (CYPO) coming into force effective 1 January 2024, which marks a significant step towards protecting the rights and welfare of all children in Sri Lanka.

The CYPO, a legislation governing justice for children in Sri Lanka since 1939, previously only covered those up to the age of 16. The amendment now extends its protection to all children under the age of 18. Furthermore, the amendment also repeals the section of the CYPO which permitted the use of corporal punishment on children and adolescents by parents, teachers, or guardians.

These amendments contribute to the alignment of Sri Lanka’s laws that address children’s rights with international standards, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), but also addresses the evolving needs and challenges faced by children and adolescents in the country.

The Red leader is in the Green Room. Meera Srinivasan of The Hindu has it right when she called it “a significant outreach to the island nation’s most popular politician at the moment.” (Sri Lanka’s JVP-led alliance invited for talks in Delhi for the first time - The Hindu)

### New Delhi Focuses On Exploring Unknown NPP

*2024-02-08 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/New-Delhi-Focuses-On-Exploring-Unknown-NPP/172-276538) · `en`

Now the JVP has grown to form an alliance (the National People’s Power) with several other groups, and is even recognized as a force in the political scene by neighbouring India

Though India may not fear the JVP-led alliance it certainly is concerned about how this alliance would deal with countries which have an interest in Sri Lanka; especially like India, China and the United States of America. On the surface it could amount to be an invitation to test the psyche of a political party that has the potential to win an election but might not know what to do with extreme power that comes its way when it forms a government

There was a time when people in this island nation feared the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). That was a time known as the ‘insurgency’. We saw the worst of this insurgency in the late 1980s, and this was a time when there was an Indian Peace Keeping Force in this island; sent here to help the Sri Lankan security forces in the fight against terrorism.

“It is essential for the country to assume one policy when it comes to economic recovery and development”-

At the end of the day the necessity is for a dynamic, result oriented leader for the country

The country is confronted with too much of hearsay and prophesies which have led to the downfall of the government

There are no people with courageous and conviction in the nation.

UNP has seen an erosion in its confidence and we have re-establish that in the best possible way

President Ranil Wickremesinghe is proposing a daring new system that is adventurous

Some 18 months ago you were without electricity, gas and fuel. I think people should not forget about  all these

*2024-02-07 23:56:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175845) · `ta`

Former President Maithripala Sirisena said that we have plans to build the country with all parties.

He was speaking to the media after a speech of the President's Policy Declaration held in Parliament on Wednesday (7).

Since 2022, we have urged everyone to work together to solve the economic crisis. Former President Gotabhaya Rajapakse and the current President Ranil Wickremesinghe have taken action to form a Supreme Party government. The efforts have failed due to lack of cooperation.

The country's economic status has stabilized. But the social structure is the worst affected. Social structure cannot be achieved by crisis. We are sure that everyone should work together to build the country.

I invite everyone to unite with the Sri Lanka PA. We have plans to build the country.
