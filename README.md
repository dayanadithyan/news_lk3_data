Argentina has asked Interpol to arrest IranтАЩs interior minister over the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people, the foreign ministry said Tuesday.

The Iranian minister, Ahmad Vahidi, is part of a delegation from Tehran currently visiting Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and Interpol has issued a red alert seeking his arrest at the request of Argentina, the ministry said in a statement.

Argentina has also asked those two governments to arrest Vahidi, it added.

On April 12, a court in Argentina placed blame on Iran for the 1994 attack against the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires and for a bombing two years earlier against the Israeli embassy, which killed 29 people.

The 1994 assault has never been claimed or solved, but Argentina and Israel have long suspected the Iran-backed group Hezbollah carried it out at IranтАЩs request.

Prosecutors have charged top Iranian officials with ordering the attack, though Tehran has denied any involvement.

Meanwhile, a bond maturing on 15.12.2026 was quoted at 11.32/40 percent from 11.30/40 percent on Monday.

### Sri Lanka financial account turns negative in 2023 amid heavy net repayments

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs external financial account turned negative in 2023, official data show as bilateral lenders stopped financing the government, multilaterals had to be paid, and banks repaid credit lines which counterparties refused to roll over.

The financial account was 1.3 billion dollars in deficit in 2023, subject to errors and omissions of 318 million dollars.

Sri Lanka defaulted on official credit in April 2022 after money printed to keep an artificially low policy rate depleted forex reserves, but the country had to repay multilateral lenders and banks and to repay counterparties.

Though rates were hiked in April 2022, the Reserve Bank of India gave credits to the central bank, leading to more money printing to offset interventions, delaying a correction in the external accounts.

The balance of payments turned positive only in the third quarter of 2022 and monetary stability was restored. A positive overall balance of payments also denotes outflows through the central bank.

### Exploring FDI and export potential of Sri Lanka under the new normal

*2024-04-24 02:04:22* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Exploring-FDI-and-export-potential-of-Sri-Lanka-under-the-new-normal/4-760961) ┬╖ `en`

This article captures the core insights from the recent webinar hosted by the Daily FT, Board of Investment, SLID, CIMA, ACCCA and the International Chamber of Commerce. The event fostered dialogue with the diplomatic community from crucial markets about the critical role of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in Sri LankaтАЩs growth trajectory.

As Sri Lanka works to recover from its recent economic crisis through robust macroeconomic and fiscal policies, its future growth prospects remain constrained. The country faces challenges such as underperforming exports, which are projected to increase by only 5.27% annually from 2024 to 2028, and structural economic weaknesses, including persistently low labour productivity that has grown at a mere 1.4% over the past decade. To foster sustainable economic growth, Sri Lanka must enter new markets through efficiency-enhancing free trade agreements (FTAs), simultaneously addressing domestic constraints to unlock its FDI and export potential.

The World Bank recently held a press briefing to discuss the future of Sri Lanka's economy. World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka Faris Hadad-Zervos stated: "Sri Lanka's economy is on the road to recovery, but sustained efforts to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on the poor and vulnerable are critical, alongside a continuation of the path of robust and credible structural reforms."

Currently, Sri Lanka's overall recovery path is becoming clearer, especially through policy-level measures and structural reforms, particularly concerning state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that have been incurring losses. The maintenance of loss-making SOEs poses a significant burden on the Government's Balance Sheet. In 2023, the cumulative net losses of SOEs amounted to 1,323 billion rupees, with some showing marginal profits. However, overall, these entities face challenges in overcoming historical cumulative losses.
