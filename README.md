### Hamas leader in West Bank dies in Israeli custody, says Palestinian government body

*2024-07-26 12:02:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/100789/-hamas-leader-in-west-bank-dies-in-israeli-custody-says-palestinian-government-body) ┬╖ `en`

A Hamas leader in the West Bank died in Israeli custody after a deterioration in his health condition, a Palestinian governmental body said early on Friday.

Mustafa Muhammad Abu Ara, 63, died after being transferred to a hospital from the Ramon jail in southern Israel, the Palestinian Commission of Detainees Affairs said in a statement.

тАЬBefore his arrest, he was suffering from serious health problems and needed intensive medical follow-up. However, from the moment of his arrest, Sheikh Abu Ara, like all prisoners, has faced unprecedented crimes ... since the beginning of the war of extermination.тАЭ

Abu Ara, who was arrested in October last year, was subjected to torture and deprived of medical treatment, the Palestinian body said. There was no immediate comment from Israel.

At least 18 Palestinians have died in Israeli custody since the start of the Gaza war on Oct. 7, the Palestinian Prisoners Association said last month.

### The appointment of the Inspector General of Police is legally and constitutional: Speaker

*2024-07-26 11:54:00* ┬╖ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189418) ┬╖ `ta`

Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena defended the appointment of the Inspector General of Police as constitutional and correct, despite criticism. He denied allegations of wrongdoing, stating decisions were made in accordance with the constitution. The process involved the approval of both the Constituent Assembly and Parliament, marking an unprecedented move. He suggested that in cases of vacancy, there should be established procedures or judicial intervention, emphasizing that even the President cannot make such appointments unilaterally.

ЁЯЯй

The police chief affair is very complicated. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said that allegations are being made against me that this situation was due to the wrong decision taken by me.

The Speaker said this while commenting on the appointment of the Inspector General of Police in Parliament today (26).

We have not taken any wrong decision. We have taken a reasonable, right resolution of the constitution deeply. That resolution may seem incorrectly for you (awakening the opposition). But we made that decision in the right way.

I have taken this decision from the house and is completely false. 41 (d) - I used the word for me in Article 5. The appointment of the Inspector General of Police with the approval of the Constituent Assembly and the approval of the Parliament was unprecedented.

So there are steps to solve this post in case of vacuum. Or the court must provide a solution for this. He said that even the president could not decide on this.

### Arrested

*2024-07-26 11:50:49* ┬╖ [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/ропро╛ро┤рпНрокрпНрокро╛рогроорпН/ропро╛ро┤рпН-роХрпКро│рпНро│рпИроХрпНроХро╛ро░ро┐-роХрпИродрпБ/71-341068) ┬╖ `ta`

A suspect linked to the robbery of a Canadian Tamil family in Jaffna was arrested after a violent gang attack during their holiday stay. The investigation led to the arrest of three individuals, including a woman accused of orchestrating the crime. Further inquiries revealed the involvement of a temple leader in Canada, who allegedly funded the gang. The woman, with pending criminal cases, was detained for 48 hours for further investigation.

ЁЯЯй

A main suspect in connection with the robbery of a Canadian Tamil family in the Analathivu area in Jaffna has been arrested.

A Tamil family from Analadeev had come to Canada and lived in Canada last year to spend the holidays.

In the meantime, on February 23 last year, a violent gang entered the house where they were staying and robbed their foreign money, jewelery, goods and passports.

The Kayts police, who were conducting investigations into the incident, found that from Jaffna, they went to Analytivu on a special boat and found the robbery.

On the basis of intensive investigations, three persons were arrested on suspicion and investigated, and they said that a woman had paid for her and demanded that she hired her and demanded that she had been attacked.

Accordingly, the police have arrested the woman on Wednesday (24) for about a year and a half.

While investigating the woman, the head of the Iyyappan temple in Canada had confessed that he had paid a violent gang to pay for a gang.

### Sri Lanka election announcement triggers unexpected constitutional conundrum

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ The formal announcement of the presidential elections on Friday has triggered limitations on the executive that will complicate its uneasy relations with the judiciary and plunge the country into a constitutional conundrum, as an acting police chief was not immediately appointed following a court order.

Incumbent Inspector General, Deshabandu Tennakoon, was barred from exercising the powers of his position by the Supreme Court, which decided to hear nine petitions against his controversial appointment in February.

Election officials said the executive loses its power to make any appointments or even transfer public servants when an election has been called. This restriction could hinder the appointment of an acting police chief.

Although the court has said President Ranil Wickremesinghe can appoint a suitable officer as the Acting Inspector General, no immediate action was taken, and the operation of election law from Friday bars him from doing so.

### Principles and proposals for political and constitutional reform for democracy: Part I

An agenda for restoring democratic government calls for major changes in the Constitution as well as the system of government

2024 is a year of elections to choose a new President and possibly a new Parliament. In that context, the theme of political and constitutional reforms has once again begun to draw the attention of the citizens, civil society movements and political parties. It is necessary to recognise that any constitutional reform effort should have two main goals. They are (a) restoring the countryтАЩs parliamentary democracy and (b) replacing, not just reforming, the existing 1978 Constitution with a new and democratic constitution. A new constitution should also give effect to the democratising hopes of the people of Sri Lanka.

Therefore, an agenda for restoring democratic government calls for major changes in the Constitution as well as the system of government.

ThereтАЩs a political poster thatтАЩs been splashed on the walls of Colombo. Black letters on a yellow background mean that the author or the party cannot be identified. It is obviously a teaser campaign. It comes with a promise, which of course is the bread and butter of all politicians. Apparently, тАШthe lie will come to an end,тАЩ and on the 29th, the name of the messiah who will take all Sri Lankans to some yet-to-be-named promised land will be revealed.

This is the season for that kind of thing, so the timing is not bad at all. After all, people are talking about elections these days. They are wondering if elections will be held soon and, if so, whether it would be a presidential or parliamentary election. They talk about candidates, those who have announced their intentions and those who might very soon.

### Fitch says lower generation costs support CEBтАЩs tariff cut; no risk to IPP payments

*2024-07-26 03:03:44* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Fitch-says-lower-generation-costs-support-CEB-s-tariff-cut-no-risk-to-IPP-payments/14-764780) ┬╖ `en`

Fitch Ratings said yesterday Ceylon Electricity BoardтАЩs (CEB, BB+(lka)/Stable) cash flow will stay adequate to service debt despite a 22.5% tariff cut from 16 July 2024.

Fitch does not expect the latest cut to affect the Sri Lankan electricity distributorтАЩs payments to independent power producers (IPPs). Lower tariffs are supported by falling generation costs from CEBтАЩs higher mix of hydropower and lower coal prices YoY. Financing costs will also fall amid lower market interest rates, Fitch said.

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri LankaтАЩs instruction on the 22.5% average tariff cut, made during the regulatorтАЩs quarterly tariff review, was larger than the 10% proposed by CEB. However, generation costs have fallen in tandem with the rise in hydropower to 31% of the generation mix in 1H24 (1H23: 23%), while prices of coal, which fuels over 36% of the countryтАЩs generation mix, have dropped 32% YoY. Fitch expects thermal coal prices to fall 20% and 10% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.

The Rajapakse government has taken steps to burn the Janasas of Muslim citizens who died in the Corona infection without any scientific resolution.
