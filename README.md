For two decades, air pollution has increased annually in South Asia, but satellite data for 2022 -- the most recent year available -- showed a surprise 18 percent fall.

A diagram of the number of presidential candidates who contested the elections since 1982 in Sri Lanka would look like a tick mark. Six candidates contested the first election in 1982, and the number went down to three in 1988. Since then, the numbers have been in ascendency. In 2019, 35 candidates were in the field. This time around, a total of 39 candidates are in the fray. Most of them are proxies strategically fielded to divide the votes of one of the leading candidates. Some proxy candidates are in the contest to mobilize resources for their favorite leaders. Although hardly noticed, some of the candidates have contested several elections. For example, Battaramulle Seelaratne Thera, who contested the 2010 election, endorsing Mahinda Rajapaksa, withdrew at the eleventh hour. Sri Lanka Labor Party’s A. S. P. Liyanage and the United Socialist Party’s Siritunga Jayasuriya are among the usual suspects.

### Knowing When To Step Aside: Mark Of True Leadership

Presidential aspirant Wickremesinghe’s recent appeal to Sri Lankans to vote for the Gas Cylinder symbol, with the ominous warning that failure to do so will result in long queues for essentials, reflects a troubling mindset.

This statement, which seems to equate the temporary resolution of gas shortages with his qualification to lead the nation, is out of touch and a poor Marcom strategy. It suggests that Wickremesinghe and his advisors believe that merely avoiding crises is enough to secure the presidency, ignoring the deeper, more pressing needs of the country.

Wickremesinghe’s approach is similar to his previous attempts to appeal to the masses with shallow gestures, such as his infamous offer of chewing gum to farmers, a tone-deaf proposal that highlighted his disconnection from the realities of rural life.
