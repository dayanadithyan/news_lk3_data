*2024-06-14 00:43:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Beyond-CSR-Looking-inward-for-socialimpact/4-763050) · `en`

The true essence of CSR is its integration into the very fabric of a company’s operations

For years now, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been a buzzword among both development and private sectors. It is easily one of the most misinterpreted concepts – its essence diluted when communicated and implemented within the corporate world. Businesses often misunderstand and misapply the concept of CSR: rather than integrating CSR into core business practices, the trend is a stronger focus on charitable initiatives. While still commendable, businesses can start by looking inward and truly embracing CSR with a deeper, more authentic approach that embodies company policies, practices, and culture.

A few right-thinking sports ministers tried to change the constitution governing cricket in the country to address emerging issues, but they failed before the processes even commenced

Sovereignty can generally be defined as supreme authority. In any State, sovereignty is assigned to the person, body or institution that has the ultimate authority over other people to establish a law or change existing laws. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme legitimate authority over some States.

At the outset a nation’s sovereignty is vested on its citizens and they use it to elect their representatives to a national assembly to carry out the affairs of the nation for a given period of time. In a democratic setup voters use their sovereign power to elect their representatives to manage the affairs for the benefit of the nation and in return be accountable to the nation on its affairs.

The island nation has witnessed thousands of courts-seized vehicles end up in unusable conditions because of long duration to conclude court cases for crimes.

“There is no clear law on assets and properties that are seized in court cases,” Rajapakshe told reporters at a media briefing on Wednesday (12).

“We have come up with laws on that including the one, which is on the assets involved with court cases. We know that there are goods worth over billions of rupees corroding after being seized by courts. If somebody has used a vehicle or machine in a crime, the court is compelled to keep them with its custody until the legal case is over.”

He said keeping such assets for long duration has become a huge issue for courts because it needs lands.
