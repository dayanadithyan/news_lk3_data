### Sajith bars Daily Mirror over liquor controversy liquor

*2024-05-16 16:59:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Sajith-bars-Daily-Mirror-over-liquor-controversy-liquor/108-282735) ┬╖ `en`

May 16 Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader Sajith Premadasa has announced a ban on the Daily Mirror from covering any press briefings held by the SJB.

The decision comes in the wake of accusations made by Premadasa, who criticized the publication for what he deemed as a "mockery of journalism."

Accusing the Daily Mirror of deliberately misquoting a statement made by him on banning liqour licenses in the country, Premadasa expressed his frustration at the handling of his statements. However on many occasions Premadasa has taken out his frustration on the paper after the paper made critical coverage on him as an Opposition Leader.

One such example is when Premadasa said he would lead the Aragalaya to oust former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa from his seat on July 9, 2022, but instead of leading the protest he got himself admitted at a private hospital in Colombo leaving the public to wonder where the Opposition Leader was.

MPs seek to extend their insurance coverage to include family members, requesting an increase from one million rupees. This follows their authorization for concession vehicle licenses, discussed during a House Committee meeting. The move comes as they already cover their own insurance and that of the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, indicating willingness to pay more for family inclusion. The Speaker has urged the President to consider granting these permits, with the government potentially reviewing such concessions post-lift of the vehicle import ban.

ЁЯЯй

A reliable source yesterday said that the MPs had requested that their family members be extended to one million rupees insurance for the inclusion of their family members following the authorization for concession vehicle licenses.

At the House Committee meeting held last Friday, MPs have heard this while urging the permission of the vehicle permit for the second time.

They are currently paying the amount of insurance of MPs and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. They are said to have tried to add their family members to it and agreed to pay an increased amount.

More. The Daily Mirror has reported that Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena has written to President Ranil Wickremesinghe to consider the grant of permits demanded by MPs.

The government is considering such concessions once the ban on vehicle imports is lifted.

The 23-year-old was suspended by Nepal's cricket association after his conviction late last year but remained at liberty after his sentencing to await the outcome of his appeal.

"I am grateful to everyone for all the support during this time," Lamichhane said outside the court, where he was greeted by cheering fans.
