There should be a change of orientation in dealings with the IMF and Sri LankaтАЩs creditors. The aim must be to protect the living standards of the people and to promote the growth of the economy in ways that expand incomes, create good-quality jobs, and improve the trade balance. This means that the debt restructuring process has to be based on ensuring that the debt stock does not increase with interest payments; on a haircut on commercial debt that is far more than 30%; on multilateral and bilateral agencies also accepting a reduction of their contribution to the debt stock

We were invited to Sri Lanka between 9-11 June 2024, where we participated in consultations in Colombo with academics, researchers, activists and political parties.

Following is a letter to political party leaders of SLPP, SJB, JVP/NPP, SLFP, UNP, TNA and SLMC

With elections, possibly the Presidential election first, followed by a parliamentary election thereafter, we see mainstream political parties focussing on elections, with heavy criticism of previous Governments, they were also party to at different times in different alliances. It is an irony therefore, the whole focus of all Opposition parties is on тАЬcorruption and economic crisisтАЭ with no mention of their responsibility for any of them. They also have only vague deviations from the IMF Program pursued by President Wickremesinghe-led Government. Shared perception nevertheless in both the Government and the Opposition is the IMF remains the sole saviour this moment, while the crisis is not merely economic.

### New property taxes are coming: Key changes and impacts

*2024-06-24 23:28:29* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/New-property-taxes-are-coming-Key-changes-and-impacts/4-763401) ┬╖ `en`

The new property taxes are on the horizon, bringing significant changes to property taxation in Sri Lanka. HereтАЩs a brief overview of what you need to know about the new imputed rental income tax, its impact, and how it might affect your financial planning.

The primary change is the introduction of an imputed rental income tax. This tax targets the notional income homeowners could earn from renting their properties, ensuring a fair contribution to public finances. It will be implemented before 1 April 2025.

Currently, Sri Lanka does not have an imputed rental income tax. Under the new policy, owner-occupied and vacant residential properties will be taxed with an exemption threshold and graduated rates. Importantly, interest repayments on loans related to the property can reduce the taxable portion of rental income.

### Price or quality: Is NMRA barking up the wrong tree?

Instead of harping on price, however politically popular it may be, the authorities should concentrate on preserving the quality of medicines

I recently had to see my doctor (who is also a personal friend) regarding some infected skin wounds that I had developed on my forearms. Little did I know that this would lead to the horrific realisation of the problems that the public are facing when obtaining their medications.

I was prescribed a cream called Fusidic acid and the doctor, being a friend, wrote it by brand and told me that this is the original product which would be a little difficult to find. With that recommendation I went to almost a dozen pharmacies and was informed at each one that it was not available and was offered various substitutes, some of the same medicine and some of a similar nature. The reason given for unavailability was that the manufacturer had withdrawn from the country.

### Nimal prefers solo scene

*2024-06-24 23:08:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/nimal-prefers-solo-scene/) ┬╖ `en`

The guy who created a sensation with the song тАШRanpota ThelabuwaтАЩ has decided to do his thing as a solo artisteтАж

Nimal Jayamanne says he quit the band scene in December last year.

тАЬI told the boys to carry on while re-stepping into my solo career, due to personal reasons.тАЭ

The singer also worked on a new song, called тАШMage PanaтАЩ, with a video to go with it, as well.

It was, in fact, the song тАШRanpota ThelabuwaтАЩ that made Nimal a star, literally, overnight.

I remember him performing this particular song at an Island Music Awards show, years ago, and the crowd response was terrific.

Probably we may see a few more big hits come our way from Nimal, now that he has decided to go solo.
