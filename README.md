### ‘My memory is fine’ - President Biden hits back at special counsel

US President Joe Biden has angrily criticised an investigation that found he mishandled top secret files and said he struggled to recall key life events.

In a surprise news briefing on Thursday evening, Mr Biden insisted: “My memory is fine.”

He slammed a claim that he could not recollect when his son died, saying: “How the hell dare he raise that?”

The inquiry found Mr Biden “wilfully retained and disclosed” classified files, but decided not to charge him.

Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Hur determined Mr Biden had improperly kept classified documents related to military and foreign policy in Afghanistan after serving as vice-president.

The scathing 345-page report, released earlier in the day, said the president’s memory had “significant limitations”.

Mr Hur interviewed the 81-year-old president over five hours as part of the inquiry.

Northern Uttarakhand state lawmakers passed the legislation on Wednesday and its approval by the state governor and the Indian president is seen as a formality before it becomes law in the state. Muslim leaders and others oppose the Uniform Civil Code initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu Nationalist party saying it interferes with their own laws and customs on such issues.

India, the world’s most populous nation with more than 1.4 billion people, is comprised of around 80% Hindus and about 14% Muslims. Muslims accuse Modi’s right-wing nationalist party of pursuing a Hindu agenda that discriminates against them and directly imposes laws interfering with their faith.

Pakistan, Feb 09 (Independent) With results from Pakistan’s election trickling in slower than normal, candidates backed by former prime minister Imran Khan’s party appeared to be doing better than expected, as he was seen neck-and-neck with the favourite Nawaz Sharif.

Preliminary election results normally emerge within a few hours in Pakistan but were hit by long delays overnight, only adding to existing fears of poll rigging.

The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had announced results of just eight of the 265 contested seats in parliament on its website by morning.

Mr Sharif’s PML-N is leading in four seats while members of Mr Khan’s PTI party who ran as independents won three seats, and the Pakistan Peoples Party of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari got just one.

The election commission cited an unspecified “internet issue” for the long delay of more than 13 hours of counting the votes as the PTI party alleged that the “overwhelming mandate of the people of Pakistan is being stolen”.

### Sri Lanka’s copyright laws need to be updated for artificial intelligence: Lawyers

*2024-02-09 11:30:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-copyright-laws-need-to-be-updated-for-artificial-intelligence-lawyers-150509/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Intellectual Property Act needs revisions to recognize creations by artificial intelligence, legal professionals point out.

“Our Intellectual Property Act established in 2003 recognizes only a human as an author,” lawyer and academic in intellectual property, Sidath Gajanayaka said at a panel discussion on ‘Integrating AI into Human Lives: Legal Challenges in the Age of AI’ on Thursday (8).

Section 5 of the Intellectual Property Act describes an author as ‘the physical person who has created the work’ paving the way for questions regarding the use of artificial intelligence in creative works.

Artificial intelligence programs, such as ChatGPT, have been able to write articles and research pieces independently.

“We must look at how much of a human intervention is there to write an article,” Gajanayaka said. “Who is recognized as the author is a dilemma. Ideally, it is a person who gave the prompt.”

### Gemunu proposes plans to prevent abuses in buses

*2024-02-09 10:45:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Gemunu-proposes-plans-to-prevent-abuses-in-buses/108-276666) · `en`

Colombo, Feb 9 (Daily Mirror) - Before targeting individuals who commit acts of abuse against children and women on public transport, the police must take action to implement the prepaid card system or the transporting of passengers to the seating capacity of buses, the Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) said.

LPBOA chairman Gemunu Wijerathne told the Daily Mirror that people who want to abuse children, women and pickpockets never buy tickets but travel freely.

"Implementing the prepaid card system will help prevent these kinds of abuses. Meanwhile, transporting passengers to the seating capacity of buses will also help reduce these kinds of abuses," he said.

"We have enough private and Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses to transport people according to the seating capacities of buses.

"Otherwise, deploying officials or people to apprehend pickpockets and those who abuse women and children will not be a practical solution to the issue," Wijerathne said.
