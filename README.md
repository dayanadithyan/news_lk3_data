### It is reasonable to reduce the electricity tariff by 35 percent - Janaka Ratnayake

As the Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission in 2022, I see the success of my sacrifice that the recommendation of the public welfare proposal was implemented two years later.. However, if the government ensures the public distribution of the profits received by the Ceylon Electricity Board, it is healthy to reduce the electricity tariff by 35 percent, said Janaka Ratnayake, former chairman of the Public Use Commission.

He made this statement during a media briefing held at his private office in Colombo yesterday regarding the permission of the Sri Lanka Public Use Commission to permit the 21.9 per cent power reduction in effect from midnight yesterday (4).

Steps have been taken to reduce electricity tariffs by 21.9 per cent of the public welfare. Nevertheless, it is mandatory for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to distribute the profits made by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) in the past.. The clarity should be public.

Colombo, March 6 (Daily Mirror) - The National People‚Äôs Power (NPP) said it would not derail the IMF programme if it won the presidency but would renegotiate its terms and conditions on implementations since the current austerity measures had burdened people and the attempts of the government to sell off public assets would bring severe economic consequences to the country.

NPP economic council member Prof. Anil Jayantha said his party would also seek speedy actions on the debt restructuring process.

Also, he said that a homegrown solution to stabilise the economy is needed and NPP is ready to come out with such plans of unleashing the growth potential, increasing government revenue, rebuilding foreign reserves and directing the economy for a sustainable growth.

However, he said the present government could have gone for early negotiations with creditors in advance and explored other options available and adopted by other countries if it had a¬†genuine intention of recovering the economy.

As we celebrate International Women‚Äôs Day, it prompts us to wonder, what does it truly mean to be a woman? In a world marked by increasing competitiveness and relentless pace, women often find themselves questioning their place and value. Today, as we honour the spirit of womanhood, it is imperative to recognise the enduring legacy of women and address the scarcity of female role models to inspire the next generation.

Being a woman is a profound journey, marked by the diverse roles of daughter, wife, mother, educator, career woman and a caregiver to her family. From the moment a child is cradled protectively in her womb, she begins a journey of nurturing and guidance that extends far beyond birth. A mother‚Äôs love envelops her child, shaping their perceptions and experiences as they navigate the world.

It was refreshing to see our team win. The huge crowd at the third T-20 match, vouched for the regeneration of interest among the fans of the game in the country.

While we won all of the test matches, it was the absence of spectators which was prominent. Despite the fact entrance to the games were free, a sparse crowd attended the matches.

During an earlier era we were enthralled when we beat teams like India, Pakistan and Australia. In those days beating even England was no big deal.

But times have changed. At the Dambulla Cricket Stadium where the last T-20 match between Afghanistan and our national team took place, we witnessed a sad change for the worse in the spirit the game was played.

### Militarisation: Something old; something new

If dignity was what the retired general was after, higher pensions/benefits to lower rank retirees would have served better (especially the disabled/seriously injured)

Had Sri Lanka used a part of her massive defence budget to provide an honourable and viable way out for her soldiers post-war, the twin problems of high desertions and criminalisation of deserters could have been minimised. 10 years on, no political leader is interested in acknowledging the issue let alone addressing it

‚ÄúAre we so morally sick, so deaf and dumb and blind, that we do not understand this?‚Äù

In 2023, bankrupt Sri Lanka added $ 16.6 billion to its central government debt, an increase of 21%.

Sri Lanka ranks a high 43 in Global Militarisation Index and a low 83 in Social Progress Index. When it comes to militarisation, Sri Lanka outranks most developed countries. We also outrank our neighbours, including India (77); only Pakistan, at 44, is slightly ahead of us.

Wind farms located at close proximity to wetlands is not a new phenomenon. Thus, Mannar is not an exception.

As we celebrate International Women‚Äôs Day, it prompts us to wonder, what does it truly mean to be a woman? In a world marked by increasing competitiveness and relentless pace, women often find themselves questioning their place and value. Today, as we honour the spirit of womanhood, it is imperative to recognise the enduring legacy of women and address the scarcity of female role models to inspire the next generation.

Being a woman is a profound journey, marked by the diverse roles of daughter, wife, mother, educator, career woman and a caregiver to her family. From the moment a child is cradled protectively in her womb, she begins a journey of nurturing and guidance that extends far beyond birth. A mother‚Äôs love envelops her child, shaping their perceptions and experiences as they navigate the world.

He said this while addressing the second day debate on the Bind Receivables Bill, Trusting Receivables (Amendment) Bill, Amendment (Amendment) Bill, Financial Leasing (Amendment) Bill.

Other banks and financial institutions in the country are based on the actions of the central bank in the country. Bank loans are only one hundred per cent of the Central Bank. But if the rest of the country goes to the banks of the country, the interest is 20.5 per cent.. That is why when we were told to allow the central bank to act independently, we were told that it should be somewhat independent.
