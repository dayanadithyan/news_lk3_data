Parliament, Feb. 20 (Daily Mirror)- The government is planning to provide the Galle Face agitation site where the 'GotaGoGama' Aragalaya was conducted, to establish a casino centre, NPP MP Vijith Herath alleged today.

He told Parliament that the government is planning to provide a license through the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to an institution bearing a Chinese name to open a casino centre on the Aragalaya site and that a famous gambler in Negombo was behind this particular institution.

The MP said the 'Aragalaya site', which was a turning point in Sri Lanka's political history, is provided for a casino centre to take revenge from the Aragalaya people and that it was a serious mistake.

State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said no casino centre will be opened targeting locals and that Rs. 10 billion needs to be paid when opening a casino.

### US pushes for UN to support temporary Gaza ceasefire, oppose Rafah assault

*2024-02-20 14:29:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97409/us-pushes-for-un-to-support-temporary-gaza-ceasefire-oppose-rafah-assault) · `en`

The United States has proposed a rival draft United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a temporary ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and opposing a major ground offensive by its ally Israel in Rafah, according to the text seen by Reuters.

The move comes after the U.S. signalled it would veto on Tuesday an Algerian-drafted resolution — demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire — over concerns it could jeopardize talks between the U.S., Egypt, Israel and Qatar that seek to broker a pause in the war and the release of hostages held by Hamas.

Until now, Washington has been averse to the word ceasefire in any U.N. action on the Israel-Hamas war, but the U.S. text echoes language that President Joe Biden said he used last week in conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Indian farmers who have been protesting for a week to demand guaranteed crop prices have rejected a proposal from the government, and say they will continue their march to the capital New Delhi.

The protesting farmers began their march last week, but their efforts to reach the city have been blocked by authorities, who have used tear gas and heavily barricaded entry points into the capital to avoid a repeat of 2021 farmer protests when they camped on the outskirts for over a year.

Late Monday night, farm leaders said they refused the government’s offer of a five-year contract for guaranteed prices for a set of crops, including pulses, maize and cotton.

The government’s proposal made Sunday was “not in the interest of farmers,” Jagjit Singh Dallewal, one of the leaders spearheading the protest, told the Press Trust of India news agency.
