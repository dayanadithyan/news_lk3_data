### Gunmen attack Hindu pilgrim bus in India‚Äôs Kashmir, nine killed

Gunmen ambushed a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims in Indian-administered Kashmir, which then tumbled into a ravine killing at least nine people, police said Sunday.

The attack came around an hour before Hindu-nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn in for a third term on Sunday evening in the capital New Delhi.

‚ÄúInitial reports suggest that militants were waiting there in an ambush and they fired on the bus,‚Äù police officer Mohita Sharma told AFP.

‚ÄúThe driver lost control and fell into the deep gorge. Nine people died and 23 were injured.‚Äù

The crash happened near Reasi town, in the south of the disputed territory, as the bus was returning from a popular Hindu shrine in the area.

Opposition Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge condemned the ‚Äúgruesome terror attack‚Äù in a post on social media platform X.

Modi‚Äôs ‚Äúchest-thumping propaganda of bringing peace and normalcy... rings hollow‚Äù, he said.

### Tourism trade remains robust despite seasonal softening in May

The tourism trade is going through an expected softening due to the seasonality tied to the arrivals, but it has managed to eke out an income of US$ 154.0 million in May, data showed.

This was down from US$ 225.7 million in April but up from US$ 100.0 million a year ago when the trade was recovering from repeated crises.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs economy weakened due to waning inflows from tourism and other foreign currency inflows due to the 2019 Easter attacks, two years of pandemic induced restrictions over travel and in-person events, and then by the ‚ÄòAragalaya‚Äô in 2022.

It added to the challenges faced by tourism in its efforts to revive while the global travel industry started picking up from two years of pursuing stay at home orders due to the worldwide pandemic.

This caused many countries to put up travel advisories against their people who were thinking of taking flights to Sri Lanka, delaying what looked like a continuous recovery in the trade.

Lawyers‚Äô Collective, a civil society group comprising legal professionals, has voiced its opposition to the recent recommendation by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to extend the term of Attorney General Sanjaya Rajaratnam beyond the mandatory retirement age of 60. In a letter addressed to the members of the Constitutional Council, the Prime Minister, and other key figures, the letter outlined several serious concerns regarding the proposal.

The Collective recalled a similar situation in 2008 when an attempt to extend the term of an Attorney General resulted in a Fundamental Rights application before the Supreme Court. They noted that this legal challenge ultimately led to the Attorney General in question opting for retirement rather than accepting the extension. According to the Collective, the Constitution does not empower the Constitutional Council to approve extensions for officials who are subject to a mandatory retirement age, thereby rendering such a proposal legally questionable.

‚ÄúThis committee is tasked with addressing issues related to taxation, duties, and other Government levies, and proposing appropriate methods to the Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policy Ministry,‚Äù he added.

The State Minister emphasised that this oversight has been instrumental in supporting policy changes and improving revenue collection strategies.

### Poverty and homelessness stare elders in the face - EDITORIAL

Not many decades ago, our country was held up worldwide for its welfare state policies. Today, unfortunately, such praises are but a distant dream. Poverty rules the day-to-day life for a large number of our citizens.

Yet none of the political parties who are now canvassing for our vote, have come out with a single concrete proposal of how they intend to get this country out of its present dilemma.

In these columns, we have highlighted times out of number, the huge difference between the average wage and the cost a family of four needs to bear if they are to have two square meals a day. That cost amounted to over rupees one hundred thousand a month!

On the tea and rubber plantations -until the president recently forced owners to pay workers Rs. 1,700 per day workers were paid less than Rs. 1,000 per day. Daily paid or casual workers elsewhere in the country who form a majority of the country‚Äôs workforce receive less than Rs. 55,000 per month.

Ukrainians fire at Russian forces in Donetsk province, a target of Russia‚Äôs current, narrowed offensive

Social media is agog with fears over a looming Third World War. According to the centre-right Daily Telegraph of the UK, it has already started.

According to this view, military action in Ukraine and Gaza is only a small part of a global war in which propaganda, influence buying, trade wars and misinformation are weapons as deadly as any conventional or nuclear arsenal.

But, before we examine this theory in more detail, it‚Äôs noteworthy that Third World War scares are hardly new. They have been there almost since the day the Second World War ended.

One could very well describe the Cold War between the West (the US and its NATO allies) and the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc satellites as war by other means ‚Äì both sides vying to outdo each other with misinformation, propaganda and influence buying and trying to bully the other side into submission.
