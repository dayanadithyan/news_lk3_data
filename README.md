### Suspicion

*2024-06-20 09:13:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186514) · `ta`

Controversy surrounds the release of land in the Mannar District Vidal Island Natural Sanctuary, with debates over its use for a maritime park or for a private farm. Critics argue against granting permission due to environmental concerns and the impact on fishing activities. The release of 400 acres, initially planned to be 1000 acres, sparked fears among fishermen about the loss of valuable fishing grounds. The process lacks transparency, with the gazette notification in Sinhala lacking detailed information. The District Coordinating Committee decided against leasing the land to local or foreign companies. The Ministry of Fisheries defended the move, emphasizing the importance of the area for fish breeding. However, locals demand more protection for their livelihoods and the environment.

🟩

A special gazette notification was issued on May 6 last year that the Mannar District Vidal Island Natural Sanctuary will be completed in accordance with the authority given to the Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Pavithra Devi Wanniyarachchi.

In particular, there were various arguments over the release of the land during the Mannar District Development Committee meeting held last week.

In the name of development, he said that the maritime park, which was destroyed by the natural continental forests and preventing fishing activities, could not be granted permission.

Latest Global Economic Prospects report acknowledges global growth stabilising for first time in three years

The global economy is expected to stabilise for the first time in three years in 2024—but at a level that is weak by recent historical standards, according to the World Bank’s latest Global Economic Prospects report released on Thursday.

Global growth is projected to hold steady at 2.6% in 2024 before edging up to an average of 2.7% in 2025-26. That is well below the 3.1% average in the decade before COVID-19. The forecast implies that over the course of 2024-26 countries that collectively account for more than 80% of the world’s population and global GDP would still be growing more slowly than they did in the decade before COVID-19.

Taxation needs to be looked at from a different perspective and models of taxation need to be examined. Taxation should be looked at as part of a social contract between a government and the people who pay tax. It is part of a partnership between the government and the public and it must give a sense of ownership to the public that their money is being used judiciously for their benefit. Besides this, they must have a belief that their taxes are investments, not just expenses, and that they will have a return on their investment. Better hospitals, better schools and universities, better roads, better transport and more affordable energy costs are some returns they should be able to expect with their taxes.

“Blessed is the nation which in its moment of greatest challenge and peril can produce a moral and intellectual leadership that has the vision and the courage to overcome both. Human history has been gloriously enriched by the examples of nations, much younger and smaller, which have confronted far more awesome challenges only to produce that sort of inspiring leadership. Examples abound of peoples, with nothing of the splendour of the heritage that we so proudly possess—and so ceaselessly and clamorously proclaim—who have faced their own hours of maximum danger by summoning to their cause unsuspected reserves of self-confidence, intelligence and fortitude. But we seem determined to remain captives to the past and make ourselves hostage to an uncertain future.”

### Everyone should work together to pay a salary of 1700 rupees for plantation workers - Jeevan Thondaman

*2024-06-20 04:18:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186509) · `ta`

Jeevan Thondaman urges unity among political parties to ensure plantation workers receive a 1700 rupee salary, highlighting the need for action against companies withholding this wage. He criticizes the current salary, equivalent to just over seven dollars, as insufficient and calls for addressing injustices faced by workers, including improper arrests during union activities.

🟩

Minister Jeevan Thondaman said that all the ruling and opposition parties should take action to pay a salary of 1700 rupees for plantation workers.

The government has announced that the government has announced a salary of 1700 rupees, but the plantation companies have so far refused to provide it.. It is necessary to take steps to get it to the plantation workers, not the ruling party and the opposition.

I am not saying that the salary of 1700 rupees is sufficient for plantation workers in any way. Steps must be taken to get it, though. Currently a thousand rupees salary was fixed by 2020. That is about seven dollars. How unjust is that the salary is still paid today.

At the same time, as I am involved in the injustice inflicted on workers in a recent garden, some media have released the news.. That mistake must be addressed.

At the same time, the police do not have the authority to arrest workers to carry out union actions. In that way, the plantation management is being treated.

However, recent judicial decisions especially of the high court have revealed the baselessness of these charges, raising significant questions about the infringement of her fundamental rights. One can strongly argue that Nathasha Edirisooriya has a duty to pursue a fundamental rights case to address the grave injustice she endured and to prevent similar miscarriages of justice in the future.
