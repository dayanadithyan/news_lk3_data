If Maithri, Karuna, and Pillayan are arrested, the truth about the Easter bombing will emerge. Srinithambi Yogeswaran calls for their investigation. The Karuna Brigade's activities and the 2019 bombing's coverage suggest a hidden agenda. Pillaiyan, an adviser to Minister C. Chandrakanthan, is accused in the media but has since published a book on the bombing. This raises questions about the law's integrity and the need for serious investigation.

Colombo, April 2 (Daily Mirror) - India has no intention to reverse the agreement that ceded the Katchatheevu Island to Sri Lanka despite the political debate in India that is primarily meant for domestic consumption in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Daily Mirror learns.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday targeted the DMK over the Katchatheevu island issue, alleging the ruling party of Tamil Nadu did nothing to safeguard the state's interests. New details emerging on the issue of India handing over the Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka have unmasked the DMK's double standards totally, he said on X.

It is apparent that the current Indian ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is not in favour of the position taken by the then Indian National Congress government. However, the agreement has now been signed, and an informed source said the current debate in India has nothing to do with Sri Lanka.

Monthly milk powder consumption dropped from 7000 MT to 3000 MT over last few years

Sri Lanka‚Äôs monthly milk powder consumption, which almost halved following the economic crisis, due to the price escalation, is witnessing a slight increase, a senior industry¬†representative said.

The monthly milk powder consumption, which was about 7,000 MT pre-Covid, dropped to about 3,000 MT over the last three years, due to the price increases caused by the increase in the US dollar, an increase in global market milk prices and a hike in government taxes.

However, with the economic conditions slightly improving, over one million households have returned to the market, although the overall consumption remains lower than the pre-COVID levels, Maliban Group Chief Executive Officer Ravi Jayawardena said. He shared his views while addressing a panel discussion hosted by Capital Alliance Limited, which delved into the current trends in consumer spending and post-crisis outlook in Sri Lanka.

It is people who drive all other resources, thus becoming the central force. Gone are the days when success was solely measured by financial metrics or technological competence. While money, machinery, and markets undoubtedly play crucial roles, they are merely tools in the hands of people.

He stated that any alternative proposals must be realistic before repeating the urgency for improving revenue and meeting Intended Targets (ITs) and noting the ‚Äúcommitment in the (IMF) program to not grant any more tax concessions. Tax concessions are a missing component of tax revenues‚Äù.

The course of war  between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) and the Sri Lankan armed forces was drastically altered by the  2004 eastern  revolt headed by former tiger commander of the Batticaloa and Amparai districts Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan alias ‚ÄúCol‚ÄùKaruna.

Yes, you guessed it. It is election time in India and the BJP has never come to power in Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state in India.

S.

Q: Why does Sri Lanka get less FDI than most regional neighbours?

A: According to most credible surveys carried out, the main drivers of investment decisions are political and macroeconomic stability and the country‚Äôs regulatory and business environment. Excluding the civil conflict and the pandemic, policy inconsistency has impacted Sri Lanka‚Äôs investment climate significantly. Even prior to the recent economic crisis, Sri Lanka had a tendency of changing key policies. This has resulted in investors facing practical difficulties in running their businesses, especially with respect to the tax regime of the country.
