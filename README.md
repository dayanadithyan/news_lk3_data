### Court orders freezing of Keheliya RambukwellaтАЩs family assets

*2024-07-05 03:35:52* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Court-orders-freezing-of-Keheliya-Rambukwella-s-family-assets/56-763885) ┬╖ `en`

The Colombo High Court yesterday issued an order to freeze 16 fixed deposit accounts and three insurance policies belonging to the family members of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella.

The move comes following an application made by the Bribery Commission.

The total value of the frozen assets is estimated at Rs. 93.125 million.

The accounts and policies affected are under the names of RambukwellaтАЩs spouse, three daughters and son-in-law and will remain frozen for a period of seven days.

The former Health Minister is currently held in remand custody over allegations related to the purchase of substandard immunoglobulin injections. The Bribery Commission obtained this freezing order under Section 53(1) of the Anti-Corruption Act No. 09 of 2023, as part of an ongoing investigation conducted under Section 42 of the same Act. This section allows for scrutiny of the spouse, family members, or any other associated persons in corruption cases.

*2024-07-05 03:34:02* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/news/Attorney-General-opposes-bail-for-Hirunika-in-ongoing-appeal/56-763884) ┬╖ `en`

The Attorney General yesterday raised objections to granting bail to former Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra, who is seeking bail pending appeal.

During a session before Colombo High Court Judge Amal Ranaraja, the Attorney General requested additional time to submit written arguments against the bail application.

Consequently, the High Court has rescheduled the bail hearing for 11 July.

Premachandra, a former Colombo District MP, was sentenced to three years in prison for her role in the abduction of a youth using a Defender vehicle.

She has appealed to the Court of Appeal, challenging her conviction and the sentence handed down by the Colombo High Court.

Premachandra was convicted on 18 charges, including conspiracy, aiding in the abduction, threatening, assaulting and intimidating the victim, Amila Priyankara, in Dematagoda.

### Western Province land prices drop; RIUNIT signals market rebound

*2024-07-05 03:30:08* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/Western-Province-land-prices-drop-RIUNIT-signals-market-rebound/34-763882) ┬╖ `en`

The Research Intelligence Unit (RIUNIT), an international research and consulting firm (RIUNIT) has reported a notable dip in average land prices in the Western Province, marking the first decline in the 20 years it has tracked the market.

Typically, land scarcity in island cities like Colombo creates constant upward pressure on land values. Even during Sri LankaтАЩs civil conflict, land prices in Colombo continued to rise.

However, in the first quarter of 2024, land prices fell in many Western Province suburbs, alarming industry experts.

RIUNIT CEO Roshan Madawela said: тАЬThankfully the downward trend seen at the start of the year has now turned and what we are now observing is a return to the long-term average property price increases that Colombo and the Western Province has traditionally enjoyed.тАЭ

An emergency Parliament meeting cost nearly Rs 1 crore, primarily for presenting President Ranil Wickremesinghe's debt agreement report. Despite being cut short due to opposition leader Sajith Premadasa's comment, the expense underscores the high cost of brief parliamentary sessions.

ЁЯЯй

According to parliamentary sources, nearly Rs 1 crore has been spent to hold an emergency meeting in Parliament on Tuesday (02).

Parliament was convened to present a special report of President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the debt renovation agreements.

Parliament was postponed after opposition leader Sajith Premadasa commented after the president's speech. The session was held for only one and a half hours.

Although the session is short, a parliamentary spokesman said that the amount spent on a day of a parliamentary meeting would cost short meetings.

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa accuses the president and allies of attempting to delay the election, citing previous instances where negative national news influenced decisions against holding elections. He argues that despite constitutional requirements for the election to occur between September 17 and October 16, certain groups aim to obstruct the public's right to vote. Premadasa calls for the protection of voting rights and urges the Election Commission to ensure a fair and democratic election, emphasizing the readiness of the United People's Power and the United People's Alliance to combat any electoral conspiracies.

ЁЯЯй

Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has accused the president and his slaves of trying to postpone the election.

In the past, slaves, manipulations and colleagues who represent the president and the government have made the idea that it is inappropriate to hold the presidential election with negative news to the country.

The Opposition Leader said that this was not the right time to hold the presidential election on several occasions, the president and the groups close to him were trying to carry out a political agenda.

In this context, there have been many attempts to snatch the presidential election that is legally and constitutionally held today.. He said all of these were conspiracies that violate the constitution.

Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said that although the Constitution clearly stated that the presidential election should be held from September 17 to October 16, some groups are working to disrupt the right to the people of the country to elect a new president.

### Why parate is so hot these days

*2024-07-05 01:18:28* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Why-parate-is-so-hot-these-days/14-763851) ┬╖ `en`

The Parate is not that draconian as most of the people see it. Firstly it applies only for loans of which the capital is Rs. 5 million or above. In practice, no bank will exercise the Parate Right until a borrower fails to repay 7/8 instalments or more. The bank as much as possible negotiates with the borrower and carefully listens to the reasons of the borrowerтАЩs failure. Banks will in the first instance endeavour to understand whether the default is due to the own negligence of the borrower or due to something beyond his control. Even in the case of own negligence the bank will warn the borrower and try to correct him, leaving aside the Parate. When the default is beyond the control of the borrower, banks give them sound concessions based on case by case

Once the parate is abolished as proposed, the borrowers who are repaying satisfactorily will also, without thinking twice, refrain from repaying their loans

### Finance Ministry on Sri LankaтАЩs International Sovereign Bond Restructuring

The Joint Working Framework negotiated with the AHG provides a fair balance of risk sharing and sufficiently addresses the concerns of Sri Lanka and the requirements of bondholders. The MLB structure, following the adjustments made through the evolution of the proposed instrument, enables the appropriate sharing of upside between creditors and the debtor, whilst also ensuring that in this process, the debt sustainability of the debtor sovereign is not compromised. These terms require formal confirmation by the Secretariat of the Official Creditor Committee and the IMF staff in order to confirm conformity with comparability of treatment requirements and compliance with Sri LankaтАЩs IMF program debt sustainability targets

The negotiated Joint Working Framework enables a fair sharing of upside or downside between creditors and Sri Lanka in case of an economic over-performance or under-performance by Sri Lanka

SL people have been left totally out of the whole process of тАЬdebt restructuringтАЭ and in the dark on тАЬconditions and measuresтАЭ the Wickremesinghe Government has agreed to

One major reason there is no transparency in any of the transactions President Wickremesinghe entered into with the IMF and in debt restructuring, is untold geo-political tie-ups. I doubt the President would ever be transparent and accountable to the people with numerous geo-political obligations that would have to remain out of public eye. But people have a right to know the conditions they are tied to in тАЬdeferring bi-lateral loan instalment paymentsтАЭ

Sri Lanka signing agreements with bi-lateral lenders Japan, China and India to restructure external debts has received calculated praise from SJB leadership and from the IMF with expectations. Japan congratulated Sri Lanka for effectively тАЬmanaging debt obligationsтАЭ.

### Imputed Rental Income Tax: A poisoned chalice?

While the IMF staff report offered a foundational framework for the proposed IRIT, recent pronouncements from the Government hint at potential divergences from the outlined plan

While the IMF recommends a wider tax net with progressive rates, the current Income Tax system, with its narrow base and high rates, suggests that policymakers might prioritise other approaches. Additionally, the IMF criticises the тАЬNet Annual ValueтАЭ concept for its reliance on exemptions (such as exempting the primary residence) and the use of assessed values. This raises the question: тАЬIs there a contradiction between the vision of the IMF with regard to the Tax Base pertaining to IRIT and the intention of the GovernmentтАЭ?

As per the recently published IMF Staff Level Report, it is expected that the Imputed Rental Income Tax (IRIT) would be implemented before the beginning of the tax year, April 2025.
