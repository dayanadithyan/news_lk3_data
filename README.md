Systems thinking has been an academic school of thought used in engineering, policy-making and more recently adapted by businesses to ensure the products and services are considering the ‘systems’ that they operate within.

Further, it is a holistic approach to understanding and solving complex problems by considering the inter-relationships and the inter-dependencies within a system. When it comes to decision-making, a systems-thinking mindset can be highly beneficial.

Despite strong interest, the relationship between systems thinking and complex decision-making has received consideration. With the use of a skill set called systems thinking, one can hope to better understand the deep roots of these complex behaviours to better predictions and ultimately adjust their outcomes.

Investment Strategy – Jan 2024 report released by First Capital Research says reforms will stay the course amid guesses and opinions on upcoming elections.”After announcing the rate cut in Nov-23, we expect the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to take a pause and maintain rates in the near future, paving way for market rates to adjust downward. However, CBSL plans on implementing a single policy rate window, we believe CBSL may implement it in the 1Q2024 via a rate cut to the SLF (standing lending facility ) reducing it to 9.0% to be in line with the SDF (standing deposit facility),” First Capital Research (FCR) says.

“With the completion of external debt restructuring during 1H2024, we believe the overall yield curve is likely to drop below 13.5% and reach a range of 11.0%-13.5% in the short term and towards end of1H2024 to reach 10.0%-12.5%. AWPR may decline to 10.0%-12.0% by Jun-24 and rise again to 11.0%-13.0% by Dec-24.”

*2024-01-28 22:59:17* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Chips-are-everywhere-But-can-Sri-Lanka-ride-the-wave/4-757848) · `en`

It is in the interest of the country to take early action to ride this wave by being a collaborative partner of India which is moving fast to make itself a semiconductor country soon

Semiconductors are a promising industry and therefore the investors in the industry have high expectations about its growth. If they compete with each other, it will be a ‘lose-lose’ situation. Hence, the chip makers should learn from those who have been successful in creating economic profit. In this case, identifying the profitable segments of the industry and seeking to take leadership in those areas will be the secret to learn. The leading players so far have invested massive amounts in Research and Development or R&D enabling them to come up with improved products and enjoy leadership in the area
