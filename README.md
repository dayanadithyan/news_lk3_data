Chinese state energy giant Sinopec is pushing for greater access to Sri LankaтАЩs market, where rival India is also seeking to expand its presence, as it looks to build its first fully-controlled overseas refinery, reflecting a change in the firmтАЩs global strategy to compensate for slowing demand growth at home.

Sinopec, the worldтАЩs largest oil refiner, is expected to complete a feasibility study by June for a plant at the Chinese-run Hambantota port, after winning ColomboтАЩs approval last November, two senior industry sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

While the China-based sources say the investment, which Colombo pegged at $4.5 billion as the countryтАЩs largest-ever foreign investment, is commercially driven, neighbouring India is pushing a rival plan to build a fuel products pipeline to the island nation southeast of the subcontinent.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka is planning to lift withholding tax on interest income below 100,000 a month to help older citizens who depend on interest income as interest rates fall, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.

With deposit rates falling to around 9 percent from an earlier 16 percent, elderly persons who depend on interest get less income, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.

тАЬWe are now planning to put in place a mechanism to lift withholding tax from retirees who earn interest below 1,000 rupees a month,тАЭ he said in statement.

It is likely to cost up to 40 billion rupees to pay interest subsidies to banks to give senior citizens interest of 16 percent when market rates fall.

The government still owed banks interest subsidies on previous years senior citizen interest subsidies, Siyambalapitiya told opposition leader Sajith Premadasa in parliament Thursday.

Colombo, April 25 (Daily Mirror) - National Consumer Front Chairman Asela Sampath urged the canteen owners to provide a cup of milk tea for Rs. 80 from today while granting the concession of the reduced prices of imported milk powder to the consumers.

Addressing the media, he said the milk powder importers had decided to reduce the retail prices of their one kilogram and 400 grams of milk powder packets with effect from today due to the depreciation of the dollar in the world market.

"In the recent past, people used to avoid patronising hotels to have a cup of milk tea due to the increase in milk powder prices.

"Now the situation has changed, and again, people have the opportunity to have a cup of milk tea at a price of Rs. 80," Sampath said.

Despite the action, it is worrying that accidents are caused by foreign tourists traveling in stairs on the railway trains.

Although the train department officials have announced that they should not travel on the stairs on the stairs, it is difficult to prevent tourists from doing so.
