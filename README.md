“Fair is foul and foul is fair” ~ William Shakespeare, Macbeth

Why are there no Booker Prize-winning novels about mundane multicultural families that inter-married for generations, shared religion/s, language/s, histories, and co-existed for centuries, while living in relative harmony in Ceylon/ Sri Lanka?

Is the trope of ‘dark natives’ engaged in endless, chaotic violence an international literature prize-winning bestseller that masks white mischief, including sanitized, techno-scientific AI guided hybrid warfare in a post-Truth world awash in distracting Culture Wars?

Susan William’s brilliant and brave book “White Malice” is subtitled “The CIA and the Covert Recolonization of Africa’. Her analysis may well apply to Eurobond debt trapped Sri Lanka, Pakistan and other Afro-Asian post/colonies, where National Endowment for Democracy (NED), funded protests and regime change operations have unfolded recently. NED is known as the second Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

### Sheikh Hasina may not return to politics, says son

Sheikh Hasina, who stepped down from the post of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and fled the turmoil-hit nation today, may not return to politics, her son and former Chief Advisor has said. Disappointed by the strong public sentiment against her government despite her efforts to transform the country, she has decided to quit, Sajeeb Wajed Joy said at BBC’s World Service’s Newshour program.

“She has turned Bangladesh around. When she took over power it was considered a failing state. It was a poor country. Until today it was considered one of the rising tigers of Asia,” Mr Joy said.

Over the last month, more than 300 people died in Bangladesh amid violent protests, which though started over quota, shortly transformed into a call for the Prime Minister to step down.

Sheikh Hasina’s critics accused her not just of corruption and nepotism but also high-handedness and curtailing of civil liberties. These, many alleged, overshadowed the economic progress and development she had brought about.

### India & The Military: Two Factors That May Affect JVP’s Rise To Power

*2024-08-05 19:33:53* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/india-the-military-two-factors-that-may-affect-jvps-rise-to-power/) · `en`

The indomitable spirit shown by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna commonly known as JVP since its inception, even after the total eclipse of its initial political leadership is remarkable. Unlike many of the leftist political parties swayed and assimilated into the mainstream spectrum of party politics in Sri Lanka, JVP survived and flourished. After a half-century of its survival before two insurrections, JVP stands as a catalyst factor in the coming presidential election of Sri Lanka. Embittered by the cascade of failures attributed to the major political parties, essentially the nepotism of the Rajapaksa regime until the ousting of Gotabaya in 2022, the people seem to have developed a trust towards JVP’s charismatic leader Mr. Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
