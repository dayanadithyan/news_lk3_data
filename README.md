### All Blacks captain Cane to retire from international rugby

Sydney (AFP) - New Zealand captain Sam Cane will retire from Test rugby at the end of 2024, the side said Monday, calling time on a World Cup winning 12-year international career.

"Having played 95 Tests - 27 as captain - the 32-year-old has decided to focus on spending more time with family and sign a long-term contract with Suntory Goliath in Tokyo," New Zealand Rugby said in a statement.

The All Blacks haven't played since they were defeated in the Rugby World Cup final by South Africa last year and Cane was already on a sabbatical in Japan.

Cane said the prospect of a three-year deal with the high-spending Tokyo club was too good to pass up.

"I had to weigh up everything and, in the end, with a young family, it seemed like the best decision to help set up our future," he said.

"It was a very hard one because I love the teams that I represent here in New Zealand."

### Indonesia flood death toll rises to 41 with 17 missing

The number of people killed by flash floods and cold lava flow from a volcano in western Indonesia over the weekend has risen to 41 with 17 more missing, a local disaster agency official told AFP Monday.

Hours of heavy rain caused large volcanic rocks to roll down one of Indonesia‚Äôs most active volcanos into two districts on Sumatra island Saturday evening, while flooding inundated roads, homes and mosques.

‚ÄúData as of last night, we recorded 37 dead victims... But from this morning it has grown again, the figure reached 41 (dead),‚Äù Ilham Wahab, West Sumatra disaster mitigation agency official, told AFP.

Rescuers were searching for 17 still missing, three in Agam district and 14 in Tanah Datar, both the worst-hit areas of the flood and home to hundreds of thousands of people, he said.

Ilham could not confirm the number of locals evacuated because officials had encouraged ‚Äúpeople to evacuate to relatives‚Äô places, which are safer‚Äù than tent shelters in heavy rains.

The Parliamentary Committee has approved a proposal to issue vehicle permits at concessionary prices to MPs, despite economic challenges. This decision, aimed at meeting the demand for such permits, follows similar practices in public service sectors. Over 100 MPs from various parties have requested Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to allow them to import vehicles. The Speaker will likely forward this request to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who, as Finance Minister, can pass the resolution. This comes after MPs elected in the 2020 general election were affected by a ban on vehicle imports due to the economic crisis. The government is considering lifting this ban, which could benefit MPs once implemented.

üü©

The main evidence reveals that the Parliamentary Committee has approved the proposal to issue a vehicle permit at concessionary prices, despite the rise of living costs and bankruptcy.

The committee, which examines the needs of MPs, said that the decision was taken advantageous of the demand for such permits in accordance with similar facilities provided to the administrative standards in various sections of the public service.

More than 100 MPs have represented various parties and submitted a letter to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to grant permission to import their useless vehicles.

The Speaker is expected to write a letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has been authorized to pass the resolution as the Finance Minister after the approval of the Council Committee.

### The Sri Lankan government that threatens the Tamils who are engaging in the commemoration cannot be said to be trying to reconciliation- Pearl

The Sri Lankan government's threats against Tamils commemorating their history contradict claims of reconciliation efforts. The People's Organization for Equality and Relief in Sri Lanka criticizes the government for its role in the genocide 15 years ago, highlighting the arrest of those commemorating their lost loved ones. The incident involving police giving biscuits to locals on Vesak Day last year further exposes the government's hypocrisy.

A former IDF soldier, interviewed on another channel, admits that some of the IDF actions he witnessed in Gaza could amount to war crimes.

Most Israelis simply do not care about what happens to Arabs and Palestinians

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reflects this cynical insularity of the Israeli public

Protests against Israeli excesses in conducting its war against Hamas in Gaza are widening in scope daily. This is not a war against Hamas; it‚Äôs a total war against the Palestinians designed to drive them out of ‚ÄòGreater Israel.‚Äô

These protests are almost exclusively in the West. It isn‚Äôt that the rest of the world is deaf and blind to what‚Äôs going on. But this is a Western problem, because of the West‚Äôs troubled historical relationships with the Jews, culminating in a great deal of sympathy for Israel after its creation (essentially a Western creation because of British Middle Eastern politics after WWII).

### Some ministers seem determined to promote immorality through Diana Gamage‚Äôs programs

*2024-05-12 22:13:00* ¬∑ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Some-ministers-seem-determined-to-promote-immorality-through-Diana-Gamages-programs/108-282426) ¬∑ `en`

Colombo, May 12 (Daily Mirror) - It is clear that some Ministers seem determined to promote immorality and erode morality by perpetuating the illegal and immoral programmes initiated by former State Minister Diana Gamage, Venerable Omalpe Sobitha Thera said.

Addressing the media, the thera said that Diana Gamage does not seem to have done anything for the country.

"The only thing that was done was that she raised her voice about the promotion of ganja and the promotion of immorality," he said.

The conspiratorial act she tried to do by developing immorality in the country, destroying morals and showing the illusion of economic development has now stopped due to the court decision. But some Ministers want to continue those programmes, he added.

According to the court decision, the role of Diana Gama has been rejected. That character does not suit social leadership at all. Finally, since she is not a Sri Lankan, she has no right to engage in politics in this country, the thera said.

### Economic growth, national security, and what next for Sri Lanka

*2024-05-12 22:03:34* ¬∑ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Economic-growth-national-security-and-what-next-for-Sri-Lanka/4-761675) ¬∑ `en`

Economic growth and national security are complementary to each other

When States fail to observe the Rule of Law and maintain the Law and Order, markets will start disintegrating themselves leading to a collapse of the same. Collapsed markets will stunt economic growth and stunted growth, as we have explained earlier, will reduce national security. Consequently, the resources spent on national security is not a waste but an essential cost to ensure the smooth operation of all the needed economic activities. Hence, no nation should compromise the national security on the ground of saving resources. It will cause the nations to sacrifice all their gains on all the economic fronts
