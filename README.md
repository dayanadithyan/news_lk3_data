### Myanmar’s junta takes revenge on its people

*2024-04-24 03:08:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Myanmars-junta-takes-revenge-on-its-people/172-281224) · `en`

The army has 150,000 troops while the rebel strength is 20,000. It has  700 tanks, 2000 artillery pieces (big numbers for a poor country with no  external enemies)

What a turn of events in Myanmar–in  2021, the Generals seized power again from the legitimately elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, the second military coup staged since 1962. The Generals had total power for much of Myanmar’s post-independence period, then relinquished briefly only to seize it back a few months later. She was jailed for 33 years on trumped-up charges. Widespread protests were crushed by killing over 3000 people, imprisoning 20,000 and destroying 55,000 houses over the past two years. Thus, the junta hoped to silence her forever and crush the country’s hopes of ever returning to democracy.

### Those whom Gods wish to destroy, they first make mad - EDITORIAL

*2024-04-24 02:45:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Those-whom-Gods-wish-to-destroy-they-first-make-mad-EDITORIAL/172-281223) · `en`

The saying “Whom the Gods would destroy, they first make mad” is  believed to have been made by the Greek Tragedian Euripides and has been used in English literature since the 17th century. Leon Tolstoy in his novel ‘War and Peace’ uses the phrase in reference to Napoleon.

Wikipedia quotes Sri Lankan Catholic Priest Father Simon Gregory Perera, SJ using the phrase about the belief of Portuguese colonialists that the loss of Sri Lanka to the Dutch was divine punishment.

Today, our country is gripped in election fever. We are witnessing the applicability of this phrase in many a political party and candidate. The dramatic twists and turns of our political establishment bear ample testimony to this. According to media reports the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has barred party members from commenting on whom that particular party may nominate as its presidential candidate!

On 17 April, the Government published the proposed electricity sector reforms in the gazette, which is now named the Sri Lanka Electricity Bill. The crucial legislation is now set to be presented to Parliament during the next sitting. It then allows the public a two-week window from the date of its submission in Parliament to challenge its legality in the Supreme Court.

This article captures the core insights from the recent webinar hosted by the Daily FT, Board of Investment, SLID, CIMA, ACCCA and the International Chamber of Commerce. The event fostered dialogue with the diplomatic community from crucial markets about the critical role of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in Sri Lanka’s growth trajectory.

As Sri Lanka works to recover from its recent economic crisis through robust macroeconomic and fiscal policies, its future growth prospects remain constrained. The country faces challenges such as underperforming exports, which are projected to increase by only 5.27% annually from 2024 to 2028, and structural economic weaknesses, including persistently low labour productivity that has grown at a mere 1.4% over the past decade. To foster sustainable economic growth, Sri Lanka must enter new markets through efficiency-enhancing free trade agreements (FTAs), simultaneously addressing domestic constraints to unlock its FDI and export potential.

The World Bank recently held a press briefing to discuss the future of Sri Lanka's economy. World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka Faris Hadad-Zervos stated: "Sri Lanka's economy is on the road to recovery, but sustained efforts to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on the poor and vulnerable are critical, alongside a continuation of the path of robust and credible structural reforms."

Currently, Sri Lanka's overall recovery path is becoming clearer, especially through policy-level measures and structural reforms, particularly concerning state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that have been incurring losses. The maintenance of loss-making SOEs poses a significant burden on the Government's Balance Sheet. In 2023, the cumulative net losses of SOEs amounted to 1,323 billion rupees, with some showing marginal profits. However, overall, these entities face challenges in overcoming historical cumulative losses.

### Prolonged West Asian instability re-shapes global system

*2024-04-24 01:14:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Prolonged-West-Asian-instability-re-shapes-global-system/4-760936) · `en`

The core problem, the Gaza war continues to shock and anger the world community, which is why world perspectives are shifting

Two hundred days after it began last 7 October, the terrible, system-shaking, Gaza war, is now a whole West Asian regional crisis. The very prolongation of the military onslaught on Gaza and the violence in the West Bank as well as its highly controversial and socially devastating nature has very quickly expanded it beyond Israel-Palestine’s borders. Given the current global systemic intimacy, it is actually a global crisis.

Today, we, in Sri Lanka, are directly affected by the West Asian war crisis that the Gaza war has become. Leave aside the simple danger of long-range missile mis-targeting in our neighbouring region of West Asia. Long range missiles possessed by some of the combatant states, carrying nuclear payloads, can, with a possible targeting failure, easily come in Sri Lanka’s direction.

(KRAKOW, Poland): On the morning of 16 April, Dr. A.T. Ariyaratne’s family informed me that he was in critical condition. In the quiet of the evening, I was heartbroken to learn that “Ari Aiya” of Sarvodaya—as I affectionately called him for more than half a century—departed us peacefully.

Undeniably, Ari Aiya drew equal inspiration from the Gandhian philosophy of non-violence. When he received the Hubert H. Humphrey International Humanitarian Award from the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs in 1994, I hailed him as the “Gandhi of Sri Lanka.”

For the moment, Voyager is sending back only health data about its onboard systems, but further work should get the scientific instruments back online.

Voyager-1 is more than 24 billion km (15 billion miles) away, so distant, its radio messages take fully 22.5 hours to reach us.

"Voyager-1 spacecraft is returning usable data about the health and status of its onboard engineering systems," Nasa said in a statement.

"The next step is to enable the spacecraft to begin returning science data again."

Voyager-1 was launched from Earth in 1977 on a tour of the outer planets, but then just kept going.

India, April 23 - India’s main opposition party accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of using hate speech after he called Muslims “infiltrators” — some of his most incendiary rhetoric about the minority faith, days after the country began its weekslong general election.

The remarks at a campaign rally Sunday drew fierce criticism that Modi was peddling anti-Muslim tropes. The Congress party filed a complaint Monday with the Election Commission of India, alleging he broke rules that bar candidates from engaging in any activity that aggravates religious tensions.

ECONOMYNEXT – Iran President Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi will inaugurate an irrigation and hydropower project that was designed and built by Iranian engineering firm and was also initially financed before international sanctions hit the project.

Sri Lanka had awarded an engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) to Iran’s FARAB engineering group to design and construct the 514 million dollar multipurpose project in 2010.

The project was funded until 2013 with a million US dollar credit from the Export Development Bank of Iran but international sanctions prevented the country from continuing financing, a government statement said.

The project continued with funding from Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka had since repaid 19.3 million dollars of the credit and 35.2 million remains outstanding.

*2024-04-23 14:54:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/181767) · `ta`

Four youths in the North died from drug use, with heavy drugs implicated. Cases of heroin and cannabis were reported. Sri Lanka's strategic location in global drug trade, facilitated by maritime boundaries, contributes to the issue. Despite legal action, drug use remains prevalent, especially among the youth. The government's focus on the war context in the North and East may exacerbate drug issues.

Four youths died due to drug use in the first quarter of this year in the Northern Province. They are all between the ages of 20 to 30 years.

In particular, a youth from Chavakachcheri has died during a drug treaty for celebrating his release as a youth from Chavakachcheri was released from prison on bail.

Sri Lanka’s star batter Chamari Athapaththu edged Natalie Sciver-Brunt to become the top-ranked batter in the ICC Women’s ODI batting rankings.

Powering Sri Lanka to the highest successful run-chase in women’s ODIs has seen Chamari Athapaththu go to the top of the ICC Women’s ODI Batting Rankings in the latest update.

Athapaththu’s stellar knock in the third and final ODI helped Sri Lanka level the three-match series in South Africa.

Chasing a record target of 302 to win, Athapaththu led Sri Lanka’s fightback with a brilliant 195*, the third-highest score in women’s ODIs.

It’s also the second-highest score by anyone in a successful run chase in ODI cricket - men’s and women’s - right behind Glenn Maxwell’s 201* against Afghanistan in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023.

The knock saw Athapaththu achieve her highest-ever rating (773) in the women’s batting rankings. The Sri Lankan also jumped two spots in the all-rounder rankings to enter the top 10 at ninth position.
