The Government has reached agreements with the IMF, World Bank and other donors on economic reforms and it is essential to extend the terms of the President and Parliament to make this exercise a success,. Stabilizing the economy is more important than anything," Range Bandara told the media.

"We propose a referendum to extend the terms of the President and Parliament as it is the most democratic way to do it," he added.

Given the complexity and specificity of the situation, how may I assist you further? Are you looking for analysis, strategies, historical context, or something else related to this political scenario?

ЁЯЯй

The United National Party suffered a shameful defeat in the 2020 election. Election defeats for the UNP, which is described by some as the oldest big party, are not new.. In 1956, the party received 8 seats in a 101 seat parliament. In the 1970s, the parliament of 157 seats received 17 seats. The 2020 was exclusively different.. For the first time in its history, not a single member was elected to Parliament. The UNP received a national list in compassion for 249, 435 (2.15 %). The party had only one member in the 225 -member parliament.

UNP leader and former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been a Member of Parliament for 43 years since 1977. In the 2015 general election, the Colombo district candidates came to the peak of over five lakhs of votes in the list of candidates..
