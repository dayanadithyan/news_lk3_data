May 31 - In a country where Ministers often believe they can get away by taking the law into their own hands, Water Supply Minister Jeevan Thondaman was the latest to be ridiculed for his thuggish behavior when he threatened police officers and the management of a Nuwara Eliya tea estate.

In a social media video, likely to have been filmed by someone closely following the Minister, Jeevan was seen turning into an 'angry rowdy' while entering the tea estate by force and threatening the management.

He was also seen arguing with the police and later blocking the roads, in a manner not suitable for a Cabinet Minister.

However, after coming under criticism, Jeevan took to his X account defending his actions.

### Extreme Asian heat spurs LNG demand ahead of summer months

*2024-05-31 19:26:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99569/extreme-asian-heat-spurs-lng-demand-ahead-of-summer-months) · `en`

Extreme temperatures across Asia are driving up liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand in the region as importers seek cargoes ahead of summer, with imports in South Asia hitting records.

This could tighten available supply and further lift Asian spot prices that have already gained a third since April, with heatwaves across South and Southeast Asia boosting air-conditioner use and other cooling demand. Prices are now at a near six-month peak at $12 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) and are expected to remain elevated.

“Spot prices are now driven by Asian demand. Temperatures in South Asia are rising due to a heatwave, increasing power demand,” said Siamak Adibi, principal consultant at energy consultancy FGE.

While China may still see lower demand compared with its record breaking shipments in 2021, demand from India and the rest of Asia has compensated for any drop-off, Adibi said.

### Sri Lanka renewables, power lines without tender to be legalized in new law: IESL

ECONOMYNEXT – Procurement of renewable energy as well as transmission lines without competitive tenders will be legalized in a planned electricity reform law, the Institution of Engineers of Sri Lanka has warned.

“Despite declaring the objects of the proposed Act to be “allowing open competitive procurement of new generation capacity including renewable energy”, the body of this Act states the complete opposite,” the IESL said.

“The present practice of procuring renewable energy projects at higher prices through negotiated deals and at feed-in-tariffs that never decrease, has been further strengthened by incorporating it into the main electricity legislation in the country, when most countries have given up such practices long ago to make way for competition.

“The proposed Act does not have clauses that bring any relief to Sri Lanka’s electricity customer, burdened with prices almost double that of competitor countries in the region.
