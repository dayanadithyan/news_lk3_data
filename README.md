Parliament, April 26 (Daily Mirror)- A massive scam is being operated where money is transferred from current and savings accounts to other multiple accounts without any notice to the account holder, an Opposition MP revealed in Parliament.

MP Gamini Waleboda told Parliament that people have complained that money from their current and savings accounts have been transferred to multiple other accounts within a day without the account holder getting any notification of the transfers.

He said people who had done online transactions had fallen victims to this scam.

The MP said Rs. 1.1 million from an account of a Buddhist monk from Balangoda had been transferred in this manner and it was found that a group of people who had been trained under an institute engaged in providing online transaction training were behind the scam.

He urged the House to report the matter to the Central Bank and look into it soon, claiming that money had been transferred from some 1000 accounts so far.

(CNN) - The first transplant surgery to combine a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney has been completed at NYU Langone Health, the system said Wednesday.

The subject, 54-year-old Lisa Pisano of New Jersey, had heart failure and end-stage kidney disease that required routine dialysis, NYU Langone said in a news release. But she couldn’t have a standard heart or kidney transplant because of other chronic medical conditions that “significantly reduced the likelihood of a good outcome” and because of an overall lack of donor organs in the US.

“When that opportunity first came to me, I was like, ‘I gotta try it,’ ” Pisano said during a news conference Wednesday from her bed in the intensive care unit.

“I’ve tried everything else, and I’ve exhausted all other resources. So when this opportunity came, I said, ‘I’m gonna take advantage of it,’ ” she said, hoping to “spend time with my grandkids and play with them.”

### Not AirAsia bidding to acquire SriLankan: Capital A CEO clarifies

Capital A CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes clarified that it is AirAsia Consulting Sdn Bhd that is bidding to acquire SriLankan Airlines, and not AirAsia.

If successful, the soon to be re-branded AirAsia Consulting will raise its own capital for the acquisition, Fernandes told reporters in Malaysia this week at a media conference that was held to announce the extension of his tenure as chief for another five years.

“Just to clear that up for everyone, AirAsia is not buying SriLankan Airlines. AirAsia Consulting, which will set up its own fund, is looking at buying SriLankan Airlines. So, it’s not AirAsia,” he said.

“I know it’s confusing, and AirAsia Consulting will be changing (its name) to Capital A Consulting very soon. So, that’s for airlines who want to consult our 23 years of experience, but AirAsia Consulting is also looking for opportunities to invest in airlines outside of ASEAN. AirAsia is fully focused on ASEAN. That’s our goal,”

Sri Lanka must integrate with global production networks that require trade reforms, removal of tariffs and protections across sectors and joining free trade agreements.

I hope to convince the reader that despite some of the commentary, Sri Lanka is not on the road to recovery. Numerous predictably dysfunctional policies with questionable rationalisations were implemented in 2019 and 2020; there was no discernible deliberative process. The underlying fragility of governance that precipitated the collapse is still prevalent. Two years on, the Wickremesinghe Government is exhibiting the same tendencies: a concentration of power in the office of the presidency with the executive holding the critical ministries of finance and defence; this Wickremesinghe Government has not materially altered the conditions that led to our crisis.

What horrible times are we living in? “Never again” was the resolve that led to the formation of a rules-based world order in the aftermath of World War II, in which some 80 million people—3 percent of the then-world population—perished. But events that followed showed humans were incapable of living in peace. People continued to die in wars across the world.

But none of the myriad wars and conflicts could be as brutal as the war Israel’s hardline prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been waging against the hapless people of the Gaza Strip for the past 200-plus days. What is happening in Gaza is not a war; it is genocide, period.

Colombo, April 25 (Daily Mirror) - The Veterinary Faculty at Peradeniya University has introduced a novel small-sized loop designed for implantation into the uterus of female monkeys to effectively prevent pregnancy

A one-and-half-year-old female monkey that had given birth once was used for this test.

Senior Professor Ashoka Dangolla from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Peradeniya University reported that during the X-ray examination conducted after the surgery, it was observed that the implanted loop was successfully in place.

He was a true embodiment of Social Democracy, governing the entire social, political, cultural, and moral order. He was not a mere propagator of a Social Market Economy, when he took over leadership from a right wing, J.R. Jayewardene led UNP that tried to dislodge Deputy Leader Premadasa from his well-earned Presidential candidature in 1989. The same right-wing forces in the UNP, tried to impeach him together with Feudalist sympathisers, who lost all their social status due to Premadasaism

I was socialised in my childhood, by an ardent Samasamajist, LSSP, father, in Moratuwa. However, I became disillusioned in my youth, as I witnessed the ground level actions of the Samasamaja Party, working with Feudalists, who pretended to be Progressive.
