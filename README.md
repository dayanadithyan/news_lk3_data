### Sri Lanka micro-finance bill challenged by community organizations

*2024-01-24 14:20:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-micro-finance-bill-challenged-by-community-organizations-148535/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – A planned bill to regulate micro-finance organizations has been challenged in the Supreme Court by traditional community organizations which provide savings and credit, according to a statement.

The proposed bill  is “intrusive and violate the autonomy of community organisations such as Death Donations and Welfare Societies, Sarvodaya Shramadana Societies and Women’s Organisations engaged in community savings and credit providing activities for generations before modern micro-finance began,” they say.

The community based organizations have also complained that larger finance companies which also provide micro-finance and where concerns have been raised about “predatory lending”, appear to be excluded.

Regulating for the sake of regulating will harm these community-based initiatives and trample on low-income people’s autonomy and traditional rights to organise their credit services, petitioners have said.

බෙංගාල බොක්ක වෙරළ ආශ්‍රිතව පිහිටා ඇති එම ගම්මානයේ බොහෝදෙනා ධීවරයින් ලෙස සිය ජීවිකාව ගෙනයති.

ඔවුන් පවසන්නේ වරාය තවත් ව්‍යාප්ත කළහොත් සිය ගම්මාන විනාශ වී සිය ජීවන මාර්ග ද අවහිර විය හැකි බවයි.

නමුත් ධීවර ප්‍රජාව පවසන්නේ මෙම ව්‍යාපෘතිය මගින් මත්ස්‍ය සම්පත විනාශ විය හැකි බවයි.

### தமது சொந்த காணியில் இராணுவம் விவசாயம் செய்வதை வேலியால் பார்க்கும் வட பகுதி மக்கள்  - சாணக்கியன்

*2024-01-24 14:18:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174693) · `ta`

தங்களது சொந்த காணியில் இராணுவம் விவசாயம் செய்வதை வேலியால் பார்க்கும் வட பகுதி மக்களின் நிலை யாருக்கும் வரக்கூடாது என  பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினர் இராசமாணிக்கம் சாணக்கியன் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

இன்றைய பாராளுமன்ற அமர்வில் கேள்விபதிலின் போது  பாதுகாப்பு அமைச்சரிடம் தெரிவித்தபோதே அவர் இதனைக் குறிப்பிட்டுள்ளார்.

வடக்கு, கிழக்கில் இடம்பெற்ற யுத்தம் முடிந்து தற்போது 15 வருடங்கள் முடிவடையப் போகின்றது. 15 வருடங்களுக்குப் பின்னரும் குறிப்பாக இந்த வடக்கு கிழக்கு மாவட்டங்களில் மாத்திரம் இராணுவ முகாம்களை பாதுகாப்பு கருதி வைத்திருக்கின்றோம் எனக் கூறுவதை எங்களால் ஏற்றுக் கொள்ள முடியாது.

குருக்கள் மடம் பாடசாலைக்குரிய மைதானக் காணியானது இராணுவ கட்டுப்பாட்டினுள் இல்லை எனக் கூறினாலும் தற்போது வரை அவ் மைதான காணி இராணுவ கட்டுப்பாட்டிலேயே இருக்கிறது.

மொறக்கொட்டான் சேனையில் இராணுவ முகாம் அமைத்திருக்கும் பாடசாலைக்கு பதிலாக பிறிதொரு பாடசாலையினை அமைத்ததாக கூறியுள்ளீர்கள்.

புதிதாக அமைக்கப்பட்ட பாடசாலை ஒரு ஆற்றோர பிரதேசத்தில் காணப்படுகின்றது. இதனை அக் கிராம பெற்றோர்களோ, பிள்ளைகளோ விரும்பவில்லை.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rulers are trying to curb the freedom of speech of people after bankrupting the country, opposition chief whip Lakshman Kiriella told parliament in a debate over a controversial law to control online speech.

“We agree that regulation is needed, but this Bill should be postponed and get suggestions from the opposition about our doubts and fears (se-ka san-ka) on this,” Kiriella said.

The UN and several international companies have opposed this Bill, Kiriella said. “The international community will be against us if we bring this law.”

“Lajjayi (shame), instead of going home you are trying to bring this law.”

Ruling party legislator Ajith Rajapakse said there were people who mis-used social media.

The opposition has pledged to repeal the law if they come to power. (Colombo/Jan24/2024)

### Trump wins New Hampshire primary as rematch with Biden appears increasingly likely

*2024-01-24 11:12:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96686/trump-wins-new-hampshire-primary-as-rematch-with-biden-appears-increasingly-likely) · `en`

Former President Donald Trump easily won New Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday, seizing command of the race for the Republican nomination and making a November rematch against President Joe Biden feel all the more inevitable.

The result was a setback for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who finished second despite investing significant time and financial resources in a state famous for its independent streak. She’s the last major challenger after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his presidential bid over the weekend, allowing her to campaign as the sole alternative to Trump.

Trump’s allies ramped up pressure on Haley to leave the race before the polls had closed, but Haley vowed after the results were announced to continue her campaign. Speaking to supporters, she intensified her criticism of the former president, questioning his mental acuity and pitching herself as a unifying candidate who would usher in generational change.

### Sri Lanka central bank equity positive by end 2023, no need for govt capital yet: Governor

*2024-01-24 11:05:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-central-bank-equity-positive-by-end-2023-no-need-for-govt-capital-yet-governor-148503/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank had positive equity in its balance sheet by end December and the central bank does not need a government capital injection, after losses made in debt restructuring, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.

The International Monetary Fund has asked the central bank to be recapitalized if its capital is negative by 2025, he said.

“If you look at end December balance sheet, we still maintain positive equity,” Governor Weerasinghe said.

“So I think there is no need for us to seek recapitalization at this point.”

Due to converting Treasury bills to bonds, the lower yielding bonds led to a large capital loss at current yields immediately.

The central bank, while losing money on central bank dollar swaps and dollar borrowings, makes cashflow profits on its Treasuries portfolio coupons, though at a lower rate than before restructuring. Foreign assets also bring profits.

### Prevailing prices of commodities cannot be reduced further - Sagala

Sagala Ratnayaka, the President’s Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of the Presidential Staff, states that there is no possibility of further reducing the prevailing prices of commodities.

Ratnayake expressed that since the rupee is appreciating very slowly, what needs to be done now is to take steps to increase the income of the people.

“The price of goods has been brought to the lowest possible point. The prices of some goods like vegetables, fluctuate frequently. However, in terms of foreign exchange, the prices of goods have reached the lowest point”, he said.

“Further appreciation of the rupee is happening very slowly. All we have to do now is to increase the income of the people. Otherwise, we have to make the income of people match the tripled prices of goods.”

Meanwhile, he also said that although the salaries of government employees are increased by Rs. 10,000 from this year, that amount is nowhere near enough to cover the expenses considering the price hikes.

### Health Ministry denies Onco Surgeon’s retirement request

Colombo, Jan 24 (Daily Mirror) -  Notwithstanding official reports indicating that Onco Surgeon Dr. Crysantha Perera, accused of allegedly assaulting a female hospital staffer, has sought early retirement, the Health Ministry is reported to have rejected his request, Daily Mirror learns.

The surgeon, in accordance with the recently issued circular, is eligible to continue serving until the age of 63. However, the 61-year-old surgeon had formally submitted his retirement request two years prior to reaching the retirement age.

Against this backdrop, informed sources suggest that the Health Ministry's refusal is based on the pressing service requirements at the Karapitiya Hospital, where Dr. Crysantha plays a pivotal role as the chief Onco surgeon.

Highlighting Dr. Crysantha's significant contributions to the hospital, sources emphasise that his departure would create a void that cannot be easily filled at this juncture due to the absence of any immediate replacements.
