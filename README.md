### Modi's security adviser Ajith Doaal - Wimal Weerawansa

*2024-04-27 01:12:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/182060) · `ta`

Ajith Dowal's security adviser, Modi's MRM Vasim and Rajadurai Hashan, face controversy over the Sunday bombings. Wimal Weerawansa, a National Freedom Front leader, suggests the bombings could alter Sri Lanka's elections. The truth behind the bombings remains unknown, with no debate on the incident. Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe express concern. Modi's statement in Goa on the day of the bombings suggests a conflict between Sri Lankan Catholics and Indians. The bombings did not affect the 2019 presidential election, with Sajith Premadasa winning. The bombings targeted traditional Muslim beliefs, with 117 Muslims killed in 2016.

Minister Harin Fernando suggests Catholic lawyers form a commission to investigate the Sunday attack, emphasizing legal action over continued discussion.

🟩

Minister Harin Fernando said that Catholic lawyers should call the community and set up a power commission and investigate the life of the Sunday.

He was speaking at the third day debate in Parliament on Friday (26).

Steps must be taken to provide a solution rather than continue to discuss the lifeblood Sunday attack. As a solution to this, Catholic lawyers should call the community and set up a power commission to investigate the life of the Sunday attack on the Sunday attack.. The Commission should also be held responsible for taking legal action.

The government nor the nan does not have to report this issue. The proposal may have been presented to Sajith Premadasa and Anuragumara Dissanayake. There are great lawyers from the Kattaelika community in Sri Lanka.. There is a charge against 93 people in connection with the attack. All 93 persons should be summoned to the Commission.

I can't pour everything into my head because I was in the liberation struggle. "I am confronted by how many inquiries," said Minister of State Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan.

He was speaking at the third day debate in Parliament on Friday (26).

This is the election year and the opposition and some others are still focusing on those living.. Here I noticed that some people extend their hands on me for politics. I can only worry about them. No matter how many inquiries, I am ready to face.

Since 2012, this religious affair has slowly come out.. As a result, some things have begun to happen in the villages where Muslims are concentrated. It was only when ISIS terrorism has reached its peak in the world.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leaders who had been imprisoned for their involvement in the 1971 Insurrection followed an untraditional strategy subsequent to their release from prison in 1977, in their pursuit of political power.

They, instead of mainly encountering the United National Party (UNP), the then ruling party, chose first to attack the leftist parties which were the third force then, to capture that position and then take on the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to become the second powerful party in the country.

Ranil Wickremesinghe perceives himself as a unique selling proposition in the presidential election.

Ranil Wickremesinghe,  a 75-year-old  lawyer, has been immersed in politics for over 50 years. He has been an MP for almost 44 years. Ranil has served as  leader of the Opposition for about 18 years. He has been a deputy minister and Cabinet minister. Above all Wickremesinghe has been sworn in as Prime Minister six times. Impressive as it is, this record of service will not be Wickremesinghe’s lasting political legacy

The first advantage is that Wickremesinghe has a proven track record in this so far. He took over when the country was facing an unprecedented economic crisis. Shortages were rampant amid an acute lack of foreign exchange. There were queues everywhere but supplies were unavailable or inadequate. Power and fuel shortages had virtually paralysed the country

### Thevarapperuma a deformed version of a “Clean” MP

The cumulative factor of electing MPs on ethno-religious and caste preferences with ability to have personal issues addressed through them, have given the “vote” a completely contradictory reason for use, to what it is meant for. Within that distorted individualised purpose of using the vote left unquestioned, the likes of JVP/NPP now wants people to vote for candidates who would in their electorate “serve the people” and they pose as the most suitable candidates to “serve the people”. In plain language, Thevarapperumas do not “serve the people” as Nalinda Jayatissa says. They respond to individual requests

Two politicians, one a State Minister in present SLPP Government headed by President Wickremesinghe and the other a former State Minister under incumbent President Wickremesinghe’s previous “Yahapalana” rule, had tragic, unexpected deaths. One in a road accident and the other in an electrocution in his own land. The two had two different social responses over their deaths.

For climate finance and global funds, ensuring that funding reaches the local level and vulnerable

Climate change impacts all sectors, administrative levels, and segments of society. Research has firmly established the need to mobilise significant resources for addressing these impacts, as well as the current gaps and shortfalls in this endeavour. According to the first Global Stocktake, which was finalised at the 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement (COP28) in December 2023, the adaptation finance needs of developing countries “are estimated at USD 215–387 billion annually up until 2030,” and their needs to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) “at USD 5.8–5.9 trillion for the pre-2030 period.”

There’s something rotting in our system, our society, and it’s being allowed to get worse

There are of course principled and professionally sharp individuals in the police and other arms of the justice system who work tirelessly to combat the drug menace but their efforts are relentlessly compromised at some point by the intervention of some bigwig or another. Therein lies the problem and the solution

Robert Frost once wrote, “Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.” It’s a place like Hotel California in the popular Eagles song by that name — you can check out any time you like but you can never leave.

It’s all about family. The prodigal son or daughter can return. And when they do, other residents cannot pack their bags and leave, however distasteful the returnee has turned out to be or the returning is.

Colombo, April 26 (Daily Mirror) - The Association of Medical Specialists (AMS) have raised concerns regarding proposed changes to the entry criteria for fee-levying medical undergraduate programs at the state-owned medical school of Kothalawala Defense University.

Traditionally, admissions to medical faculties in Sri Lanka have been based primarily on the Advanced Level Examinations Z score, with the University Grants Commission (UGC) allowing a small allocation of additional marks for students excelling in extracurricular activities. This approach has been praised for providing equal opportunities regardless of economic or social background.

### Venice introduces entry fee for day-trippers to tackle mass tourism

*2024-04-26 21:10:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98873/venice-introduces-entry-fee-for-day-trippers-to-tackle-mass-tourism) · `en`

After many years of preparation, Venice has finally debuted its controversial five-euro entry toll for tourists without a hotel reservation this Thursday (25).

This unprecedented measure – being the first city in the world to impose such a fee – has a clear objective: to confront mass tourism that has threatened the fragile balance of the city of canals for too many years, relentlessly driving out its residents.

The figures are quite graphic because, even though there are only about 50,000 residents living in the islands of Venice – not counting those living on the mainland – on days of high pressure, there can be up to 40,000 visitors in Venice at once.

Just last year, 20 million tourists came to walk through its alleyways.

Venice, Italy (CNN) — April 25 has long been a historic day in Venice – the date is not just Italy’s Liberation day, but it’s also the feast day of the city’s patron saint, St. Mark.

But now Venice will notch up another dose of history for April 25 – as the day the city becomes the first in the world to charge day-trippers an entry fee.
