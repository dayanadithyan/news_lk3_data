### Sri Lanka gazettes tea, rubber wages at Rs1,350 with Rs50 over kilo rate

*2024-09-16 11:19:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-gazettes-tea-rubber-wages-at-rs1350-with-rs50-over-kilo-rate-179696/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s wage board has mandated daily wages for tea and rubber workers effective from September 10, according to a gazette notice.

The minimum daily wage is 1,350 rupees for a ‘norm’ of each estate, and there will be a 50 rupee payment for each kilo plucked above the ‘norm’.

The norm is the usual leaf that can be plucked for a field. Some fields which are in shadow of mountains or in areas that get lower rainfall have lower ‘norms’.

The new formula was mutually agreed with plantations companies, industry sources said.

An earlier model which mandated a 1,700 rupee minimum wage was resisted by plantations companies, who said it will result in lower volumes of tea being plucked.

Sri Lanka’s plantations workers and other wage earners found their salaries purchasing power destroyed after macroeconomists in the central bank and Treasury cut its policy rate by printing large volumes of money permanently depreciated the currency.

“Have you learned nothing from history?” Freud (The Future of an Illusion)

“Wrath” is the opening word of The Iliad. Wrath is a key driver of the upcoming presidential election. People are angry at political leaders for bankrupting the country. Hopefully, the anger is accompanied by reason, not just pointing fingers outward but also looking inward.

Those political leaders did not force themselves into power. They were elected by majorities of Sri Lankans. We too bear some culpability for our tragedy.

Unfortunately, wrath is blinding and not enlightening, a truth The Iliad amply illustrates. Enraged at the injustice done to him by Agamemnon, the supreme commander of the Greek forces, Achilles not only retires from the war against Troy; he also conspires to humiliate Agamemnon by making him go down in utter defeat.
