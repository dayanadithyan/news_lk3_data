In a joint statement, the three nations invited Israel and Hamas to restart talks on 15 August “to close all remaining gaps and commence implementation of the deal without further delay.”

Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will return to her country when its new caretaker government decides to hold elections, her son said, but it was not clear if she would contest.

Hasina fled to neighbouring India on Monday after weeks of deadly protests forced her to quit. A caretaker government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus was sworn in on Thursday, which will be tasked with holding elections.

Speaking to the Times of India daily, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who is based in the U.S., said, “For the time being, she (Hasina) is in India. She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election.”

He did not specify whether Hasina, 76, will contest elections. “My mother would have retired from politics after the current term,” Joy said.

“The Supreme Court today gave an order in terms of the law of the country and the constitution of the SJB”, he added.

Furthermore, Wijesekara said: “Both Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara extended their support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe at a very critical time of the country. They both put their political careers on the line knowing this outcome in the hour of need.”
