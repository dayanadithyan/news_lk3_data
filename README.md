Rathnayake defended the move saying that the discussion with Chung was a casual one.

He told Daily Mirror that in the discussion that took place on Tuesday (28), Chung had asked if the election would be held during the period from between September 17 and October 16 as officially announced by the EC.

“The focal point of the meeting was to discuss the election process. Besides, plans for elections were also discussed. However, there was nothing serious or influencing discussed during the meeting which lasted only 30 minutes. It was just a courtesy call,” he underscored.

(AP) — Donald Trump became the first former American president to be convicted of felony crimes Thursday as a New York jury found him guilty of all 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex.

Trump sat stone-faced while the verdict was read as cheering from the street below could be heard in the hallway on the courthouse’s 15th floor where the decision was revealed after more than nine hours of deliberations.

“This was a rigged, disgraceful trial,” an angry Trump told reporters after leaving the courtroom. “The real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people. They know what happened, and everyone knows what happened here.”

Judge Juan Merchan set sentencing for July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where GOP leaders, who remained resolute in their support in the aftermath of the verdict, are expected to formally make him their nominee.

### “VFS” the whole lot

“Yes, real tragedy is never resolved. It goes on hopelessly for ever. Conventional tragedy is too easy. The hero dies and we feel a purging of emotions. A real tragedy takes place in a corner, in an untidy spot …” – No Longer at Ease (Chinua Achebe)

In the common usage, VFS has come to represent the concept of outsourcing, when the State or a private sector organisation decides that one of its functions is better performed by an outside agency, and more economically. As far as we are aware, VFS, the organisation in issue is in the business of providing visa support services, acting on behalf of certain States, which will make the final decision on who goes in or out of that country. The function of the VFS is purely administrative, collecting documents from visa applicants which are then sent to the respective embassies for decision.

### Quo Vadis (Where are you going) Sri Lanka?

Whichever way Sri Lanka chooses to go, will ultimately be determined by its core values

Sri Lanka, since independence has been on a road that was not quite destined to reach a destination. Then, after almost 30 years of independence, with light to moderate progress, the economy underwent a radical change in 1977. We were told that this would make Sri Lanka a developed country in a short time span.

Things did not work out as expected and the next four and a half decades brought us to bankruptcy. There is not much purpose in blaming others, when we ourselves were to blame.

What is clear is that there was a huge thinking deficit on our part, as we believed all the West was saying and advising about development and how we should be getting about it.
