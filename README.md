Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley will suspend her presidential campaign on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with her plans, ensuring that Donald Trump will win the Republican nomination and once again face Democratic President Joe Biden in November’s election.

Haley will give a speech at 10 a.m. local time (1500 GMT) to address her future in the race, the source said, but she will not make an endorsement at that time. She will urge Trump to try to win the backing of her supporters, which include a significant chunk of moderate Republicans and independent voters, the source added.

Haley’s decision to suspend her campaign comes a day after Super Tuesday, opens new tab, when Trump beat her soundly in 14 of the 15 Republican nominating contests.

Haley lasted longer than any other Republican challenger to Trump but never posed a serious threat to the former president, whose iron grip on the party’s base remains firm despite his multiple criminal indictments.

The Eelam Tamils feel their justifications and demands for a homeland are ignored. The relationship between the Eelam Tamils and India has been strained, with the Sri Lankan Indian Treaty and its staff in Sri Lanka being based on mutual welfare and security. The tragic event of the Siripur Buddha has widened the gap. The Eelam Tamils urge the Indian Central Manila Government to release the convicted individuals.

Democratic Party leader C. Vendan said that Murugan, Robateayas and Jayakumar should quickly release the special camps and return their homeland.

The Tamils feel that India should understand the justifications and chambers of the Eelam Tamils after decades.

The Sri Lankan Indian Treaty and its Staff in Sri Lanka were based on the accumulation of its full strength, considering the welfare of its region and the security of the Eelam Tamil.

Some of the bitter extraordinary events after that have been abandoned by the Eelam Tamils in the aftermath of the tragic event of the Siripur Buddha, which has finally created a gap in the relationship of the Indian Eelam Tamils.

We and our people think that the relationship between us and India has been abandoned.
