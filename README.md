Much to the consternation of law abiding people the Government has announced its decision not to act on the Supreme Court interim order restraining Deshabandu Thennakoon from functioning as the Inspector General of Police (IGP).

Despite the ruling by the highest court in the land, the Government insists that the Police IGP will continue to hold office.

Delivering a special statement in Parliament, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena stated that the Supreme Court cannot change the approval granted by the Constitutional Council to appoint the current IGP and therefore the IGP will continue in his position. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has declared his candidacy in the upcoming Presidential election, has stated that he will not appoint an acting IGP as this may lead to election petitions being filed against him.

At least Trump did not pretend to be a great Democrat! But RW did! RW made SL one up over America!

He denied the local elections over a year ago bogusly claiming lack of funds all the while spending millions of borrowed monies on a non existing national pride on the Independence Day celebrations. Further he also got the bunch of Rajapaksa crooks and hooligans in the parliament to approve extra Rs. 200 million over and above the budget on his own foreign travel.
