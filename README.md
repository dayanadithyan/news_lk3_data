A Melbourne woman has been saved from sending thousands of dollars to her sick overseas “boyfriend” after being caught up in a romance scam.

The woman, aged in her 60s, went to a NAB branch in Cranbourne, in Melbourne’s southeast in February, wanting to deposit $2,000 into an account to help her boyfriend, whom she met on social media.

She said her boyfriend, who was living in Turkey, was sick and needed the money to fly to the UK for treatment. But his account had apparently been frozen.

“He told her to instead send the money to his friend in Sydney who could then transfer him the money,” NAB Customer Advisor, Dilan Pathirannahalage said in a statement.

However, alarm bells quickly went off for Mr Pathirannahalage when the woman wasn’t able to provide the recipient’s surname.

“The reason she didn’t know who she was transferring the funds to was because she had never met the person on the other end of the line who she thought was her boyfriend, and so didn’t know their friends either.”

### Katchatheevu island row: Modi says ‘new details unmasked DMK’s double standards’

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that new details on the Katchatheevu island issue “have unmasked DMK’s (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) double standards totally”. His remarks came a day after he attacked the Congress over its decision to hand over the strategic island to Sri Lanka in the 1970s.

In a post on X, the Prime Minister said, “Rhetoric aside, DMK has done NOTHING to safeguard Tamil Nadu’s interests. New details emerging on #Katchatheevu have UNMASKED the DMK’s double standards totally.”

“Congress and DMK are family units. They only care that their own sons and daughters rise. They don’t care for anyone else. Their callousness on Katchatheevu has harmed the interests of our poor fishermen and fisherwomen in particular,” he added.

Katchatheevu island is where fishermen from Tamil Nadu go to fish. But they are detained by the Sri Lankan Navy as soon as they cross the International Maritime Border Line (IMBL) to reach the island.
