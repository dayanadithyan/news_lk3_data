Colombo, Jan 22 (Daily Mirror) - The Yukthiya operation should not be a drama but should be aimed at apprehending main drug dealers in the country, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said yesterday.

Speaking to journalists Field Marshal Fonseka said there is no point in arresting hundreds of ordinary people without arresting main drug traffickers in Sri Lanka.

"If major drug traffickers are not arrested under the Yukthiya Operation it will become another drama. Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennekoon will not be able to travel along the streets if he continues to make Yukthiya operation a drama," he added.

He also stressed that Samagi Jana Balawegaya ( SJB) should go along the right track if it wants to win the hearts of the people.

" SJB should scrutinize those whom it wants to accept to its fold rather than inviting those from other parties to join hands," he added.

Changing the existing system is not just a political program, but a national activity. People are currently coming forward for a new change.

It is ludicrous to say that those responsible for the fall of the country in all sectors in economic and all sectors are said to have progressed a step away from today.

Therefore, this chauvinist gang must liberate the country and lead the country to the new path. This is the goal of the national people's power.

Sri Lanka has gone through easy money booms, involving private credit surges financed by central bank credit to boost growth, and the resultant forex shortages, tightening of exchange and import controls too often since the central bank was set up in 1950.

The Sri Lanka Press Institute, its constituents and affiliated organisations yesterday expressed concern over the proposed Online Safety Bill (Bill) and its implications on the freedom of expression.

While acknowledging a need to regulate internet intermediaries, as is the objective of the Bill, the SLPI  identified several controversial elements present in the Bill that are not conducive for  journalists, the media and the larger community in Sri Lanka.

Considering the amendments to be proposed at the Parliamentary committee stage based on the Supreme Court determination in November 2023, 31 of the 56 articles in the Bill are expected to be revised in line with the principles of democracy and the Constitution of Sri Lanka, reflecting on the freedom of expression of the media. Accordingly, the proposed amendments are expected to alter the functions and the framework of the Commission, including its autonomy and the definitions of offences.

Value Added Tax (VAT) can be reduced to 15% to equalize with its previous level if all businesses in Sri Lanka register for VAT, Bandula Gunawardena, the Minister of Transport, Highways, and Mass Media said on Saturday.

He said so while visiting a food factory in Kolonnawa where fruit dices and floats are produced for the wider cake industry.

“Young people in this country have opportunities to stand on their feet without engaging in hateful rhetoric about the society if they reimagine and rekindle the entrepreneurial spirit within them and start their own businesses. We have the opportunity to produce goods and deliver services to countries such as India, China, Japan and South Korea. They are huge economies and we can access those markets with tax-free benefits. When such a manufacturing and business culture is embedded in our society, there would be enough liquidity to ease the burden on the vulnerable sections of the society.

Since the economic meltdown, many of us realise that bad practices of the past – spending far more than we earn – has led us down to the sorry path we find ourselves in. Political leaders claim that we are no longer a bankrupt nation and have substantial dollar reserves. The reality sadly is, the situation is not so rosy.

A portion of these ‘reserves’ comprises credit lines, funds lent by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other multi-lateral lending agencies. Some funds are also tied to particular conditions.

So while we do have a certain amount of ‘money in the bank’ so-to-say, it is not ours to spend as we would wish. Far worse, we have as yet not commenced repaying our international creditors as the negotiations are ongoing. So the situation is not as good as portrayed.

### Russia wants Sri Lanka to maintain neutrality on Ukraine despite Western Pressure - Ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan

*2024-01-22 00:01:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Russia-wants-Sri-Lanka-to-maintain-neutrality-on-Ukraine-despite-Western-Pressure-Ambassador-Levan-Dzhagaryan/231-275441) · `en`

Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan, in an interview with Daily Mirror, discusses the current status of bilateral ties, and what is being planned for the future.

Q  How did the recent visit of a top level Russian delegation help elevate bilateral ties?

We are satisfied with the current level of our bilateral relations. Another indication of it was the visit of a high-ranking Russian delegation.

It was a rather big delegation of more than 40 people, headed by Nikolai Patrushev, the Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.   He had a very important meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe on   December 6, 2023. He had a meeting with Defence Secretary, Major General (Rtd) Kamal Gunaratne. The latter was in Moscow in May, last year. So it’s a continuation of bilateral dialogue. Also, Mr. Patrushev, when he was in Colombo last December, extended his invitation to Mr. Gunaratne to visit Russia in the coming year.

### Avalokiteshvaras in Every Sphere of Sasana: a Growing Gap between Dhamma & Buddhism

*2024-01-22 00:01:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Avalokiteshvaras-in-Every-Sphere-of-Sasana-a-Growing-Gap-between-Dhamma-Buddhism/172-275438) · `en`

Followers of wholesome Dhamma need not be disturbed by individuals like Jeromes, Sepalas, Natashas, Ruwans, or Avalokiteshvaras; these are insignificant ‘outside’ influences, a phenomenon that existed even in the times of the Buddha. The growing concern lies in the emerging threat posed by ‘Devadattas’ operating within the Sasana.

### Society 5.0: Is it a myth or a miracle?

*2024-01-21 23:18:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Society-5-0-Is-it-a-myth-or-a-miracle/4-757585) · `en`

Urbanisation, smart cities, climate change, temporariness and aged populations are a few among many other reasons as to why firms and nations should focus on Society 5.0

In an ever-changing world, one cannot find a risk-free venture, investment, event, or an activity. Risk should necessarily be examined by looking at the probability of occurrence and the impact. Technology can play a vital role in mitigating the risks by addressing both the impact and probability of occurrence. Designers and developers of Society 5.0 solutions should necessarily use best practices such as secure by design in mitigating risks

### In this election year, Sri Lanka needs a lot of rationally thinking people

*2024-01-21 22:48:25* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/In-this-election-year-Sri-Lanka-needs-a-lot-of-rationally-thinking-people/4-757583) · `en`

Instead of being rational choosers, they have acted on emotions created by political leaders of all hues  – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

At an election, political leaders would emotionalise voters to gain power but after the election, they simply forget about it leaving the voters in the lurch. Hence, acting rationally is a must for voters at the forthcoming elections

In 2024, Sri Lankan voters will be given the choice of electing their leaders through the power of the ballot. This is an important occasion for Sri Lanka which is a long surviving democracy in South Asia, next only to India. However, a common allegation is that, throughout the post-independence history, the voters have not done their job correctly. Instead of being rational choosers, they have acted on emotions created by political leaders of all hues.
