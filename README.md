The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a very efficient leader. He had excellent XQ (Execution Quotient) i.e. ability to get things done. The secret of his efficiency was his sense of urgency. Once a task was decided he would formulate a plan with relevant parties and execute it as fast as possible. This was evident in his many actions from winning over tribal chiefs to the many campaigns he led to ensure Islam triumphed and a commonwealth based on the brotherhood of man finally emerged. That he was supremely successful in this nobody will deny. We know in our personal life that anything we decide to do later, rarely gets done. One delay leads to another, which is why procrastination is regarded almost as a sin in Islam

The study reveals shocking reports that the Lu chromosomes found in men are disappearing.

Biologists have published shocking results from how the Lu chromosome, one of the two gender chromosomes in humans, is likely to disappear when the world has changed all things.

They said that the complete disappearance of this chromosome would mean the end of the male offspring in the future. However, we do not need to believe that, and they have some beliefs.

In this regard, renowned genetic professor Jennifer A. Marshall Graves said, "In the last 300 million years, it has lost 1,393 of its original 1,438 genes and only 45 genes remains."

Jennifer A. Marshall expressed concern that the time of Lu chromosome's telephone number is over and that if this trend continues, they will disappear completely within 11 million years.
