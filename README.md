*2024-04-02 17:31:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180269) · `ta`

இத்தேர்தல்களில் எதிர்ககட்சியான குடியரசு மக்களின் கட்சி (சி.எச்.பி.) அதிக உள்ளூராட்சி சபைகளை கைப்பற்றியுள்ளது.

81 மாகாண தலைநகரங்களில் 35 சபைகளை எதிர்கட்சியான சி.எச்.பி. வென்றுள்ளது. 24 சபைகளில் மாத்திரம் ஜனாதிபதி தையீப் அர்துவானின் ஏ.கே.பி. கட்சி வென்றுள்ளது.

குர்திஷ் கட்சியான டீ.ஈ.எம். 10 சபைகளையும் இஸ்லாமியக் கட்சியான யேனிடேன் ரெஃபா 2 சபைகளையும் கைப்பற்றியுள்ளன.

துருக்கியின் மிகப் பெரிய நகரான இஸ்தான்புல், தலைநகர் அங்காரா, அடானா, புர்ஸா, அன்டால்யா நகரங்கிளலும் சி.எச்.பி. கட்சியின் மேயர்கள் தெரிவாகியுள்ளனர்.

2002 ஆம் அண்டு அர்துவானின் ஏ.கே.பி. கட்சி அதிகாரத்துக்கு வந்த பின்னர் அக்கட்சி அடைந்த மிக மோசமான தோல்வி இதுவாகும்.

பணவீக்கம் 67 சதவீதமாக அதிகரித்துள்ளமை இத் தேர்தல் பெறுபேறுகளுக்கு ஒரு பிரதான காரணம் எனக் கருதப்படுகிறது.

Sri Lanka's milk consumption has slightly increased post-crisis, but overall, it's less than before. Economic recovery has seen over a million families return to the market, but the dairy industry needs at least two years to reach pre-crisis levels.

🟩

Following the economic crisis, a senior industry representative said the use of Sri Lanka's monthly milk, which has been reduced by almost half of the price rise, has seen a slight increase.

Consumption of 7,000 metric tonnes of milk powder in the last three years has declined to 3,000 metric tonnes in the last three years due to the rise in US dollar prices, milk prices in the world market and government tax hikes.

However, with the slightest improvement of economic conditions, more than one million families have returned to the market, although the overall consumption is less than the previous level, said Ravi Jayawardena, CEO of the Maliban Group.

He shared his views while addressing a group debate by the Kabital Alliance Limited, which examines the current trends of Sri Lankan consumer spending and the post -crisis view.

According to Jayawardena, the domestic dairy industry will take at least two years to return to Kovit's previous consumption.
