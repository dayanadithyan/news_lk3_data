### UN Security Council demands immediate ceasefire in Gaza after US abstains

*2024-03-26 07:44:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/98204/un-security-council-demands-immediate-ceasefire-in-gaza-after-us-abstains) ¬∑ `en`

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council on Monday demanded an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages after the United States abstained from the vote.

The remaining 14 council members voted for the resolution, which was proposed by the 10 elected members of the body.

Washington had been averse to the word ceasefire earlier in the nearly six-month-old war in the Gaza Strip and had used its veto power to shield U.S. ally Israel as it retaliated against Hamas for an Oct. 7 attack that Israel says killed 1,200 people.

But amid growing global pressure for a truce in the war that has killed more than 32,000 Palestinians, the U.S. abstained from the vote on Monday to allow the Security Council to demand an immediate ceasefire for the month of Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which ends in two weeks.

*2024-03-26 07:25:00* ¬∑ [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/194934) ¬∑ `si`

The UN Security Council passed a ceasefire proposal for Gaza, with Hamas requesting hostage release. Despite US opposition, Israel's Netanyahu office advocated for change. Critics argue this signals a rift between Israel and the US.

üü©

The United Nations Security Council has passed a proposal to immediately implement a ceasefire at Gaza.

It is reported that the Hamas has also requested the release of unconditional hostages.

After the opening operations in Gaza last year, several proposals to the Defense Council were not passed in the United States, but in the face of the United States.

However, the US has avoided the proposal yesterday (25th) and the US is not used against it.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has worked for the change in the United States.

Israel has also taken steps to cancel the discussion on Washington this week.

Critics say that this has received a signal of ancientity between Israel and the US.

However, UN Palestinian Representative Riyadh Mansoor, who accepted this proposal, said that the resolution was delayed when more than 100,000 IDPs were killed.

### Issues facing Inland Revenue Department in tax collection

The IRD has encountered significant challenges in meeting its tax collection targets. As of October 2023, the IRD collected 82% of the projected revenue, amounting to Rs. 740 billion out of an expected Rs. 908 billion.

The slowdown in collection was particularly noticeable in the second half of the year, attributed to the Central Bank‚Äôs interest rate policy directive in August, which impacted corporate tax inflow. Financial institutions, which are major contributors to corporate taxes, have been affected by the monetary policy, leading to a shortfall in Government revenue.

The IRD set ambitious targets for corporate taxes at Rs. 603 billion and non-corporate taxes at Rs. 305 billion for 2023. By October, 77% of the corporate taxes and 91% of the non-corporate taxes were collected.

The 2024 Budget aims to increase tax revenue to Rs. 4 trillion, up from Rs. 3 trillion in 2023, with a significant portion expected from taxes on income and profit.
