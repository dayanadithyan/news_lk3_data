тАЬShe has turned Bangladesh around. When she took over power it was considered a failing state. It was a poor country. Until today it was considered one of the rising tigers of Asia,тАЭ Mr Joy said.

Over the last month, more than 300 people died in Bangladesh amid violent protests, which though started over quota, shortly transformed into a call for the Prime Minister to step down.

Sheikh HasinaтАЩs critics accused her not just of corruption and nepotism but also high-handedness and curtailing of civil liberties. These, many alleged, overshadowed the economic progress and development she had brought about.

### India & The Military: Two Factors That May Affect JVPтАЩs Rise To Power

*2024-08-05 19:33:53* ┬╖ [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/india-the-military-two-factors-that-may-affect-jvps-rise-to-power/) ┬╖ `en`

The indomitable spirit shown by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna commonly known as JVP since its inception, even after the total eclipse of its initial political leadership is remarkable. Unlike many of the leftist political parties swayed and assimilated into the mainstream spectrum of party politics in Sri Lanka, JVP survived and flourished. After a half-century of its survival before two insurrections, JVP stands as a catalyst factor in the coming presidential election of Sri Lanka. Embittered by the cascade of failures attributed to the major political parties, essentially the nepotism of the Rajapaksa regime until the ousting of Gotabaya in 2022, the people seem to have developed a trust towards JVPтАЩs charismatic leader Mr. Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
