### பெருந்தோட்ட மக்களை சிறு தேயிலைத் தோட்ட உரிமையாளர்களாக பலப்படுத்தினால் சமுர்த்தி அஸ்வெசும போன்ற திட்டங்கள் தேவைப்படாது - சஜித் பிரேமதாச

*2024-02-15 01:29:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/176407) · `ta`

தோட்டங்களில் வேலை செய்பவர்களைச் சிறு தோட்ட உரிமையாளர்களாக்கி, பயிரிடப்படாத அரச தரிசு நிலங்களை அந்தந்த பகுதிகளுக்கு ஏற்ப சிறு தேயிலை தோட்டங்களாக மாற்றி, இன்றைய தொழிலாளியை நாளைய தொழில் முனைவோராக்கும் செயல்திட்டம் நிச்சயம் முன்னெடுக்கப்படும். இது தொழிலை விட வாழ்வாதாரம் என்றும் இந்த நிலத்தில் தேயிலைத் தோட்டம் அமைந்து இருப்பது போலவே வீட்டை நிர்மாணித்துச் சிறந்த வருமானத்தை ஈட்டிக்கொள்ளலாம் என்றும் எதிர்க்கட்சித் தலைவர் தெரிவித்தார்.

நாட்டின் தேயிலை உற்பத்தியில் 70 வீதமானது சுமார் 40 வீதமான காணிகளை வைத்திருக்கும் சிறு தேயிலைத் தோட்ட உரிமையாளர்களால் வழங்கப்படுவதாகக் கூறப்படுகிறது. 60 சதவீதத்திற்கும் அதிகமான நில உடைமை கொண்ட பெரிய அளவிலான தேயிலை தொழிற்சாலைகள் தேயிலை உற்பத்திக்கு 30 சதவீத பங்களிப்பையே வழங்குகின்றன. சிறிய தேயிலைத் தோட்டங்களை ஊக்குவிப்பது என்பது தேயிலை உற்பத்தியை அதிகரிப்பதாகும் எனவும், அதன் பின்னர் சமுர்த்தி மற்றும் அஸ்வெசும போன்ற திட்டங்களுக்குத் தேவைப்பாடு ஏற்படாது என்றும் எதிர்க்கட்சித் தலைவர் தெரிவித்தார்.

### Importance of renewable energy for future energy security and economic growth

*2024-02-15 00:05:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Importance-of-renewable-energy-for-future-energy-security-and-economic-growth/4-758488) · `en`

It is time Sri Lankans considered in depth, the impact of energy on their day to day life and the national economy, as well as the sources of such energy. Leaving such matters entirely to the officials and the politicians to make all the decisions would only cause them to lament later on the hardships passed on to the consumers due to poor decisions, lacking in wisdom or vision for the future. It is increasingly evident that rampant corruption and deal making are in place as per comments made even by the Supreme Court from time to time as well as the findings of the Auditor General. The fact that no pressure is applied to follow up on these allegations and take action to bring the culprits to book, underscores both the lack of understanding and the apathy of the general public, that hitherto seem to believe they have no role to play.

As I was admiring a  skyscraper, I was jolted back to reality by a rickety old bus pulling up in front of it. Somehow, the blueprint to make Colombo world-class seems to have forgotten all about public transport

Colombo is a city in a hurry. New hotels, shopping malls and highways are mushrooming everywhere, and the skyline keeps growing upwards, promising to take us to a world-class future. I went to Galle Face and Port City recently to soak in the Global City in progress. As I was admiring a brightly-lit skyscraper, I was jolted back to reality by a rickety old bus pulling up in front of it. Somehow, the blueprint to make Colombo world-class seems to have forgotten all about public transport.

### Wildlife: 50,000 Species Meet the Needs of Billions Worldwide

Despite widespread criticism especially by some media groups which obviously have some vested interests, President Ranil Wickremesinghe – giving steady leadership to the heavily divided Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) government – is making  steady progress in pulling Sri Lanka out of its worst ever economic and debt crisis. These moves come in an election year but some critics are alleging that the President might try to put off the elections by changing the Executive Presidential system of government. While these areas are important, the politicians and the people need to focus on areas, which have long-term consequences and add beauty to this paradise island. One such area is wildlife, though most people do not have direct interests or connections with it.

— President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Address to the Nation, Feb 7th 2024 —

The UNP-led old order fell in 1956 because Sir John Kotelawala was socio-culturally insensitive; tone deaf. Ranil is similarly incapacitated, in the socio-economic dimension. He said that economic recovery was proceeding at “rocket speed”, and “unlike other nations, we have managed to rejuvenate our economy swiftly, evading enduring difficulties and pains…”

### Sri Lanka house builders should look for the sun: SEA officials

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lankans building their new home should focus on the direction of the sun, and not just auspicious directions, officials at a Sectoral Oversight Committee on Energy have said.

Many Sri Lankans consult astrologers and mystics before building anything new, who advise on which direction a building must not face (ma-ru si-ti-na di-sha-va).

But house owners should also focus on the direction of the sun (hi-ru si-ti-na di-sha-va), officials of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) said.

“When building, constructors should consider a place to install solar panels in a new house,” a statement by the Department of Government Information quoted the officials as saying.

The officials pointed out that although people are concerned about the ‘direction of death’ based on occult science, they are not concerned about the direction of the sun. This has become a problem in the installation of solar panels, they said.

Rivals Anies Baswedan and Ganjar Pranowo had about 25% and 17% respectively, according to the independent pollsters that were conducting “quick counts” at the close of voting.

Counts by reputable outlets have proven to be accurate in previous elections. An official result is not expected until several weeks after the vote.

*2024-02-14 16:13:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/176355) · `ta`

It must be accepted that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is currently in the present presence than in the past.

Udaya Kammanpila, the leader of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (Hela Urumaya Party), said that there were no political parties in the mood to accept this progress.

He was responding to a question raised by the media regarding the 'JVP's progress' after attending a function in Colombo on Wednesday (14).

With a few polls to be held this year, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is said to be present.. The truthfulness of the polls taken, is doubtful.

At present, the People's Liberation Front must accept that the presence of the Liberation Front is currently in the forefront.

Those who have become bankrupt in politics refuse to accept this. But we will accept the truth.

According to the Constitution this year, the presidential election must be held. Internal maneuvers are rapidly carried out to regain the election rather than prioritize the election.

Colombo, Feb 14 (Daily Mirror) -  The healthcare services across the country have been paralyzed, inconveniencing patients as trade unions within the health sector have decided to continue the island-wide strike.

Furthermore, long queues can be seen at nationwide pharmacies owned by the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation since this morning as medications are not being dispensed from the medicine counters at government hospitals.

The strike, which commenced from 6.30 a.m. yesterday (13) was launched following unsuccessful discussions with officials from the Finance Ministry.

The focal point of the strike action is the prolonged and contentious disagreement surrounding the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance, according to the President of the Federation of Health Professionals Ravi Kumudesh.

The health workers have so far resorted to three trade union actions this year over the failure to provide an allowance similar to the DAT allowance granted to the doctors.
