Sri Lanka has scrapped plans to sell off its indebted national airline despite shortlisting three potential buyers, the government’s privatisation agency said Friday.

Colombo called for bids in September to sell SriLankan Airlines, a key IMF demand when granting a bailout loan to the country last year.

Six firms had initially expressed interest in taking a stake in the airline, which owed more than $2.0 billion at the end of the 2022/2023 financial year.

The government announced in April a shortlist of three potential investors, including Malaysia’s Air Asia.

However, on Friday, the State Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit said it had called off the sale.

“The cabinet of ministers at a meeting on July 9 decided to terminate the current bidding process with regard to the divestiture of SriLankan Airlines,” it said in a brief statement without giving any reasons for the decision.

It added that the government will follow an “alternate strategy” regarding the carrier.

### China's doors continue to be open to the world

*2024-07-19 10:22:17* · [`adalk`](https://www.ada.lk/opinion/චීනයේ-දොරටු-ඉදිරියටත්-වඩාත්-පුළුල්ව-ලෝකයා-වෙත-විවෘතයි-/2-410866) · `si`

It appears there might have been a misunderstanding in my previous response. Let's address the topic directly.



China's approach to opening its markets and engaging with the global economy has indeed evolved significantly over the years. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), for instance, is a testament to China's ambition to expand its economic influence beyond its borders. The initiative aims to enhance connectivity and cooperation on a transcontinental scale, covering Asia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and beyond.



Moreover, China's domestic policies, such as the opening up of various sectors to foreign investment and the introduction of new laws to facilitate foreign businesses, demonstrate a commitment to integrating more deeply into the global economy. The increase in visa-free access for foreigners and the growth in tourism indicate a broader effort to attract international visitors and investors.



However, it's crucial to recognize that China's approach to opening up is balanced with its own strategic interests. While China seeks to engage more closely with the global economy, it also maintains certain restrictions and controls to protect its domestic industries and national security. This balance is evident in areas like foreign direct investment, where China has specific requirements and limitations to ensure that incoming capital aligns with its long-term development goals.



Furthermore, China's participation in international economic agreements, such as the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) and applications to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), reflect its desire to contribute to and benefit from global economic governance frameworks. These moves signal China's intention to play a more prominent role in shaping the rules of the global economy.



In summary, while China is indeed opening its doors wider to the global economy, this process is part of a carefully calibrated strategy that balances economic engagement with the protection of national interests. The country's rapid economic growth, its ambitious infrastructure projects like the BRI, and its active pursuit of international economic partnerships all underscore its commitment to fostering greater global connectivity and cooperation.

🟩

The near term was the worst impact on economic globalization of anti-globalization (anti-globalization). The capital, industries and jobs that some Western States have followed the policies of the 'national security' and the 'National Assault' have led to the rejection of foreign enterprises.

In addition, some Western media made many accused of opening of China and refused to understand China's market conditions. However, the problem is that China is not open by the opening, it shows that China does not fulfill any Western requirements.

No. In view of the following data, it realizes that it is false.China is currently the largest seventh year of the country. The export values ​​of the products including the first half of the year 2024 have been influenced by 22.2% of the previous year, 91.1% and 25.6% compared to the previous year.

The parties should have a strong balance sheet and expertise, as there were the jobs of 6,000 people at stake, he said. (Colombo/July19/2024)

Appeal – STOP aiding Israeli government’s continued slaughter of Palestine people

I am a Sri Lankan by descent. I also consider myself a “citizen” of South Asia (SA) despite India keeping the SAARC, a defunct association. I am a keen observer of SA politics and of regional and global conflicts.

You do not have to be told I know, Israeli attacks on Palestine civilians begun on 7 October 2023 in retaliation to a Hamas terror attack that took Israel by surprise, continues unabated and the toll of Palestine civilians killed end-June, 2024 according to the Gaza Ministry of Health is 38,000 humans. Yet “Lancet”, a peer reviewed, internationally recognised medical journal says it could now be around 186,000 people, as the “official toll does not take into account thousands of dead buried under rubble and indirect deaths due to destruction of health facilities, food distribution systems and other public infrastructure”.

Taxpayer rights have been steadily curtailed in recent policy changes

A taxpayer is required to file, a return of income, VAT return or SSCL return as the case may be on or before the due date. If the Inland Revenue officers are not in agreement with the return filed, they have a statutory right to raise an appropriate assessment on or before the expiry of the relevant time bar provided in the relevant statute. Generally, within a 30-day period a taxpayer of receipt of assessment has to appeal/request for administrative review against such to CGIR, specifying the grounds of appeal. Taxpayers dissatisfied with an assessment have recourse through a four-tier appellate system.

The tax assessment process commences with an inquiry, which may involve interviews and requests for documents. Following this, the Assistant Commissioner responsible for the taxpayer’s file may issue an assessment if they determine that the declared tax liability is incorrect.

### NCE urges authorities to expedite Sri Lanka’s accession to Madrid Protocol

*2024-07-19 05:10:00* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/business/NCE-urges-authorities-to-expedite-Sri-Lanka-s-accession-to-Madrid-Protocol/34-764455) · `en`

Sri Lanka exports a wide range of goods under various trademarks, contributing significantly to economic growth in international trade. As an exporters’ chamber, the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) actively encourages its members to export under their own brands. However, the cost of registering trademarks in multiple countries can be prohibitively expensive. For instance, registering in 10 countries means incurring tenfold the cost. The Madrid Protocol offers a solution to this issue.

The Madrid System, officially known as the Madrid Protocol, is an international treaty administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). It provides a streamlined and cost-effective way for businesses to register their trademarks in multiple countries. Joining this system would offer significant benefits to Sri Lankan exporters.
