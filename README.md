India, the world’s biggest democracy, held Parliamentary elections this year in seven phases from 19 April to 1 June. 642 million persons voted in the poll. Results were announced on 4 June. The incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi was re-elected PM for the third time. His party the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 240 of 572 Lok Sabha or Parliament seats. Together with allied parties the BJP led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) obtained 293 seats in Parliament.

The election results have been continuously analysed and commented upon from the time of the poll. A significant aspect of these analyses and commentaries is the “caste factor”. Indian analysts and commentators are not “shy” about discussing caste openly when dissecting poll results. It is an acknowledged fact in India that caste plays a very influential role in determining the outcome of elections in many electorates, regions or states. Many Indians delve into the “caste in elections” topic without any inhibitions.

### Emerging Presidential election campaigns in Sri Lanka: Liberal consensus and fringe politics

*2024-06-26 05:33:58* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Emerging-Presidential-election-campaigns-in-Sri-Lanka-Liberal-consensus-and-fringe-politics/4-763468) · `en`

In the lead up to Presidential elections, the three leading political camps—the President Ranil Wickremesinghe-led Government, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), and the National People’s Power (NPP)—appear to converge on two key issues, namely, an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led path to economic recovery, and the continuity of the Provincial Councils (PC) system.

On the economic front, the current IMF program is now backed, to varying degrees, by all three camps. The SJB and the NPP, from the Opposition, argue that they would negotiate the Government’s IMF deal to more favourable terms that especially benefit the more vulnerable, poorer sections of society. This indicates one side of the policy convergence that ‘there is no alternative’ to the IMF.

### Harshana Rajakaruna can only be accepted if international companies declare that the country has recovered from the bank -

*2024-06-25 16:28:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186951) · `ta`

If the country has recovered from the bankruptcy, international standards must be notified of the announcement.

Without doing so, the president or no other ministers cannot accept the announcement. United People's Shakti Gampaha District Parliamentarian Harshana Rajakaruna said this is a move to deceive the people.

Foreign debt restructuring is very important to recover from that state of affairs.

But the government has so far gone into a very narrow amount of debt renovation in foreign debt restructuring.

Based on this, the government is trying to release the report that the country is currently recovering from bankruptcy.

When many bankrupt countries recover from bankruptcy, the debt reorganization is very successful. But such a situation did not include the Ranil Wickremesinghe -led government.

How can the country recover from bankruptcy. We also wish to recover from the bankruptcy. We will be happy if such a situation happens. But it is not possible to take action to deceive people.
