ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs central bank has mopped up 546 billion rupees of domestic money, out of a total of 578.5 billion rupees created by the purchase of foreign exchange in the six months to June 2024, official data showed.

The central bank had generated 538.1 billion rupees from forex purchases from the market, a Market Operations Report showed.

The central bank had also generated 40.4 billion rupees net from buying official foreign loan proceeds after settling any loans.

Analysts had warned that one of the ways the rupee is pressured by the deeply flawed operational framework of an IMF-prone central bank is through the surrender by the Treasury of its dollar receipts, creating new money.

Government surrenders have a devastating effect on the currency, when the exchange rate is already under pressure, driving up credit and requiring an even greater contraction of the economy to end any external crisis triggered by mis-targeted short term rates, analysts have said.

Violent disorder erupted in Liverpool, Bristol, Hull and Belfast - four cities located in different corners of the UK - with scuffles breaking out and bricks and bottles thrown as anti-immigration protesters faced groups opposed to racism.

### Rajapaksas  Backstabbing Ranil  Over the Presidential Candidacy Issue   Backfire  on the SLPP.

*2024-08-04 03:33:00* ┬╖ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84468) ┬╖ `en`

President  Ranil Wickremesinghe was cruelly bamboozled by the Rajapaksas early this week. The incumbent president was given false promises that the Medamulana clan-led тАЬpohottuwaтАЭparty was firmly behind him in his bid to contest the forthcoming presidential poll. The note of discord struck by Namal Rajapaksa was lightly dismissed as being of very little consequence. The message conveyed was that Wickremesinghe should formally seek the suppo rt of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna(SLPP) for his candidacy and that it would be accepted and approved by the SLPP as a matter of course. But when Ranil did so, the carpet was yanked from under his feet.

### PR: The Essential Ingredient in Hoteliering тАУ Part A

*2024-08-04 02:39:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/pr-the-essential-ingredient-in-hoteliering-part-a/) ┬╖ `en`

I consider Public Relations (PR) as one of the most important aspects in running any business. In the context of managing Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH) during the early 1990s, I identified the following twelve segments of people with whom I needed to have good PR:

During my efforts to shortlist employee suggestions, тАШEstablishing quality circles in all departments, to earn a national awardтАЩ was identified as a goal for 1991. Before formalizing quality circles, we initiated special clean-ups using the Sri Lankan village concept of тАШShramadanaтАЩ (donation of time and effort). This practice brought a new sparkle to the hotel.

### The  Supreme Court has consistently upheld the principle that a govt servant is empowered to refuse to obey an тАШillegalтАЩ order by his or her superior resulting in the use of state assets for a particular political party or candidate.

*2024-08-04 02:22:00* ┬╖ [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=84472) ┬╖ `en`

If the glittering promise of the тАШJathika Jana BalavegayaтАЩ (NPP) is supposed to offer a better, brighter Sri Lanka to put an end to the тАЩ76 year old curseтАЩ of its political rivals, it is time that NPP Presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake refrains from justifying his actions during the run-up to the September 21st Presidential elections on the basis that, тАШothers are doing it, why not me?тАЩ

That absurd justification is increasingly being used by the NPP to the extent that this (logically) defeats its own argument of being тАШdifferentтАЩ to the others. Earlier, the NPP Presidential candidate announced on a recent visit overseas to meet his тАШsupportersтАЩ that he will declare the cost of his (frequent) travels and the sources of that (private) funding only if President Ranil Wickremesinghe together with his Minister of Sports and Minister of Labour/Foreign Employment discloses the same information regarding their (state) travels.

### Some wonders AI has created and dangers of negative repercussions

*2024-08-04 02:09:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/some-wonders-ai-has-created-and-dangers-of-negative-repercussions/) ┬╖ `en`

If anyone in this audience was skeptical regarding my earlier assertion that engineering and technology underpin numerous innovations shaping our lives, this example should effectively dispel their doubts. So what is behind this success in this new generation of AI that we now experience? It is a technology called Deep Learning, a term that may be familiar to some of you.

What is Deep Learning? Deep learning is a computer learning paradigm, inspired by the human brainтАЩs neural networks, which are believed to process data iteratively, through layers. Similar to how the brain learns from data, Deep Learning algorithms also learn by processing data, through layers of interconnected computing nodes, refining their understanding with each iteration.

### My time at Sussex University in the mid-1970s

*2024-08-04 02:07:00* ┬╖ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/my-time-at-sussex-university-in-the-mid-1970s/) ┬╖ `en`

тАЬCulture is like jam; the less you have, the more you spreadтАЭ

The Central Bank of Ceylon had stringent forex laws and regulations in the seventies. In 1975, it approved 18 sterling pounds for me to take to England as a student and recorded the amount in my passport. The postgraduate studentship from the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) of Sussex University paid my airfare, tuition fees, and living expenses.

I travelled to Karachi from Colombo on October 1. The connecting flight to London was delayed because the plane had engine troubles. I did not have money to make a call to IDS or ARTI about the delay. The plan was for someone from IDS to meet me at Falmer railway station (the nearest to the university) on October 2 in the afternoon.
