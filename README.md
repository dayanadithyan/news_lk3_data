### Independence and Self-Sufficiency: Co-operation in Times of Crisis

*2024-02-05 00:05:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Independence-and-Self-Sufficiency-Co-operation-in-Times-of-Crisis/172-276324) · `en`

For close to a decade and a half I have been studying co-operatives, particularly as I was preoccupied with questions about the post-war reconstruction of Jaffna. As I watched the failure of development policies that prioritised building transport and urban infrastructure over rural livelihoods, supported the proliferation of financial institutions leading to indebtedness, and grand claims about the private sector generating employment that did not materialize, I became more and more involved with the co-operative movement. Drawing on the institutional memory of the co-operative movement and the vast network of co-operatives that survived the war, some of us began to see an alternative for social and economic revival of the still rural war-torn society in the North.

True freedom cannot be bestowed by an external entity; it resides within you. Unleash it from within yourself

The 76th ‘February 4th’ has passed, marked by four days of aerobatics, consuming considerable aviation fuel and time.

The 76th ‘February 4th’ has passed, marked by four days of aerobatics, consuming considerable aviation fuel and time. This prompts questions about resource usage during such events. The primary question persists: why, after 76 years of independence, hasn’t this celebration translated into genuine freedom? To attain complete freedom for Sri Lankans, there is a need to fully implement the 13th Amendment or consider extending beyond its provisions.

Although Jaffna district Member of Parliament, Sivagnanam Sritharan had told the media on what principles he would lead the struggle for the political rights of the Tamil people after being elected as the leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) – popularly known as the Federal Party – it was expected that he would officially explain his policies after assuming office at the party’s convention that was to be held in Trincomalee last Sunday.

However, the convention was postponed indefinitely due to controversies surrounding selections for other posts, including the post of the General Secretary of the party. So the new leader was unable to deliver that important speech.

After the election of Sritharan by the party’s General Council in a secret ballot at Trincomalee Town Hall on 21 January, the other contender, Member of Parliament, M.A. Sumanthiran had publicly announced that he would cooperate with the new leader.

“We intend to take additional strikes, and additional action, to continue to send a clear message that the United States will respond when our forces are attacked, when our people are killed,” White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC’s “Meet the Press” program on Sunday.

The strikes are the latest blows in a conflict that has spread into the Middle East since Oct. 7, when the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed Israel from the Gaza Strip, igniting war.

Cardinal Ranjith highlighted the contrasting approaches taken by Singapore and Sri Lanka after independence. While Singapore's leaders prioritized unity and the well-being of all communities, he decried the division sowed by Sri Lankan leadership based on language and religion.

He further praised Singapore's strong legal system and emphasis on discipline, contrasting them with the perceived disregard for law and order in Sri Lanka.

The Cardinal accused the government of self-serving agendas and prioritizing personal gain over the nation's well-being. He questioned the legitimacy of their "independence celebrations" at a time of economic and political turmoil, suggesting that they only celebrate their own freedom, not that of the suffering people.

The legislation which seeks to regulate online content was passed in Parliament, with amendments, on 24 January, amidst objections from opposition politicians and activists who allege the new law will muzzle free speech.

The controversial Bill garnered not only the attention of local activists and organisations, but also that of diplomats and large international organisations, claiming that the Bill had numerous problematic aspects.

### A Letter To Anura Kumara Dissanayake – Spell Out Your Agenda

Today, Sri Lankans are totally fed up with both political parties. Millions of Lankans have finally realized that together the two major parties ran our country to ground while protecting each other when laws were broken, and corruption was evident.

Thank to the contribution of the social media, an angry public who were deprived of the very basic necessities of life rallied together and managed to chase away a president who mismanaged the country, a historic first in our beloved island.

Two of his catastrophic decisions were giving a tax to the tune of around Rs 600 billion without figuring out how to pay for it (now RW has made the people pay for it with increased taxes) and later opting to go for organic fertilizer during a global pandemic thereby ruining the only healthy sector of our economy which was agriculture. Had Gota not been given the huge tax cut he might have had the money to buy chemical fertilizer.

If the National Conference is held according to the choice, then the next step is to take the formula of 'Sridharan and Sumanthiran General Secretary', which Sumanthiran has proposed.

If that is the case, it is sure to lose the North and East face, which has a traditional political party, the Tamil National Party. Therefore, the party will continue the truth test without giving up

### Yukuthiya & The Perils Of Overkill

The term overkill means “excessive, or more than necessary.” The current “Yukthiya” is an excellent example, but not the only one of several such, relating to recent happenings. A justifiable query is why such actions, so obviously necessary, possible and long overdue, have not already been executed. Is the inaction deliberate? Has it awaited this chance, to create an image of heroic efficiency? It could also suggest an awakening from a long slumber, now mixed with an element of theatre.

There are several instances of the use of overkill to guarantee failure. There have also been examples where this “all or nothing” approach has created drastic ill-effects.

### Of Elections, Bond Scams & Money Politics: The Anatomy Of Default @75

With the wisdom of hindsight, the Root Causes of Sri Lanka’s first Sovereign Default, staged three years ago on the eve of 75 years of ‘Independence’ from the British Raj are clearly discernible.

Back in March 2021 when the default happened there was too much Aragalaya hype and confusion to discern the deep structures, transnational financial networks, and vested interests (including members of the Lankan Diaspora) embedded in the debt pile up. Amid protests at soaring cost of living, the claim was that Sri Lanka, South Asia’s wealthiest country with the best human and social development indicators in the region was “bankrupt” because it lacked exorbitantly privileged US dollars to buy food and fuel. This was after the shadowy off-shore Hamilton Reserve Bank had filed a case in the New York courts against the country for non-payment of a small amount of interest owned.

### What is the line?

These arguments often notice the key role in financing to essential public services such as health, education, infrastructure and social security nets.. To ensure adequate funds for public services and balance the need for economic growth, Sri Lanka and many countries are facing a complex challenge.

Of course, there are arguments against taxation. Some argue that taxes are high and they are free of economic growth. Others argue that the taxes are unfair and that they are burdened with proportions for the poor.

The debate on taxation will continue for many more years. However, one is clearly. Taxes are essential in any modern society, and they play an important role in financing the public goods and services we all believe in.

### Ceremonial Security Act: For whom?

In any case, the bill has been passed as most of our MPs voted in favor of the deepest and widths of the status law.. The law has come into effect with the similarity of the Speaker. So people need to understand this reality and act very carefully.

What is important here is that the issue in Sri Lanka is a law or legalization;Is not about. Its proper implementation is on. Whatever the laws are written, it is not properly implemented. We have repeatedly condemned the law that the law does not go on all.

Therefore, the government should not forget that if the new law is implemented in that way or against freedom of expression, its consequences may not be predicted.
