### EC defends talks with Julie Chung amid criticisms

*2024-05-31 07:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/EC-defends-talks-with-Julie-Chung-amid-criticisms/108-283720) · `en`

Colombo, May 30 (Daily Mirror) - Following severe criticism that US Ambassador Julie Chung had interfered in discussing Sri Lanka’s election process with the Election Commission (EC) officials, the EC chairman R.M.A.L. Rathnayake defended the move saying that the discussion with Chung was a casual one.

He told Daily Mirror that in the discussion that took place on Tuesday (28), Chung had asked if the election would be held during the period from between September 17 and October 16 as officially announced by the EC.

“The focal point of the meeting was to discuss the election process. Besides, plans for elections were also discussed. However, there was nothing serious or influencing discussed during the meeting which lasted only 30 minutes. It was just a courtesy call,” he underscored.

He also noted that the appointment for the meeting was made two weeks ago and it came from the US Embassy.

This follows heavy criticism on social media that the US is influencing Sri Lanka’s internal affairs.

Notorious underworld figure and drug trafficker Ruwan Jayasekara, alias “Midigama Ruwan”, has been brought back to Sri Lanka from Dubai by a team of offices from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) today, Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said.

In March, it had been reported that “Midigama Ruwan” had been arrested by the Dubai Police, based on a Interpol warrant, and that he would likely be extradited back to Sri Lanka.

He is considered to be one of the two people who had led Harak Kata’s drug network after the latter’s arrest in Madagascar and extradition to Sri Lanka. He is also said to have planned an attack on the CID head office in Colombo to free drug trafficker Nadun Chinthaka alias ‘Harak Kata’, which was ultimately foiled.

Colonel Nalin Herath, the Defence Ministry Spokesman, dismissed the claims as false, stating that there is no validity to the reports.

However, he acknowledged the presence of ammunition which has passed its shelf life being stored in military-owned warehouses in the country.

Colonel Herath clarified that “these stocks do not belong to the Ministry of Defence but to a foreign private company, which has been instructed to promptly remove or destroy the surplus ammunitions due to security concerns.

(AP) — Donald Trump became the first former American president to be convicted of felony crimes Thursday as a New York jury found him guilty of all 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex.

Trump sat stone-faced while the verdict was read as cheering from the street below could be heard in the hallway on the courthouse’s 15th floor where the decision was revealed after more than nine hours of deliberations.

“This was a rigged, disgraceful trial,” an angry Trump told reporters after leaving the courtroom. “The real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people. They know what happened, and everyone knows what happened here.”

Judge Juan Merchan set sentencing for July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where GOP leaders, who remained resolute in their support in the aftermath of the verdict, are expected to formally make him their nominee.

### International spotlight on presidential election

Colombo, May 31 (Daily Mirror) - The International spotlight is already cast on the conduct of the upcoming presidential election in Sri Lanka with the European Union already deploying its experts for a pre-election assessment of the ground situation, an official said yesterday.

Election observers are usually deployed to monitor national elections in Sri Lanka. They also carry out pre-poll assessments to ascertain whether a free and fair electoral process is ensured in the country.

However, it assumes special significance this year because Sri Lanka is going to implement the Campaign Finance Act to monitor electoral expenses of candidates for the first time.

The implementation of the new law was also a recommendation by the EU experts who monitored elections in Sri Lanka in the past.

Election Commission’s Chairman R. M. A. L. Ratnayake confirmed that the EU delegation met with him.

### Donald Trump convicted 34 times in first for ex-US president

ECONOMYNEXT – Former US President Donald Trump has been convicted by the jury for falsifying business records in a case linked to paying off a former porn star.

Trump is expected to be sentenced on July 11 but Trumps lawyers are also expected to appeal the decision.

Trump slammed the judge as ‘corrupt’ and claimed he was a ‘very innocent man’ after the jury delivered the verdict.

The trial should have been held in a different location where there were more Republicans instead of the New York, where he did not win, he said.

However many Trump businesses had been based for years in New York.

Reporters in the courtroom said the jury was widely expected to go home for the day for further deliberations and those present were ‘stunned’ by the verdict that came at the end of the day.

Trump’s fund-raising website crashed in what the Republican activists said was a rush by his supporters to donate.

Trump is also facing trials for inciting a ‘riot’ in Washington. (Colombo/May31/2024)

### Vesak at the United Nations: Still not a UN holiday?

Vesak Day almsgiving hosted at Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka in New York

IDN-InDepthNews: Sri Lanka celebrated Vesak Day 2024 last week with much pomp and ceremony in historic Matale where the Buddha’s teachings were first formally documented in the first century B.C. at the Aluviharaya Rock Temple and religious observances took place in almost every temple in the country. Prior to that, the Master’s teachings had been transmitted orally from teacher to pupil.

Vesak is the premier religious festival in Sri Lanka, commemorating the birth, enlightenment and the passing of the Buddha, with colourful electrically lit decorations illuminating private homes and main streets and alms being offered to all passers-by along main roads.

In New York, the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka co-hosted an impressive event at the United Nations with Thailand to observe the United Nations Day of Vesak. Many other Sri Lankan missions around the world did the same.

### Governance all the way down

*2024-05-31 05:42:12* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Governance-all-the-way-down/4-762402) · `en`

Multiple modalities of State intervention—from regulation to planning, stimulus to welfare—have all been collapsed into each other and displaced by the insipid term of governance

Given the comprador mentality that pervades thinking about the burgeoning crisis of development and possible solutions for poor countries, there has been far less scrutiny of the vague claim that governance is the problem. How many people in the US establishment would now argue, for example, that free trade is an unassailable good? In contrast, when it comes to financing for development, myth quickly replaces evidence in determining which solutions are taken seriously, and which are dismissed. The choice often has nothing to do with reason. Instead, as Doyle implied, it has everything to do with interests and how creditor expectations are currently formed. And in this moment, it is austerity that is the primary vehicle of extraction

Ambassadorial aspirants hardly break a sweat when drafting submissions to the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, not even in pre-ChatGPT days. They’ve been in the business of US diplomacy long enough to know what ‘US Foreign Policy’ is. They know what the listers want to hear. They have templates to choose from. And therefore the opening statement made on May 9, 2024 to the Committee by Elizabeth K Horst, nominee to be the US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, is more or less par for the course. A parenthesis is called for here.

### A Glint In The Eyes Of Votaries Of BJP – 2024 Encounter

An absolute majority in Lok Sabha held the prospect of a third consecutive term for the BJP in 2024. A remarkable stretch of achievements nationally and internationally, swung increasing support for the incumbent government. Conversely, the opposition unable to bring its act together, was losing its confidence by the day. An ill-knit coalition fragmented even in the course of the elections. Before elections concluded, the coalition was in shambles.

The Four-State elections giving a stunning victory to the BJP recently, launched it into the trajectory of victory. The election year 2023 – 2024 pitched but ever-increasing confidence in the BJP. The opposition fragments were driven into an unholy alliance, which started disintegrating from the beginning. To see an overwhelming victory, BJP has only four more days.

Whichever way Sri Lanka chooses to go, will ultimately be determined by its core values

Sri Lanka, since independence has been on a road that was not quite destined to reach a destination. Then, after almost 30 years of independence, with light to moderate progress, the economy underwent a radical change in 1977. We were told that this would make Sri Lanka a developed country in a short time span.

Things did not work out as expected and the next four and a half decades brought us to bankruptcy. There is not much purpose in blaming others, when we ourselves were to blame.

What is clear is that there was a huge thinking deficit on our part, as we believed all the West was saying and advising about development and how we should be getting about it.
