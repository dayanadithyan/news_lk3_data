### Poverty and homelessness stare elders in the face - EDITORIAL

*2024-06-10 01:22:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Poverty-and-homelessness-stare-elders-in-the-face-EDITORIAL/172-284470) · `en`

Not many decades ago, our country was held up worldwide for its welfare state policies. Today, unfortunately, such praises are but a distant dream. Poverty rules the day-to-day life for a large number of our citizens.

Yet none of the political parties who are now canvassing for our vote, have come out with a single concrete proposal of how they intend to get this country out of its present dilemma.

In these columns, we have highlighted times out of number, the huge difference between the average wage and the cost a family of four needs to bear if they are to have two square meals a day. That cost amounted to over rupees one hundred thousand a month!

On the tea and rubber plantations -until the president recently forced owners to pay workers Rs. 1,700 per day workers were paid less than Rs. 1,000 per day. Daily paid or casual workers elsewhere in the country who form a majority of the country’s workforce receive less than Rs. 55,000 per month.

Ukrainians fire at Russian forces in Donetsk province, a target of Russia’s current, narrowed offensive

Social media is agog with fears over a looming Third World War. According to the centre-right Daily Telegraph of the UK, it has already started.

According to this view, military action in Ukraine and Gaza is only a small part of a global war in which propaganda, influence buying, trade wars and misinformation are weapons as deadly as any conventional or nuclear arsenal.

But, before we examine this theory in more detail, it’s noteworthy that Third World War scares are hardly new. They have been there almost since the day the Second World War ended.

One could very well describe the Cold War between the West (the US and its NATO allies) and the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc satellites as war by other means – both sides vying to outdo each other with misinformation, propaganda and influence buying and trying to bully the other side into submission.

The 73-year-old popular but polarizing leader is only the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to retain power for a third five-year term.

His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which won by landslides in 2014 and 2019, failed to secure a majority to govern on its own in the latest national election. However, Modi’s National Democratic Alliance coalition won enough seats to form a government, with him at the helm.

This is the first time the BJP under Modi has needed support from its regional allies to form a government after a decade of commanding the majority in Parliament.

Lord Buddha, elaborating on the notion of sorrow (dukkha) in the first sermon he delivered after attaining Enlightenment, observed that having to associate with those who are repugnant is sorrowful and being apart from those who are loved is also sorrowful — appiyehi sampayogo dukkho, piyehi vippayogo dukkho. So, we choose to avoid and insulate ourselves from the distasteful while we seek the company of people we find agreeable. When they leave, we are saddened. When they depart, never to return, we are distraught.

A few days ago, I realised that while any kind of separation from someone who is likeable is never a happy thing, there are instances when it is devastating. I had just received a text from my friend Prof Arjuna De Silva, and he wanted to know ‘if the story about Dr Siri was true.’ I called two of Dr Siri’s closest friends, Ranjith Page and Dr Harindu. Both confirmed that he had passed away in Dubai. I am shocked and saddened beyond belief.

### Sri Lanka central bank avoids negative equity with imputed values for restructured bonds

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s central bank has used an imputed valuation of its re-structured government securities, to get over lack of a market price, which may have allowed it to avoid negative net assets and even bigger losses in 2023.

The central bank reported losses 114.3 billion rupees in 2023, solely due to a 766 billion rupee ‘one day loss’ from restructuring its Treasury bill portfolio into long term bonds with ‘step down’ coupons.

The Treasuries portfolio, acquired to drive monetary instability from 2020, initially gave it high profits as rates went up to correct balance of payment deficits.

Related Sri Lanka’s central bank makes more than Rs500bn in profits to June 2023: analysis

Unlike in 2022, when a currency collapse led to losses on its foreign assets portfolio, which was negative due to swaps not being outlawed by the legislature, foreign currency income was a positive 83 billion rupees, compared to a loss of 778 billion in 2022.
