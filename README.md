### If the president comes to an end to solve the problems of the minority people - Parliamentarian Govindan Karunagaram is ready to negotiate with him

*2024-05-27 14:02:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/184599) · `ta`

Govindan Karunagaram, a Batticaloa district parliamentarian, expressed readiness to negotiate with the president for economic recovery, emphasizing consideration for minority issues. He spoke at the 25th Anniversary Celebration of the Vinayaka Sports Club, highlighting the need for addressing minority problems. The People's Alliance (PA) faces challenges in nominating a presidential candidate due to past political dynamics, but potential opportunities exist for candidates supporting the PA, especially with the possibility of multiple contestants in the upcoming presidential election. This could allow any candidate to secure over 50% of the Sinhalese vote, potentially uniting Tamil Muslims and hill country people as a formidable force.

🟩

Batticaloa district parliamentarian Govindan Karunagaram (Jana) said that if the country is to be economically recovered, we are ready to talk to them if the president will consider the minority people and examine their problems.

The 25th Anniversary Celebration of the Vinayaka Sports Club of Batticaloa was held on Sunday evening (26) evening. He was speaking to the media after attending the event.

The PA is not in a position to field a presidential candidate at present. The people of this country are not prepared to support the PA and make their candidate win. This is because former President Gotabhaya Rajapakse, who made 69 lakhs of votes, chased him away in the last two years of the last period of 2019.. That situation is still from the Sinhalese.

“But if it’s held after the presidential election, they will be wiped out. They have understood this politically. That’s why they want the parliamentary elections first, so they can get at least 25 seats,” Rahuman said speaking to reporters.

However, government spokesmen continue to be emphatic that a presidential election will be held first. Wickremesinghe himself had said on several occasions, as recently as this week, that parliamentary elections will be held after.

ECONOMYNEXT — The ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuan (SLPP) wants parliamentary elections first to prevent a wipe-out, main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Mujibur Rahuman said.

The MP claimed that the SLPP has strategically considered the possibility that President Ranil Wickremesinghe will not win the presidential election scheduled for this year, which is why they are in a hurry to hold the parliamentary polls before.
