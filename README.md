*2024-03-13 17:42:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/194470) · `si`

It seems like you've shared a comprehensive overview of various economic, social, and political issues facing Sri Lanka, including the impact of foreign debt, the need for economic recovery programs, challenges in the education sector, issues related to self-employment and entrepreneurship, nutritional support for athletes, and the broader economic landscape. This is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a nuanced approach to address.



Given the breadth of the topics you've covered, it's clear that addressing these issues will require a multi-pronged strategy that includes:



1. **Economic Recovery and Stabilization**: Implementing programs that directly support the economy, such as providing financial relief to low-income households, investing in infrastructure, and promoting self-employment and entrepreneurship. This could involve measures like providing bank loans to self-employed individuals, especially those in the tourism sector, which is already showing signs of improvement.



2. **Education and Skills Development**: Addressing the challenges in the education sector, including the recruitment of teachers and the provision of adequate resources for students. This could involve implementing programs to recruit scholars in the teaching profession and ensuring that educational institutions in remote areas have the necessary facilities and resources.



3. **Health and Nutrition**: Ensuring that athletes and other individuals have access to proper nutrition and healthcare. This includes providing medical advice, necessary clothing, and increasing training places. The government's role in supporting the nutritional status of school players and athletes is crucial.



4. **Digital Economy and Infrastructure**: Moving towards a digital economy and improving infrastructure, especially in rural areas. This involves leveraging modern technology to enhance the development of the country and ensuring that the benefits of digital transformation are accessible to all.



5. **Addressing Corruption and Economic Mismanagement**: Taking steps to eliminate corruption and address past economic mismanagement. This includes implementing laws to prevent future instances of cheating and establishing an independent commission to investigate and prosecute those involved in corruption.



6. **Promoting Industries and Entrepreneurship**: Supporting industries like film art and tourism, which have the potential to contribute significantly to the economy. This involves providing incentives and protecting these industries from external threats.



7. **Addressing Tax and Price Issues**: Addressing the concerns related to high taxes on essential items like sanitary towels and the devaluation of the rupee. This requires a careful balance between revenue generation and ensuring affordability for essential goods and services.



In conclusion, addressing the economic and social challenges facing Sri Lanka requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that considers the interconnectedness of these issues. It's crucial to involve various stakeholders, including the private sector, in developing and implementing these strategies to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth.

Putin, speaking just days before a March 15-17 election which is certain to give him another six years in power, said the nuclear war scenario was not “rushing” up and he saw no need for the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

The National People's Power (NPP) warns against the sale of state assets, including SriLankan Airlines, Telecom, CEB, and Litro Gas, arguing the government lacks authority and should stop for the sake of future generations.

🟩

The National People's Power (NPP), which urged the government to stop the sale of state assets following the national election, yesterday warned that the government would take appropriate action on such activities during the National People's Power in the future.

NPP Economic Council member Sunil Handunnetti said at a media briefing that the government would not be selected in the next election, such as SriLankan Airlines, Telecom, CEB and Litro Gas.

He said the government does not have the authority to sell state resources, state agencies or corporations and that the government should stop selling such assets in order to obtain a huge brokerage.

Handunnethi said that the people should come forward against any action to sell state resources that affect future generations, and that any interested parties like China or India will review the decision and that the government of the national people's power in the future will decide against such agreements.

March 12 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump both clinched their parties' nomination on Tuesday, kicking off the first U.S. presidential election rematch in nearly 70 years.

Biden needed 1,968 delegates to win the nomination, and he passed that number on Tuesday night as results began to come in from the primary contest in Georgia, Edison Research said. Results were also coming in from Mississippi, Washington state, the Northern Mariana Islands and Democrats living abroad.

Hours later, Trump clinched the 1,215 delegates required to secure the Republican presidential nomination as four states held contests, including Georgia, the battleground where Trump faces criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the state's 2020 results. There were 161 delegates at stake on Tuesday in Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington state.
