It will be interesting to make an assessment of what Sri Lankan leaders have been demonstrating vis a vis the ideals and objectives of the World Economic Forum

Sri Lankans need to be told the truth by all political parties. Their credibility will hinge on this.

It is that the country is in debt to the hilt, its current GDP growth would not allow it to repay the debts, and if they are not honoured, the country will not be able to borrow any more even for development work, let alone for consumption

The Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum for the year 2024 is held from 15-19 January in Davos, Switzerland, under the theme ‘Rebuilding Trust’. It aims to restore collective agency, and reinforce the fundamental principles of transparency, consistency, and accountability among leaders.

No law abiding person who wants a country free of crimes and the drug menace would belittle or discourage a campaign launched by the authorities to accomplish that purpose. In the same breath, on the very ground of being a law-abiding person, he/she would not like to see the campaign tarnished by possible or apparent personal agendas of anyone or any group and the highhanded activities of the personnel on the ground.

### The Contribution of Siam and Burma to Buddhism in Sri Lanka

*2024-01-30 00:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/The-Contribution-of-Siam-and-Burma-to-Buddhism-in-Sri-Lanka/172-275930) · `en`

It is well known that monks from Siam and Burma (as Thailand and Myanmar were called earlier) helped stem a decline in the practice of Buddhism, and contributed to its democratization in Sri Lanka during certain periods in the island’s history.

The circumstances which necessitated help from Siam and Burma, the process of securing such help, the role of the Dutch in it, and the  results of foreign involvement are vividly described by Auckland University sociologist Kitsiri Malalgoda in his book Buddhism in Sinhalese Society 1750-1900 (Tambapanni Academic Publishers, Colombo, 2023).

*2024-01-29 22:46:22* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-crisis-of-confidence/4-757888) · `en`

The hills are alive in Davos, with the sounds of failure. Conversations used to be about taking advantage of the global playing field that US presidents and their allies were seeking to build after World War II and after the end of the Cold War. Companies now, and countries themselves, are seeking to understand how to ameliorate the risks of a new, emerging, seemingly chaotic world order.

Yes, it was recently that time of year, as corporate chieftains, policy makers, NGO “warriors”, so-called journalists and self-styled intellectuals went invading the Swiss Alps for the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. Their anthem was “rebuilding trust.” After devastating trust on so many fronts this was a bold aspiration.

The Sri Lankan government’s proposed law to create another body to investigate wartime abuses replicates previous failed efforts, ignores the needs of victims, and falls far short of meeting Sri Lanka’s international legal obligations, Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday (29 Jan.).

In a statement, the Human Rights Watch claimed that “Sri Lankan authorities continue to silence and repress families of victims and their communities 15 years after the armed conflict ended”.

The Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka Bill was published on January 1, 2024, following limited consultations in 2023 and government pledges to investigate human rights violations and war crimes committed during the 1983-2009 civil war with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and in its aftermath.

The allegations against staffers with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees prompted Western countries to freeze funds vital for the body, which is a lifeline for desperate Palestinians in Gaza. The U.N. fired nine of the 12 accused workers and condemned “the abhorrent alleged acts” of staff members.

The accusations come after years of tensions between Israel and the agency known as UNRWA over its work in Gaza, where it employs roughly 13,000 people.

Social networking companies, Google and Yahoo should be able to think about what it will happen to Sri Lanka from providing service to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is like China.

So young people should come forward to voice their voice against this. In the future, the younger generation will suffer greatly. The law is already in effect in the country regarding social websites. So there is no need to implement any new laws.

Those arrested for allegedly reproaching religions including Buddhist Buddha are madmen. So it is a matter of not necessarily the mainstream of the main media. All of this is a drama that is being staged in the government's plan.

There is no truth to say that indirect taxes go rise. When the demand is increased, the supply of goods will be effective when the supply is reduced.

We will charge a real estate tax in 2025. It's a very progressive step. Hope to charge a specific tax from those who have very high property.

### ICJ to rule on jurisdiction in Russia-Ukraine genocide case

The United Nations’ highest court will rule on Friday whether it will hear a case in which Ukraine has accused Russia of violating international law by saying its invasion was launched to stop an alleged genocide.

Ukraine brought the case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, days after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

In hearings in September, lawyers for Moscow urged judges to throw out the case, saying Kyiv’s legal arguments were flawed. The ICJ on Monday said a ruling on Russia’s objections to the court’s jurisdiction will be handed down on Friday.

Kyiv says Russia is breaching the 1948 Genocide Convention by saying the invasion was justified to stop an alleged genocide of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine says there was no risk of genocide in eastern Ukraine, where it had been fighting Russian-backed forces since 2014.

### Whispering Mountains; Revealing An Open Secret

The fact that even though eyes are ours, we are supposed to see what is painted by them, has been reaffirmed by events recently occurred in Sri Lanka. When we see beyond it, we are at the risk of losing even our lives. This is an idea that I have to always tell myself once I see how hard and tactfully the rulers of this country are trying to paint that picture to be seen and praised by us as citizens.

A good film, in my opinion, should be a combination of 50% from reality and another 50% from the imagination. When it’s closer to reality, it’s called a documentary, when it’s closer to the imagination, it’s called fiction. The film “Whispering Mountains” has made that platform where we can build our own imagination and criticism based on reality, as it keeps a good balance between reality and imagination.
