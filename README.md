I was born at the very end of the nineteenth century and in my eightieth year I can look back on the careers of some of the prominent minority leaders about whom I shall say something in this article.

The names that come to mind include the brothers Ponnambalam Ramanathan and Ponnambalam Arunachalam and their kinsmen, Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy and Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy. They came from the same highly educated and successful families of Jaffna.

Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan had held the office of Solicitor-General under British rule and often acted as Attorney-General, a post reserved for officers recruited from abroad. He was a polished speaker, though in his old age he was inclined to be somewhat long-winded.

Now that the presidential election is round the corner and would be followed by a general election, the majority of law-abiding, patriotic, selfless and non-partisan people would want many changes in the system to bring this country back to where it was in the early nineteen fifties.

The first thing many are clamoring for is to abolish the executive presidency. This office has been a bane rather than a boon to this country and its people. It has only helped to enrich some who achieved this position. As we can remember, there were many previous occupants of this office who promised abolish it if they were elected, but reneged on their promise.

The powers attached to the executive presidency have been misused even by those with a good educational background and we have seen how the prerogative of the presidential pardon had been utilized to pardon murderers, drug dealers, child rapists, etc.

### Israel and Hezbollah in major missile exchange as escalation fears grow

Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel early on Sunday, as Israel’s military said it struck Lebanon with around 100 jets to thwart a larger attack, in one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare.

Missiles were visible curling up through the dawn sky, dark vapour trails behind them, as an air raid siren sounded in Israel and a distant blast lit the horizon, while smoke rose over houses in Khiam in southern Lebanon.

On Sunday evening, sirens sounded in Rishon Letsiyon, central Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said, and added that one projectile had been identified crossing from the southern Gaza Strip and falling in an open area. The armed wing of Hamas said it had fired an “M90” rocket at Tel Aviv.

Any major spillover in the fighting, which began in parallel with the war in Gaza, risks morphing into a regional conflagration drawing in Hezbollah’s backer Iran and Israel’s main ally the United States.
