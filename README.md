The role of the JVP in Sri Lanka‚Äôs political unrest: A historical and analytical perspective

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), or the People‚Äôs Liberation Front, played a pivotal role in the political upheavals in Sri Lanka during the 1970s and late 1980s. Their violent uprisings were born out of discontent with the Government‚Äôs handling of the economy and social issues, especially during the reign of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike in the 1970s. The extreme measures taken by the JVP in their quest for revolutionary change left a lasting impact on the nation‚Äôs political and social fabric.

The economy will be the key issue for voters in Sri Lanka‚Äôs upcoming presidential election, set against a backdrop of geopolitical rivalry

When Sri Lanka heads to the polls on 21 September in the country‚Äôs first presidential election since its 2022 economic meltdown, the economy will be the key issue for voters. The election will serve as a referendum on the difficult austerity measures imposed on the country‚Äôs road to recovery.

Sri Lanka underwent a sovereign default in April 2022 as its foreign exchange reserves ran out and public debt stood at more than $83 billion, half of which was owed to foreign creditors. Soaring inflation at close to 70 per cent and commodity shortages triggered large-scale unrest that ultimately unseated President Gotabaya Rajapaksa from power.

In 2023, the government of Interim President Ranil Wickremesinghe secured a $2.9 billion bailout from the IMF ‚Äì the 17th in the country‚Äôs history.

AP: Whoever Sri Lanka‚Äôs next president is, Muthuthevarkittan Manohari isn‚Äôt expecting much to change in her daily struggle to feed the four children and elderly mother with whom she lives in a dilapidated room in a tea plantation.

Both leading candidates in Saturday‚Äôs presidential election are promising to give land to the country‚Äôs hundreds of thousands of plantation workers, but Manohari says she‚Äôs heard it all before. Sri Lanka‚Äôs plantation workers are a long-marginalised group who frequently live in dire poverty, but they can swing elections by voting as a bloc.

Mahohari and her family are descended from Indian indentured labourers who were brought in by the British during colonial rule to work on plantations that grew first coffee, and later tea and rubber. Those crops are still Sri Lanka‚Äôs leading foreign exchange earners.

### The path ahead after the poll

Vote wisely, and well then, with an eye on the general elections to follow ‚Äì Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

A radical point has been made often enough: It is an election like no other in our nation‚Äôs history.

On one hand, the first election since the flaring up and fading away of the Aragalaya. So Sri Lanka‚Äôs most vocal demographic‚Äôs premier opportunity to press the case again. There is so much at stake for all those representative stakeholders who agitated for ‚Äòsystem change‚Äô.

On the other hand, one last stand for the traditional parties who are an entrenched part of the system to fight to retain their bastions of influence and privilege. For them too, those powerful elites who have enjoyed state capture at the expense of the poor, average citizens and others marginalised in many ways, so much is at stake...

Today there is no time to think too much. There was a time for that, and it was all our yesterdays leading up to that box inside this polling booth.

As the Presidential election campaign draws to a close, the focus must shift from electoral competition to the urgent challenges facing the country. While the election outcome remains uncertain, what is clear is that the next President will inherit a country grappling with economic instability and deep-rooted problems of impunity and corruption. A pressing challenge that also needs to be at the forefront of the Government that is formed is the need to resolve the long-standing ethnic conflict through a sustainable political solution based on the devolution of power. The new President must prioritise this issue to bring lasting peace and unity to the country.
