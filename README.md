*2024-04-01 12:23:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/195167) · `si`

මෙම වසරේදී ජනාධිපතිවරණය පැවැත්වීම සදහා මුලික කටයුතු මේ වනවිටත් සුදානම් කර අවසන් බව ජාතික මැතිවරණ කොමිසම පවසයි.

ඒ අතර රජයේ අභ්‍යන්තර ආරංචි මාර්ග පවසන්නේ ජාත්‍යන්තර මූල්‍ය අරමුදලේ ණය ප්‍රතිව්‍යුහගතකරණ වැඩසටහන ජූලි මාසයේ අග වන තෙක් ක්‍රියාත්මක වන බැවින් ඊට පෙර කිසිදු මැතිවරණයක් නොපැවැත්වෙනු ඇතැයි ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා කැබිනට් මණ්ඩලයට සහ මැතිවරණ කොමිසමට දැනුම්දුන් බවයි.

මෙම වසරේදී ව්‍යවස්ථානුකූලව ජනාධිපතිවරණය පැවැත්විය යුතු වන අතර එළැඹෙන සැප්තැම්බර් අග හෝ ඔක්තෝබර් මුලදී එය පැවැත්වෙනු ඇතැයි වාර්තා විය.

මැතිවරණ කොමිසමේ සාමාජිකයකු ප්‍රකාශ කළේ ජනාධිපතිවරණය සදහා රුපියල් කෝටි දහසක මුදලක් පසුගිය අයවැයෙන් වෙන්කර ඇති අතර මැතිවරණය පැවැත්වීම සඳහා සිදුකෙරෙන කටයුතු පිළිබඳ සියලු සහකාර මැතිවරණ කොමසාරිස්වරුන් දැනුවත් කර ඇති බවයි.

කෙසේ වෙතත් ජනාධිපතිවරණයට පෙර මහ මැතිවරණයක් පවත්වන ලෙස ශ්‍රී ලංකා පොදුජන පෙරමුණ ජනපතිවරයාගෙන් ඉල්ලා තිබූ අතර එසේ පවත්වන්නේ නම් මහ මැතිවරණය අගෝස්තු මාසයට පෙර පැවැත්විය යුතු වෙයි.

### Sri Lankan saves Melbourne woman from romance scam

A Melbourne woman has been saved from sending thousands of dollars to her sick overseas “boyfriend” after being caught up in a romance scam.

The woman, aged in her 60s, went to a NAB branch in Cranbourne, in Melbourne’s southeast in February, wanting to deposit $2,000 into an account to help her boyfriend, whom she met on social media.

She said her boyfriend, who was living in Turkey, was sick and needed the money to fly to the UK for treatment. But his account had apparently been frozen.

“He told her to instead send the money to his friend in Sydney who could then transfer him the money,” NAB Customer Advisor, Dilan Pathirannahalage said in a statement.

However, alarm bells quickly went off for Mr Pathirannahalage when the woman wasn’t able to provide the recipient’s surname.

“The reason she didn’t know who she was transferring the funds to was because she had never met the person on the other end of the line who she thought was her boyfriend, and so didn’t know their friends either.”

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that new details on the Katchatheevu island issue “have unmasked DMK’s (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) double standards totally”. His remarks came a day after he attacked the Congress over its decision to hand over the strategic island to Sri Lanka in the 1970s.

In a post on X, the Prime Minister said, “Rhetoric aside, DMK has done NOTHING to safeguard Tamil Nadu’s interests. New details emerging on #Katchatheevu have UNMASKED the DMK’s double standards totally.”

“Congress and DMK are family units. They only care that their own sons and daughters rise. They don’t care for anyone else. Their callousness on Katchatheevu has harmed the interests of our poor fishermen and fisherwomen in particular,” he added.

Katchatheevu island is where fishermen from Tamil Nadu go to fish. But they are detained by the Sri Lankan Navy as soon as they cross the International Maritime Border Line (IMBL) to reach the island.

### CBSL salary hike: Is it the Governor who is responsible?

*2024-04-01 02:22:40* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/CBSL-salary-hike-Is-it-the-Governor-who-is-responsible/14-760146) · `en`

CBSL governing board (from left): Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Nihal Fonseka, Dr. Ravi Rathnayake, Anushka Wijesinha, Vish Govindasamy, Rajeev Amarasuriya, Manil Jayesinghe

Not only the rule of law but the spirit of the law is vital during a crisis

The last few weeks have seen a massive media interest and public attention on the salary hikes amounting up to 70% at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) at a time of an economic downfall in the country. I welcome the recommendations made by the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) at the Parliament and the acceptance of the recommendations by the CBSL governor and the staff to re-visit and reverse the proposed increase in the national interest.

There is a clear attempt to target the Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, and make him the scapegoat for the proposed increases. This in my view is politically motivated by many who were responsible for the economic downfall of the country.

### DDR for Sri Lanka and SLR for CBSL:  CB Governor’s rationale is puerile

*2024-04-01 02:19:05* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/DDR-for-Sri-Lanka-and-SLR-for-CBSL-CB-Governor-s-rationale-is-puerile/14-760145) · `en`

Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe having made the blunder of unilaterally deciding to grant a phenomenal and unprecedented increase in the emoluments for the Central Bank (CB) staffers has further aggravated the issue by citing that for some employees the take home salary will be negative if the revised salary is not granted.

I would like the CB Governor to elaborate as to how the take home salary will be negative because of the loan given to the staff? It is normal that when an employer grants a loan to an employee, the loan amount is such that it is recovered in instalments over a period of time whilst the employee at the same time gets a reduced amount of take home pay (because of the deduction of the loan).

For the take home pay to be negative, I think that the Governor has made an additional blunder having given a colossal sum as loan which if it is to be recovered, within a short period of time, from the salary will make the take home salary negative!

### Why elections for Presidency all political parties have promised to abolish?

*2024-04-01 02:07:15* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-elections-for-Presidency-all-political-parties-have-promised-to-abolish/4-760144) · `en`

None in mainstream politics would lead this country on a right path to freedom, democracy and an inclusive society with socio-economic and cultural development. These political leaderships simply have no valid “development program” to back their criticism of the past and the present and their request for political power at the next “presidential” election. A larger crisis therefore is the timidity of the educated urban polity that has access to new information, new knowledge and new social discourses beyond geographical boundaries

President Ranil Wickremesinghe is reported to have told the cabinet of ministers, priority has to be given to the IMF program to ensure economic stability and elections will have to be postponed till the IMF program is concluded. One newspaper report had it, the President had in fact informed the Election Commission too about postponing elections.

### What is wrong with Sri Lanka?

*2024-04-01 01:56:25* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-is-wrong-with-Sri-Lanka/4-760143) · `en`

It is not the country per se, but the politicians and the people who are wrong. While politicians should take 70% responsibility, the people also should take the rest or 30%. It is true that these wrongs on the part of the politicians or the people are not limited to Sri Lanka. Even in a country like Australia where I now live, there are intermittent corruption, crime, gender abuse, killing, and misguided politics. However, the difference is extremely vast. Sri Lanka’s wrongs are perhaps 50 times higher than a country like Australia.

### I am not responsible for the rejection of Maithri - He must take responsibility for the fall of the SK - State Minister Lasantha Alagavanna

*2024-04-01 01:37:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/180099) · `ta`

He defends his decision to step down as treasurer, accusing allegations of improper establishment. Alagavanna highlights the inability of the SLFP to join the leadership council, attributing this to the coalition's members. He aims to unite the party and other parties, criticizing the decision-making process at a special meeting. Alagavanna also addresses the law and the actions of former President Maithripala Sirisena, who voted against the law.

🟩

Parties that are members of the PA refusing to accept Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) leader Maithripala Sirisena. Minister of State Lasantha Alagiyavanna said that it cannot be accepted by me.

He further stated at a press conference held in Colombo on Saturday (30).

I have removed me from the position of treasure. The allegation against me is that it is not properly taken up to establish the PA. But this alliance has already been established.

However, all parties that are members of this coalition indicate that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) leader Maithripala Sirisena cannot be joined by the leadership council.. I can't do anything for this.

I am trying to unite the party, leadership and other parties. In our party, the Political Council Central Executive Committee and the Executive Committee. A special meeting was called. Such a decision cannot be made in any way at a special meeting.
