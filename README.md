Postponing the presidential election could benefit the entire nation, especially the Tamil community, by preventing a scenario where no candidate secures over 50% of the vote, which might lead to political instability and worsen the existing economic crisis. This move would also avoid significant electoral expenses that could further strain the economy.

Parliamentarian C says that the presidential election is beneficial to the Tamil people. V.. Wigneswaran said.

“The postponement of the presidential election is beneficial to the whole country. Especially for the Tamils.

As for this presidential election, no candidate can get more than 50 percent of the votes. So they will try to get the votes of the minority people.

At the same time, when no one gets more than 50 percent of the votes in the presidential election, the political stability in the country will be left.

There are already economic crises in the country. If there is no political stability, the country will face the worst economic setbacks.

In addition, there will be a situation where large funds will be spent on the election. That too will affect the country's economy ”.

Speech made at an event marking the first anniversary of the passing of Mr. Merrill. J. Fernando on July 17

My earliest recollections of Merrill are of his consulting me at the Ratnam Private Hospital when I was a young and energetic surgeon. Although he consulted doctors in Singapore, UK and Australia, he always came back to me for a second opinion. Our friendship grew with mutual admiration for each other’s work.

I did not realize that he had another doctor at home until one day he called me to say that one of his sons has read on the Internet of the side effects of a drug that I had prescribed, and asked me what I thought he should do. I replied “Merrill, it takes 10 to 15 years to become a good doctor but it takes only 10 to 15 seconds to become an Internet doctor”! He roared with laughter. That was the side of Merrill who loved a good joke and even better, a repartee.

Ceylon’s native medicinal practitioners did not all come from a single social class anymore than did her astrologers. I can remember that, in my childhood days, a man named Punchi Rala, who cultivated a paddy field owned by my family, prescribed medicines for the commoner ailments. On the other hand, there was the Veda Menike, a female relative of mine, the daughter of an Adigar, who apart from being a competent ayurvedic doctor, had a good knowledge of Pali and Sanskrit and was at home with ola manuscripts.

Living in Kurunegala town at the beginning of the 20th century, we also had a family doctor who came with his shiny instruments in a buggy cart. There were, as far as I can remember, two motor cars in Kurunegala at the time. Neither the doctor or any member of my family possessed one.

### ARTI or Peradeniya University? – career dilemmas of a young man

*2024-07-21 00:20:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/arti-or-peradeniya-university-career-dilemmas-of-a-young-man/) · `en`

In 1971, after the failed Marxist uprising against the state, the government introduced the rule that anyone applying for a government job should get a report (a ‘chit’) from the local political agent of the government. This rule especially applied to young men and women, as the government distrusted the youth because of their involvement in the insurrection.

Soon after graduating from the University of Peradeniya in 1972, I applied for a vacancy at the Agrarian Research and Training Institute (ARTI) for a research and training officer (rural sociology). I visited the political agent, who lived in Hendala, to get a chit. The agent was an Ayurvedic doctor who was also a justice of the peace and a member of the Town Council (He was known as ‘Member Mahatmaya.’). He cordially received me in the verandah of his small house. He was in a sarong without a shirt or a vest. A heavy leather belt with a large buckle was around his belly over the sarong. A small towel covered his shoulders.

### MY DAYS WITH DR.MARY RUTNAM AND ROBIN RUTNAM

*2024-07-20 22:47:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/my-days-with-dr-mary-rutnam-and-robin-rutnam/) · `en`

For the younger generation that may not know of Dr. Mary H. Rutnam, she was a Canadian missionary doctor, who came to Ceylon on her marriage to a Ceylonese missionary educator, Mr. S.C.K. Rutnam. She was born as Mary Irwin, in Ontario, Canada (1873-1962). She had a medical degree from Canada, but opted to work as a medical missionary in Ceylon. Later, after the mission did not approve of her marriage to a native Ceylonese, she ceased to be a missionary worker and settled into a medical practice in Colombo. Her patients were mainly women, mainly Muslim women who preferred to have a female doctor. Although she was white and foreign-born, it was remarkable that she was able to bypass the white-colonial structure in Ceylon and identify directly with its native people.

### THE FAILURE OF TEACHING RELIGION IN SCHOOLS

*2024-07-20 22:47:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/the-failure-of-teaching-religion-in-schools/) · `en`

To quote. “Religion should be the motor of life, the central heating plant of personality, the faith that gives joy to activity, hope to struggle, dignity to humility and zest to living.” Upliftment is the keynote. Yet Religion has been the cause of the most appalling bloodshed and strife . The most horrendous wars have been fought in the name of religion and rivers of blood have flowed while idiots quarreled over the words of god-like men who must have been appalled by the distortion of their messages to humanity. So let us agree that religion DIVIDES and most certainly does not UNITE.

I am at a loss, therefore, to understand, WHY our Education Planners insist on religion being taught in schools? Religion continues to be a divider even in our little island. In schools that contain pupils of all faiths, students are split up whenever it is time for that period in religion. Language is already a divisive factor yet we purposely add yet another subject to compound the folly.

### UN top court says Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories is illegal

The UN’s top court has said Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories is against international law, in a landmark opinion.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) said Israel should stop settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and end its “illegal” occupation of those areas and the Gaza Strip as soon as possible.

In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the court had made a “decision of lies”.

The court’s advisory opinion is not legally binding but still carries significant political weight. It marks the first time the ICJ has delivered a position on the legality of the 57-year occupation.

The ICJ, based at The Hague in the Netherlands, has been examining the issue since the beginning of last year, at the request of the UN General Assembly.

The court was specifically asked to give its view on Israel’s policies and practices towards the Palestinians, and on the legal status of the occupation.

### The presidential election is good for the Tamil people - CV Vigneswaran

*2024-07-20 16:09:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/188949) · `ta`

CV Vigneswaran argues that postponing the presidential election benefits the Tamil community and the nation as a whole. He highlights potential instability due to no candidate securing over 50% votes, which could exacerbate existing economic crises and lead to significant election-related spending affecting the economy. He calls for unity among parties to advocate for a one-year delay in the election to ensure political stability and economic recovery.

🟩

Parliamentarian CV Wigneswaran says that the postponement of the presidential election is beneficial to the Tamil people.

He said this during a media briefing held in Jaffna today (20).

The postponement of the presidential election is beneficial to the whole country. Especially for the Tamils.

As far as the presidential election is concerned, no one can get more than 50 percent votes. So they will try to get the votes of the minority people.

At the same time, when no one gets more than 50 percent votes in the presidential election, the country will be without political stability.

There are already economic crises in the country. If there is no political stability, the country will face the worst economic setbacks.

In addition, there will be a situation where large funds will be spent on the election. That too will affect the country's economy.

Therefore, all parties should come together and make a demand for a one -year presidential election.
