Colombo, Feb 05 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of former Health Minister and top officials being found to have been embroiled in the import of substandard Immunoglobulin injections, authorities have decided to increase the penalty for the act of supplying or selling substandard medicines, sources said.

Accordingly, the fine has been increased substantially from Rs.100 to Rs.100,000 for individuals found guilty of this offence.

Previously, the fine for offences related to compromising the quality of a specific medicine and deliberately dispensing it from a dispensary was set at a meager Rs. 100.

This adjustment comes as a response to the need for stricter measures to ensure the quality and safety of pharmaceuticals in the country.

The proposal to enhance the fine was put forward by Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapaksha, the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms.

### Independence and Self-Sufficiency: Co-operation in Times of Crisis

For close to a decade and a half I have been studying co-operatives, particularly as I was preoccupied with questions about the post-war reconstruction of Jaffna. As I watched the failure of development policies that prioritised building transport and urban infrastructure over rural livelihoods, supported the proliferation of financial institutions leading to indebtedness, and grand claims about the private sector generating employment that did not materialize, I became more and more involved with the co-operative movement. Drawing on the institutional memory of the co-operative movement and the vast network of co-operatives that survived the war, some of us began to see an alternative for social and economic revival of the still rural war-torn society in the North.

The 76th ‘February 4th’ has passed, marked by four days of aerobatics, consuming considerable aviation fuel and time. This prompts questions about resource usage during such events.

Although Jaffna district Member of Parliament, Sivagnanam Sritharan had told the media on what principles he would lead the struggle for the political rights of the Tamil people after being elected as the leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) – popularly known as the Federal Party – it was expected that he would officially explain his policies after assuming office at the party’s convention that was to be held in Trincomalee last Sunday.

However, the convention was postponed indefinitely due to controversies surrounding selections for other posts, including the post of the General Secretary of the party. So the new leader was unable to deliver that important speech.

After the election of Sritharan by the party’s General Council in a secret ballot at Trincomalee Town Hall on 21 January, the other contender, Member of Parliament, M.A. Sumanthiran had publicly announced that he would cooperate with the new leader.

The United States and Britain unleashed attacks against 36 Houthi targets in Yemen, a day after the U.S. military hit Tehran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for a deadly attack on U.S. troops in Jordan.

“We intend to take additional strikes, and additional action, to continue to send a clear message that the United States will respond when our forces are attacked, when our people are killed,” White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC’s “Meet the Press” program on Sunday.

The strikes are the latest blows in a conflict that has spread into the Middle East since Oct. 7, when the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed Israel from the Gaza Strip, igniting war.

COLOMBO (News 1st) – Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has called for a transition to new leadership in Sri Lanka.

Cardinal Ranjith highlighted the contrasting approaches taken by Singapore and Sri Lanka after independence. While Singapore's leaders prioritized unity and the well-being of all communities, he decried the division sowed by Sri Lankan leadership based on language and religion.

He further praised Singapore's strong legal system and emphasis on discipline, contrasting them with the perceived disregard for law and order in Sri Lanka.

The Cardinal accused the government of self-serving agendas and prioritizing personal gain over the nation's well-being. He questioned the legitimacy of their "independence celebrations" at a time of economic and political turmoil, suggesting that they only celebrate their own freedom, not that of the suffering people.

The legislation which seeks to regulate online content was passed in Parliament, with amendments, on 24 January, amidst objections from opposition politicians and activists who allege the new law will muzzle free speech.

The controversial Bill garnered not only the attention of local activists and organisations, but also that of diplomats and large international organisations, claiming that the Bill had numerous problematic aspects.

Today, Sri Lankans are totally fed up with both political parties. Millions of Lankans have finally realized that together the two major parties ran our country to ground while protecting each other when laws were broken, and corruption was evident.

Thank to the contribution of the social media, an angry public who were deprived of the very basic necessities of life rallied together and managed to chase away a president who mismanaged the country, a historic first in our beloved island.

Two of his catastrophic decisions were giving a tax to the tune of around Rs 600 billion without figuring out how to pay for it (now RW has made the people pay for it with increased taxes) and later opting to go for organic fertilizer during a global pandemic thereby ruining the only healthy sector of our economy which was agriculture. Had Gota not been given the huge tax cut he might have had the money to buy chemical fertilizer.
