Investing in women also includes actively addressing discrimination and ensuring laws, policies, budgets and investments that respond to their needs

It is time that Sri Lanka prioritizes women‚Äôs empowerment and recognizes that gender equality is not only a matter of rights but the bedrock of an equitable, peaceful and prosperous society. However, it takes investment to build inclusive communities and societies with the full participation of women and girls from all backgrounds

When global crises such as climate disasters, poverty, and hunger occur, women and girls are affected the most

Gender inequality is also reflected in women‚Äôs representation and participation in leadership, which remains abysmally low in Sri Lanka

Despite the executive colliding head on sometimes with the Parliament and some other times with judiciary, the Constitutional Council and ‚Äúindependent Commissions in the recent past, the former has emerged victorious always, sometimes at the expense of the rules of the duel.

For instance, in spite of the battle between the executive on behalf of the two ruling parties and the Election Commission backed by the Opposition parties over the local government elections having been dragging on for more than a year, the two ruling parties ‚Äì the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) can boast to have the ‚Äúmission accomplished.‚Äù

Every attempt by successive Sri Lankan governments to open up the local economy to the world has been obstructed by a minority of individuals and groups with vested interests. The picture shows Colombo Port City, a project funded by China, and these groups have been skeptical of such foreign investments

Those days, I noted, when the queues get shortened, the country would revert to the old habits

How much of a window to India that Sri Lanka could now aspire to be is open to question

Parents of university students are a worried lot at present. This is because there is speculation that their children in university may be featuring in a number of protests throughout March, according media reports.

There are the pluses and minuses of such protests. Protests of this nature will certainly be of news value to the media. Protesting undergrads have often won their rights and also the hearts of the down-trodden masses. But from the perspective of the country‚Äôs economy and the future of these students there are people who disapprove of such violent gatherings. Critics ask the question whether such gatherings have to be so disruptive and violent at times! They in return ask the question whether these undergraduates cannot think of an innovative way of staging a protest that will grab the attention of the government and also win their demands?

March 8 (Reuters) - Gold prices surged to a fresh record high on Friday as data showing a rise in the U.S. unemployment rate boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates soon.

Spot gold rose 0.7% to $2,173.49 per ounce by 10:42 a.m. ET (1542 GMT), while U.S. gold futures added 0.7% to $2,180.50.

Bullion was on track to post its biggest weekly percentage increase since mid-October.

Gold reached an all-time high of $2,185.19 after a report showed a rise in the U.S. unemployment rate and a moderation in wage gains despite job growth acceleration in February.

"We still believe the same underlying premise remains, which is the combination of the expectation that the Fed is still going to cut rates later this year and dollar weakness," said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.

This marked the end of a 25-year conflict between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist rebel group. The conflict stemmed from longstanding grievances, including discriminatory policies against the Tamil minority, perpetrated by successive governments dominated by the Sinhala-Buddhist community. The LTTE sought to establish a separate state in the North and East of Sri Lanka, leading to a protracted and violent struggle. During the final stages of the war, an estimated 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed, predominantly in the rebel-hold north of the country (Lynch, 2011). The Sri Lankan military achieved a decisive victory, decimating the entire military leadership of the LTTE, including its leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.
