The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, the Indian Prime Minister and the Government of Sri Lanka to take steps to join their families, including Murugan and Robert Paes, who are in the Indian jail.. Sivagnanam Sridharan appealed.

He appealed to the debate on the amendments to the Taxes Bill on Wednesday (06) in Parliament.

Sivanesan, a member of the parliament, was unjustly killed in the name of a deep infiltration force by Sri Lankan soldiers.

Meanwhile, I am making our tribute to Shantan, who has embraced the first death for a few days without being imprisoned in India and later released.

It is the biggest crisis and a grievance of a young man who left the age of 53 at the age of 20 who was trying to see his mother, to see relatives.

Sri Lankans as a whole haven‚Äôt read enough about politics or believe too much about its abilities that it‚Äôs the cure for all ills; otherwise, Sri Lankans would not have been cheated by their lawmakers for 76 long years!

We have already read the Wickremesinghe chapter, and only the former hints that all the government‚Äôs stolen monies will be brought back and the culprits punished, when a new government assumes power.

We voters have an issue. We don‚Äôt demand that the lawmaker talks the truth. When the two Chapters of the highest Buddhist Order of this island nation started giving enough hints of late that politicians cannot be trusted, many thought that this call came very late.

### Defense sharing should not split the country and make power sharing from the dark age -Foreign Minister insists on

*2024-03-06 23:59:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/178124) ¬∑ `ta`

Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabri emphasizes the importance of power devolution in Sri Lanka, arguing it's crucial for national unity and progress. He cites Sri Lanka's economic recovery post-crisis and India's stabilization under Manmohan Singh as examples. Sri Lanka's multi-ethnic community, including Tamils, Muslims, and Sinhalese, can progress together, with the Tamil National People's Front advocating for a political solution. The minister warns against the dangers of language-based division, referencing Colvin R.D. Silva's warning against a war that could have been avoided if Tamil-Sinhala languages were declared royal in 1956. He calls for all political parties to focus on the country's welfare over politics, highlighting the need for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address war-related issues without external interference.

üü©

Devolution of power does not split the country. Therefore, political parties should dedicate their position on the sharing of power and refer to the country for the country.. If ethnic harmony is confirmed only can the country progress. Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabri said devolution of power should be made possible to get out of the dark era.

He was speaking at a debate on the Taxes Bill on Wednesday (6) in Parliament.

Sri Lanka is an excellent example of what will happen if you make popular decisions in the economy and what will happen if timely economic policies change. The people of the country will take the benefit of taking strict resolutions to recover from the economic crisis.

India faced the worst economic crisis in 1991. The then Prime Minister of India Narasinghe Rao. Manmohan Singh appointed Finance Minister and stabilized India's economy. Since 1991, many political parties have ruled India but economic policy has not been changed for political purposes.

President (then Prime Minister) pointed out in 2016 that ‚Äúgiven the future growth potential and envisaged development plans, Sri Lanka will have to overcome the scarcity of skilled human resources apart from managing power and water requirements‚Äù. Sri Lanka eight years later is still looking for sustainable Human Resource solutions

Official records suggest that over 1.1 million Sri Lankans have left the country in 2022 with a monthly average of about 94,000 while only 27.6% of total departures have left for foreign employment purposes, most of them low- and semi-skilled workers. In 2023, around 300,000. However there is evidence that middle-class professionals joined the exodus in 2022 and 2023 thinking that the country would take years to recover. Overall critical sectors like healthcare, banking sector and information technology increasingly struggle with talent shortages.

Anura and the NPP have seized the public imagination in a way that nobody in this election year has. They have done so, not by resorting to base invocations of race and religion as Gotabaya Rajapaksa did. They have done so, because they are not boring while almost all others are; they have not lost credibility as all others have; they are interesting and have social energy while the others are tired and lack authentic passion; they have a positive message which motivates and mobilises while others are shrilly negative, imaginatively timid, stale and samey.
