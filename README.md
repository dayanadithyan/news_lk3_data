ECONOMYNEXT — Former minister Udaya Gammanpila plans to present a private member’s bill to parliament seeking a ’22nd amendment’ to Sri Lanka’s constitution seeking the removal of police powers devolved to the provinces by the 13th amendment.

Gammanpila told reporters that devolving police powers to the provincial councils could pose a threat to national security.

“If there is a separatist war in the future, that war will be fought between the provincial police of the north and the Sri Lanka Army. Both will be official armies,” the former minister who now sits in the opposition said.

“Countries that work against Sri Lanka could openly, without hesitation, provide aid to that separatist armed movement, or in the other words, the northern police army,” he said.

Asked if his bill could get a two-thirds majority in parliament, Gammanpila said it would test parliament’s resolve.

### Greece legalises same-sex marriage

Feb 16 - Greece has become the first Christian Orthodox-majority country to legalise same-sex marriage.

Same-sex couples will now also be legally allowed to adopt children after Thursday's 176-76 vote in parliament.

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the new law would "boldly abolish a serious inequality".

But it has divided the country, with fierce resistance led by the powerful Orthodox Church. Its supporters held a protest rally in Athens.

Many displayed banners, held crosses, read prayers and sang passages from the Bible in the capital's Syntagma Square.

The head of the Orthodox Church, Archbishop Ieronymos, said the measure would "corrupt the homeland's social cohesion".

The bill needed a simple majority to pass through the 300-member parliament.

Mr Mitsotakis had championed the bill but required the support of opposition parties to get it over the line, with dozens of MPs from his centre-right governing party opposed.
