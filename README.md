Joining the government is now a matter of question. Who wants to board a shipwreck.

There are reports that the United People's Power is trying to get rid of you - can we talk about whether these rumors are true or not?

You know that we are facing the most bad situation, especially in relation to the economy.

Everyone knows that the country is in the grip of debt and has reached bankruptcy.

The income of the people has not increased but the costs have increased, causing people to be in great crisis.

What do you want to report in the Sri Lankan media that the United People's Power is trying to get you out of the United States?

Answer- The party is doing well but I have faced some things. I tried to find a solution to these issues.

This is relevant to joining some people in the party, and they are currently joining our opponents with the current ruling party five years ago.

One of them is a former military commander - I think that even though he is in the army, his actions are not acceptable.

### Parliament up in arms against salary hike for Central Bank employees

Members of both the Government and the Opposition are up in arms against the recent salary hike granted to the employees of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).

The latest attack came from Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva who said Parliament should be given the right to decide on the salary increments of the CBSL officials.

"Parliament should approve any salary hikes for Central Bank officials as it is the legislature that has the power over finances. Let us bring in such a law," he said.

"Do office assistants of the Central Bank perform any special role to become entitled to an exorbitant salary," he asked in response to the salary hike given to Central Bank office assistants.

Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella also criticised the salary hike.

"The monthly salary of a Deputy Governor of the Central Bank has been increased to Rs. 1.6 million while a peon's salary has been increased by Rs. 70,000," he said.

### Sri Lanka inflation to reach 5% during Q3-Q4: CBSL official

*2024-02-21 14:28:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97433/sri-lanka-inflation-to-reach-5-during-q3-q4-cbsl-official) · `en`

Sri Lanka’s inflation is expected to return to the government’s 5% target starting from the last two quarters of the year, a Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) official said on Wednesday, as the economy stabilises from a crippling financial crisis.

The economy has shown signs of recovery in recent months, aided by a $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, after it went into freefall in 2022 due to a severe foreign exchange shortage.

“Inflation is projected to reach 5% in the medium term, which is from about the third quarter to the end of the year,” S. Jegajeevan, the director of CBSL’s economic research department, told reporters.

“The high base effect from the tax increases is expected to benefit inflation in early 2025 and possibly even bring it lower than 5%.”

The South Asian country defaulted on its overseas debt in May 2022 after depleted foreign exchange reserves triggered worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948.
