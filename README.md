Mozambique (BBC) - More than 90 people have died after a ferry sank off the north coast of Mozambique, local authorities say.

Officials in Nampula province said five people had been rescued of the around 130 believed to have been on board.

They were fleeing a cholera outbreak, Nampula Secretary of State Jaime Neto said. Many children were among the dead, he added.

"Because the boat was overcrowded and unsuited to carry passengers it ended up sinking," Mr Neto said.

Unverified video posted on social media purported to show dozens of bodies lying on a beach.

The boat was apparently travelling from Lunga to Mozambique Island, off the coast of Nampula.

Nampula province has been one of the worst-affected by the cholera outbreak which has spread over several countries in southern Africa since January last year.

According to Unicef, the current outbreak is the worst in 25 years. Since October 2023, Mozambique has reported 13,700 confirmed cases and 30 deaths.

тАЬSri Lanka is blessed with plenty of wind тАФ a renewable energy resource with which cheaper electricity can be provided to consumers without spending millions of dollars on fossil fuel, but it is still an enigma why the government of Sri Lanka is dragging on finalizing the Adani wind power project in Mannar,тАЭ they said.

Indunil Bandara, Convener of the Youth for Renewable Energy Organization voiced concerns over the issue of increasing electricity unit tariffs faced by Sri Lankans. Bandara highlighted that nearly 25% of the average income is allocated to electricity consumption, posing significant challenges to households and businesses alike.

### Sri Lanka forex reserves improving, but global oil prices keep increasing

The gross official reserves were provisionally estimated at US dollars 4,951 mn as at end March 2024 including proceeds from the PeopleтАЩ Bank of China (PBOC) swap arrangement, which is subject to conditionalities on usability, according to the Weekly Economic Indicators of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

The report, however, stated that during the period under review (March 29- April 5), crude oil prices exhibited an increasing trend. Crude oil prices increased owing to optimism on demand with the expansion in manufacturing activity in China and the US, coupled with the concerns about tight supply stemming from escalating geopolitical tensions and major producers keeping output cuts in place. Overall, both Brent and WTI prices increased by more than US dollars 3.00 per barrel during the review period.

The situation, therefore, appears to remain ambivalent for Sri Lanka as the cost of incoming shipments of oil could jump in the coming weeks.

Ex-President Sirisena is once again in the news for all the wrong reasons. Hardly had the ink dried on news stories of his sudden firing of three senior Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members, we learned that a court order has barred him from performing duties as chairman of that party.

The court order was based on a complaint to the court by Chandrika Kumaratunga for the removal of Sirisena from the post of SLFP Chairman, on the grounds he was unsuitable for the role. Among the reasons for his ouster were charges he was unlawfully holding the Chairmanship of the party in violation of the Party Constitution.

Additional charges arose from SirisenaтАЩs actions during the constitutional crisis of 2018 being deemed incorrect. He was also found guilty of having violated the fundamental rights of people in the case of the Easter Sunday bombings.

In response to past controversies surrounding nekath, the government appointed a team of astrologers in 1992┬а to determine the official auspicious times, which were widely accepted. However, professional rivalry or jealousy often leads astrologers outside the official team to challenge the declared times, citing various unexplained theoretical concepts unique to astrology.

There is a war in Ukraine? It seems to have been forgotten by everyoneтАУexcept by Ukraine, Russia and their respective allies.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine in February 2022, many including myself expected it to be over in weeks. In my case, this was because, as much as I dislike PutinтАЩs dictatorship, Russian superiority in armour, artillery, aircraft and manpower was so big it was hard to see how Ukraine could stop all those tanks rolling over the countryтАЩs eastern steppes and advancing into the country, encircling and destroying outnumbered Ukrainian forces.

### Racist policy of forced cremation

The whole issue of forced cremation that shook the Muslim community in 2020/21 was entirely rooted in racism.

It is the Gotabaya Government which both piloted and enforced to the full measure this racist policy, aided by experts whom the President himself effectively appointed.

Now that it has been demonstrated, after a series of international setbacks for the Government and the erosion of public trust in Government leaders and experts, the question of tendering an open apology to the Muslim community and to those who opposed the policy tooth and nail as it was ruthlessly enforced has now come up.

As admitted, ThondamanтАЩs Ministry of Water Resources has found out that the COVID-19 virus doesnтАЩt spread through ground water. Perhaps, Ali SabryтАЩs Ministry of Foreign Affairs may have found out that the damage that this racist policy implemented by the Government, of which he remained an integral part (as Justice Minister), heaped on the country internationally was avoidable but horrendous.

### How to miss five industrial revolutions

The signs of having gone through industrial revolutions are the country becoming wealthy, and population having a high level of per capita income

Sri Lanka did not have a complete set of Government institutions to maintain a corruption-free economy. This incompleteness later led to countrywide corruption and creating a generation of rent seekers whose primary objective was to profit from the Government, at the expense of the welfare of the general public. This should have been obvious to the political leaders and bureaucrats of Sri Lanka who oversaw the transition of political power from the colonial master. Thus, the need to import and adopt technology and the need to install the full set of institutions should have been a top priority of the country. In similar situations, countries like Japan and Singapore adopted correct strategies
