Colombo, Feb 2 (Daily Mirror) - The controversial Online Safety Bill, which was passed in Parliament last week and was endorsed by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena yesterday, was gazetted and enacted as law.

The third reading of the bill was passed without a vote on January 24, and several amendments recommended by the Supreme Court were incorporated, though opposition MPs accused the government that the bill that was passed did not properly accommodate those recommendations.

The Asia Internet Coalition, an industry association that promotes understanding and resolution of Internet policy issues in the Asia Pacific region and works with tech giants such as Google, Meta and X, have criticised the bill, calling it “unworkable”.
