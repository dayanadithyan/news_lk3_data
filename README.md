In 1973, the government distributed 10 kg of rice to low-income families, threatening jail and fines for taking more. Initially, it aimed to prevent rice imports and self-govern, but now imports are allowed. This change led to the publication of a warning in Weerakesari on November 15, 1973, about confiscation and fines for taking over half a rice.

🟩

The government provides 10 kg of rice each to low -income families in the country. However, in 1973, the government announced that those who were taken over the rice would be jailed and fined.

The main opposition Maldives Democratic Party (MDP) dwindled to just 12 seats from 65 earlier.

Both Beijing and New Delhi have wooed the Maldives as they vie for influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Elected last year, Muizzu has pledged to end the country's "India First" policy, straining ties with New Delhi.

### Sri Lanka rupee quoted in spot-next dollar market after pressure

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s rupee was quoted at 302.20/30 to the US dollar in the spot next (spot plus one day) market after the stop opened tentatively at 302.00/75 levels, dealers said.

There were one or two sporadic deals at 302.00 to the US dollar, but the spot market was not very active in early trade, dealers said.

Market participants are recovering from a heavy dose of moral suasion last week, after the rupee came under upward pressure from an ‘oversold position’.

Sri Lanka’s central bank collected 715 million dollars from the interbank market in March, three times the around 200 million it collected in the previous two months.

The central bank was able to collect large amount of dollars in March as the rupee was allowed to appreciate steeply within a short time amid deflationary policy, encouraging importers to delay payments and also creating market incentives banks to short their open positions.
