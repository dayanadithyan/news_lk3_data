ECONOMYNEXT — The process followed in enacting Sri Lanka’s controversial Online Safety Act (OSA) raises serious questions on law-making and its impact on constitutional democracy, the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) said, urging the government to replace the act with a law that “genuinely addresses” concerns on online safety.

Claiming that the process of drafting the OSA was shrouded in secrecy, CPA said the rushed manner of its passage raises questions as to the intentions of the government in enacting a law that has significant implications for fundamental rights and the rule of law in Sri Lanka.

“CPA has previously commented on the substance and process followed with the Bill and challenged its constitutionality. In light of recent events surrounding the enactment of the OSA, CPA condemns the enactment of such a draconian law that can further limit freedom of speech and the right to dissent,” the organisation said.
