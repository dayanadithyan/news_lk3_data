ECONOMYNEXT – The International Monetary Fund has said a suspension on parate execution, or halting foreclosure decisions taken by banks in Sri Lanka on bad loans, should be ended as soon as possible.

Sri Lanka bank non-performing loans went up as much as 13 percent, with a combined hit from a currency crisis which came on top of the Coronavirus pandemic triggering a slew of auctions of collateral of distressed businesses.

“The suspension of banks’ repossession of collateral (“Parate” executions) 22 will hinder the banks’ ability to manage NPLs and price credit risks and should be lifted as soon as possible while encouraging a negotiated NPL solution to avoid excessive liquidation,” an IMF report released after the approval of the latest review of the IMF said.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will impose tax on owner occupied houses, charge value added tax on digital services, and remove exemptions on services exports, under a revised deal agreed with the International Monetary Fund.

The IMF in particular has been pushing a wealth tax claiming it was ‘critical’.

A tax will be imposed on owner-occupied houses on an imputed rent calculation, according to a program agreed with the IMF and approved by its Board on June 12.

The money will be given to Municipal Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas,

Concerns have been raised about wealth-style taxes which are imposed on assets without any cashflows to pay, in a country where existing and past measures have discouraged house building and costs are prohibitive and unaffordable in part due to currency depreciation.

Valued added tax will be imposed on digital services, as part of a slew of new tax measures.

I will focus on two matters. One is his success as the lay custodian of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha known as Diyawadana Nilame in Sinhala which can be directly rendered to English as the Water Bearing Official. The other is his rare display of accountability as the Minister of Justice when there was a jail breakout and prison mutiny leading to the death of two inmates in 1988.

### Beyond CSR: Looking inward for social impact

The true essence of CSR is its integration into the very fabric of a company’s operations

For years now, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been a buzzword among both development and private sectors. It is easily one of the most misinterpreted concepts – its essence diluted when communicated and implemented within the corporate world. Businesses often misunderstand and misapply the concept of CSR: rather than integrating CSR into core business practices, the trend is a stronger focus on charitable initiatives. While still commendable, businesses can start by looking inward and truly embracing CSR with a deeper, more authentic approach that embodies company policies, practices, and culture.

A few right-thinking sports ministers tried to change the constitution governing cricket in the country to address emerging issues, but they failed before the processes even commenced

Sovereignty can generally be defined as supreme authority. In any State, sovereignty is assigned to the person, body or institution that has the ultimate authority over other people to establish a law or change existing laws. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme legitimate authority over some States.

At the outset a nation’s sovereignty is vested on its citizens and they use it to elect their representatives to a national assembly to carry out the affairs of the nation for a given period of time. In a democratic setup voters use their sovereign power to elect their representatives to manage the affairs for the benefit of the nation and in return be accountable to the nation on its affairs.
