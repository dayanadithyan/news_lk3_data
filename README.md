*2024-08-04 13:25:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/190235) ¬∑ `ta`

The Mannar District Public Organization Union has written to the Ministry of Health expressing concern over the death of Mariaraj Sindhuja at Mannar District Hospital. Sindhuja, who gave birth there on September 9th, died on the 27th after being neglected overnight due to heavy rain.

üü©

The Mannar District Public Organization Union has sent a letter to the Secretary of the Ministry of Health regarding the death of a woman named Marmaraj Sindhuja at the Mannar District Hospital.

The Mannar District Public Organizations Union, which has requested Mariaraj Sindhuja to seek justice, has also requested that the inquiries into the death of the death should not be covered.

Mrs. Mariaraj Sindhuja had a baby at the Mannar Hospital on the 9th of last month.

Later, on the 27th, the Mannar District Hospital was enrolled at night due to Guruder.

Until the next morning, no doctor visited them.

The woman has died due to the irresponsible act of the doctors. It is customary for these irresponsible actions to continue in the schools.

A young graduate woman has been killed by the recklessness of a doctor who is in charge of the hostel.

‚ÄúNamal Rajapaksa does not know history. Chandrika Bandaranaike is not ready to give her father the presidential candidate when he was ready for the 2005 presidential election. At the time, I first recommended myself the name of Mahinda Rajapaksa, said SM Chandrasena.

‚ÄúThen I was very troubled. Mrs. Chandrika scolded me. That is not the only one. He said he helped him to make his grandfather a president.

We were listening to Namal Rajapaksa's claim that the houses of Sehan Semasinghe and other MPs were burned.. It was because of their misdeeds that such situations were met.

Namal Rajapaksa's wrong work was to sacrifice life that day. It was because we held meetings on the day of the protest.

"I say that Namal Rajapaksa cannot fill my vacuum in Anuradhapura district."Parliamentarian SM Chandrasena said he should be present to fill his vacuum.

### PR: The Essential Ingredient in Hoteliering ‚Äì Part A

*2024-08-04 02:39:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/pr-the-essential-ingredient-in-hoteliering-part-a/) ¬∑ `en`

I consider Public Relations (PR) as one of the most important aspects in running any business. In the context of managing Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH) during the early 1990s, I identified the following twelve segments of people with whom I needed to have good PR:

During my efforts to shortlist employee suggestions, ‚ÄòEstablishing quality circles in all departments, to earn a national award‚Äô was identified as a goal for 1991. Before formalizing quality circles, we initiated special clean-ups using the Sri Lankan village concept of ‚ÄòShramadana‚Äô (donation of time and effort). This practice brought a new sparkle to the hotel.

### Some wonders AI has created and dangers of negative repercussions

*2024-08-04 02:09:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/some-wonders-ai-has-created-and-dangers-of-negative-repercussions/) ¬∑ `en`

If anyone in this audience was skeptical regarding my earlier assertion that engineering and technology underpin numerous innovations shaping our lives, this example should effectively dispel their doubts. So what is behind this success in this new generation of AI that we now experience? It is a technology called Deep Learning, a term that may be familiar to some of you.

What is Deep Learning? Deep learning is a computer learning paradigm, inspired by the human brain‚Äôs neural networks, which are believed to process data iteratively, through layers. Similar to how the brain learns from data, Deep Learning algorithms also learn by processing data, through layers of interconnected computing nodes, refining their understanding with each iteration.

‚ÄúCulture is like jam; the less you have, the more you spread‚Äù

The Central Bank of Ceylon had stringent forex laws and regulations in the seventies. In 1975, it approved 18 sterling pounds for me to take to England as a student and recorded the amount in my passport. The postgraduate studentship from the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) of Sussex University paid my airfare, tuition fees, and living expenses.

I travelled to Karachi from Colombo on October 1. The connecting flight to London was delayed because the plane had engine troubles. I did not have money to make a call to IDS or ARTI about the delay. The plan was for someone from IDS to meet me at Falmer railway station (the nearest to the university) on October 2 in the afternoon.

President  Ranil Wickremesinghe was cruelly bamboozled by the Rajapaksas early this week. The incumbent president was given false promises that the Medamulana clan-led ‚Äúpohottuwa‚Äùparty was firmly behind him in his bid to contest the forthcoming presidential poll. The note of discord struck by Namal Rajapaksa was lightly dismissed as being of very little consequence. The message conveyed was that Wickremesinghe should formally seek the suppo rt of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna(SLPP) for his candidacy and that it would be accepted and approved by the SLPP as a matter of course. But when Ranil did so, the carpet was yanked from under his feet.

During the two weeks after President Biden‚Äôs ultimate act of patriotism in deciding not to seek re-election for a second term, the political climate in the United States has been energized with a number of totally unexpected and refreshing events.

Biden became the second man to decline re-election since Lyndon Johnson in 1968. The circumstances surrounding the decision by these presidents not to run for re-election had many differences, but forsaking personal ambition for the good of their party and country is the common theme that has distinguished their presidencies in history for their selflessness and patriotism.

*2024-08-04 00:25:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/court-orders-on-the-plantation-wage-issue/) ¬∑ `en`

On May Day, flanked by plantation sector legislators representing the Ceylon Worker‚Äôs Congress( CWC), President Wickremesinghe announced the increase of the plantation worker daily wage to Rs 1,700.00. His will was legitimized by a gazette notification signed by Manusha Nanayakkara, Minister of Labour. Twenty one plantation companies, collectively, filed a petition before the Court of Appeal, seeking the invalidation of the said gazette, on the basis that the unilateral and arbitrary decision by the minister violated the legal principles of natural justice.

On July 4, a three-member Supreme Court bench issued an interim injunction order, preventing the implementation of the said gazette. Clearly, the court considered that the plea by the plantation companies had merit. The latest court ruling, along with the two others delivered on the recent election-related petitions, is more egg on the president‚Äôs face.

She may also be the first Black and South Asian American president; Obama being considered to be first African American Prez. A very significant fact is that powerful women are rallying around her and endorsing her strongly. They are led by Nancy Pelosi, recently 52nd Speaker of the House of Representatives. Jill Biden, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama are close behind; Hollywood stars too like Beyonce.

Mother died three days ago. Or maybe it was the day before. I‚Äôm not sure. It feels surreal, as if she‚Äôs still present. Her absence is heavy, a palpable silence thick with the memory of her voice. In those last days, she would call out my name in the evenings at the Cancer Hospital. I flew back for her from the US to Sri Lanka. It was a gruelling 20-hour journey.

Upon landing, I was arrested at the airport. They threw me into a cramped cell with two others: a Tamilian and a man who had stolen copper wire to feed his sick mother. The wire was worth Rs.22,000 (under 75 USD). It is in my opinion a desperate act in a country declared bankrupt in 2022. The economic collapse has driven many to crime, with Colombo‚Äôs streets mired in gun violence and systemic corruption.

In Sri Lanka's 2024 presidential election, confusion arises due to the increasing number of candidates and the voting system. If no candidate secures 50% of the votes, the first and second runners-up' votes are combined and the candidate with the majority wins. Social media's influence, including fake news, is significant. Voting involves marking preferences for up to three candidates, ensuring transparency and allowing for redistribution of votes based on preferences.

Fake news, fabricated news, videos and photos are being spread on social media. As well as Memes, the social media is going viral.
