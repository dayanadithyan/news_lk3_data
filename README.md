### US now pushes UN to back ‘immediate’ Gaza ceasefire to free hostages

The United States on Tuesday revised language in a draft United Nations Security Council resolution to back “an immediate ceasefire of roughly six weeks in Gaza together with the release of all hostages,” according to the text seen by Reuters.

The third revision of the text - first proposed by the U.S. two weeks ago - now reflects blunt remarks by Vice President Kamala Harris. The initial U.S. draft had shown support for “a temporary ceasefire” in the Israel-Hamas war.

The U.S. wants any Security Council support for a ceasefire to be linked to the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

### Honouring the Unsung Heroes of Sri Lanka on International Women’s Day

As we celebrate International Women’s Day, it prompts us to wonder, what does it truly mean to be a woman? In a world marked by increasing competitiveness and relentless pace, women often find themselves questioning their place and value. Today, as we honour the spirit of womanhood, it is imperative to recognise the enduring legacy of women and address the scarcity of female role models to inspire the next generation.

Being a woman is a profound journey, marked by the diverse roles of daughter, wife, mother, educator, career woman and a caregiver to her family. From the moment a child is cradled protectively in her womb, she begins a journey of nurturing and guidance that extends far beyond birth. A mother’s love envelops her child, shaping their perceptions and experiences as they navigate the world.

It has been observed that divisive politics is one of the inborn deficiencies in party politics although political parties are considered as vital components of Parliamentary Democracy. It is not possible to activate representative democracy or parliamentary democracy without political parties.

Hooray and congratulations! Our national cricket team won a full series of matches. It was against Afghanistan, but no matter, at last we have won a whole series. It was refreshing to see our team win. The huge crowd at the third T-20 match, vouched for the regeneration of interest among the fans of the game in the country.

While we won all of the test matches, it was the absence of spectators which was prominent. Despite the fact entrance to the games were free, a sparse crowd attended the matches.

During an earlier era we were enthralled when we beat teams like India, Pakistan and Australia. In those days beating even England was no big deal.

But times have changed. At the Dambulla Cricket Stadium where the last T-20 match between Afghanistan and our national team took place, we witnessed a sad change for the worse in the spirit the game was played.

### Militarisation: Something old; something new

If dignity was what the retired general was after, higher pensions/benefits to lower rank retirees would have served better (especially the disabled/seriously injured)

Had Sri Lanka used a part of her massive defence budget to provide an honourable and viable way out for her soldiers post-war, the twin problems of high desertions and criminalisation of deserters could have been minimised. 10 years on, no political leader is interested in acknowledging the issue let alone addressing it

“Are we so morally sick, so deaf and dumb and blind, that we do not understand this?”

In 2023, bankrupt Sri Lanka added $ 16.6 billion to its central government debt, an increase of 21%.

Sri Lanka ranks a high 43 in Global Militarisation Index and a low 83 in Social Progress Index. When it comes to militarisation, Sri Lanka outranks most developed countries. We also outrank our neighbours, including India (77); only Pakistan, at 44, is slightly ahead of us.

### Honouring the unsung heroes of Sri Lanka on International Women’s Day

As we celebrate International Women’s Day, it prompts us to wonder, what does it truly mean to be a woman? In a world marked by increasing competitiveness and relentless pace, women often find themselves questioning their place and value. Today, as we honour the spirit of womanhood, it is imperative to recognise the enduring legacy of women and address the scarcity of female role models to inspire the next generation.

Being a woman is a profound journey, marked by the diverse roles of daughter, wife, mother, educator, career woman and a caregiver to her family. From the moment a child is cradled protectively in her womb, she begins a journey of nurturing and guidance that extends far beyond birth. A mother’s love envelops her child, shaping their perceptions and experiences as they navigate the world.

Sri Lanka and India are working on an estimated USD 1.2 billion undersea transmission line that will link the island nation’s power grind with that of India to provide energy security to this country, a top Sri Lankan official said on Tuesday.

The proposal is to link Sri Lanka’s north central town of Anuradhapura and Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state in India through a direct power line. After a 130km overland transmission line in India, an undersea line (via a submarine cable) will emerge at Thiruketheeswaram in Mannar in northeast Sri Lanka.

Sulakshana Jayawardena, Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy said, “This will raise our hopes on energy security.” He said this days after the fifth meeting of the India-Sri Lanka joint working group (JWG) for cooperation in the power sector was held on February 28 here. The High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Santosh Jha also attended the meeting.

### Avoid making bogus allegations against state top officials - Speaker urges parliamentarians

*2024-03-05 21:34:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/177940) · `ta`

Parliamentarians urged to avoid false allegations against state officials, as Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena highlighted concerns over baseless accusations.

🟩

Members of Parliament should avoid the presence of the state's top officials and their service to insult fake allegations. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena informed the House that state officials have expressed concern over the fake allegations of MPs.

It is observed that the Member of Parliament is baselessly presenting to the honor of the state's top officials.

The lack of chance of state officials to clarify the allegations made by a few MPs will be considered unjust.

If there are any problems with state officials, there are instructions for handling it properly. Therefore, MPs must avoid the proposal of false accusations to insult state officials. Therefore, I urge you to remove the allegations leveled at state officials in accordance with the Secondary Command (91) (9).
