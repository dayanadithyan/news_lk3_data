### Surprise defeat for far-right in France in Macron‚Äôs snap election gambit

ECONOMYNEXT ‚Äî President Emanuel Macron‚Äôs gamble in calling a snap poll somewhat paid off after a left-wing alliance secured the highest number of seats in the French parliament, effectively defeating an alliance led by the far-right National Rally.

The Economist reported that Marine Le Pen‚Äôs National Rally (RN)-led bloc, which was widely anticipated to top the voting, will now end up in third place, securing 134 to 152 seats. However, this is still a major win for the once-fringe party which only held 88 seats in the outgoing parliament, indicating the mainstreaming of its hard-right ideology.

A left-wing alliance led by Jean-Luc Melenchon is projected to have secured 171-187 seats after what CNN has called tactical voting in Sunday‚Äôs second round election. CNN noted that France will be left in political limbo after no party came close to winning an absolute majority.

### Presidential pardons: an unchecked executive power

*2024-07-08 11:07:00* ¬∑ [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/presidential-pardons-an-unchecked-executive-power/) ¬∑ `en`

A pardon is defined in Black‚Äôs Law Dictionary ‚Äòas an act of grace‚Äô. In the Oxford Dictionary it is defined as an ‚Äúaction of forgiving or remission of the legal consequences of an offence or conviction‚Äù. Some argue that the power to grant a pardon is a check on the powers of the judiciary rectifying any miscarriage of justice. But this executive power unchecked could result in the abuse of power.

In recent times, President Sirisena granted two pardons ‚Äì one within six months and the other within nine days of relinquishing office while President Gotabay Rajapaksa granted two pardons ‚Äì one within four months of becoming president and the other seven months after he received a two thirds majority in Parliament.

### Worsening external deficit to improve fiscal deficit: Jumping from frying pan into the fire

Are we taking the right measures to address the debt problem?

After a disastrous handling of the economy during and in the immediate aftermath of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021, the then President was unceremoniously (and possibly justifiably) removed from office. But is the economy on the right track since then?

The relative stability of the economy since mid-2022 was broadly due to the following:

2. Increase in rainfall in mid-2022, which eased the power cuts. As the rainfall reduced towards the end of 2022, electricity tariff was increased sharply which reduced demand.

3. Halt of service of foreign debt which decreased foreign currency outflows.

4. Exorbitant increase in interest rates and depreciation of currency in mid-2022 which plummeted demand for imports and eased foreign currency outflows. While interest rates have fallen sharply in recent months, Rupee has also strengthened to an extent.

Instead of protesting against an RE project, which will contribute to Sri Lanka‚Äôs much needed energy security and take us a step forward towards freedom from fossil fuels, why aren‚Äôt these protestors doing some real environmental work on the ground?

Recently a group of environmentalists and a religious leader approached the Supreme Court against a renewable energy project to come up in the country‚Äôs north.

Environmentalists rallying against a renewable energy project is odd. As they should be against fossil fuel-based projects and push for a quicker energy transition for Sri Lanka to achieve its goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.

Throughout its post-independence history, Sri Lanka has been a big consumer and a bad saver

The Central Bank alone had a foreign debt obligation of $ 6 billion, converting its foreign reserves to a net negative position of $ 2.5 billion.

### 2024-07-07 (Sunday)

### India balances the series

*2024-07-07 23:21:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187931) ¬∑ `ta`

India started its new era with a loss in Harare but clinched the T20 series against Zimbabwe with a 100-run win in the second match. Abhishek Sharma, a rising star, played a crucial role with a century in his second international T20 match, alongside Ruthuraj Gaikwad. India's total was 234/2, with key contributions from Shubman Gill, Abhishek Sharma, Ruthuraj Gaikwad, and Rinku Singh. Zimbabwe was bowled out for 134, with Wesley Madhevere leading their batting. Avesh Khan and Mukesh Kumar starred with the ball.

üü©

The first attempt towards India's new era began with a defeat in Harare last Saturday (06).

However, India won the second international T20 cricket match on Sunday (07) at the same stadium and won the series by 100 runs.

Abhishek Sharma, believed to be a future player in India, has made India's victory easier.

In this year's IPL, three of them, Abhishek Sharma, Ruthuraj Kaikwad and Rinku Singh, scored more than 220 runs.

India decided to bat first and scored 234 runs for the loss of 2 wickets in 20 overs.

India's Shubman Gill (2) was a minor stumbling block in the second over.

However, Abhishek Sharma scored a huge batsman in his 2nd international T20 cricket match and shared 137 runs with Rutraj Kaikwad in the 2nd wicket.
