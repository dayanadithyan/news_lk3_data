### Did the baby dead in delivery?Missing?

*2024-05-26 20:09:00* ┬╖ [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/197037) ┬╖ `si`

A newborn's death during delivery at a new District General Hospital in Matara, Sri Lanka, has sparked controversy. The family alleges poor handling of the situation by the hospital staff, including suspicions about the treatment of the deceased infant. Despite medical confirmation from a private clinic, the hospital initially claimed the baby was stillborn before acknowledging its death. The family was asked to pay for services related to the burial, which led to further dissatisfaction. The hospital's handling of the situation, including the lack of clear communication and potential mismanagement, has raised concerns among the community.

ЁЯЯй

The babies of the babies complained that the staff of the new District General Hospital has not taken steps to show his body or babies that died in giving birth.

They say three stages of the body staff in three occasions that hospital staff are strongly suspicious.

The 24-year-old residents of Weligama, Matara, was included in the New District General Hospital in Matara on the 22nd.

Madushani has joined the private medical clinic of a loyal and gynecologist working at the hospital while the relevant hospital has been selected for childbirth.

The scan has also been confirmed by medical tests on the private clinic, as well as the date of childhood to be included in the private clinic.

The hospital authorities have informed her the first child to create his first child, but died after her baby was dead.

The staff has told the relatives to pay Rs.

When questioned by the child's body, relatives were taken to the staff of relatives regarding the burial or burial to the Colombo National Hospital.

### Sri Lanka hotelier wants rupee to be unit of account to enable external trade

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs unstable exchange rate is making it difficult for businesses to price output across time to foreign counter parties and widely expressed fears of future instability also dented investor confidence, a private entrepreneur said.

Sri LankaтАЩs central bank has since September 2022 provided monetary stability including the elimination of forex shortages with deflationary policy by overshooting its 5 to 7 percent domestic inflation target, providing a strong foundation for growth and economic activities to recover.

However, volatility in the exchange rate was proving troublesome for some businesses as the currency could no longer be used as a unit of account to denominate future prices.

тАЬI heard the word price stability. Yes, thatтАЩs good we have, we have got that,тАЭ Gerard Ondaatjie, a business executive and hotelier said at a recent forum at the Central Bank.

### UN fears 670 people buried under Papua landslide

May 26 (BBC) - About 670 people are estimated to be buried under a massive landslide in Papua New Guinea, a UN official says.

The head of the International Organization for Migration in Papua New Guinea, Serhan Aktoprak, said the impact of Friday's landslide in the country's isolated Enga province was greater than initially thought.

"There are an estimated 150-plus houses now buried," Mr Aktoprak said.

The affected areas are in the highlands of Enga, in the north of the island nation in the south-west Pacific.

Mr Aktoprak said rescuers were at risk because "the land still sliding".

"The water is running and this is creating a massive risk for everyone involved," he said.

There are nearly 4,000 people living in the area hit by the landslide.

But Care Australia, the humanitarian agency which is helping with relief efforts, warned that the number affected was "likely to be higher" because of an influx of people escaping tribal conflicts in neighbouring areas.

A Sri Lankan Tamil refugee living in London, known for running a chicken shop, has been arrested and faces deportation to France due to involvement in abductions. He was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by a French court for his role in abductions. Despite claiming his wife suffers from mental illness, his appeal for stay was denied, leading to his imminent deportation.

Sun has reported that Britain will be deported to France, who has planned to smuggle illegal immigrants into the UK.

The French court last year ruled that he was involved in the abduction and sentenced him to five years in prison.

The refugee who fled to Britain in 2003 from Sri Lanka gave him all the permission to live there.

He lived in a southwestern part of London and worked in a shop selling poultry meat in Brickton.

At the same time, he has also acted as the head of the gang who abducted Sri Lankan people in the last two years.

British officials first arrested him in 2022 on behalf of French officials. On November 2022, a judge ordered him to be deported based on the grip of France.

However, Sivagangan had filed a petition in court, saying that his wife was physically mentally ill.┬аHowever, the judge rejected his petition on Friday.

He was the main person of the European widespread gang operating in many countries of the world, the court document said.

Presidential candidate Donald Trump was booed and heckled by many in a raucous audience at the Libertarian National Convention on Saturday night, a marked change from the adulation he receives at rallies from his fervently loyal supporters.

Libertarians, who believe in limited government and individual freedom, blame Trump, a Republican, for rushing through the creation of a COVID-19 vaccine when he was president and for not doing more to stop public health restrictions on the unvaccinated during the pandemic.

When Trump took to the stage in Washington, there were loud boos and jeers. A smaller section of the crowd, Trump supporters, cheered him.

Shortly before he appeared, one Libertarian Party member shouted: тАЬDonald Trump should have taken a bullet!тАЭ

TrumpтАЩs campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the hostile reception.
