### Decolonizing History & Fiction In Post-Ethnic Sri Lanka

“Fair is foul and foul is fair” ~ William Shakespeare, Macbeth

Why are there no Booker Prize-winning novels about mundane multicultural families that inter-married for generations, shared religion/s, language/s, histories, and co-existed for centuries, while living in relative harmony in Ceylon/ Sri Lanka?

Is the trope of ‘dark natives’ engaged in endless, chaotic violence an international literature prize-winning bestseller that masks white mischief, including sanitized, techno-scientific AI guided hybrid warfare in a post-Truth world awash in distracting Culture Wars?

Susan William’s brilliant and brave book “White Malice” is subtitled “The CIA and the Covert Recolonization of Africa’. Her analysis may well apply to Eurobond debt trapped Sri Lanka, Pakistan and other Afro-Asian post/colonies, where National Endowment for Democracy (NED), funded protests and regime change operations have unfolded recently. NED is known as the second Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

He said this while responding to a question raised by a journalist on Monday (05.08) as to what their position was about the Tamil general candidate.. As he continues,

Relo party supports common candidate. But I do not agree. It is a sapling exam. I have heard the views of the Vanni people. Their position is my position. The general candidate has no support in the Vanni.

The general candidate is not going to win. The Tamil people, including Samasti, praise the aspirations of the Tamil people. But when he gets less votes, there will be a look that the aspirations of the people are not recognized by the Tamil people.
