### The Steps To Achieve Justice In Sri Lanka

Under President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s tenure, the Sri Lankan civil war, which spanned from 1983 to 2009, reached its brutal conclusion on May 18, 2009. This marked the end of a 25-year conflict between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist rebel group. The conflict stemmed from longstanding grievances, including discriminatory policies against the Tamil minority, perpetrated by successive governments dominated by the Sinhala-Buddhist community. The LTTE sought to establish a separate state in the North and East of Sri Lanka, leading to a protracted and violent struggle. During the final stages of the war, an estimated 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed, predominantly in the rebel-hold north of the country (Lynch, 2011). The Sri Lankan military achieved a decisive victory, decimating the entire military leadership of the LTTE, including its leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.

Hamas on Thursday left Gaza ceasefire talks in Cairo where there was no sign of progress just days before the start of Ramadan, while the U.S. said the onus was on the Palestinian militant group to strike a deal on Israeli hostages.

Israel and Hamas blamed each other for the lack of agreement after four days of talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt about a 40-day ceasefire amid fears violence could escalate during the Muslim fasting month.

Egyptian security sources said talks, taking place without an Israeli delegation in Cairo, would resume on Sunday, the expected start of Ramadan.

Senior U.S. administration officials said the onus was on Hamas to complete a hostage deal and attributed the delay to what they described as Hamas so far not agreeing to release sick and elderly hostages.

A Hamas official told Reuters the United States was in partnership with Israel and that such comments were misleading. Hamas has insisted that a ceasefire deal include a process toward ending the war altogether.
