### Bangladesh calm a day after top court scrapped some job quotas

Bangladesh appeared calm on Monday amid a curfew, but widespread disruption of telecoms prevailed a day after the Supreme Court scrapped some quotas for government jobs that sparked protests this month that killed scores.

Clashes between protesters and security forces killed at least 139 people across the South Asian nation after the high court last month reinstated job reservations removed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina‚Äôs government in 2018.

On Sunday, however, the Supreme Court ordered that 93% of government jobs should be allocated on the basis of merit, against earlier quotas of 56% for groups such as families of freedom fighters, women, and people from underdeveloped areas.

There were no reports of violence or protests on Monday morning and media said curfew would be relaxed for three hours in the afternoon, extended from two hours the previous day, so that people could buy essentials.

The petitioners claim that the Minister of Public has issued a gazette notification to release the Shriman Cultivation from the Vedithalthivu Reserve Zone, designated as a reserve monastery.

The gazette notification stated that the Petitions referred to the provisions of the Wildlife and Flora Ordinance and that the migration birds and hydrologicals enter the forest zone.

### Russia is the fourth economic force in the world

*2024-07-22 12:34:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189023) ¬∑ `ta`

In early June, the World Bank ranked Russia as the fourth-largest economy globally based on PPP, surpassing Germany due to cheaper gas and political instability. Russia's economic growth, initially lagging, surged post-Ukraine invasion, aiming for global dominance. Despite challenges, including sanctions and a shift towards militarization, Russia's economy boomed, with the World Bank tripling its growth forecast to 3.2%. However, Russia still trails India and China in size, with the shadow economy potentially underestimating its true GDP.

üü©

According to the World Bank's data, published in early June, the Russian economy has become the fourth developed country in the world based on Purchase- Power and Balance (PPP).

According to PNE report last August, Russia has already behind Germany to become the fifth largest economy. The cheapest Russian gas was cut off, and German has now been stagnant and suffered from recent political events and fell to sixth place in the World Bank rankings.

Purchase-Power-Balance (PPP) and Gross National Production Measurement is preferred by many economists. This is because it takes into account the difference between local prices and nominal prices.

The World Bank has upgraded Russia's ranking after reviewing its data. And Russia says that Japan has actually overtaken Japan in 2021 and has since retained the fourth place since.

Its earlier calculations were based on 2017 data, but these are now updated to reflect 2021 statistics.

While Sri Lanka has scrapped plans to sell a stake in its national carrier, SriLankan Airlines, after foreign offers it sought didn‚Äôt meet up to expectations, government officials say they are pursuing an alternate route which still includes attracting investors to the debt-ridden airline.

He highlighted that, prior to the economic crisis, the Central Bank had the ability to print money as required, which led to an inflation rate as high as 70%.

### Child‚Äôs Guide To Debt & Debt Restructuring: Part III

Aseni, whiz kid in economics, and her grandfather, Sarath Mahatthaya, an ex-official of the Finance Ministry, are having an interactive dialogue on issues relating to debt and debt restructuring, two topics of immense current interest. They have discussed two matters relating to debt restructuring, total foreign debt and its impact on the country‚Äôs indebtedness and the domestic debt optimisation. They continue their discussion.

Aseni: Sri Lanka has increased its foreign borrowing during the post-independence period. For instance, its foreign borrowing at independence in 1948 was a pittance at 4% of GDP. But the total country borrowing at $ 62 billion in December 2023 amounted to 74% of GDP. It is a well-known fact that in ancient times when the country was ruled by Lankan kings, there was no borrowing from abroad to build giant tanks like Parakrama Samudra or pagodas like Rathnamali Maha Seya. How did those kings perform those miracles?
