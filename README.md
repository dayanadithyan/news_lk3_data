### Suspicion

*2024-06-20 09:13:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186514) ¬∑ `ta`

Controversy surrounds the release of land in the Mannar District Vidal Island Natural Sanctuary, with debates over its use for a maritime park or for a private farm. Critics argue against granting permission due to environmental concerns and the impact on fishing activities. The release of 400 acres, initially planned to be 1000 acres, sparked fears among fishermen about the loss of valuable fishing grounds. The process lacks transparency, with the gazette notification in Sinhala lacking detailed information. The District Coordinating Committee decided against leasing the land to local or foreign companies. The Ministry of Fisheries defended the move, emphasizing the importance of the area for fish breeding. However, locals demand more protection for their livelihoods and the environment.

üü©

A special gazette notification was issued on May 6 last year that the Mannar District Vidal Island Natural Sanctuary will be completed in accordance with the authority given to the Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Pavithra Devi Wanniyarachchi.

Various controversies have arisen over the release of the land in the Vidal Island area as the Gazette Notification has been announced that the land belonging to the Forest Department has been released to maritime park/maritime.

In particular, there were various arguments over the release of the land during the Mannar District Development Committee meeting held last week.

In the name of development, he said that the maritime park, which was destroyed by the natural continental forests and preventing fishing activities, could not be granted permission.

Taxation needs to be looked at from a different perspective and models of taxation need to be examined. Taxation should be looked at as part of a social contract between a government and the people who pay tax. It is part of a partnership between the government and the public and it must give a sense of ownership to the public that their money is being used judiciously for their benefit. Besides this, they must have a belief that their taxes are investments, not just expenses, and that they will have a return on their investment. Better hospitals, better schools and universities, better roads, better transport and more affordable energy costs are some returns they should be able to expect with their taxes.
