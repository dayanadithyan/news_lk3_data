### October Revolution, women’s revolution and SJB’s economic ignorance

*2024-02-29 00:59:41* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/October-Revolution-women-s-revolution-and-SJB-s-economic-ignorance/4-758965) · `en`

It is a mood and movement of the masses powered by layered generations of the state university educated modern middle-class, led by its organised vanguard intelligentsia (the JVP leadership comprising former university student leaders) and affiliated or networked intelligentsia (the NPP leadership). The JVP is leftist, of a Marxist-Leninist formation; the NPP, left-inclined.

It is a revolution with a vision of modernisation and inclusive, non-discriminatory nation-building. The modernisation is not led by the bourgeois elite but the educated middle-classes. It is not statist, but is not anti-state, coming as it does from the beneficiaries of state education and professionals of the public sector. In terms of ethos, the state university educated generations have residual socialist sympathies.

Following a long spell of about five months of rainfall in most parts of the country, especially in the wet zone which devastated the agriculture in those areas, the country has begun to experience seemingly a similar long spell of drought which seems to be carrying devastating effects on the same farming community.

It might have a huge effect on hydro power generation as well, making in turn a negative bearing on the electricity consumers who have already been hit hard by two consecutive tariff hikes within a short period with relatively massive margins such as 70 percent. Interestingly, the authorities responsible for supplying electricity to the country (who refused to reduce the electricity tariff during the recent rainy period despite repeated requests by various groups in the country) are going to reduce the tariffs by 18 percent now, according to media reports.
