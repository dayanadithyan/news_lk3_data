### Elite establishment’s last stand

*2024-09-19 02:17:04* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Elite-establishment-s-last-stand/4-766866) · `en`

It was always going to come to this. The first Sri Lankan election in generations where even a remotely leftist party stood a chance of winning was always going to end with an almighty Red Scare. So it is that the presidential campaign of National People’s Power (NPP) candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) is inspiring lurid visions of an impending violent, dystopian regime, splayed across news and social media. This is the prophecy of the Sri Lankan elite establishment, a select cross section of the country’s businesspeople, policymakers, professionals, journalists and academics who have been proximate to state power, especially in the last two years. Scrutiny of them and their crescendoing hysteria reveals much about how power and privilege work in Sri Lanka, and what happens when their wielders are threatened.

### Economic stakes of the 2024 Presidential election

*2024-09-19 02:05:08* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Economic-stakes-of-the-2024-Presidential-election/14-766863) · `en`

As Sri Lanka gears up for elections, policymakers must avoid rash economic promises that risk a decade of lost growth and an era of relative decline.

As too often in the past, Sri Lanka appears not to have broken its damaging tendency towards ‘competitive populism’ ahead of elections. Fiscally profligate promises ranging from wage increases to loan write-offs and welfare handouts are being made in a bid to win votes. Such pledges often come with a hefty price tag that the country can ill afford, especially given its still fragile economic recovery.

### Raja Bhavatu Dhammiko: May the ruler be righteous

*2024-09-19 02:02:27* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Raja-Bhavatu-Dhammiko-May-the-ruler-be-righteous/4-766862) · `en`

When we reflect on our current predicament we can see how we have treaded the vicious instead of the virtuous cycle expounded in the Dhamma

At the end of almost all Buddhist chantings and during Independence Day celebrations we hear this four-line stanza being chanted. Over the years this has become part of our culture. May be because of that we have forgotten to reflect on the deeper meaning of this wish. It is a blueprint for a comprehensive governance system for the nation.

The four wishes though appearing to be independent are in fact interdependent.

If one refers to the Agganna Sutta (DN2), when the king is not righteous the minister becomes the same and so would the officers and eventually the people to move away from the righteousness. This would impact the total ecosystem which results in poor harvest; when the harvest is poor the population becomes poor. This is a vicious cycle.

### Political culture will keep changing for better, with or without NPP

*2024-09-19 01:59:35* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Political-culture-will-keep-changing-for-better-with-or-without-NPP/4-766861) · `en`

As it turns out, the winning proposition of the NPP is the new political culture they hope to usher in.

According to the interview of Anura Kumara Dissanayake (or AKD) of the National People’s Power (NPP) party carried out by Kalindu Karunaratne of Ada Derana on 16 September, NPP has all but conceded the economic issues. What remains is a new political culture of austerity, self-sacrifice and accountability which leaders will demonstrate, and others will emulate. The new political culture is expected to catalyse the socio-economic changes needed to take the country forward.

The good news for the country and the bad news for NPP is that the political culture has changed and will keep changing, with or without the NPP. Further changes will happen not because of a cadre of austere and self-sacrificing politicians, but institutions, laws and economic realities, and social norms driven by these.

### Election 2024 choices for change: Weaponised negativism or progressive centrism

*2024-09-19 01:55:24* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Election-2024-choices-for-change-Weaponised-negativism-or-progressive-centrism/4-766860) · `en`

Unless you reject change and vote Ranil, the choice is between two types of change-- as represented by Anura and Sajith.

Anura represents the risk of uncertain, disequilibrating, ‘wild’ change, mainly from below.

Sajith represents the assurance of steady, stable, sustainable, constructive, calibrated change, mainly from above.

As a boy one thing I picked up from Mervyn de Silva, my father, is that every story has to be checked from more than one side and source, and that “the truth usually lies somewhere in the middle”.

This month, September, would have marked his 95th birthday had he lived, but he died with his 70th birthday just out of reach. He’s the one after whom the pinnacle prize of the Annual Journalism Awards presented by the Editors’ Guild and the Publishers’ Society– the Mervyn de Silva Journalist of the Year-- is named.

That’s why in politics I tend to look for the position in-between; the third space—and to persuade players to occupy that space.

### Voting with no confidence

*2024-09-19 01:48:31* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Voting-with-no-confidence/4-766859) · `en`

We the voters fail to understand that we are only getting cheated

Twenty-two million Sri Lankans are expected to have another leader for the nation after the national election on 21 September. It is interesting that the Election Commissioner is still expressing the potential leaders concern on rahu times! I wrote on voting without much confidence (https://www.ft.lk/columns/My-vote-goes-to-Voting-without-much-confidence/4-688684) just ahead of the last election as I felt the manifestos really did not offer credible and scientifically sound steps to alleviate national issues and also the fact that simple motherhood statements lack coherence with the candidate – the credibility gap!

### Presidenshel Elecshen Gide

Oll are saying that this PE will be the first one decided on a Second Count! Which means the Manaapey olso matters! But before Manaapey counting, first Number 1 & 2 will be decided and then the Manaapeys on every other PEC is counted and winner declared! It is like a game of Musical Chairs, thirty peeples playing, suddenly there is ONLY ONE CHAIR & TWO PEEPLES! And the votes of the eliminated players will determine the winner!

Then you have five happy years of telling the peeples from time to time, “I told you so!”

The day you sit on that chair, everything changes. I know peeples say “The Putuwa won’t change me” I olso said it, before I sat in it, (My dear Frend Wikrama knows oll about this, when he got the Putuwa on a platter from me!) but once you sit on that Putuwa, there are things you must learn to do, you must be SELECTIVE!

SELECT:  What you hear / Who speaks to you / What you remember / Who and What you ignore  (applicable to your manifesto as well)

### Who should be our leader?

*2024-09-19 01:32:54* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Who-should-be-our-leader/4-766855) · `en`

The choice of the most suitable Presidential candidate for Sri Lanka depends on several key factors, including the candidate’s vision for economic recovery, governance, accountability, and social welfare, among other areas. Here are a few qualities and areas of focus that could guide the evaluation of a suitable candidate:

Economic expertise: Given Sri Lanka’s ongoing economic challenges, including debt restructuring and inflation, a candidate with strong economic management skills is essential. They should have a track record in promoting sustainable development, attracting investment, and creating jobs.

Reform-oriented mindset: The candidate should prioritise structural reforms in governance, the judiciary, and public institutions. Addressing corruption and implementing transparency measures are key to restoring public confidence.

### Great import/re-export scam set to destroy local production

*2024-09-19 01:24:14* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Great-import-re-export-scam-set-todestroylocal-production/4-766854) · `en`

In the run up to the Presidential Elections,  what is very visible to the public eye  are  the many incentives, bribes/handouts, gifting of lands, housing, increased Aswesuma  payments, jobs, write off of farmer debts, salary increases, PAYE tax reductions. “You name it and you get it” kind of inducements are given  to all and sundry. This  is practically at the expense of the people and the scarce resources of a bankrupt and  indebted nation.

This article attempts to expose the more insidious and hidden opportunities given to traders and their political supporters alike for circumvention and fraud to thrive in international trade. This is particularly so since it is on the eve of the elections that the Presidential Candidate who is also the Head of the Finance Ministry has decided  to restore some of the concessions hitherto subject to malpractice, misuse and abuse in the import of items for purported value addition and re-export under certain Free Trade Agreements.

Even in Parliament, Sajith retreated on that day, knowing that he could not get too much votes against Ranil Wickremesinghe.. How can such a person win the votes of the majority of the people?
