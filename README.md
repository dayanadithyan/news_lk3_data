Biden, who was traveling in South Carolina, asked for a moment of silence during an appearance at a Baptist church’s banquet hall.

“We had a tough day last night in the Middle East. We lost three brave souls in an attack on one of our bases,” he said. After the moment of silence, Biden added, “and we shall respond.”

Political critics point out that there will be a powerful factor to produce a government or to select a government in Tamil political parties and the support of the country's minorities in the coming elections.

The minority baliary has increased to 31 percent in Sri Lanka.

Political commentators also stated that the general election and the presidential election will depend on the way Tamil political parties will be supported.

These conditions may be very different with the political leadership that is known to the North and East as well as the plantation.

The support of the Ilangaitamil Auru Kachchi party and support of the Muslim parties will be the same.

Sri Lanka's Sinhala political party leaders have also paid close attention to the victory of the Ilangai Thamil Arascaki.

The reason is that the TNA leader appears to be the leader of the TNA and the leader of the Tamil National Alliance.

“While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq,” Biden said in a statement.

“Have no doubt - we will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing,” he said.

Biden later asked for a moment of silence for the three killed service members during a campaign event in South Carolina, adding, “We shall respond.”
