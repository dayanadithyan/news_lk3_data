The evolving economic ties between India and Sri Lanka present significant opportunities for growth and collaboration

Sri Lanka‚Äôs recent economic turmoil and recovery efforts present a complex narrative marked by internal challenges and external macroeconomic shocks. The economic crisis disrupted the financial landscape, leading to significant international involvement, mainly through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and strategic partnerships with neighbouring countries like India.

India‚Äôs participation in Sri Lanka‚Äôs recovery process underscores its economic and strategic interests in the island nation. As the first bilateral creditor to provide financial assurances to the IMF, India was crucial in facilitating Sri Lanka‚Äôs bailout program. This financial support, totalling around $ 4 billion, included multiple credit lines and currency support, highlighting India‚Äôs commitment to regional stability amid Sri Lanka‚Äôs economic downturn.
