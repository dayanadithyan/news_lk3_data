No one in the government talks about the child who arrived on top of Sri Lanka and arriving in the country of the country.

### Astronomers finally detect a rocky planet with an atmosphere

WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Astronomers have searched for years for rocky planets beyond our solar system with an atmosphere - a trait considered essential for any possibility of harboring life. Well, they finally seem to have located one. But this hellish planet - apparently with a surface of molten rock - offers no hope for habitability.

Researchers said on Wednesday the planet is a "super-Earth" - a rocky world significantly larger than our planet but smaller than Neptune - and it orbits perilously close to a star dimmer and slightly less massive than our sun, rapidly completing an orbit every 18 hours or so.

Infrared observations using two instruments aboard the James Webb Space Telescope indicated the presence of a substantial - if inhospitable - atmosphere, perhaps continuously replenished by gases released from a vast ocean of magma.

The government must completely digitize services offered by border agents, including Sri Lanka Customs, to ensure that the cost of exports and the cost of living is to be reduced.

Although Sri Lanka's customs are steadily operating and fully digitalized services during the epidemic, the agency returned to the manual process in the post -infection period, causing corruption with delays and additional expenses.

‚ÄúContinuing governments do not have the motivation and vision of going to digitalization. Each rupee that is formed at port's transportation cost will come back to you. It is sent to the customer, so the cost of living is increasing.

With this media briefing, we urge the government to implement a complete digitalization, as this is not a neglecting issue in today's global economy, ‚Äùsaid Global Shippers Forum President Sean Wan Dard.

He warned that Sri Lankan exporters would lose their market share in exports as other countries in the region would come up with full digital services.

‚ÄúOne could question whether Gamage who has been declared as a non-citizen of this country could register a political party. One could also question whether the MOU signed by SJB General Secretary with Ms.Gamage is legally valid.

Further the validity of nomination papers signed by Gamage for certain MPs is also questionable,‚Äù the Minister said.

‚ÄúSome SJB MPs whom I chatted with at the House canteen informed me that they were worried about yesterday‚Äôs judgment of the Supreme Courts which ruled that Gamage cannot function as an MP as she is not a citizen of Sri Lanka.

They are concerned since they may have to give up their MP posts,‚Äù he added.

The new reconciliation team opposes the establishment of a Reconciliation Commission, arguing for international monitoring and questioning its timing in relation to the election.

üü©

The Reconciliation Commission is renewed. We are fully opposed to this.

Speaking at a debate on diplomatic privilege on Wednesday (08) in Parliament, he said.

We do not accept the fact that the Foreign Minister's attempt to set up a Reconciliation Commission is correct. We will not accept that the fight is conducting investigations into it. These investigations should be held with international monitoring. We have already emphasized this. The Minister should take note of it. He said that there would be a chance of a justification. .

In this way, this reconciliation commission should have international surveillance.. In the past, the reconciliation commissions have been set up and our people have expressed their views. Were told the secrets. But the decree committees were to dissolve.

Now a new reconciliation commission is being launched. We are completely opposed to this. At this time, the question of whether the reconciliation commission is set up to the election.

### Why did Minister Tiran Alles sign  the outsourcing deal with VFS Global when there‚Äôs no rationale for outsourcing since Lankan officials have been handling on-arrival visas since 2012 without a problem.

On every side are seen the burial ground of dreams.‚Äù Faiz Ahmed Faiz (The Subject of Poetry)

President Ranil Wickremesinghe expects Lankan rupee to appreciate further and reach 280 per dollar by June. Namal Karunaratna, a leading light of the NPP/JVP, states that rupee will start sliding soon, reaching 400-500 per dollar. He dismisses the rupee‚Äôs strong performance as a fluke caused by a recent spate of dollar loans.

Karunaratne‚Äôs analysis is wrong. The rupee is gaining mainly due to the boom in tourism and influx of foreign remittances. As some independent analysts have pointed out, the value of the rupee could fall in the second half of the year if vehicle imports are allowed. But the rupee would plunge to the depths of Karunaratne‚Äôs expectations only if the Wickremesinghe administration makes a Gotabaya-style error.

### Post-May Day political balance and scenarios

Tyrannical Tiran Alles is about to learn a lesson in politics that his distinguished, respected father would have taught him had he been around. The worst time to play tough guy is in an election year with six months max to go to vote. Citizens (including officials) are impatient to vote, and are unintimidated because they know they have the power to bring the whole power structure down soon, if they so wish.

The Minister concerned is an unelected parliamentarian whose name has figured in disclosures by whistleblowing international journalists. He is attempting a witch-hunt against an articulate, courageous, mediagenic young man. He has antagonised the socially confident, sophisticated travel industry. Whatever his power (and cross-party connections), he is on a very slippery slope and may start the rockslide that takes the administration down with him.
