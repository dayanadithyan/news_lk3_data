### Deshamanya Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne: A rare personality above normal human frailty

*2024-06-14 03:31:49* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Deshamanya-Dr-Nissanka-Wijeyeratne-A-rare-personality-above-normal-human-frailty/4-763059) ┬╖ `en`

I have not met Deshamanya Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne, known to everyone as Nissanka, in person. I have watched him performing as a civil servant and minister, listened to his speeches, and spoken to his friends to know enough about him to pen this appreciation on his 100th birth anniversary falling on 14 June.

I will focus on two matters. One is his success as the lay custodian of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha known as Diyawadana Nilame in Sinhala which can be directly rendered to English as the Water Bearing Official. The other is his rare display of accountability as the Minister of Justice when there was a jail breakout and prison mutiny leading to the death of two inmates in 1988.

### Beyond CSR: Looking inward for social┬аimpact

The true essence of CSR is its integration into the very fabric of a companyтАЩs operations

For years now, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been a buzzword among both development and private sectors. It is easily one of the most misinterpreted concepts тАУ its essence diluted when communicated and implemented within the corporate world. Businesses often misunderstand and misapply the concept of CSR: rather than integrating CSR into core business practices, the trend is a stronger focus on charitable initiatives. While still commendable, businesses can start by looking inward and truly embracing CSR with a deeper, more authentic approach that embodies company policies, practices, and culture.

A few right-thinking sports ministers tried to change the constitution governing cricket in the country to address emerging issues, but they failed before the processes even commenced

Sovereignty can generally be defined as supreme authority. In any State, sovereignty is assigned to the person, body or institution that has the ultimate authority over other people to establish a law or change existing laws. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme legitimate authority over some States.

At the outset a nationтАЩs sovereignty is vested on its citizens and they use it to elect their representatives to a national assembly to carry out the affairs of the nation for a given period of time. In a democratic setup voters use their sovereign power to elect their representatives to manage the affairs for the benefit of the nation and in return be accountable to the nation on its affairs.

I will focus on two matters. One is his success as the lay custodian of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha known as Diyawadana Nilame in Sinhala which can be directly rendered to English as the Water Bearing Official. The other is his rare display of accountability as the Minister of Justice when there was a jail breakout and prison mutiny leading to the death of two inmates in 1988.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri LankaтАЩs female tea pluckers do not get promoted as male tea pluckers do, Minister of Estate Infrastructure Jeevan Thondaman said.

тАЬI know educated women who are plucking tea because they are not getting into management, and I know less than qualified men who are in management positions. Why? Because they know how to order people around,тАЭ Thondaman told EconomyNext.

A study done by Verite Research in 2022 shows that the estate sectorтАЩs economically active population is 404,002 out of which 167,156 are women.

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka will allow courts to sell vehicles and machineries seized by courts due to their suspicious involvement in crimes to preserve foreign exchange and minimal usage of lands, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.

The island nation has witnessed thousands of courts-seized vehicles end up in unusable conditions because of long duration to conclude court cases for crimes.

тАЬThere is no clear law on assets and properties that are seized in court cases,тАЭ Rajapakshe told reporters at a media briefing on Wednesday (12).

тАЬWe have come up with laws on that including the one, which is on the assets involved with court cases. We know that there are goods worth over billions of rupees corroding after being seized by courts. If somebody has used a vehicle or machine in a crime, the court is compelled to keep them with its custody until the legal case is over.тАЭ

He said keeping such assets for long duration has become a huge issue for courts because it needs lands.
