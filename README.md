The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed deep concern about the recent remarks made by certain Members of Parliament condemning the invocation of Supreme CourtтАЩs fundamental rights jurisdiction by a citizen to challenge the issuance of liquor licenses.

Reiterating that every citizen has a fundamental right to seek redress from the Supreme Court, the apex court of the country, as enshrined in the Constitution, the BASL said this right cannot be curtailed under the guise of parliamentary privileges.

Accordingly, it has categorically condemned the claims made by these MPs suggesting otherwise.

The BASL, in a statement issued on Wednesday (03), said it views with grave concern that any attempts to use parliamentary privileges to interfere with the independence of the judiciary directly or indirectly.

It also emphasized that it would, under no circumstances, remain silent when attempts are made to weaken the independence of the judiciary.

The humanitarian crisis is in danger of intensifying the killing of humanitarian workers in Gaza, following the suspension of their humanitarian tasks.

Following the killing of seven humanitarian employees in the attack on World Central Kitchen's vehicle, many organizations involved in Gaza have suspended their work in view of the safety of their employees.

The Anara, a charity, has said that this is never a matter of fact, and we have come to the conclusion that there is no safeguard for humanitarian assistance as many humanitarian employees and their families have been killed.

We understand the worst effects of humanitarian aid suspension, but the risk of increasing during humanitarian aid distribution has created a position to suspend our tasks until our employees think they can work again.

Last month, the UN said that hunger and poverty could be developed at any time in Gaza.

Oxfam said the number of hunger facing hunger in the Palestinian region has increased several times.
