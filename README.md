*2024-01-29 15:53:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/175075) · `ta`

சாந்தனின் உடல் நிலையை கருத்தில்கொண்டும் இந்த அவசர சூழ்நிலையை கருத்தில் கொண்டும் இந்திய அரசும் மத்திய அரசும் தமிழக அரசும் இலங்கை அரசும் உடனடியாக நடவடிக்கைகளை எடுக்கவேண்டும் என தமிழ்தேசிய மக்கள் முன்னணி வேண்டுகோள் விடுத்துள்ளது.

முன்னாள் இந்திய பிரதமர் ராஜீவ்காந்தி கொலை வழக்கில் நீண்டகாலமாக சிறைத்தண்டனை அனுபவித்தவர்கள் இந்திய உச்சநீதிமன்றத்தால் விடுதலை செய்யப்பட்டபோதும் அவர்கள் சிறப்பு முகாமில் தடுத்துவைக்கப்பட்டு சிறைக்கைதிகள் போல தமது வாழ்வை அனுபவித்து வருகின்றார்கள்.இவர்களில் இலங்கையை சேர்ந்தவர்கள் தாங்கள் இலங்கைக்கு சென்று குடும்பத்தவர்களுடன் இணைந்து வாழகோரிக்கை விடுத்துள்ள போதிலும் இன்றுவரை அவர்களின் கோரிக்கைகள் நிறைவேற்றப்படவில்லை.

இந்த நிலையில் சாந்தன் குடும்பத்தினரின் வேண்டுகோளிற்கு இணங்க தமிழ்தேசிய மக்கள் முன்னணி மூன்றாம் திகதி இந்திய துணைத்தூதுவரை சந்தித்த இந்திய உயர்நீதிமன்றத்தினால் விடுதலை செய்யப்பட்டவர்கள் தங்கள் குடும்பத்துடன் இணைந்து வாழவழிசெய்யவேண்டும் என வேண்டுகோள் விடுத்திருந்தது.

President Joe Biden said Sunday that the U.S. “shall respond” after three American troops were killed and dozens more were injured in an overnight drone strike in northeast Jordan near the Syrian border. Biden blamed Iran-backed militias for the first U.S. fatalities after months of strikes by such groups against American forces across the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.

Biden, who was traveling in South Carolina, asked for a moment of silence during an appearance at a Baptist church’s banquet hall.

“We had a tough day last night in the Middle East. We lost three brave souls in an attack on one of our bases,” he said. After the moment of silence, Biden added, “and we shall respond.”
