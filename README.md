A day earlier, the two had attended ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, where Biden had drawn common cause between the allied forces that helped free Europe from Nazi Germany and today’s effort to support Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and Zelenskyy had been greeted with a rapt ovation.

### Weapon - Review

*2024-06-07 17:19:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185551) · `ta`

"Review: 'Weapon' features Sathyaraj, Vasanth Ravi, and others in a sci-fi tale where a serum turns a man into a superhuman. Despite engaging modern tech elements like AI, the plot lacks depth on its purpose and side effects. Sathyaraj shines as the superhuman, but the film misses opportunities for humor and clarity. Tanya Hope and Rajiv Menon deliver strong performances amidst a storyline that could benefit from more focus on social development and less on indiscriminate violence."

Actors: Sathyaraj, Vasanth Ravi, Tanya Hope, Rajiv Menon, Mime Gopi, Velu Prabhakaran, Vinodini Vaidyanathan and many others.

Fans expecting a run-fest were left disappointed when Sri Lanka were bowled out for 77 -- their lowest ever score -- against South Africa, while India bowled out Ireland for 96 in Wednesday’s one-sided contest.

“T20 Inc and the ICC recognise that the pitches used so far at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium have not played as consistently as we would have all wanted,” the ICC said in a statement.

Dutch voters have begun four days of voting across the European Union, with exit polls suggesting a tight race between a left-green alliance and the party of anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.

Right-wing and far-right parties are widely expected to make big gains in many of the EU’s 27 member states, and that appears to have been borne out in the Netherlands, to an extent.

Although the Green-Labour alliance is set to take more seats in the European Parliament according to the exit poll, Mr Wilders’ Freedom Party is on course for big gains.

But he has not repeated the runaway victory of last November’s general election.

Under European law final results are not released until every country has voted, late on Sunday evening. Some 373 million Europeans are eligible to vote in the world’s second biggest democratic election after India.
