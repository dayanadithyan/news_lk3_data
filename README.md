### Telecom Act amendments donтАЩt address the future: Are they at least fixing flaws from the past?

*2024-05-16 00:40:44* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Telecom-Act-amendments-don-t-address-the-future-Are-they-at-least-fixing-flaws-from-the-past/4-761833) ┬╖ `en`

The country is changing. Apartments and condominiums are popping up everywhere. Technology and markets are changing. Navigating the streets without Google maps seems unthinkable. Data consumed in a month 25 years ago is now consumed in a few hours.

The world is changing. Stories about vehicles that are communicating our braking patterns back to the manufacturer and insurance companies do not seem like science fiction, though we know our cars (and our insurance companies) are not like that, yet.

The future is already here; itтАЩs just not very evenly distributed, as William Gibson, the writer, says. Are our laws ready for the future? Are they at least adequate for the present?

### Sri LankaтАЩs amended Telecommunications Bill should be sent back to the drawing board

*2024-05-16 00:37:02* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-amended-Telecommunications-Bill-should-be-sent-back-to-the-drawing-board/4-761832) ┬╖ `en`

It is critical that the Government puts a stop to its conservative and traditional approach to telecoms regulation and handles it in a way that will ensure that digital connectivity spurs the development of the nation

Sri LankaтАЩs Telecommunications Act first came into force in 1991. It was subsequently amended in 1996. There have been no further amendments or revisions to the Act since then, although there have been several (but failed) attempts to update this legacy Act over the years. An amended Bill has now been sent to Parliament for consideration and is expected to be debated by the countryтАЩs lawmakers in the next few weeks.

One would think that the legislation governing one of the most dynamic and critical sectors should have kept up with the times, but here we are 28 years later, attempting to maintain a historical artefact and supplement it with piecemeal amendments, in the hope that this will help sustain digital development for the next decade and more.

### Stolen Assets Recovery Framework: There is much room for improvement

*2024-05-16 00:00:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Stolen-Assets-Recovery-Framework-There-is-much-room-for-improvement/172-282665) ┬╖ `en`

The rallying call for recovering stolen assets during the 2022 protests is still fresh in our minds. If the Abacha loot could be returned to Nigeria by Switzerland, could Sri Lanka not do the same?

In response to the protests and building on the work done by experts over many years, the agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and the IMF now contains a structural benchmark where the GoSL has committed to enact a Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) in keeping with international standards by April 2024.

In March 2023, the Minister of Justice appointed a committee chaired by Supreme Court Justice Yasantha Kodagoda. Dated April 10, 2024, the182-page report of the POCA Committee, now available on the website of the Ministry of Justice, sets out a framework for an upcoming Proceeds of Crime Act.

The current framework is a good start with room for improvement

### Family is the first essential cell of human society

*2024-05-16 00:00:00* ┬╖ [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Family-is-the-first-essential-cell-of-human-society/172-282664) ┬╖ `en`

Families stay together if they regularly pray or meditate together. This is a hallowed philosophy that goes a long way to show that good families make good societies and countries. We need to see unity in diversity in families with none dominating or having his/her way. Family members need to be sacrificial and forgiving, embodying values of love, peace, joy, patience, kindness, humility, gentleness and meekness. Some believe the husband is the head of the family and must take the final decision on important issues, but this has been proven to be wrong. The right way is a collective decision by the husband, wife and grown up children. If all family members have an attitude of foot-washing service to others, it will set a good example to the neighbourhood and provide a solid base for the country of good citizens who are concerned not only about themselves, but about the future of the country and the future generations.

### Change, not continuity is imperative for consensus, stability and recovery

*2024-05-15 23:43:43* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Change-not-continuity-is-imperative-for-consensus-stability-and-recovery/4-761831) ┬╖ `en`

Basil RajapaksaтАЩs idea of a snap Parliamentary election proceeds from the ruling partyтАЩs viewpoint that it has a better chance of survival while its partner Ranil holds office and controls the administration.

There is no guarantee though, that if and when that Parliamentary election is held, Ranil wonтАЩt tell the country тАЬOk, now youтАЩve had your election for this yearтАЭ, and press тАШpauseтАЩ on the scheduled Presidential election.

That is almost exactly what happened in 1982. We had one national election but not the other. The Presidential election was in October 1982, and JR Jayewardene won. The Parliamentary election was scheduled for early 1983, but a Referendum was held instead in December 1982 which the UNP coercively and fraudulently won, and the Parliamentary election was postponed. That lit the fuse that led to Black July 1983, two civil wars (North and South), and foreign military intervention.

### Indian travelersтАЩ boycott of Maldives is helping Sri Lanka, says Tourism Minister

### At least 16 Sri Lankans killed fighting in Russia-Ukraine war

Those who joined had been duped with promises of high salaries and falsely told they would be given non-combat roles, Waleboda said.

Tennakoon said the recruitment of Sri Lankans was being treated as a human trafficking enterprise and urged military officers not to fall prey to the recruitment drive.

A High Court in Pakistan on Wednesday granted bail to Imran Khan in the 190 million pounds corruption case, in which the jailed former prime minister and his wife are accused of receiving land worth billions of rupees as a bribe from a real estate tycoon.

A two-member bench of the Islamabad High Court had reserved the verdict on Tuesday after the completion of arguments.

On Wednesday, the court asked Khan to submit a surety bond of Rs 1 million in order to secure bail. However, the order will not result in the ex-premierтАЩs release from Adiala jail since his sentences in the Iddat and cypher cases are yet to be suspended.

In December last year, the National Accountability Bureau initiated an investigation against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, and others in a case of alleged acquisition of hundreds of canals of land under the name of Al Qadir University Trust, resulting in a reported loss of 190 million pounds to the exchequer.
