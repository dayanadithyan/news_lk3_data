### Sri Lanka reports US$706mn current account surplus amid financial outflows

ECONOMYNEXT тАУ Sri Lanka has recorded a 706 million US dollar current account surplus in the first quarter of 2024 as the financial account recorded a deficit amid private and official debt repayments and reserve collections, data show.

Sri Lanka has recorded current account surpluses, since the last quarter of 2022 when monetary stability is reached.

The current account is a mirror image of the financial and capital accounts, subject to errors and omissions.

The way external accounting is calculated, only the balance of payments surplus and deficit (as defined) can be accurately measured.

Whether there is a balance of payments deficit or surplus depends on the note-issue activities of the central bank.

When money is printed through reverse repo or standing facilities, regardless of a budget deficit or surplus, there are foreign exchange shortages, making it difficult to make foreign payments, especially in the capital account, leading to a run down of reserve and eventual default.

### Anti-Corruption Act: Why is file failing?

*2024-07-02 02:06:52* ┬╖ [`bbccomsinhala`](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala/articles/c6p231z2vrqo) ┬╖ `si`

The Anti-Corruption Act, passed in Parliament and effective since August 8, 2023, aimed to combat bribery and corruption by enhancing the powers of the Bribery Commission. However, legal challenges have arisen, particularly regarding the appointment of a Director General under the new Act before filing charges. This has led to the dismissal of cases against high-profile individuals like former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal and others, not due to lack of evidence but due to procedural issues related to the Act's implementation.

ЁЯЯй

The anti-corruption act of the government was passed in Parliament last year with the objective of eliminating bribery and corruption.

The bill was implemented as a law from August 8, 2023.

The Bribery Commission (Investigation Commission) Act was completely abolished with the implementation of the bill.

Bribery or Corruption Commission has been given extensive legal authorities to suppress bribery or corruption under the Anti-Corruption Act.

The Commission points out that more than a previous situation, the Commission has received extensive legal power and cover to investigate bribery or corruption charges.

This flawed system provides the assessor a great deal of authority and gives them the opportunity to pocket a buck for themselves

By 1 April 2025 the Government proposes to implement a wealth tax by way of an тАЬimputed rental incomeтАЭ on property as a precursor to a land tax. In simple terms the meaning of тАЬimputed rental incomeтАЭ is the estimated rental income of a property if it were rented. The mere assumption of a rental income is very much subjective and cannot in any effect be a guide to govern taxes.

In reality, imputed rent is exactly what the Local Councils are already obtaining from property owners by way of Municipality Rates. Hence the new тАЬimputed rental incomeтАЭ is just a facade to re-tax the citizen who is already taxed twice over on the same income, first by the Municipality on the imputed rent and secondly by the Inland Revenue based on actual income of the same property.

In the late 1970s, during the rising tide of neoliberal globalisation, many countries in the Global South opened up their economies to foreign capital in order to build a so-called export-oriented economy. The ethos that drove such reforms can be divided into two camps:

In China, pragmatism prevailed, with Chairman Deng Xiaoping stating, тАЬTo cross the river, feel for the stones.тАЭ

In Sri Lanka, there was an ideological faith in markets and foreign capital, with then President J.R. Jayewardene stating, тАЬLet the robber barons come.тАЭ

Today, one of these countries has defaulted on its external debt and is undergoing its 17th IMF program. The other is the worldтАЩs factory, contributing to over 35% of global manufacturing value-added and expected to lead the next business cycle. No prizes for guessing which is which.
