### Is a “production economy” the solution?

*2024-01-30 00:07:59* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Is-a-production-economy-the-solution/4-757912) · `en`

Is the Government capable of identifying what we should produce for export? Isn’t it better to leave that to the entrepreneurs? What can the Government do? Remove whatever barriers enterprises face. If information gaps exist, help bridge them. But in many cases the most helpful thing Government can do is to improve infrastructure services

Every few years, Sri Lanka’s weakness in manufacturing comes up as the cause of our economic malaise. Economic growth through services is not real, they argue. In the most recent iteration, the slogan is that of a production economy, code for manufacturing.

### Politics without substance or substance without politics? People have a choice

It will be interesting to make an assessment of what Sri Lankan leaders have been demonstrating vis a vis the ideals and objectives of the World Economic Forum

Sri Lankans need to be told the truth by all political parties. Their credibility will hinge on this. Solutions to address this truth might be different, but they need to be based on the true situation the country is in. What is the true situation? It is that the country is in debt to the hilt, its current GDP growth would not allow it to repay the debts, and if they are not honoured, the country will not be able to borrow any more even for development work, let alone for consumption

The Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum for the year 2024 is held from 15-19 January in Davos, Switzerland, under the theme ‘Rebuilding Trust’. It aims to restore collective agency, and reinforce the fundamental principles of transparency, consistency, and accountability among leaders.

No law abiding person who wants a country free of crimes and the drug menace would belittle or discourage a campaign launched by the authorities to accomplish that purpose. In the same breath, on the very ground of being a law-abiding person, he/she would not like to see the campaign tarnished by possible or apparent personal agendas of anyone or any group and the highhanded activities of the personnel on the ground.

### The Contribution of Siam and Burma to Buddhism in Sri Lanka

It is well known that monks from Siam and Burma (as Thailand and Myanmar were called earlier) helped stem a decline in the practice of Buddhism, and contributed to its democratization in Sri Lanka during certain periods in the island’s history.

The circumstances which necessitated help from Siam and Burma, the process of securing such help, the role of the Dutch in it, and the  results of foreign involvement are vividly described by Auckland University sociologist Kitsiri Malalgoda in his book Buddhism in Sinhalese Society 1750-1900 (Tambapanni Academic Publishers, Colombo, 2023).

### A crisis of confidence

*2024-01-29 22:46:22* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/A-crisis-of-confidence/4-757888) · `en`

The hills are alive in Davos, with the sounds of failure. Conversations used to be about taking advantage of the global playing field that US presidents and their allies were seeking to build after World War II and after the end of the Cold War. Companies now, and countries themselves, are seeking to understand how to ameliorate the risks of a new, emerging, seemingly chaotic world order.

Yes, it was recently that time of year, as corporate chieftains, policy makers, NGO “warriors”, so-called journalists and self-styled intellectuals went invading the Swiss Alps for the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. Their anthem was “rebuilding trust.” After devastating trust on so many fronts this was a bold aspiration.

### Sri Lanka’s new transitional justice process lacks credibility – HRW

The Sri Lankan government’s proposed law to create another body to investigate wartime abuses replicates previous failed efforts, ignores the needs of victims, and falls far short of meeting Sri Lanka’s international legal obligations, Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday (29 Jan.).

In a statement, the Human Rights Watch claimed that “Sri Lankan authorities continue to silence and repress families of victims and their communities 15 years after the armed conflict ended”.

The Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka Bill was published on January 1, 2024, following limited consultations in 2023 and government pledges to investigate human rights violations and war crimes committed during the 1983-2009 civil war with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and in its aftermath.

An Israeli document obtained Monday spelled out allegations against a dozen U.N. employees the country says participated in Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault — claiming seven stormed into Israeli territory, including two who participated in kidnappings.

The allegations against staffers with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees prompted Western countries to freeze funds vital for the body, which is a lifeline for desperate Palestinians in Gaza. The U.N. fired nine of the 12 accused workers and condemned “the abhorrent alleged acts” of staff members.

The accusations come after years of tensions between Israel and the agency known as UNRWA over its work in Gaza, where it employs roughly 13,000 people.

State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Minister of Finance, said that a promotion tax would be taken to recover the percentage of new indirect taxes.

"The people are hard. The hardest event is the hardest chance of passing a economic crisis. We had to levy taxes to increase state revenue. The people gained the weight. They want to give us delight. They burdened this weight.

We will not be expecting the new indirect taxes. There is no expectation to increase the percentage of curves.

We are trying to expand the direct tax basis and increase state revenue. We are trying to quickly hurry indirect tax deduction day.

There is no truth to say that indirect taxes go rise. When the demand is increased, the supply of goods will be effective when the supply is reduced.

We will charge a real estate tax in 2025. It's a very progressive step. Hope to charge a specific tax from those who have very high property.

### ICJ to rule on jurisdiction in Russia-Ukraine genocide case

The United Nations’ highest court will rule on Friday whether it will hear a case in which Ukraine has accused Russia of violating international law by saying its invasion was launched to stop an alleged genocide.

Ukraine brought the case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, days after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

In hearings in September, lawyers for Moscow urged judges to throw out the case, saying Kyiv’s legal arguments were flawed. The ICJ on Monday said a ruling on Russia’s objections to the court’s jurisdiction will be handed down on Friday.

Kyiv says Russia is breaching the 1948 Genocide Convention by saying the invasion was justified to stop an alleged genocide of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine says there was no risk of genocide in eastern Ukraine, where it had been fighting Russian-backed forces since 2014.

### Whispering Mountains; Revealing An Open Secret

The fact that even though eyes are ours, we are supposed to see what is painted by them, has been reaffirmed by events recently occurred in Sri Lanka. When we see beyond it, we are at the risk of losing even our lives. This is an idea that I have to always tell myself once I see how hard and tactfully the rulers of this country are trying to paint that picture to be seen and praised by us as citizens.

A good film, in my opinion, should be a combination of 50% from reality and another 50% from the imagination. When it’s closer to reality, it’s called a documentary, when it’s closer to the imagination, it’s called fiction. The film “Whispering Mountains” has made that platform where we can build our own imagination and criticism based on reality, as it keeps a good balance between reality and imagination.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s merchandise exports fell 9.54 percent to 11,856 million US dollars in 2023, with December exports falling 11.5 percent, data from the state Export Development Board showed in a year that the rupee appreciated amid better monetary policy.

The rupee appreciated from 363 to the US dollar in December 2022 to 323 by December 2023.

In December, when exports fell 11.25 percent from a year earlier to 947.5 million US dollars, the rupee appreciated from 329 to 323 to the US dollar.

That exchange rate depreciation (the price of a US dollar measured in locally made paper) is determined by exports,  imports or the trade deficit and is not a monetary phenomenon linked to the producer of the bad money  – the central bank – is an idea dating back to classical mercantilism of the 17th century.

“Ibrahim who was a key suspect in the Easter Sunday attacks was in the NPP national list. The father of one of the suicide bombers was also in the NPP national list. This group has funded the NPP with millions of rupees. Catholics in this country should remember this fact when casting their votes,” Lanza said during the inaugural rally of the new alliance that is in the making.

“NPP leaders have not paid a single cent as taxes. They have not provided employment to a single youth, unlike us. This is because they don’t own any enterprises. They are not employed. However, they lead more comfortable lives than any one of us,” he said.
