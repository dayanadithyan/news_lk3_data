Besides breaching the Trump campaign, officials also believe that Iran tried to hack into the presidential campaign of Kamala Harris.

The Elections Commission has decided to reject the gas cylinder objections to Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is contesting as an independent candidate for the presidential election.

Election Commissioner Saman Sridha Ratnayake has responded to allegations made by a political party that the gas cylinder symbol was given to his team in the last local government election.

During the local elections, many demanded the Cass cylinder symbol. The reserved symbols are only for political parties. Others can use anyone.

Therefore, not to give a chance to false things. In response to this, it is false and they are doing so for advertising in the media.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs boost innovation program should aim at introducing multiple types of innovations, including network innovations, business structure innovations, service innovations, and channel innovations.

### Presidential Hopefuls Should Give Top Priority To Make Sri Lanka A Creative Economy ‚Äì Part II

Summary so far: There are 39 Presidential hopefuls seeking the mandate from voters to rule Sri Lanka for the next five years. Since Sri Lanka is a country that had been embroiled in an unparalleled economic crisis and still struggling to recover, it is necessary to adopt a suitable policy strategy to push the economy through a high growth path to facilitate it to deliver prosperity and wellbeing to people. This requires the policymakers to give the highest priority to build an innovative or a creative economy.

In this context, the development of human knowledge will generate inventions, but those inventions should be commercially produced by entrepreneurs through a process, identified by the Austrian American economist Joseph Schumpeter as innovation.
