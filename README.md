Tea market developments reported by brokers last week indicated that tea production was just slightly higher over the production reported during the same period in 2023.

I have not met Deshamanya Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne, known to everyone as Nissanka, in person. I have watched him performing as a civil servant and minister, listened to his speeches, and spoken to his friends to know enough about him to pen this appreciation on his 100th birth anniversary falling on 14 June.

I will focus on two matters. One is his success as the lay custodian of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha known as Diyawadana Nilame in Sinhala which can be directly rendered to English as the Water Bearing Official. The other is his rare display of accountability as the Minister of Justice when there was a jail breakout and prison mutiny leading to the death of two inmates in 1988.

### Beyond CSR: Looking inward for social impact

The true essence of CSR is its integration into the very fabric of a company’s operations

For years now, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been a buzzword among both development and private sectors. It is easily one of the most misinterpreted concepts – its essence diluted when communicated and implemented within the corporate world. Businesses often misunderstand and misapply the concept of CSR: rather than integrating CSR into core business practices, the trend is a stronger focus on charitable initiatives. While still commendable, businesses can start by looking inward and truly embracing CSR with a deeper, more authentic approach that embodies company policies, practices, and culture.

In a democratic setup voters use their sovereign power to elect their representatives to manage the affairs for the benefit of the nation and in return be accountable to the nation on its affairs.

Former Inspector General of Police (IGP), Chandra Fernando says that it cannot be expected that the political groups who have engaged in violent political activities in the past will not resume such activities in the future.

He stated this while speaking during a press conference held today (13), with the participation of other retired high-ranking police officers including former IGPs and DIGs.

Fernando further stated that although the government carried out rehabilitation programmes to a large extent after the 1971 insurrection and though everyone believed that the insurrection would end with that, unfortunately, the violence returned in 1989 “destroying lives and properties in the country.”

“We then thought it was all over, but unfortunately, 91 houses were destroyed in one night on the 9th of May, 2022 by an organized group. Therefore when things like this happen, will this not happen in the future as well?” he said.
