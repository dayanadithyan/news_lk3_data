### Thousands of migrant kids reach Canary Islands alone; officials seek Spain’s help

The children sometimes won’t stop crying. Health workers dealing with migrants arriving on Spain’s Canary Islands try to understand if the tears are from illness, injury or, as is often the case, from pure shock.

One young Senegalese boy who disembarked recently kept fainting every few minutes, troubling doctors who couldn’t determine the cause. Other migrants finally explained: the boy had witnessed both parents die during the arduous boat voyage from West Africa. Their bodies were thrown overboard into the Atlantic Ocean.

“There’s no medicine for that,” said Inmaculada Mora Peces, a 54-year-old emergency doctor who treats migrants arriving on the island of El Hierro.

Mora Peces is among a growing number of people sounding the alarm as the archipelago struggles to deal with thousands of teenagers and children traveling alone to the European Union territory from Senegal, Mali, and other African nations, fleeing poverty, conflict and instability.

He escaped with minor injuries, but the iconic picture of Trump defiantly doing a fist pump, his bloody ear and face prominent with Old Glory fluttering in the background, conveyed an image that will go down in history – the courageous warrior, fighting for the country he loves, despite the excruciating pain he has suffered all his life with bone spurs.

The shooter, a 20-year-old registered Republican, described as “a very quiet young white man” was a poor marksman. Two inches to the left would have changed the history of the most powerful nation in the world. As Senator Tim Scott said at the Convention, “On Saturday, the Devil came to Pennsylvania with a rifle, but OUR AMERICAN LION GOT UP AND ROOOOARED!

### 4.5 million tons of plastic per year imports, but recycling 50,000 tonnes

*2024-07-23 10:37:49* · [`adalk`](https://www.ada.lk/breaking_news/වසරකට-ප්ලාස්ටික්-ටොන්-ලක්ෂ-4-5ක්-ආනයනය-කළත්-ප්‍රතිචක්‍රීකරණය-වෙන්නේ-ටොන්-50-000යි/11-410932) · `si`

Sri Lanka imports 4.5 million tons of plastic annually, recycling only 50,000 tonnes. The Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, chaired by Ajith Mannapperuma, focuses on plastic waste management. It's noted that while 1,200 metric tons of plastic are recycled monthly, 900 tons are improperly disposed of. The main obstacle to increasing recycling is the lack of interest in collecting plastic bottles. Proposals for improving plastic recycling, including deposit schemes for PET bottles, were insufficiently advertised. The committee recommends legalizing these proposals and extending the submission deadline to August 27th. The Ministry of Environment will investigate international recycling practices for PET bottles.

🟩

Based on the QR code, PET plastic bottles were noticated with the sectoral oversion committee on the environment, natural resources and sustain development.

The sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Susar Development Ajith Mannapperuma was also present at the Chairman of Parliament.

The Chairman of the Committee Hon.

This is the most focused on plastic and that about 1,200 metric tons of mine per month is recycling to the environment, and the remaining 900 tons are buried in the open environment.He said he was sabotized in the soil.

It was also revealed that the main reason for the largest reason for not adding plastic bottles is not interested in collecting them.

### Tamil Leader Sampanthan: Last of a Generation Leaves without Succession

*2024-07-23 10:37:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/tamil-leader-sampanthan-last-of-a-generation-leaves-without-succession/) · `en`

R. Sampanthan MP, the accredited Tamil political leader for the last fifteen years, passed away on June 30, 2024. I am late in writing this obituary. There have been many commentaries on Sampanthan’s life and politics, including Sanjana Hattotuwa’s excellent cross-sectional summary (in Groundviews) of the commentaries on the late parliamentarian and political leader. Along with citing Meera Srinivasan and Narendra Modi, Dr. Hattotuwa presents what he calls “snapshots from a divided country.” Most of them are from social media, ranging from the laudatory, through critical but not disrespectful, to obscenely insulting commentaries. The last category of comments appeared in Sinhala on Facebook and Twitter. They say more about the social media than the message and should not be taken as representative of the broader Sinhalese society. Mr. Sampanthan would have been the first to emphasize that.

### Ranil As The Pohottuwa Presidential Candidate

*2024-07-23 10:27:36* · [`colombotelegraphcom`](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/ranil-as-the-pohottuwa-presidential-candidate/) · `en`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW) was appointed to that position through the votes of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (Pohottuwa) MPs in Parliament in a situation where the restoration of law and order was the main issue at hand. He has fulfilled that task exceptionally well. His task was made easier because the so called aragalaya sought only the removal of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa from power. When President Gotabaya resigned, large segments of the aragalaya crowds simply melted away. The UNP’s own activists in the aragalaya, the foreign funded NGOs, the Tamil and Muslim groups, the Christian and Catholic groups all left the Galle Face protest site. Hence only a residual group of activists remained at Galle Face to be chased away by President Wickremasinghe within hours of being sworn into office.

### Politicians at Urumaya public meetings

*2024-07-23 10:27:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/189139) · `ta`

The Elections Commission plans to request the Urumaya and Jayakamoosree organizations in Sri Lanka to exclude politicians from their upcoming public meetings, ahead of the impending election announcements. Despite lacking authority to enforce this, the commission aims to communicate its stance through a letter to the President's Secretary, highlighting the need for transparency and neutrality in public gatherings.

🟩

The Elections Commission will appeal to the Urumaya and Jayakamoosree Sri Lanka without politicians.

The Elections Commission will appeal to stop the involvement of politicians in events such as the Urumaya, as the announcement of the elections will be released soon.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is expected to contest the presidential election, has used public meetings such as the Urumaya, and accuses the public of the public.

Elections Commission Chairman RMAL Ratnayake says that they have no authority to impose restrictions on politicians participating in such events so far as the Election Commission has not yet announced the presidential election.

However, the Elections Commission has decided to send a letter to the President's Secretary Samanratnayake to hold public meetings such as the Urumaya.

"We will ask for these public meetings without the participation of politicians," he said.
