Elections Commission Chairman RMAL Ratnayake says that they have no authority to impose restrictions on politicians participating in such events so far as the Election Commission has not yet announced the presidential election.

However, the Elections Commission has decided to send a letter to the President's Secretary Samanratnayake to hold public meetings such as the Urumaya.
