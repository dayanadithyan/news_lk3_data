Colombo, Feb 01 (Daily Mirror) -  The healthcare services across the country were hampered as health workers resorted to strike action from yesterday (1).

The strike was initiated at 6:30 a.m. by at least 72 trade unions within the health sector in protest of the government’s refusal to grant Disturbance, Availability, and Transport (DAT) allowance of Rs. 35,000 to the professionals.

The trade union action unfolded across all government hospitals, drawing attention to the concerns of supplementary medical professionals who feel overlooked in the government’s recent decision-making.

As such, patients within hospitals expressed their distress, citing inconveniences resulting from the disruption in healthcare services.

Ravi Kumudesh, President of the Joint Council for Professions of Supplementary Medicine, voiced strong opposition to the Cabinet’s choice to abstain from increasing the DAT allowance for health professionals.

### Efficient public sector operations possible with fully digitalized workforce of 200,000: Suresh Shah

*2024-02-02 06:24:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Efficient-public-sector-operations-possible-with-fully-digitalized-workforce-of-200-000-Suresh-Shah/108-276176) · `en`

The public sector can smoothly run with a workforce as low as 200,000 persons through digitalization, against the current public sector workforce of 1.3 million, according to the Head of State-Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit (SOERU) Suresh Shah.

He noted that even without digitalization, the public sector workforce can be cut by half and the public services can be maintained efficiently.

Sri Lanka’s bloated public sector shrunk by 135,000 to 1.393 million by the end of 2022 from 1.401 million in 2021 and from 1.528 million in 2020 as the government started to reduce the excess cadre while freezing recruits.

Shah claimed that if the public service is fully digitalized, the public sector cadre could be brought down to 200,000 people.

However, Shah was quick to rule out any radical move to reduce employment in the public sector.

Just a few weeks ago, the men from Havelock Town came well prepared to take on the dominating and unbeaten Ceylonese Rugby and Football Club, and turned the chips in their favour to bamboozle the home team in the first half. Being the second team on that weekend that believed in the old saying “the best form of defence is attack”, they pounced on the Hosts from the word go, before the red Jerseys could ever think of settling down.

Independence Day would be a day of joy and happiness. But that has not been so for the Ilankaith Thamizhar of Sri Lanka for many, many years – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

Sri Lanka known formerly as Ceylon gained independence from British rule on 4 February 1948. The island nation celebrates the 76th anniversary of her “tryst with destiny” on Sunday. Events marking freedom day festivity are scheduled for the week-end.

Even as the greater part of the island is enveloped in a melodious mood, a discordant note is struck in the Tamil dominated Northern Province and the Tamil majority Eastern Province. The Jaffna University Students Union and organisations representing the families of disappeared persons have proclaimed 4 February 2024 as a “Kari Naal” (black or dark day) and declared it as a day of mourning.

### Electoral prospects spark optimism for Sri Lanka’s underprivileged

*2024-02-02 05:38:22* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Electoral-prospects-spark-optimism-for-Sri-Lanka-s-underprivileged/4-758067) · `en`

The forthcoming general election holds promise for Sri Lanka’s impoverished majority – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

As the spectre of a general election looms over Sri Lanka, the political elite and the economically powerful are gripped with panic. Recent newspaper articles have been rife with speculations about the potential upheaval that such an election could bring. However, amidst their apprehension, it’s crucial to recognise that elections present a beacon of hope, particularly for the impoverished masses of Sri Lanka.

The anticipation of a general election has sent shockwaves through the corridors of power, primarily because it threatens to dismantle the entrenched privileges enjoyed by a select few. Despite the prevailing economic and debt crises plaguing the nation, a significant segment of society continues to benefit from a system riddled with corruption, mismanagement, and poor governance.
