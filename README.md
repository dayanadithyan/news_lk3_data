### Germany’s parliament votes to legalize limited marijuana possession and allow ‘cannabis clubs’

*2024-02-23 22:32:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97488/germanys-parliament-votes-to-legalize-limited-marijuana-possession-and-allow-cannabis-clubs) · `en`

BERLIN (AP) — German lawmakers on Friday approved a government plan to liberalize rules on cannabis, paving the way for the country to decriminalize limited amounts of marijuana and allow members of “cannabis clubs” to buy it for recreational purposes.

Parliament’s lower house, or Bundestag, backed the legislation, a prominent reform project of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s socially liberal governing coalition, by 407 votes to 226. There were four abstentions.

Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said the government’s aim is to “fight the black market” and better protect young people. He said current laws in the European Union’s most populous nation have failed, with consumption rising and increasing problems with contaminated or overly concentrated cannabis.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lankans may have to wait more time to read the meeting minutes of the Central Bank’s Monetary Board, a top official said, despite a new act that has made the central bank to be more transparent and accountable for its decisions.

Many central banks including the United States’ Federal Reserve, India’s Reserve Bank, and Bank of Mexico release the minutes of their monetary policy meeting to ensure transparency.

The new Central Bank Act passed by the Parliament in line with the guidance by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) includes measures for Sri Lanka’s central bank to be more transparent and accountable.

These measures include releasing the Monetary Policy Report every six months and the first such report was released on February 15.

However, the central bank has not taken a decision to release the minutes of the Monetary Board meetings on the monetary policy.

### ISIS bride Shamima Begum loses bid to regain UK citizenship

*2024-02-23 19:00:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/ISIS-bride-Shamima-Begum-loses-bid-to-regain-UK-citizenship/108-277616) · `en`

Feb 23 - Shamima Begum, the London-born Bangladeshi-origin woman, who fled the UK as a 15-year-old schoolgirl to join the Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist network, on Friday lost yet another legal bid to regain her British citizenship and return to the UK.

The ruling means the 24-year-old must remain in Syria. The government stripped her citizenship on national security grounds in 2019.

Ms Begum left London nine years ago aged 15 to travel to Syria and join Islamic State group, or IS.

The ruling by three appeal judges was unanimous. It could still be challenged in the Supreme Court by Ms Begum.

Her solicitor, Daniel Furner said that her legal team was "not going to stop fighting until she does get justice and until she is safely back home".

However the judges wholly dismissed all of Ms Begum's arguments - a highly significant rejection that could affect her ability to gain a full appeal at the Supreme Court.

Scientists in Scotland have revealed a remarkable discovery of a ‘very strange’ 240-million-year-old ‘Chinese dragon’ fossil.

The international team from National Museums Scotland revealed their discovery -- found in Guizhou Province in southern China -- of the Dinocephalosaurus orientalis, a 5-meter-long aquatic reptile from the Triassic period dating back an estimated 240 million years.

‘With 32 separate neck vertebrae Dinocephalosaurus orientalis had an extraordinarily long neck that draws comparison with that of Tanystropheus hydroides, another strange marine reptile from the Middle Triassic of both Europe and China,’ scientists said announcing the discovery.

‘Both reptiles were of similar size and have several features of the skull in common, including a fish-trap type of dentition,’ officials continued. ‘However, Dinocephalosaurus is unique in possessing many more vertebrae both in the neck and in the torso, giving the animal a much more snake-like appearance.’

If you look at the issues that took place over a year and a half ago in Sri Lanka, they were formed due to lack of financial dollars.

Our biggest tourist market is India.

Indians travel to Sri Lanka and make it easier to make the Indian rupee.

Question: Indian Foreign Minister appealed to Indians to visit Sri Lanka?How do you consider the tourist attraction for Indians?

Reporter -I have visited Sri Lanka but it is in an unprecedented moment -after a Sunday attack

Taraka- Your Foreign Minister said that Sri Lanka is a country of 65,000 squaremm in a country but everyone has everything.

It is not surprising that Markapolos said Sri Lanka was the best island.

Colombo, Feb 23 (Daily Mirror) - The name 'spa' has to be changed and people should not be allowed to merely use the name spa, Tourism State Minister Diana Gamage said.

Addressing the media, she said the use of the name 'spa' is not appropriate as it implies a high level of professionalism and denotes a wellness center. Therefore, it is imperative to cease using that name.

"The utilization of the name'spa' disrespects the professionalism of individuals working in such establishments. It is important to refrain from using this name to uphold the dignity and respect associated with the spa industry," she said.

"If a lady has to work as a masseur in a spa or in a hotel, and if she goes and says to someone that she is working in a spa, people look at her as if at a prostitute. Because the name spa is being used like that," the State Minister said.

Therefore, the name 'spa' has to be changed and they should not be allowed to use the name spa, she said.
