The massive barrage of strikes hit more than 85 targets at seven locations, including command and control headquarters, intelligence centers, rockets and missiles, drone and ammunition storage sites and other facilities that were connected to the militias or the IRGC’s Quds Force, the Guard’s expeditionary unit that handles Tehran’s relationship with and arming of regional militias.

SLFP leader former President Maithripala Sirisena has already informed Ms. Kumaratunga about the membership reinstatement.

The alliance was originally formed ahead of the general election in 1994 as a move to defeat the 17-year rule of the United National Party (UNP). The People’s Alliance remained in power until 2001 when it was defeated by the UNP again.

In 2004, the SLFP took the lead in forming the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA).

Since then, the People’s Alliance remained idle in politics. In what appeared to be a new political development ahead of the presidential elections, it will be revived with Ms. Kumaratunga as the leader.
