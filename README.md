### සෞඛ්‍ය ක්ෂේත්‍රයේ ගැටලු විසඳීමට ජනපති ගේ මැදිහත්වීම ඉල්ලයි

*2024-02-16 15:21:00* · [`adaderanasinhalalk`](http://sinhala.adaderana.lk/news/193470) · `si`

සෞඛ්‍ය ක්ෂේත්‍රයේ මතු ව ඇති ගැටලු විසඳීමට, දුෂණ සහ වංචාවලට සම්බන්ධ දේශපාලනඥයින්ට සහ නිලධාරීන්ට නිසි දඬුවම් ලබාදීමට විශේෂ ජනාධිපති කොමිසමක් පත් කළ යුතු බව විශේෂඥ වෛද්‍ය චමල් සංජීව මහතා පවසයි.

වෛද්‍ය හා සිවිල් අයිතිවාසිකම් පිළිබඳ වෛද්‍යවරුන්ගේ වෘත්තීය සමිති සන්ධානයේ සභාපතිවරයා පවසන්නේ ඒ සඳහා වහාම ජනාධිපතිවරයා මැදිහත් විය යුතු බවයි.

අද (16) කොළඹ දී මාධ්‍ය වෙත අදහස් දක්වමින් ඔහු මේ බව පැවසුවේය.

මෙරට ඖෂධ සැපයුම් ජාලය බරපතළ අර්බුදයකට මුහුණ දී ඇති බවත් ඒ සඳහා කඩිනමින් නිසි විසඳුම් නොලැබුණහොත් ඉදිරි මාස ‍කිහිපය තුළ සෞඛ්‍ය පද්ධතියේ ගැටලු නැවත විසඳිය නොහැකි තත්ත්වයකට පත්විය හැකි බවද වෛද්‍යවරයා අවධාරණය කළේය.

එ‍මෙන්ම සෞඛ්‍ය අමාත්‍යාංශය, රාජ්‍ය ඖෂධ නීතිගත සංස්ථාව, වෛද්‍ය සැපයුම් ඒකකය, ඖෂධ නියාමන අධිකාරිය සහ රාජ්‍ය ඖෂධ නිෂ්පාදන සංස්ථාව අතර අනෝන්‍ය සම්බන්ධයක් නොමැති වීම හේතු‍වෙන් පවතින ඖෂධ හිඟය සම්බන්ධ සත්‍ය තොරතුරු දැනගැනීමට නොහැකි වී තිබෙන බව ද ඒ මහතා වැඩිදුරටත් සඳහන් කළේය.

Russian families must produce at least two children for the sake of the nation’s ethnic survival, and three or more if it is to develop and thrive, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.

Russia has suffered heavy but undisclosed casualties since launching its war in Ukraine nearly two years ago, and hundreds of thousands of people have fled the country out of opposition to the conflict or fear of being called up to fight.

Putin told employees at a tank factory in the Urals region that two children per family was the minimum number if the peoples of Russia were to preserve their identities.

“If we want to survive as an ethnic group - well, or as ethnic groups inhabiting Russia - there must be at least two children,” he said.

If each family had just one child, the population would shrink, he said. “And in order to expand and develop, you need at least three children.”

Pakistan’s election last week did not return a clear majority for anyone but independent candidates backed by jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan won 92 out of 264 seats, making them the largest group.

Questions have been raised about the fairness of the Feb. 8 election both inside Pakistan as well as in major foreign capitals, with Washington having previously said there were “undue restrictions” on freedoms of expression and assembly.

“We are watching this very, very closely,” White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday, expressing concern about “intimidation and voter suppression.”

“International monitors are still taking a look at those tallies, I’m not going to get ahead of that process,” he added about the vote count.
