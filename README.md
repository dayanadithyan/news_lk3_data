### New Zealand name T20 World Cup 2024 squad

(ICC) - Experienced batter Kane Williamson has been named captain as New Zealand became the first team to announce their squad for June's ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

The Kiwis named their 15-player squad for the ninth edition of the 20-over showcase on Monday, with the Black Caps opting for an experienced squad that includes Williamson and fast bowling duo Tim Southee and Trent Boult.

It will be the sixth appearance for Williamson at a T20 World Cup and fourth as skipper, with Southee set for his seventh appearance at the tournament and Boult his fifth as the Kiwis seek a first title in the shortest international format of the game.

There were no major surprises in New Zealand's squad, with key pacer Kyle Jamieson (back) and all-rounder Adam Milne (ankle) ruled out of the event through injury and the likes of Will O'Rourke, Tom Latham, Tim Seifert and Will Young missing out on selection despite some recent good form against the white-ball.

### US research ship granted entry to SL waters for replenishment

The Sri Lankan Government has granted entry to a US research ship for replenishment purposes alone.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed that while the ship was denied permission to conduct research activities, it was allowed entry for replenishment purposes.

Earlier reports indicated that the Sri Lankan Government declined a request for a research vessel to access Sri Lankan waters, consistent with its policy against permitting research ships in its maritime territory. The vessel, which included students from a US university, specifically sought permission to enter Sri Lankan waters solely for logistical support, including fuel, water purification, and food.

In December of last year, Sri Lanka suspended the entry of foreign research vessels due to significant security concerns raised by neighbouring India and the United States, particularly following the visits of two Chinese research ships within 14 months.

### If you donтАЩt like to say genocide, think of it as mass murder

In November, the UN Secretary- General called IsraelтАЩs retaliation┬а (including cutting off food, aid and water supply to Gaza) a genocidal┬а action, and┬а was heavily condemned by Israel and pro-Israeli lobbies┬а across Europe and the US.

When Israel launched a massive bombardment of the Gaza Strip in retaliation to the Hamas cross-border attack on Oct 7, 2023, I had divided sympathies, especially in view of the atrocities committed by Hamas fighters inside Israel that day.

These divided sympathies stemmed from the fact that I began my journalism career in Amman, Jordan, a step away from Jerusalem, the West Bank and Israel. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon to drive out Yasser ArafatтАЩs Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) began when I was a young reporter and sub-editor at the Jordan Times. I quite understand what the Palestinians have been going through ever since the formation of Israel as a Jewish State in 1948.

### May Day and the plight of Lankan workers - EDITORIAL

This Wednesday is May Day, a day set apart to commemorate the struggles and gains made by workers and labour movements the world over. Very sadly, in our country, workersтАЩ day has been usurped by political parties and gains lost to economic woes.

Today, workers dance and parade the streets, not to regain their lost rights of the past four to five years. They will carry forward campaigns of diverse political parties hoping to grab power at the yet undeclared elections expected to be held later this year.

The average monthly household income of the poorest 20% of our population is Rs. 17,572, raised from a meager Rs. 12,500 in March this year. But multiple energy price increases and sales tax hikes in January raised the cost of living and hit wage earners hard.

What is being bargained is much less than the relief of $ 14 billion expected through debt restructuring. While noting that it is not a relief for Sri Lanka, the GovernmentтАЩs initiative to reach some agreement with them should be commended. Hence, any delay in reaching an agreement will be a killer for Sri Lanka which will have to sacrifice all the hard-earned gains so far relating to pushing the country back to normalcy
