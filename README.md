Colombo, May 30 (Daily Mirror) - Thailand’s cabinet approved a range of visa promotions to attract more tourists from other countries, including Sri Lanka, Foreign Affairs Minister M.U.M. Ali Sabry said.

According to him, Sri Lankan tourists, along with visitors from 36 other countries including Albania, Cambodia, China, India, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Laos, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, Romania, Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan can now enter Thailand without a visa and stay for up to 60 days.

The Election Commission has expressed strong dismay over any attempts to delay the upcoming Presidential and Parliamentary elections, insisting they proceed as scheduled.

### UK Parliament dissolves ahead of July 4 general election

*2024-05-30 08:51:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/99526/uk-parliament-dissolves-ahead-of-july-4-general-election) · `en`

The British parliament dissolved on Thursday ahead of a July 4 general election, which looks set to bring Labour to power after 14 years of Conservative rule.

Five weeks of campaigning officially began as 650 seats of members of parliament (MPs) became vacant at one minute past midnight (2301 GMT) in line with the electoral schedule.

The first week of campaigning has seen a shaky start following Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s rain-drenched election announcement, with many observers taking the downpour as a bad omen.

Sunak set the election for July 4, instead of later in the year as had been widely expected, in what observers said was an attempt to regain momentum as his party slides in opinion polls.

After 14 years in opposition, the Labour party now has the chance to win back power with its leader Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, at the helm.

### Vietnam example: Communist factor in JVP-NPP mix could prove constructive

*2024-05-30 04:59:56* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Vietnam-example-Communist-factor-in-JVP-NPP-mix-could-prove-constructive/4-762354) · `en`

“First as tragedy, then as farce”. Marx’s legendary riff on Hegel springs to mind when forecasting the political future of Sarvajana Balaya, the rebranded bloc of Islamophobic ultranationalists from the Zombieland of the Gotabaya Presidency and old Leftists.

I expect it to be extinguished through Sarvajana Chanda Balaya (universal franchise) at the forthcoming Parliamentary election just as the SLFP’s allies were in 1977. Its rancid ultranationalism is anathema to the youth of the Aragalaya generation and while its old personalities and discourse will give ex-MR voters someone to punish, for the painful Gotabaya fiasco.

For the CPSL and Vasu’s DLF there will be no coming back from this last cruise on the Titanic. Criticising the JVP-NPP is fine but doing so in alliance with and on the same platform as three notorious political purveyors of dangerous Islamophobia (Muslim birth-rates, Dr. Shafi, etc.) is morally grotesque and ethically disgusting.

### Yukthiya anti-drug operation: Separating fact from fiction

The impact of the operation on respect for the rule of law and the protection of human rights has been adverse

Minister Alles and Deshabandu Tennakoon, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), have repeatedly proclaimed the success of Yukthiya (means justice in Sinhala), the anti-drug operation they launched in December 2023. The facts say otherwise.

As of 22 May 2024, 113,974 persons have been arrested as part of Yukthiya, with the majority of such persons released soon after arrest either after being fined or on bail. Releasing most arrested persons within a few hours of arrest demonstrates that the intent is to create the illusion of effective government action to address drug trafficking by showing a high number of arrests. However, most of the arrested persons are drug users, many of whom are drug dependent, and not drug traffickers.

### How transparency and competitive bidding could have averted VFS visa fiasco

*2024-05-30 04:46:09* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/How-transparency-and-competitive-bidding-could-have-averted-VFS-visa-fiasco/4-762351) · `en`

The recent outrage over the outsourcing of Sri Lanka›s visa issuance to VFS Global stemmed from two controversies: 1) the secretive selection process of VFS Global without broader consultation and 2) neglecting value for money by not considering alternatives.

Addressing two key gaps in Sri Lanka›s public procurement system could have prevented the uproar: 1) lack of transparency and 2) excessive reliance on cabinet discretion over competitive bidding.

The first point of contention is the secrecy and lack of consultation surrounding the decision to grant VFS Global the contract. The public, and even the Parliament, learned crucial details about the terms and conditions of the handover—such as service fees, investment and contract duration—only through ad-hoc statements by the authorities after VFS Global began operations. This, too, was in response to the backlash following a viral video criticising VFS Global›s management.

However, other sources denied any such move and said that President Ranil Wickremesinghe had assured that elections would be held. So, while President Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) government are focused on elections, they should also dedicate time for issues such as climate change as it no doubt affects the entire country and its people.
