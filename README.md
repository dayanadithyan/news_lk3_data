### Wanindu Hasaranga Test ban: Sri Lanka cricket denies use of any loopholes

Sri Lanka Cricket has denied that they exploited any loopholes after the Wanindu Hasaranga Test ban fiasco has grabbed the headlines in recent times.

Hasaranga, who had retired from the longest format of the game in August last year, performed a U-turn and was subsequently selected for the Test series against Bangladesh. However, in a major turn of events, the ICC would slap him with a ban on Tuesday, March 19.

This meant that he would be unable to play the series against Bangladesh, but meant that he would be available for the T20 World Cup 2024 and the upcoming season of the IPL with his new franchise, Sunrisers Hyderabad.

While there has been speculation among fans and pundits that the Sri Lanka cricket board has exploited a loophole in the ICC rules, the governing body has strongly rejected this claim. The SLC claimed that Hasaranga had informed them via e-mail on March 16 about his desire to play Test matches and said that his fitness levels had improved.

Parliament, March 21 (Daily Mirror)- COPE Chairman MP Rohitha Abeygunawardane asked today if he was fit to be elected as a Member of Parliament, why he cannot function as the Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE).

If I am fit to be elected as an MP, why can’t I function as COPE Chair? When I was elected COPE Chair, the opposition hurled allegations against me,” he said.

### Parents in Sri Lanka in a major crisis;Drug shortages;Increase in prices multi -fold

*2024-03-21 15:11:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/179333) · `ta`

Sri Lanka faces a health crisis due to drug shortages and rising prices. The government's health budget is insufficient, impacting patients like Nuwan, who travels for cancer treatment. The National Cancer Hospital is crucial for those without private access. The economic downturn exacerbates the crisis, with drug shortages and price increases. The pharmaceutical industry is affected, with international corporations contributing to the shortage. The Sri Lankan currency's fall in 2022-3 increases drug prices, and some fraudsters sell medicines at inflated prices. Health Minister Ramespatra acknowledges these issues, noting increased budget funds to address drug prices but also highlighting outdated drugs in government hospitals.

🟩

Nuwan, a native of Medimalai, travels 230 kilometers every time he is suffering from cancer.

It was revealed last year that his 18 -year -old son was suffering from a bloodbath, and the two parents came to Makarahamavi every time they were treated from their homes.

The government has allocated four percent of its budget for health services to provide free medical mission to all Sri Lankan people.

However, due to the consequences of the economic downturn, the health sector, which has previously been acclaimed, has been in the crisis of drugs.

National Cancer Hospital, such as Puspakumara's family, is very important for many who cannot be treated in private hospitals.

Patients such as Nuwan should be given free of charge but have not recently seen such a situation.

Treatment is excellent but there is a shortage of drugs.

I am buying medicines from my family and friends, but the number of drugs has increased many times, he said.

Parliament, March 21 (Daily Mirror)- The Viyathmaga had no connection to the economic crisis and the expulsion of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa from office, Parliamentarian Nalaka Godahewa said today.

He told Parliament that the crisis situation was a result of the banning of chemical fertilizer, shortage of gas, the power crisis and depletion of foreign reserves.

The MP said Gotabaya Rajapaksa in his book which was released recently clearly said that former Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage had supported him in the implementation of the organic farming policy.

He said the Viyathmaga members who were appointed as Secretaries to the Ministries were against the decisions taken by the President and as a result, four of them were removed.

The MP said this in response to a claim made by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, who said that the Viyathmaga was behind the faulty decisions taken by Gotabaya Rajapaksa resulting in the expulsion of the then President and the government.

The villagers say that the majority of the people of the Menkamam pond, which belongs to the Muttur Divisional Secretariat Division of Trincomalee, have been occupying the area since Wednesday (20).

They are concerned that no legal action has been taken against them and that no legal action has been taken against them.

More than 200 farmers rely on the Menkamam pond belonging to the Abirami Amman Agricultural Federation. But the site has long been rehabilitated and has been acquired by the majority of the people. The people who rely on this field and who have been working as a livelihood industry have been facing a loss in agriculture for a long time.

Therefore, the relevant authorities are demanding the rehabilitation of the pond and the villagers are urging the villagers to take legal action against those who illegally occupy the pond.
