### Excessive women's damage

*2024-06-20 10:21:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186517) ¬∑ `ta`

In Sri Lanka, leptospirosis, primarily affecting women, has seen a rise, especially among those in agriculture, livestock, and gem mining sectors. Last year, it affected 9,000; this year, 5,000. Mainly reported in Ratnapura, Kegalle, Galle, Kalutara, Moneragala, and Kurunegala, it's spread via bacteria from infected rat urine or feces entering the human body through wounds, mouth, etc., exacerbated by heavy rains. Symptoms include muscle pain, jaundice, and breathing issues, potentially leading to severe outcomes like organ failure without early treatment. Prevention involves good hygiene, avoiding contaminated water, and managing waste properly, alongside raising awareness among high-risk groups.

üü©

Health officials have recognized that leptospirosis in Sri Lanka has been affected by the higher women.

The fever is suffering from men who are involved in agriculture, livestock and gem excavation industries.

9000 people were affected by the fever last year. So far this year, 5,000 people have been affected.

The victims are mostly from Ratnapura, Kegalle, Galle, Kalutara, Moneragala and Kurunegala.

Leptospirosis is spread by some kind of bacteria. Bacteria that spreads mice is living in the kidney of the affected mice. The urine of the rat, in the stool this bacteria exit. When we consume water or foods mixed with the rat, the fever can occur.

If we trample the rat's waste, the bacteria will go into the body through the wounds, abrasions, dry areas, mouth, nose, and private areas.

### Suspicion

*2024-06-20 09:13:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186514) ¬∑ `ta`

Controversy surrounds the release of land in the Mannar District Vidal Island Natural Sanctuary, with debates over its use for a maritime park or for a private farm. Critics argue against granting permission due to environmental concerns and the impact on fishing activities. The release of 400 acres, initially planned to be 1000 acres, sparked fears among fishermen about the loss of valuable fishing grounds. The process lacks transparency, with the gazette notification in Sinhala lacking detailed information. The District Coordinating Committee decided against leasing the land to local or foreign companies. The Ministry of Fisheries defended the move, emphasizing the importance of the area for fish breeding. However, locals demand more protection for their livelihoods and the environment.

üü©

A special gazette notification was issued on May 6 last year that the Mannar District Vidal Island Natural Sanctuary will be completed in accordance with the authority given to the Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Pavithra Devi Wanniyarachchi.

Various controversies have arisen over the release of the land in the Vidal Island area as the Gazette Notification has been announced that the land belonging to the Forest Department has been released to maritime park/maritime.

In particular, there were various arguments over the release of the land during the Mannar District Development Committee meeting held last week.

In the name of development, he said that the maritime park, which was destroyed by the natural continental forests and preventing fishing activities, could not be granted permission.

Taxation needs to be looked at from a different perspective and models of taxation need to be examined. Taxation should be looked at as part of a social contract between a government and the people who pay tax. It is part of a partnership between the government and the public and it must give a sense of ownership to the public that their money is being used judiciously for their benefit. Besides this, they must have a belief that their taxes are investments, not just expenses, and that they will have a return on their investment. Better hospitals, better schools and universities, better roads, better transport and more affordable energy costs are some returns they should be able to expect with their taxes.

### Everyone should work together to pay a salary of 1700 rupees for plantation workers - Jeevan Thondaman

*2024-06-20 04:18:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/186509) ¬∑ `ta`

Jeevan Thondaman urges unity among political parties to ensure plantation workers receive a 1700 rupee salary, highlighting the need for action against companies withholding this wage. He criticizes the current salary, equivalent to just over seven dollars, as insufficient and calls for addressing injustices faced by workers, including improper arrests during union activities.

üü©

Minister Jeevan Thondaman said that all the ruling and opposition parties should take action to pay a salary of 1700 rupees for plantation workers.

The government has announced that the government has announced a salary of 1700 rupees, but the plantation companies have so far refused to provide it.. It is necessary to take steps to get it to the plantation workers, not the ruling party and the opposition.

I am not saying that the salary of 1700 rupees is sufficient for plantation workers in any way. Steps must be taken to get it, though. Currently a thousand rupees salary was fixed by 2020. That is about seven dollars. How unjust is that the salary is still paid today.

At the same time, as I am involved in the injustice inflicted on workers in a recent garden, some media have released the news.. That mistake must be addressed.

At the same time, the police do not have the authority to arrest workers to carry out union actions. In that way, the plantation management is being treated.

If the High Court runs to go to the referendum in addition to the two -thirds majority, it will not do it with only a two -thirds majority.. MPs plan to bribe. This is due to the lack of value to the High Court's decision on the Bill on Sexual Equality. This is a dangerous precedent. We should be very carefully, including the Speaker.

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian MA Sumanthiran said that the president's failure to accept the Supreme Court's decision on the Sexual Equality Bill could be dangerous in the future, as the president is trying to extend the term of the election.

Sumanthiran said this while addressing a special statement in Parliament on Wednesday (19).

When the Ceremony Act was passed. He has said that the second time does not require the Supreme Court's decision on the Bill of Equality Equality.. What is the reason for this?That is, they are trying to increase the president's term in 6 years.

If the High Court runs to go to the referendum in addition to the two -thirds majority, it will not do it with only a two -thirds majority.. MPs plan to bribe. This is due to the lack of value to the High Court's decision on the Bill of Sexual Equality. This is a dangerous precedent. We should be very carefully, including the Speaker.

Nathasha Edirisooriya, a stand-up comedian known for her sharp wit and incisive commentary, found herself at the center of a legal maelstrom when she was unjustly arrested and detained. The arrest, based on allegations of making comments detrimental to religious harmony, not only led to her imprisonment but also tarnished her reputation. However, recent judicial decisions especially of the high court have revealed the baselessness of these charges, raising significant questions about the infringement of her fundamental rights. One can strongly argue that Nathasha Edirisooriya has a duty to pursue a fundamental rights case to address the grave injustice she endured and to prevent similar miscarriages of justice in the future.
