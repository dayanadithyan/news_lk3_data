President Ranil Wickremesinghe in addressing the International Customs Day Celebrations had once again thrown the gauntlet at all political parties and challenged them to put forward a better and alternative agenda to the current IMF designed economic revival program. In that address, he obviously omitted to utter even one word about the extent of economic hardship endured by a vast majority of people as a result of implementing IMF recommendations. Because, like IMF, RW also believes that the hardship is short term pain worth enduring to achieve long term gain. But who gains at the cost of whose pain is left unsaid. This address, like several of his in recent months, was obviously driven by RW’s political desire to discredit the opposition before declaring the date for presidential poll to which he would be a contestant.

### Icon of the Seas: World’s largest cruise ship sets sail

*2024-01-28 08:26:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96783/icon-of-the-seas-worlds-largest-cruise-ship-sets-sail) · `en`

(Reuters) - The world’s largest cruise ship is set for its maiden voyage on Saturday, but environmental groups are concerned that the liquefied natural gas-powered vessel - and other giant cruise liners to follow - will leak harmful methane into the atmosphere.

Royal Caribbean International’s Icon of the Seas sets sail from Miami with capacity for 8,000 passengers across 20 decks, taking advantage of the surging popularity of cruises.

The ship is built to run on liquefied natural gas (LNG), which burns more cleanly than traditional marine fuel but poses greater risks for methane emissions. Environmental groups say methane leakage from the ship’s engines is an unacceptable risk to the climate because of its short-term harmful effects.

“It’s a step in the wrong direction,” said Bryan Comer, director of the Marine Program at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), an environmental policy think tank.

Miami, Jan 28 (BBC) - The world's largest cruise ship has set sail from Miami, Florida, on its maiden voyage, amid concerns about the vessel's methane emissions.

The vessel is going on a seven-day island-hopping voyage in the tropics.

But environmentalists warn that the liquefied natural gas-powered ship will leak harmful methane into the air.

"It's a step in the wrong direction," Bryan Comer, director of the Marine Programme at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.

"We would estimate that using LNG as a marine fuel emits over 120% more life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than marine gas oil," he said.

Earlier this week, the ICCT released a report, arguing that methane emissions from LNG-fuelled ships were higher than current regulations assumed.
