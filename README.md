Colombo, March 6 (Daily Mirror) - While reducing the prices of Lanka Super Diesel 4 Star Euro 4 and Lanka Petrol 95 Octane Euro 4, the government has played a small gimmic on the people, former Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Commissioner Janaka Ratnayaka said.

Reducing the fuel prices by Rs. 9 and Rs. 10 is of no use to the people. As he had mentioned in 2022, the fuel prices can be reduced by a maximum of Rs. 200, he added.

Ratnayake claimed that the fuel prices published on the official page on X, officially known as Twitter, by the Power and Energy Minister were wrong and that their formula was also wrong.

"If we calculate the fuel prices according to the trends of the world market, the fuel prices can be reduced by a maximum of Rs. 200.

### Crucial Red Sea data cables cut, telecoms firm says

March 6 (BBC) - Several undersea communications cables in the Red Sea have been cut, affecting 25% of data traffic flowing between Asia and Europe, a telecoms company and a US official say.

Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications said it had taken measures to reroute traffic after four of the 15 cables were recently severed.

The US official said it was trying to find out whether the cables were cut deliberately or snagged by an anchor.

Last month, Yemen's internationally-recognised government warned that the Iran-backed Houthi movement might sabotage the undersea cables in addition to attacking ships in the sea.

The Houthis - who control much of western Yemen's Red Sea coast - denied last week that they had targeted cables and blamed US and British military strikes for any damage to them.

US and British forces have targeted Houthi weapons and infrastructure in response to the drone and missile attacks on merchant vessels passing through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

As the Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission in 2022, I see the success of my sacrifice that the recommendation of the public welfare proposal was implemented two years later.. However, if the government ensures the public distribution of the profits received by the Ceylon Electricity Board, it is healthy to reduce the electricity tariff by 35 percent, said Janaka Ratnayake, former chairman of the Public Use Commission.

He made this statement during a media briefing held at his private office in Colombo yesterday regarding the permission of the Sri Lanka Public Use Commission to permit the 21.9 per cent power reduction in effect from midnight yesterday (4).

Steps have been taken to reduce electricity tariffs by 21.9 per cent of the public welfare. Nevertheless, it is mandatory for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to distribute the profits made by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) in the past.. The clarity should be public.
