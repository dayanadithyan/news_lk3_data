The Sunday Times of 28 April 2024 reported that plans are underway to lift the restrictions on the import of motor vehicles because a committee of Treasury Officials has stated that in the absence of duties on motor vehicle imports the country would not meet the revenue targets set by the International Monetary Fund. The news report states further that the trade-off is an $ 800 million drain on foreign reserves against the earning of a SL Rupee denominated tax revenue of Rs. 340 billion. Whilst accepting that there would be different views re the logic of this trade-off, I see this as a situation which calls for Limiting Factor Analysis (LFA).

### A wise fool’s paradise

When President Ranil Wickremesinghe announces his candidacy, we will hear people sing of dark times

“For every complex problem, there is a solution that is clear, simple, and wrong.” – H.L. Menken

‘Sustaining Stability’ is the oxymoronic title of the recent panel discussion organised by the Central Bank.

How to make a three-legged stool stand on two legs would have been a more commonsensical, down to earth title for the profoundly perplexing exchange of views by five panellists – all steeped in the science of economics.

That makes it easy. A repetition of remarks made by participants or attempting to qualify who said what, is not necessary.

It was a seriously choreographed discussion. It was in English – the language of Global Commerce, the IMF, and holders of our International Sovereign Bonds.

Therein lies another tale. All this brouhaha is to appease creditors for us to get back to the business of borrowing.

### Easter attack like NATO

Every year around late April we all speak about the Easter bomb disaster which affected thousands of people in the country.

During that period there were several public requests for action to be taken against all who are guilty of failing in their duties.

In an article on 2 May 2019 which was published in the papers soon after the disaster where I clearly mentioned:

“It is absolutely necessary that those responsible, starting from the top two leaders and all others holding political office, be compelled by law to face appropriate penalties for their indifference and negligence.”

As it has happened in the last 75 years after Independence, whenever a disaster takes place in the country we talk about it for some time and conveniently forget about it.

### Playing “Blind Man’s Buff” with Sri Lanka’s Free Trade Agreements: Part 2

Transparency and widespread consultation is vital for an FTA Feasibility Study that reflects the interests of the country rather than vested interests of a few politicians and their business henchmen

It is important to realise that the mere reduction of an import duty at the border, through an FTA does not mean free market access for Sri Lanka goods to the Indian or any other market since there are many non-tariff barriers and trade facilitation documentation issues facing our exports to those markets. An UNCTAD Study on Non Tariff Measures in China and India (2020) noted that despite reduction in import duties at the border, a host of NTMs as sanitary and phytosanitary/technical barriers to trade, quotas, financial exchange and price changing measures, registration and administrative, non technical issues can adversely affect price and quantities traded.

The Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday approved a power wheeling facility for private entities to collectively use the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) transmission network to transport electricity to different locations subject to a payment of fee.

The progressive move aims to promote renewable energy adoption and boost energy self-sufficiency in Sri Lanka. The approach, known as ‘power wheeling’, allows electricity users to utilise existing supply from another location through the grid, subject to a fee, thereby reducing costs effectively.

Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Minister Bandula Gunawardena yesterday said under the approved proposal, electricity users will be allowed to build renewable energy plants, such as mini-hydro facilities and transmit the generated power through the CEB grid to other locations owned by the same party for personal use.

Two private member bills have been presented to parliament with the aim of increasing women’s representation in the legislative body.

The two bills, reportedly submitted by parliamentarian Dr Sudarshini Fernandopulle as private member proposals, aim to address the issue of female representation in parliament. One bill seeks to amend the Parliamentary Elections Act, advocating for a minimum of 30% female representation in every recognized political party.

Additionally, another proposal submitted to Parliament as a draft bill aims to amend the Constitution as the 22nd Amendment. This proposal suggests that not less than 50% of women members be included in the national list nominated to represent the Parliament of a political party or an independent group.

Fernandopulle told journalists that despite her requests to political parties to take steps to enhance women’s representation, she opted to introduce the necessary legislation herself due to the absence of a positive response.

### Biden slaps new tariffs on Chinese imports, ratcheting trade war

*2024-05-15 04:45:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/biden-slaps-new-tariffs-on-chinese-imports-ratcheting-trade-war/) · `en`

President Joe Biden has slapped major new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment, taking potshots at Donald Trump along the way as he embraced a strategy that’s increasing friction between the world’s two largest economies.

The Democratic president said on Tuesday that Chinese government subsidies ensure the nation’s companies do not have to turn a profit, giving them an unfair advantage in global trade.

“American workers can outwork and out-compete anyone as long as the competition is fair,” Biden said in the White House Rose Garden. “But for too long, it hasn’t been fair. For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies … it’s not competition, it’s cheating.”

China immediately promised retaliation. Its Ministry of Commerce said Beijing was opposed to the tariff hikes by the United States and would take measures to defend its interests.

*2024-05-15 00:20:50* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/தமிழர்களுக்கு-இலங்கை-என்ன-செய்தது-சுமந்திரன்-கேள்வி/175-337312) · `ta`

Sri Lanka's handling of Tamil issues contrasts sharply with its stance on Palestine. TNA MP MA Sumanthiran criticized Sri Lanka for its "hypocrisy" and "dual role," highlighting the disparity between condemning international crimes like those in Palestine while dismissing similar atrocities against Tamils as internal affairs. He referenced the Mullivaikkal massacre, where hundreds of thousands were trapped without food, contrasting it with the international outcry over Palestine. Sumanthiran questioned whether Sri Lanka's selective concern for international law applies equally to its own citizens, calling for an independent inquiry into the treatment of Tamils.

🟩

The genocide in Palestine took place for Tamils in Sri Lanka, but what did Sri Lanka do to the Tamils, who voice their voice for Palestine?Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian MA Sumanthiran alleged that this is the hypocrisy and dual role of Sri Lanka.

He said this while addressing the debate on the postponement of today's situation in Palestine held in Parliament on Tuesday (18).

Today's situation of Palestine is very serious. This situation should not be considered normal. In this case, there are also those who behave in this Parliament. He said their action was insidious.

They are talking about international crimes, including human rights, international human rights laws, and genocide. They are talking about the Palestinian situation, referring to the terrorist activities that have taken place within a country.

### The media hides the Palestinian disaster

*2024-05-15 00:14:35* · [`tamilmirrorlk`](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/செய்திகள்/பலஸ்தீன-பேரழிவை-ஊடகங்கள்-மறைக்கின்றன/175-337311) · `ta`

Imtiaz Pakir Makar accuses media of covering up the Palestinian crisis, likening it to the apartheid era. He criticizes the media for not exposing the ongoing disaster in Palestine, despite social media revealing some truths. Last week, the UN granted Palestine full membership, despite threats from Israel to cut US aid to the UN. This move was supported by 143 countries, with only nine, including the US and Israel, opposing it. Makar highlights the ongoing challenges to international justice and human rights.

🟩

United People's Power MP Imtiaz Pakir Makar said that the genocide and disaster that has been carried out on Palestinian soil for more than six months, the world's mighty media and some of our country's mighty media are covering up.

He said this while addressing the debate on the proposal on the present stage of Palestine in Parliament on Tuesday (14).

The forces that saved the South African apartheid regime, in the same manner, are still trying to cover up the injustice and repression of Palestinian soil, and go against the mandate of the people of the world, and seek refuge for the separatist and inhumane rule.

Although the mighty media is covered, the reality of Palestine is almost exposed to the community through social media.

### Lankan mercenaries fighting in Russo-Ukraine war - EDITORIAL

*2024-05-15 00:02:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Lankan-mercenaries-fighting-in-Russo-Ukraine-war-EDITORIAL/172-282591) · `en`

Media reports have been circulating of Sri Lankan ex-military personnel being involved in the Russo-Ukraine conflict. With the war raging in Ukraine, many Ukrainian males of military age have fled to neighbouring EU countries to avoid military service. It should not be unexpected that recruiters would seek battle-hardened military men from foreign lands.

Our country with a large number of battle-hardened troops either idling in camps or having deserted military service is therefore a soft target for foreign recruiters. All they needed were locals with insider knowledge and capacity to help them recruit.

According to media reports a former Major General and an ex-sergeant have been among their local point men.

In the aftermath of the war, former veterans have had all their special allowances cut. They now depend on their basic wage.

### Last throes of dynastic enterprise: Rajapaksa plots to stall recovery after ruining economy

Mahinda Rajapaksa thrives in a sense of inviolability and a culture of  impunity fostered by the very system that sustains their political  existence.

Like the rest of his ilk in this part of the world, Mahinda Rajapaksa overstayed his welcome in the power. He ran the economy to the ground as he did with the national carrier, which he re-nationalized out of a fit of rage after its Emirates management refused to deplane fee-levying passengers to make room for his entourage.

He tried on a dynastic power grab that went spectacularly wrong, ending in the worst-ever financial crisis since the independence.

But, like every crook and conman in Third World politics,  Mahinda Rajapaksa thrives in a sense of inviolability and a culture of impunity fostered by the very system that sustains their political existence.

The picture shows one of the beams of the highway after it collapsed

The construction of the phase from Kottawa to Pinnaduwa- of the project titled ‘Expressway Network of Sri Lanka’- was completed in 2011. During its construction, a medical student died as a result of a minor collapse of a bridge on the expressway in 2008. This incident sparked widespread concern regarding the quality and reliability of this expressway facility. Although the concept of expressways was relatively new to Sri Lankans at that time, there was significant discourse regarding passenger safety; particularly in the event of a bridge or culvert falls apart while the facility is being used for travel. Investigations later confirmed that the cause of the collapse was the improper construction of the bridge.

The other beams at a 45 degree angle are unaffected by the collapse of one beam

### A Call To Comrade Anura Kumara Dissanayake: Time To Reflect & Adapt

I write these words with a sense of urgency and anticipation, believing that the time has come to reflect and adapt. The seeds you sow knowingly or unknowingly have reaped a bitter harvest of division and discontent among the people of our Nation. Your brand of politics has had a lasting impact on our society, characterized by its bitterness and divisiveness. From the turbulent events of 71 to the unrest of 88 and 89, the scars of past conflicts continue to haunt us. The stagnant narrative of 76 years of curse and rejection of 225 has perpetuated, casting a shadow over our collective aspirations.

Your ability to mobilize support and empower people to your cause cannot be denied. The meetings last May showed the strength of your organization. But this energy, though powerful, is not without its dangers. It serves as a warning not only to you but to the entire nation.

### If Tamil Eelam was origin

*2024-05-14 21:26:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/183560) · `ta`

Tamil Eelam, if it had originated, could have evolved into a South Asian Israel, akin to the transformation of Palestine. Wimal Weerawansa, a Sri Lankan parliamentarian, suggested the US's interest in ending the LTTE war was influenced by Israel. The comparison draws parallels between the struggles of Palestinians and Tamils, highlighting the international community's role in conflicts. The narrative also touches on the failed attempts by Britain to establish Tamil Eelam within Sri Lanka, contrasting it with their success in Palestine. The mention of the US's involvement, including a Marine Squadron visit to protect LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, and the use of veto power at the UN to support Sri Lanka, underscores the complex international dynamics in these conflicts.

🟩

If the war with the LTTE did not end, Tamil Eelam would have been originated in South Asia. It would have been transformed into Israel.. National Freedom Front leader and parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said that the US is tears to end the war by providing Israel and ending the war.

He was speaking at a debate on the adjournment motion on the Palestinian Affairs Affairs in Parliament on Tuesday (14).

Palestinians have been badly affected by the inhuman attack of Israel. We are worried about the present situation of the Palestinians.

When World War II intensified, the Great Britain signed a deal with the Jews to end the war. The Jews urged the British to have a country or kingdom after the end of the war.

Tamils live in the world. They are based on South Indian Dravidian language so that they are giving them a unique country within Sri Lanka, giving them a great British fake independence.

### Ransomware payments increase 500% in last year: Sophos

*2024-05-14 21:05:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/ransomware-payments-increase-500-in-last-year-sophos/) · `en`

Sophos, a global leader of innovative security solutions that defeat cyberattacks, today released its annual “State of Ransomware 2024” survey report, which found that the average ransom payment has increased 500% in the last year. Organizations that paid the ransom reported an average payment of $2 million, up from $400,000 in 2023. However, ransoms are just one part of the cost. Excluding ransoms, the survey found the average cost of recovery reached $2.73 million, an increase of almost $1 million since the $1.82 million that Sophos reported in 2023.

Despite the soaring ransoms, this year’s survey indicates a slight reduction in the rate of ransomware attacks with 59% of organizations being hit, compared with 66% in 2023. While the propensity to be hit by ransomware increases with revenue, even the smallest organizations (less than $10 million in revenue) are still regularly targeted, with just under half (47%) hit by ransomware in the last year.
