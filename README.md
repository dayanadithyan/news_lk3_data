Initially, the ban was justified by disease prevention, but it's now clear the government seeks to erase references to the LTTE and the violence of the war's end. Despite this, the Human Rights Commission intervened to allow the event in Batticaloa, highlighting the government's changing justifications for the ban.

Former Commissioner of the Sri Lanka Rights Commission, Ambika Sakthkunanathan, said that the government's continued actions and reasons for the prohibition of the Mullivaikkal porridge are clearly revealed that the government's aim is to stop the references and violence in the final periods of Sri Lanka's civil war.

As far as the government is concerned, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) is refreshing to recall on May 18.

The reasons for the ban on the events have been changed from preventing the spread of the disease from the prevention of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).

In the last days of the war, the government's aim of the government is to stop commemoration of violence and violence.

According to reports, people in Batticaloa this morning have blocked the transport of Mullivaikkal porridge.

### A/L classes to begin immediately after O/L exams

The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval for the proposal to commence G.C.E. Advanced Level classes immediately after the conclusion of the ongoing G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination.

As it takes at least 03 months for the Department of Examinations to release the results after the completion of the G.C.E. O/L examination, students drop out of schools during this period, they are less inclined to continue studies and this leads to the creation of various social problems.

Accordingly, it has been recognized that it is appropriate to start higher education activities in schools immediately after the completion of G.C.E. O/L examinations, the Department of Government Information (DGI) said in a release.

Thus, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal table by Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha to commence G.C.E. Advanced Level classes immediately after the completion of G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination, which is currently underway.
