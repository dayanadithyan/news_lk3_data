### Sri Lanka manufacturing, services expand in Dec in festive demand: PMI

*2024-01-17 14:40:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-manufacturing-services-expand-in-dec-in-festive-demand-pmi-147560/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s manufacturing has expanded for the second month in December 2023, and service maintained strong growth, driven by holiday demand and tourism, based on a Purchasing Managers’ Index compiled by the central bank.

The manufacturing PMI was 52.7 above the 50 points, but slightly the 57 point, expansion seen in November.

“The increases in New Orders and Production were driven by the manufacture of food & beverages sector with the seasonal demand,” the statement said.

“However, New Orders and Production in manufacture of textiles & apparel sector declined during the month, which mainly contributed to the decline in Employment as well.”

Expectations for the manufacturing activities for the next three months were positive.

“However, the firms are concerned about the impact of tax revisions from January 2024, and the shipping disruptions due to the unrest in the Red Sea,” the statement said.

The Services PMI was 58.9 percent, also sharply above 50, and close to 59.4 points in November.

“Accordingly, significant improvements were observed in business activities related to other personal service activities, transportation and accommodation, food and beverage sub-sectors, amid the festive and holiday seasons, and tourist arrivals reaching its peak,” the statement said.

“Further, wholesale and retail trade subsector showed a strong growth due to seasonal sales. Meanwhile, financial services also improved further in line with the increase in lending activities.” (Colombo/Jan17/2024)

### Human immunoglobulin scandal: Seven accused including ex-Health Secretary further remanded

*2024-01-17 14:29:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96481/human-immunoglobulin-scandal-seven-accused-including-ex-health-secretary-further-remanded)*

Seven suspects including the former Secretary to the Ministry of Health, Janaka Chandragupta, were further remanded on Wednesday (Jan.17) over the controversial procurement of substandard human immunoglobulin vials.

Chandragupta was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on December 18, when he arrived at the premises to record a statement substandard human immunoglobulin scandal.

On December 14, Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama had declared that the actions of the former Secretary of the Ministry of Health pertaining to the process of purchasing the batch of ‘substandard’ human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were deemed suspicious.

Thus, the magistrate also ordered that all responsible parties be arrested and produced before the court irrespective of their positions, for the administration of justice over the providing of substandard medicine to the public.

### Education of children directly impacts overall success of the nation – Saman Ekanayake

*2024-01-17 14:22:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96480/education-of-children-directly-impacts-overall-success-of-the-nation-saman-ekanayake-)*

President’s Secretary Mr. Saman Ekanayake underscored the pivotal role of education in shaping the lives of children, emphasizing that it is the sole pathway to their success. He highlighted that the successful completion of education leads to the formation of informed citizens, directly impacting the overall success of the nation.

President’s Secretary, Mr. Saman Ekanayake, made this statement during his participation in the ceremony held recently to inaugurate the provision of a fully equipped library to Konkadawala Vidyalaya, Navagaththegama.

These remarks were expressed during Mr. Ekanayake’s participation in a ceremony, where a fully equipped library was provided to Konkadawala Vidyalaya, Navagaththegama.

With the guidance of President’s Secretary Mr. Saman Ekanayake and the support of Chinese financial assistance, two fully equipped libraries were established at Konkadawala Vidyalaya, Navagaththegama, and Duwa Junior College, Negombo, facilitated by the intervention of the President’s Office.

Each library, costing Rs. 02 million, is stocked with essential books for students ranging from grade 6 to grade 11. The primary aim of this initiative is to assist rural students facing economic challenges, fostering a future generation enriched with knowledge.

During his speech, Mr. Ekanayake shared that the idea of providing libraries to these schools stemmed from a conversation with the Chinese Deputy Ambassador to Sri Lanka, who expressed the possibility of supporting a Rs. 04 million project. He selected two schools, reflecting on the potential impact these libraries could have on the education of children attending these institutions over the next decade. Mr. Ekanayake, drawing from his own experiences of receiving primary education in a similar small school, emphasized the importance of supporting these children’s education to pave the way for their future.

He shared a poignant story about the Chinese Deputy Ambassador’s father. ‘To the best of my knowledge, the father of the present Chinese Deputy Ambassador, who is in attendance today, worked as a farmer. In the eighth grade, the Chinese Deputy Ambassador’s father insisted that he join in planting activities, leading to significant back pain after an hour of labour. Upon sharing this discomfort with his father, the advice given was, “If you don’t excel in your studies, you may find yourself compelled to engage in this occupation.”

Embracing that valuable lesson, the Deputy Ambassador has risen to the position of Deputy Ambassador today, operating on an international stage. This success underscores the vital message that children should internalize — education stands as the sole means to triumph in life. It is imperative to recognize that, without education, the future holds uncertainties not just for the individual children but also for the prosperity of the entire nation’.

The event was attended by State Minister Arundika Fernando, Member of Parliament Dr. Kavinda Jayawardene, Chinese Deputy Ambassador to Sri Lanka YANWAI ZHU, officials from the Ministry of Education, Principals, teaching staff, parents and a group of students.

### Sri Lanka discusses economic ties, EDR with India envoy

*2024-01-17 12:00:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-discusses-economic-ties-edr-with-india-envoy-147549/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s State Minister of Finance met with the Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha to discuss cooperation on economic concerns.

“Engaged in fruitful discussions on fostering mutual economic partnerships between our two countries, collaborative initiatives aimed at enhancing economic ties and progress on debt restructuring process,” State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said on X.

So far India has executed over a billion US dollars of projects in the island.

Investors from India, Jio Platforms Ltd and Pettigo – a unit of Reliance industries, have expressed interest in buying Sri Lanka Telecom. India’s Airtel already has a mobile unit in Sri Lanka’s telecom sector.

India is already involved in the country’s ports sector. The Adani group is building a container terminal in Colombo Port.

Sri Lanka blocked a Chinese power sector investment in the North, reportedly under Indian pressure.

The government has also temporarily halted foreign research ships after strong security concerns raised by neighbour India after the visit of two Chinese research vessels.

Political analysts say India has influence in the Sri Lankan election given it is closely connected with ethnic minority Tamils especially those who came down to the island nation from India as plantation workers during the British rule. India is involved in many housing projects for this group.

### High Posts Committee approves 5 top appointments including PUCSL chief

### China’s population drops for second straight year despite efforts to boost birth rate

*2024-01-17 11:39:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96472/chinas-population-drops-for-second-straight-year-despite-efforts-to-boost-birth-rate-)*

China’s population dropped by 2 million people in 2023 in the second straight annual drop as births fell and deaths jumped after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the government said Wednesday.

The number of deaths more than doubled to 690,000. Demographers were expecting a sharp rise in deaths because of COVID-19 outbreaks that started at the end of the previous year and continued through February of last year. The total population stood at 1.4 billion, the statistics bureau said. China, long the most populated country in the world, dropped into second place behind India in 2023, according to U.N. estimates.

The number of births fell for the seventh year, reflecting a fall in the birth rate that is a long-running economic and societal challenge for China. The population is aging steadily, which could slow economic growth over time and challenge the nation’s ability to provide for a larger elderly population with fewer workers.

The number of births fell by 540,000, which was less than in previous years. About 9 million babies were born in 2023, half of the total in 2016. All the figures are estimates based on surveys and do not include Hong Kong and Macao. China conducts a full census every 10 years.

China, which once sought to control population growth with its one-child policy, is now facing the opposite problem. The government has sought to encourage births since easing the policy over 2015 to 2016 to allow a second child and then a third child in 2021, but with little success.

People are marrying later and sometimes choosing not to have children. Even those that do often have only one child because of the high cost of educating children in cities in a highly competitive academic environment. The population of women of child-bearing age has also fallen.

The working-age population, defined as those between 16 and 59 years old, fell to 61% of the total population, continuing a gradual decline. The proportion of those aged 60 and older ticked up to 21%. The official retirement age in China is 60 years old for men and 50 or 55 for women.

It is not clear how many people died from COVID-19 because of the sudden end to China’s “zero-COVID” restrictions in December 2022. The government has reported about 80,000 COVID-related deaths from December to February but experts believe it is much higher. Studies have estimated it could have reached 1.4 million or 1.9 million deaths.

The drop in population is expected to be less this year, because of the waning effects of the pandemic and the fact that it is the year of the dragon, considered an auspicious year to have children, an expert said at a forum earlier this week, according to the China Daily, an English-language state-owned newspaper.

But Yuan Xin, a professor at Nankai University and vice-president of the China Population Association, added that “the downward trend in China’s total population is bound to be long-term and become an inherent characteristic.”

### Special notice on commencement of second phase of third school term

The Education Ministry has announced the dates to commence the second phase of the third term of government and government-approved private schools.

The Examinations Department said the new exam date and time would be as follows:

### Sri Lanka Receives 117 Tonnes of Sunflower Oil

*2024-01-17 11:15:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/17/sri-lanka-receives-117-tonnes-of-sunflower-oil/)*

COLOMBO (News 1st); The Russian Federation has delivered 117 tonnes of sunflower oil to Sri Lanka as humanitarian assistance. The donation, handed over by Russian Ambassador Levan S. Dzhagaryan, was received with gratitude by Sri Lankan officials.

"This is the second batch of vegetable oil we have provided to Sri Lanka since September last year," Ambassador Dzhagaryan said during the handover ceremony. "We hope to continue our support, not only to the friendly people of Sri Lanka, but also to other countries in need across Africa and Asia."

The Ambassador acknowledged the ongoing challenges facing Russia, including international sanctions. He emphasized, however, that "thanks to the government's policies and President Putin's leadership, the Russian Federation has overcome many difficulties and emerged as Europe's top economy and the world's fifth, behind China, the United States, India, and Japan." He added, somewhat surprisingly, "It sounds a bit ironic, but thanks to the sanctions, we have boosted our domestic production and are moving forward under my president's guidance."

The sunflower oil donation comes amid a difficult period for Sri Lanka, with the country grappling with an economic crisis. The aid is aimed at supporting Sri Lankan households facing food shortages and rising prices.

### Supreme Court deems Duminda Silva’s presidential pardon invalid

*2024-01-17 10:54:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96470/supreme-court-deems-duminda-silvas-presidential-pardon-invalid)*

The Supreme Court has declared former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s decision to grant presidential pardon to former MP Duminda Silva, convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra, as invalid.

The relevant court order was issued by a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court when several petitions filed by the late Premachandra’s wife and daughter, Sumana and Hirunika Premachandra and former Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) Attorney-at-Law Ghazali Hussain, was taken up in court this morning  (17 Jan.).

The judge bench was presided over by Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and consisted Justices Gamini Amarasekara and Arjuna Obeysekara.

Thus, the Commissioner General of Prisons was instructed by the Supreme Court to take the relevant measures necessary so as to impose the impending sentence against Duminda Silva, adding that former President Gotabaya had failed to follow the proper legal procedure when granting the said amnesty.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court ordered the Commissioner General of Prisons to take steps to implement the sentence previously imposed on this petitioner.

### BREAKING: Supreme Court Declares Duminda Silva Pardon Unlawful

*2024-01-17 10:45:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/17/breaking-supreme-court-declares-duminda-silva-pardon-unlawful/)*

COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka's Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that the presidential pardon granted to former MP Duminda Silva by ex-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was unlawful.

Silva, alongside four others, was convicted in 2016 by the High Court for the 2011 murder of politician Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra.

All five received the death penalty, a verdict later upheld by a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court.

However, following his election victory in 2019, Gotabaya Rajapaksa unexpectedly granted a pardon solely to Silva.

Three separate fundamental rights petitions challenging the legality of the pardon were subsequently filed with the Supreme Court.

The fundamental rights applications were filed by Hirunika Premachandra, her mother Sumana Premachandra, and Former Human Rights Commissioner Ghazali Hussain, PC.

### Navy apprehends 18 Indian fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters

*2024-01-17 10:31:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96469/navy-apprehends-18-indian-fishermen-poaching-in-sri-lankan-waters)*

Sri Lanka Navy has apprehended 18 Indian fishermen who were poaching in Sri Lankan waters off Mannar on Tuesday evening (Jan.16).

In an operation mounted off the coast of Mannar by the North Central Naval Command, the naval personnel had impounded 2 Indian fishing trawlers with 18 fishermen aboard.

The apprehended Indian fishermen and the poaching trawlers have been brought ashore to the Thalpadu Pier in Mannar and they are due to be handed over to the Talaimannar Fisheries Inspector for onward legal action.

The Navy conducts regular patrols and operations in Sri Lankan waters to curb illegal fishing practices by foreign fishing trawlers, taking into account the consequences of these practices on the livelihood of local fishermen and the marine resources of the country.

COLOMBO (News 1st); International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva met with Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and took the opportunity to praise the country's economic reform efforts.

Georgieva highlighted the significance of the IMF Board's approval of the first review of Sri Lanka's Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program in December 2023. This approval, she stated, "was a recognition of the important reforms Sri Lanka has pursued."

Expressing optimism about the progress made, Georgieva further declared, "These reforms are starting to pay off!"

At a separate event on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, President Ranil Wickremesinghe offered a cautiously optimistic outlook on Sri Lanka's economic recovery, highlighting progress in debt restructuring and praising the IMF's recent program review.

Wickremesinghe described his surprise when a visiting IMF team acknowledged Sri Lanka's "over-performance" in tackling the ongoing economic crisis.

He underscored the severity of the crisis, stating that "it affected all adversely," and reiterated the importance of the debt restructuring agreement reached with the IMF.

"There is no other way out for Sri Lanka," Wickremesinghe emphasized, acknowledging the crucial role in facilitating negotiations with the country's creditors.

According to Wickremesinghe, all of Sri Lanka's official creditors have agreed in principle to restructure debt in line with the IMF's target requirements. The next hurdle lies in finalizing discussions with commercial creditors.

The successful completion of the IMF's first program review in December 2023 further emboldens Sri Lanka's optimism.

Wickremesinghe said this achievement is a turning point, paving the way for the economy to shift from stabilization to recovery and growth in 2024.

He emphasized the need for continued commitment to IMF-backed reforms and reiterated the importance of transparency and accountability.

### செங்கடலில் பதட்டம்; கொழும்பு துறைமுகத்திற்கு கிடைத்த நன்மை

*2024-01-17 10:06:40 - [tamilmirrorlk](https://www.tamilmirror.lk/உலக-செய்திகள்/செங்கடலில்-பதட்டம்-கொழும்பு-துறைமுகத்திற்கு-கிடைத்த-நன்மை/50-331634)*

செங்கடல் வழியாக செல்லும் வணிகக் கப்பல்கள் மீது ஏமன் ஹவுதி கிளர்ச்சியாளர்கள் தாக்குதல் நடத்துவதால், உலகச் சந்தை கடுமையாகப் பாதிக்கப்படும் என எச்சரிக்கைகள் வந்துகொண்டு இருக்கின்றன.

அதாவது, தெற்கு செங்கடலில் பதற்றத்தைத் தவிர்க்கும் வகையில், கப்பல்கள் வசதியான போக்குவரத்துப் புள்ளியாக இலங்கையின் கொழும்பு துறைமுகத்தை கண்டறிந்ததால், சமீபத்திய வாரங்களில் இலங்கைக்கு வரும் கொள்கலன் அளவுகளில் பெரிய முன்னேற்றம் கண்டுள்ளதாக அதிகாரிகள் செவ்வாய்க்கிழமை தெரிவித்தனர்.

ஏமன் ஹவுதி கிளர்ச்சியாளர்கள் நவம்பர் முதல் செங்கடலில் கப்பல்களைத் தாக்கியுள்ளனர், இது உலகின் கப்பல் போக்குவரத்தில் சுமார் 12% பகுதி ஆகும்.

இதற்குப் பதிலளிக்கும் விதமாக, சில கப்பல் நிறுவனங்கள் இப்போது தென் ஆப்பிரிக்காவின் ‘கேப் ஆஃப் குட் ஹோப்’-ஐச் சுற்றிகொண்டு ஒரு நீண்ட பாதையில் செல்கின்றன.

இதனால் பயணம் சுமார் 10 நாட்கள் நீளும். இதற்கு பல மில்லியன் டாலர்கள் அதிகமாகச் செலவாகும்.

“கப்பல்கள் தென்னாப்பிரிக்காவைக் கடந்து வரும்போது, அவர்கள் சந்திக்கும் முதல் மையம் கொழும்புதான்... சிங்கப்பூர் தொலைவில் உள்ளது. எனவே அணுகுவதற்கு இதுவே எளிதான துறைமுகம்” என வீரசிங்க தெரிவித்தார்.

கொழும்பு துறைமுகம் மூலோபாய இடம் காரணமாக உள்ளதால், மத்திய கிழக்கு, தெற்காசியா மற்றும் கிழக்கு ஆசியாவிற்கு கப்பல்களுக்கு வசதியான அணுகலை இது வழங்குகிறதாக இலங்கை துறைமுக அதிகாரசபையின் (SLPA) மூத்த அதிகாரி லால் வீரசிங்க தெரிவித்தார்.

மேலும், கொழும்பு துறைமுகமானது ஆப்பிரிக்கா, மத்திய கிழக்கு மற்றும் கிழக்கு ஆசிய நாடுகளுக்கு இடையே உள்ள முக்கிய துறைமுகமாகும் என்றார். R

### SriLankan Airlines misses another coupon on its 2024 bond - report

*2024-01-17 10:04:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96468/srilankan-airlines-misses-another-coupon-on-its-2024-bond-report)*

SriLankan Airlines Ltd. missed a third coupon payment on its dollar bond due later this year, according to a filing on Tuesday.

The company said a further event of default would occur because it doesn’t intend to pay the coupon due on Dec. 25, having already missed payments in December 2022 and June 2023.

The airline’s board intends to communicate further with the holders of these notes, it said.

The bond with semi-annual payments matures on June 25 this year, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.

The airline recently extended the deadline to seek investor interest for its sale. Selection of pre-qualified bidders is now set for mid-February instead of end-January, according to a notice posted on the Finance Ministry website earlier this month. It didn’t give a reason for the postponement.

Sri Lanka has been looking to sell its national airline at least since mid 2022, with President Ranil Wickremesinghe then saying the country’s poorest people who’ve never flown shouldn’t be saddled with its losses. The carrier serviced 126 destinations in more than 60 countries prior to the pandemic.

### Govt. nursing officers on 24-hour token strike today

The Government Nursing Officers’ Association has launched an island-wide 24-hour token strike with effect from 7:00 a.m. today (Jan.17).

Commenting in this regard, the national organizer of the association Sudath Jayasiri explained that the nursing officers decided to resort to a one-day token strike as the discussions held with the Health Minister and the State Minister for Finance were unfruitful.

Meanwhile, several other health trade unions that engaged in a token strike on Tuesday (Jan.16) have temporarily called off their trade union action at 6:30 a.m. this morning.

The president of Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) Upul Rohana, however, has vowed to resume the trade union action if the authorities fail to address their problems within a week’s time. He said around 100,000 health workers including all paramedical services, hospital secretaries, administrative officers as well as health administrative assistants, minor staff and 75 other trade unions of the health staff would join this island-wide strike.

### Sri Lanka’s Colombo Port sees jump in traffic amid Red Sea tensions

*2024-01-17 08:28:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96465/sri-lankas-colombo-port-sees-jump-in-traffic-amid-red-sea-tensions)*

Sri Lanka’s Colombo port has seen a big jump in container volumes in recent weeks as vessels steering clear of tensions in the southern Red Sea have found it a convenient transit point, officials said on Tuesday.

Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels have since November attacked ships in the Red Sea, part of a route that accounts for about 12% of the world’s shipping traffic, in what they say is an effort to support Palestinians in the war with Israel.

In response, some shipping companies have instructed vessels to sail around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, a slower and more expensive route.

Due to Colombo’s strategic location, stopping at the port gives ships convenient access to the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia, said Lal Weerasinghe, a senior official at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).

“When ships come past South Africa, Colombo is the first hub they meet...Singapore is further away. So this is the easiest port to access,” Weerasinghe said.

Port of Colombo is a key port between Africa, the Middle East and East Asia and handled 6.94 million 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU) in 2023, a 2% jump for the year, SLPA data showed. In December, TEUs jumped 15% on year.

Over the last four to six weeks, shipping lines requested more berthing windows at the port’s three terminals and transhipment volumes from neighbouring India also grew, two terminal operators said.

“We typically handle about 5,000-5,500 TEUs (per day) but since late last year there has been an increase of about 1,000 TEUs per day,” said Weerasinghe.

“We were forced to decline requests from about four shipping lines to increase traffic because it would cause delays for existing customers.”

As much as 50% of the uptick is from Mediterranean Shipping Company, the leading container shipping company, Weerasinghe added.

Shipping companies are also increasingly using Colombo as a relaying port, sometimes offloading their entire cargo to a different ship, he added.

Vessel calls have risen at other Colombo port terminals too.

“There is a lot of transhipment from India. We are hoping increased traffic will help Colombo port edge closer to double-digit growth in the first quarter,” said an official from a privately-run terminal.

He declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media.

(Reuters) - Qatar and France have brokered a deal with Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to deliver urgent medication to some 45 Israeli hostages held by the group in Gaza in return for humanitarian and medical aid for the most vulnerable civilians.

The two countries said the aid would leave Qatar for Egypt on Wednesday before being taken across the Rafah border crossing.

Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said in a statement the deal would mean “medicine along with other humanitarian aid is to be delivered to civilians in the Gaza Strip, in the most affected and vulnerable areas, in exchange for delivering medication needed for Israeli captives in Gaza.”

He did not give details on how much aid or what aid would be delivered to civilians.

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said two Qatari Air Force planes were to land on Wednesday in Egypt with medicines purchased in France based on an Israeli list.

Earlier, Philippe Lalliot, head of France’s foreign ministry crisis centre which organises aid efforts, said negotiations had been going on for weeks and the initial idea had come from the families of some of the Israeli hostages.

Specific medical packages for several months, which were put together in France, would be delivered to each of the 45 hostages. The International Committee of the Red Cross will coordinate on the ground.

France still has three nationals held in Gaza, but none of them are in urgent need of medication, Lalliot said.

### MIDDLE EAST WAR: Iran strike in Pakistan kills 2 children. Iran says it was a militant base

*2024-01-17 05:32:00 - [newsfirstlk](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/01/17/middle-east-war-iran-strike-in-pakistan-kills-2-children-iran-says-it-was-a-militant-base/)*

Colombo (News 1st) – Yet another new dimension opened in the Middle East crisis late Tuesday as Iran bombed what it said was an anti-Iran Sunni militant base in Pakistan. The Pakistani government said two children were killed and three more children wounded, foreign media reported.

Iran's state-run IRNA news agency and state television said that missiles and drones were used in the strikes in Pakistan to target the Jaish al-Adl militant group. Press TV, the English-language arm of Iranian state television, attributed the attack to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.

The drone and missile strike was in Balochistan’s Panjgur district, about 50km inside Pakistan. The Jaish al-Adl militant group has staged several attacks in Iran.

Pakistan’s foreign ministry condemned the strikes and warned of serious consequences. “Pakistan strongly condemns the unprovoked violation of its airspace by Iran which resulted in the death of two innocent children while injuring three girls. This violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty is completely unacceptable and can have serious consequences” the statement said.

Just a few hours earlier, Iran struck what it said were Mossad sites in the town of Erbil in the Kurdish-controlled region of northern Iraq. The Iraqi government has condemned the attacks and said there are no Mossad bases in Iraq.

Meanwhile, US forces carried a third set of strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen late Tuesday, hours after a Greek merchant ship was hit by a ballistic missile in the Red Sea, and a US cargo ship was also hit by a missile.

In Gaza, fighting continued to rage, with a tentative deal reached for Qatar to send in a shipment of medicines.

The UN in a statement late Tuesday said that almost the entire population of Gaza is going hungry and said Israel is “destroying Gaza’s food system and using food as a weapon against the Palestinian people”.

### ICJ says new Bill to establish “Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation” lacks credibility

*2024-01-17 05:10:44 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/ICJ-says-new-Bill-to-establish-Commission-for-Truth-Unity-and-Reconciliation-lacks-credibility/14-757436)*

The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) in a statement said it considers the Government’s proposed Bill to establish a Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation unlikely to advance accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims and survivors of the 26-year-long armed conflict that ended in 2009 and involved widespread atrocities.

The ICJ is concerned that the lack of consultation with victim communities and the continued neglect of their demands deprive the Bill of legitimacy.

A draft Bill on Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation was gazetted on 1 January 2024, to establish the Commission, amidst a climate of impunity for past human rights violations and abuses and intimidation of victim communities in the north and east of the country.

“Considering the repressive political climate in Sri Lanka, and the absence of the conditions that are necessary to ensure the success of the proposed Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation, the Bill appears to be more of a legislative manoeuvre aimed at deflecting the attention of the Human Rights Council and removing Sri Lanka from further scrutiny rather than a genuine accountability measure,” said ICJ’s Asia Director Melissa Upreti.

The Bill suffers from a lack of transparency regarding the consultation process and non-acceptance by victim communities.

If adopted, it would empower the Attorney-General to prosecute cases where the Commission makes a finding of responsibility for an offence. The ICJ is concerned that in the past the Attorney-General’s office has assumed potentially conflicting dual roles of legal advisor for the State and prosecutor of offences allegedly committed by State officials. The ICJ has previously noted how the Department had mishandled cases relating to serious human rights violations and abuses which has contributed to a climate of mistrust. The ICJ recalls that the years since the end of the conflict have been marked by near total impunity for conflict era crimes, owing to the failure of the Attorney-General’s Department to act to hold to account those responsible for serious crimes under international law.

The Bill provides that appointments to the Commission will be made by the President upon the recommendation of the Constitutional Council. The ICJ has previously noted that the governing party holds a majority in the Constitutional Council and that a majority of members are parliamentarians with only three members appointed from outside. Further, a representative of the smaller political parties (including parliamentarians representing the north and east) is yet to be appointed to the Council. The ICJ is concerned that these arrangements are conducive to creating a Commission that lacks independence and may be subjected to political pressures and considerations in carrying out its work. The situation is exacerbated by the Constitutional Council approving the appointment of the current Acting Inspector General of Police who had in December 2023 been held directly responsible for torture by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka.

The Bill would further authorise the proposed Commission to seek the assistance of the police to conduct investigations and liaise with the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses, which in turn depends on the police to provide support for the protection of victims and witnesses. However, a number of police officials have allegedly been responsible for recent cases of torture and ill-treatment and extra judicial killings. The Government’s failure to initiate thorough and impartial investigations into these cases and to bring perpetrators to justice has deepened the public’s mistrust of the police and prosecuting agencies.

Successive UN Human Rights Council Resolutions on Sri Lanka have called for the establishment of transitional justice mechanisms with the active participation of all stakeholders, including women who have been at the forefront in leading victim demands for accountability, particularly for cases of enforced disappearance. Yet, protesting mothers and female family members of the disappeared are routinely detained, intimidated or put under surveillance and their voices suppressed.

The Bill lacks also provisions that are gender responsive and makes the establishment of mechanisms and procedures to address women’s concerns discretionary.

Existing transitional justice institutions such as the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) and the Office for Reparations have been ineffective. As underscored by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the OMP has failed to earn the trust of victims and their representatives. As recently observed by the High Commissioner, there has been little to no development regarding cases of past human rights violations and abuses.

“The victims of Sri Lanka’s 26-year armed conflict, replete with atrocities, have been forced to wait too long to learn the truth about their loved ones and to be granted justice. When the UN Human Rights Council considers a new resolution on Sri Lanka later this year, it must avoid blind acceptance of Sri Lanka’s flawed transitional justice process and institutions and adopt an approach that genuinely puts the interests of victims and survivors first,” added Upreti.

The draft Bill provides for the establishment of the Commission with a Head Office based in Colombo and Regional Offices as necessary (clause 2). The Commission will have between seven to twenty-one members, who are to be appointed by the President upon recommendation by the Constitutional Council (clause 3). The term of the Commissioners is five years (unless removed earlier) and the President can extend their term on a yearly basis for an additional two years (clause 9). The Commission may conduct public or closed sittings as necessary (clause 7).

The stated objectives of the Commission are to investigate, inquire and make recommendations in respect of complaints or allegations or reports relating to damage or harm caused to persons or property, loss of life or alleged violation of human rights which occurred during the conflict in the Northern and Eastern Provinces between 1983 to 2009 or connected to such period or its aftermath and has a mandate to promote truth telling and make recommendations for reparations, and non – recurrence (clause 12). If it appears to the Commission that an offence under any Sri Lankan law has been committed it may refer the matter to the relevant law enforcement or prosecuting authorities for further investigation and necessary action (clause 13 (zd)). The Commission does not have the mandate to determine civil or criminal liability of any person (Clause 16 (1)) and instead the onus is on the Attorney-General to institute criminal proceedings regarding an offence in Court based on material collected by the Commission (clause 16 (2)).

The Bill also provides for the establishment of a Victim and Witness Protection Division (clause 28) and a Data Management Division (clause 29). The Commission may also appoint any mechanisms and procedure to address requirements related to women, children, persons with disabilities and disadvantaged groups and advisors relating to specific issues (clause 30).

The Bill also provides for the appointment of an advisory panel to advise the Commission on matters referred to the Panel (clause 32). This panel is to consist of a minimum of ten members appointed by the President on the Commission’s recommendation. Clause 39 of the Bill states that within one month of the interim report of the Commission being published the President shall appoint a monitoring committee to implement the findings of the report. Clause 40 states that such Committee be comprised of 11 members, of which six members are to be recommended by the Constitutional Council while the others are members ex-officio. Ex-officio members include the Secretaries of the Ministries of Defence, Justice, Law & Order, Finance, Public Administration & Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment or their nominees.  The Committee is expected so submit bi-annual plans evaluating the implementation of recommendations of the TUR Commission and other previous Commissions of Inquiry.

Clause 49 of the Bill states that the Commission can defer its investigation regarding any disappearance of a person/s if requested to do so by the OMP until such time it can be resumed without compromising inquiries conducted by the OMP.

In September 2023, the ICJ joined eight other international human rights organizations in expressing their grave reservations about the proposed Truth, Unity and Reconciliation Commission and setting out prerequisites to be addressed before appointing any new Commission. The concerns relate to Sri Lanka’s legacy of failed commissions, lack of a conducive environment and confidence building efforts, lack of meaningful consultations with victim communities, the failure of domestic transitional justice institutions, and the blocking of prosecutions. None of these concerns have been addressed to date, which bring into question the newly proposed Commission’s likelihood of serving as an effective mechanism for accountability.

### Commission for Truth, Unity, and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka- A Bill

*2024-01-17 05:09:10 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Commission-for-Truth-Unity-and-Reconciliation-in-Sri-Lanka-A-Bill/4-757435)*

As long as impunity prevails, SL will achieve neither genuine reconciliation nor sustainable peace - UN Deputy High Commissioner of Human Rights

The Government has published a Bill to establish the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka in the Gazette of 29 December, 2023 that was issued on January 1, 2024.  The Foreign Affairs Minister discussed this initiative with a group of civil society, and it was once again discussed during the preparation of the Bill.

We had Presidential Commissions of Inquires such as, the Udalagama Commission in 2006 to investigate and inquire into alleged serious violations of human rights arising since 1 August, 2005; the C.R.De Silva Commission in May 2010 on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation (LLRC); and the Paranagama Commission in August 2013 to investigate Complaints of Abductions and Disappearances, in respect of the armed ethnic conflict that ended in 2009.

All these commissions were established under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, by the President. However, the recommendations were hardly implemented.

The following was stated by the UN Deputy High Commissioner of Human Rights during the oral update at the 53rd session of the Human Rights Council in June 2023.

“The announcement of plans for a Truth Commission or similar reconciliation mechanisms requires attention. Sri Lanka has witnessed too many ad hoc commissions in the past that failed to ensure accountability. The Office on Missing Persons has not achieved the results that provide satisfaction to victims. What is needed is a coherent plan that connects the different elements of truth, redress, memorialisation, accountability and creates the right enabling environment for a successful and sustainable transitional justice process. Accountability remains the fundamental gap in attempts to deal with the past. As long as impunity prevails, Sri Lanka will achieve neither genuine reconciliation nor sustainable peace.”

Under the recommendations of the UNHRC resolution A/HRC/51/5 in October 2022, it was stated as follows:

“Prepare a comprehensive strategy on transitional justice and accountability, with a time-bound plan to implement outstanding commitments, including taking steps in relation to the establishment of a credible truth-seeking mechanism and an ad hoc special court, as well as security sector reform and vetting, and re-energise the Office on Missing Persons and the Office for Reparations to ensure that they can discharge their full mandate independently and effectively.”

The LLRC recommended conducting investigations and prosecuting offenders and justified it as follows:

“It is also the obligation of the Government to clear the good name and protect the honour and professional reputation of soldiers who defended the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka and particularly the many thousands of soldiers who perished carrying out their combat duties cleanly and professionally against a widely condemned terrorist group that used most inhumane tactics in combat. Offences if any, of a few cannot be allowed to tarnish the honour of the many who upheld the finest traditions of service.”

Therefore, the intention of the Government is to address all outstanding issues that were repeatedly emphasised by many. It is a switch from presidential commissions of inquiries of which the implementation of the recommendations was not acceptable, to a Parliamentary Act with wider scope and a mechanism of implementation of the recommendations.

The objective of the Sri Lankan Bill according to Section 12(1),is that the Commission shall investigate, inquire, and make recommendations in respect of complaints, or allegations, or reports relating to damage or harm caused to persons or property, loss of life or alleged violation of human rights anywhere in Sri Lanka, that were caused in the course of, or reasonably connected to, or consequent to the conflict that took place in the Northern and Eastern Provinces during the period 1983 to 2009, or its aftermath.

In Section 12(2) it was stated that subject to the provisions of subsection (1), the mandate of the Commission includes several points that were described in sub sections running from (a) to (l).

Sub section (h)(xii)  is as follows: “Investigating and making recommendations in respect of the allegations of damage or harm caused to persons or property or loss of life or alleged violation of human rights referred to in subsection (1), including making findings in regard to those responsible for the commission of the alleged violations and abuses referred to in subsection (1), including those who advised, planned, directed, commanded or ordered such atrocities.”

The Commission can refer matters to the relevant law enforcement or prosecuting authorities of Sri Lanka for further investigation and necessary action, where it appears to the Commission that an offence or offences punishable under the Penal Code(Chapter 19) or any other law of Sri Lanka has been committed (Section 13 zd).

According to Section 16(2), it shall be lawful for the Attorney-General to institute criminal proceedings in a designated court of law in respect of any offence based on material collected in the course of an investigation or inquiry or both, as the case may be, by the Commission established under this Act. This content was also in Section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Act No 16 of 2008.

Therefore, the provisions of the Bill are in line with the thinking of the UNHRC and LLRC in relation to accountability.

In South Africa, The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established by the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act No 34 of 1995. The main objectives of the South African Commission was to establish the complete picture of nature, causes and the extent of gross violations of human rights during the specified period, facilitating the granting of amnesty to persons who make full disclosure of the relevant facts,  establishing and making known the fate of victims by granting them an opportunity to relate their own account of violations, and compiling a comprehensive report with recommendations to prevent the future violations of human rights.

We can discern that the objective of the Sri Lankan Bill is fundamentally different to the South African Act. In South Africa no party has denied that atrocities were committed and both parties to the conflict admitted that. South Africa wanted to heal their wounds and move forward. Hence, the concept of revealing the truth followed by amnesty came in.

The term of the commission is five years and it could be extended by another 2 years. The provisions of the Bill are action oriented. The criticisms of the fate of the previous Presidential Commissions of Inquiries were addressed in the Bill and remedial actions taken.

After submitting the interim reports biannually or the final report to the President, the Commission should release those to the media in all three languages and within 21 days the President should table it in Parliament (Section 15).  Within one month from the date of publication of the first interim report, the President shall establish a Monitoring Committee to monitor and facilitate the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission (Section 39).

The Monitoring Committee shall consist of five ex-officio secretaries to specific ministries and six members recommended by the Constitutional Council and appointed by the President. The Committee shall submit bi-annual reports to the President every six months, evaluating the efforts of the Government and the efforts of any other person or body concerned to implement the recommendations of the Commission and other previous Commissions of Inquiry and the President shall table such reports in Parliament not later than two weeks from the receipt of such report (Section 40).

Finally, Parliament may take cognisance of the recommendations based on interim reports or the final report, as the case may be, and pass such resolution it may consider necessary to promote national unity and reconciliation (Section 16).

It seems the President and the Government are making reforms in a slow and steady manner not only in the economic front but also in the political front, although there are widespread concerns about some of the actions of the President. Once the President attempted to implement the 13 Amendment to the Constitution in full. There was criticism against him that attempting unpopular reforms on both fronts simultaneously would be detrimental in a future election. However, it appears this is not a concern for him.

### DAT and Tit for Tat fight for equality

*2024-01-17 05:05:39 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/DAT-and-Tit-for-Tat-fight-for-equality/4-757434)*

Last week, according to media reports all Government hospitals were almost completely closed. Except for sensitive and crucially important places like the Apeksha cancer hospital, the Lady Ridgeway children’s hospital, Emergency admissions and Cardiac treatment, all others were reported closed from Tuesday to Friday and came back to normalcy by Saturday morning. Not due to lack of medicines or other necessities, but due to a string of work stoppages by all hospital staff other than the medical doctors.

They were all protesting against the Government’s decision to double the Rs.35,000 per month DAT allowance of medical doctors to Rs.70,000, ignoring all others in the health sector. Health sector trade unions including nurses, paramedics, ophthalmologists, family health and even public health inspectors demanded an increase in their allowances by Rs.35,000 per month. Paramedics were reported as having threatened to go on a continuous strike, “if the Government fails to address the issue.” That was to say, they want the issue settled with a Rs.35,000 increase in their take home pay.

They justify their demand on the grounds that, if medical doctors cannot survive the increase in the cost of living with their present take home salary and PP income, if they need such increase in their take home pay with the DAT allowance doubled, then none in the health sector would survive with their present salaries. Most in lower categories do not even have a “take home pay” as large as that of the increase of DAT allowance to Rs.70,000 said a hospital staff, when I queried about their demand for an equivalent to the DAT increase. A trained Government nurse with five years’ service would get only Rs.46,000 I was told.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge is on record saying, there is no justification in demanding an increase equivalent to that of DAT by others. He asked where on earth support staff in the judicial system gets wage increases similar to those given to Judges. That argument by the GMOA boss against salary increases for others in the health sector cannot be compared to that of Judges by any means. Judges do not have overtime pay as doctors do. Nor do Judges indulge in private practice as doctors do. Doctors in Government service enjoy both overtime pay and PP, in total violation of medical ethics and morals. Aluthge’s argument thus exposed the nauseating ego and the selfish mindset of the GMOA. DAT by itself is no legitimate allowance, the GMOA forced the then Government to accept at the expense of innocent patients in Government hospitals held captive. Not only DAT, every salary increase and privilege the medical doctors enjoy has been at the expense of these patients.

I believe, people should know what DAT is that they would have to shoulder with the massive increase announced. DAT is an exclusive monthly allowance paid to Government medical doctors in hospitals. DAT stands for “Disturbance, Availability and Transport”. It is about medical doctors being called while off duty to attend to warded patients in the hospital he or she is posted in. What the GMOA says is, if medical doctors are “disturbed” when off duty and called to attend to a patient and if they make themselves “available” despite being off duty, they should be paid for all that and that is the DAT allowance.

There are around 13,000 medical doctors attached to hospitals out of the 17,000 plus medical doctors in Government service. Of them, only about 11,000 take care of patients in hospital wards and OPDs.

Technically they are the only medical doctors who should be qualified for DAT. Qualifying for DAT does not necessarily mean they have to be paid the DAT allowance every month. According to its explanation DAT is for doctors that make such visits. How many medical doctors are disturbed on an average and make themselves available for such calls during a month? Does it mean a single visit a month would qualify a doctor to have the now increased monthly DAT allowance of Rs.70,000?

DAT has no criteria. It carries with it a consciously camouflaged aberration in implementation. Though expressed as “off duty hospital visits” DAT is a lump sum monthly allowance. There are no calculations possible for single visits in DAT. Therefore, no individual records of frantic calls for doctor visits to hospitals are necessary. DAT monthly allowance was approved by the Treasury on principle and it is now doubled from this January as approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. I would therefore, not be surprised if all 17,000 plus Government medical officers are paid DAT, including those released from service for trade union work or for funded projects.

There is illegitimacy and immorality in most privileges that Government medical officers (GMO) enjoy. Perhaps in the whole world, 17,000 plus Government medical doctors remain the only public sector that enjoy the right to be on duty without recording their time of arrival for duty and departure, but have the right to claim overtime. They definitely are the only unique profession in public service who have the right to claim overtime payments based on their personal entries made in their own private diaries.

It has now become a practice for GMOs to demand anything they wish holding the innocent patients to ransom. The demand to double the DAT was no different. This being a year of election aspirations the Government was hesitant in antagonising them, regarding them as “social influencers”. But that may not be the case with paramedics and supporting staff, who are not thought of as “social influencers”. That would by implication make this DAT increase an “election graft”. We know of election budgets, price reductions, samurdhi benefits and such that come as election grafts. What we do not know or do not want to know is most such Government decisions should be brought to Parliament and debated before implementation, if they are not proposals included in the Annual Budget approved by Parliament, for the simple reason, the Constitution holds Parliament as the sole authority on public finance.

This should therefore apply to the DAT increase that is about public finances. If all 17k plus GMOs are to be paid  DAT, the burden on the already economically hunched people would be a colossal sum of about Rs. 14.5 billion this year alone. Therefore, on principle Parliament should know what categories of medical doctors are paid DAT. Are medical doctors in health administration paid DAT? Should it be a flat monthly allowance, instead of a “payment on visit”? What would the Annual Budget be, if DAT is paid on visits? Should not these details be made available to Parliament for this massive sum to be approved and allowed?

Why all that should be brought to Parliament for approval is for the people to know how their heavily overtaxed money is disbursed and for what. It is about transparency and accountability that is at present absent. It is about holding political leaderships in Government accountable to the people. It is also about de-politicising such decisions that lack policy and principles and therefore, allows for political patronage.

In conclusion, let me therefore, say this for future consideration. Except on two rare occasions, when the President Kumaranatunge and the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Governments under worker pressure increased private sector salaries by Rs.1,000 and 2,000 respectively on “budgetary relief allowances” Governments cannot technically decide salary increases for the private sector employees, who are also taxpayers, mostly as contributors to the 80 % indirect tax. This has left a yawning income disparity between the larger majority of the private sector workers and the public sector. Yet it is this private sector employee and not the public sector employee that earn the much needed “dollar income” to the country on which others live as comfortable as they could be. It is therefore important to have a system that would allow respectability and reasonable treatment for the private sector employees too in decision making. Trade unions should therefore demand a “National Labour and Employment Policy” to be adopted in Parliament that would establish an independent “National Wages Commission” wholly responsible to Parliament to decide on wage demands and increases of both public and private sectors. The Labour and Employment policy should seriously consider a “six-hour working day in a five-day working week” for employees to have adequate free time for recreation and entertainment. It is now an accepted fact that employees with job satisfaction and free time are far more productive than the present day highly overworked employees. The “National Wages Commission” should announce an annual “Minimum National Living Wage” that for sure would have to be above Rs.75,000 per month this year, if based on numbers in the latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HI&ES) of the Census and Statistics Department.

But I doubt, the politicised public sector trade unions including the GMOA would go for such a proposal. For they will not be able to use political patronage and muscle power as they do now to push Governments to decide for them.

### 2023 tea crop improves marginally

*2024-01-17 04:39:10 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/business/2023-tea-crop-improves-marginally/34-757420)*

Production increases at all elevation levels except for low-grown compared to 2022

Sri Lanka’s tea crop improved marginally in 2023, reflecting the struggle for recovery after detrimental policy decisions and climate change.

The cumulative production for the year 2023 was 256.04 million kilos, registering an increase of 4.20 million kilos compared with 251.84 million kilos in 2022.

Data analysed by Forbes and Walker Research said all elevations have shown positive variances in the year 2023 aside from the low-grown elevation in comparison with the corresponding period of 2022.

However, it noted that compared to 299.49 million kilos in 2021, cumulative production of 2023 shows a decrease of 43.45 million kilos. On a cumulative basis, all elevations also show a decrease over the corresponding period of 2021.

High-grown elevation produced over 57.4 million kilos up by 2.50% year-on-year (YoY) whilst, medium elevation production was 41.29 million kilos up by 6.27% YoY and green tea production was at 2.28 million kilos up by 26.17% YoY. The low-grown elevation crop was down by 0.07% YoY to over 155 million kilos.

Sri Lanka was optimistic that the tea output will exceed 260 million kilos by the end of 2023 recovering from the 26-year low in 2022.

In December 2023, tea production increased mere 0.51% YoY to 19.81 million kilos vis-à-vis 19.71 million kilos of December 2022.

Forbes and Walker Research confirmed that in December all elevations except for the low grown have shown an increase in comparison with the corresponding period of 2022. However, it said compared to 20.52 million kilos of December 2021, the production of December 2023 still shows a decrease of 0.71 million kilos.

High-grown elevation produced over 4.46 million kilos up by 1.62% YoY whilst, medium elevation production was over 2.9 million kilos up by 2.38% YoY and the production of green tea was at 180,806 kilos up by 8.17% YoY. The low-grown elevation crop was down by 0.42% YoY to over 12.25 million kilos.

Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman Niraj de Mel outlining plans for 2024 insisted on the need for a strategic, unified approach to achieve common industry objectives, emphasising the importance of collaboration over working in isolation.

### Health Minister promises talks on allowance parity amidst TU strike

*2024-01-17 04:34:42 - [dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/news/Health-Minister-promises-talks-on-allowance-parity-amidst-TU-strike/56-757418)*

Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana yesterday assured health trade unions that he would engage in a special discussion with the Ministry of Finance regarding their requests for an allowance comparable to the Rs. 35,000 granted to doctors recently.

Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana provided this assurance while engaging with representatives from health trade unions at the Ministry of Health yesterday. The discussions aimed to address the demands raised by a coalition of at least 72 health service trade unions, excluding doctors, who initiated a 24-hour token strike on the same day.

The unions initiated the strike with a demand for the inclusion of the Rs. 35,000 allowance, which is currently extended to doctors, for all individuals within the entire health services sector.

Due to the island-wide strike, the Government was forced to deploy the military to ensure the normal functioning of state-sector hospitals as health-sector workers only engaged in essential duties and emergency services.

Pathirana also extended an invitation to representatives of the trade unions to participate in the special meeting with the Ministry of Finance, a proposal that their leaders accepted. The Minister assured he would fight to ensure the rights of health sector employees and highlighted the commendations received by Sri Lanka’s health service.

### மருத்துவர்களின் சம்பளம் 35000 ரூபாவினால் அதிகரிக்கப்பட்டதா ?

*2024-01-17 04:32:00 - [virakesarilk](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174105)*

அரசாங்க சேவையில் உள்ள மருத்துவர்களின் சம்பளம் 35,000 ரூபாவினால் அதிகரிக்கப்பட்டதாக அறிவிக்கப்பட்டதையடுத்து ஏனைய சுகாதார தொழில் சங்கங்கள் தமக்கும் 35,000 அதிகரிப்பு தரவேண்டுமென 2 நாள் பகிஷ்கரிப்பில் ஈடுபட்டதும் அதன் பின்னர் இப்போது 16ஆம் திகதி முதல்  மீண்டும் தொழிற்சங்க நடவடிக்கையை ஆரம்பிப்பதாக அறிவித்துள்ள நிலையில் இது தொடர்பான உண்மை நிலையை ஆராய்வதே இந்த கட்டுரையின் நோக்கம் ஆகும்.

ஊழலினால் ஏற்பட்ட பொருளாதார வீழ்ச்சிக்கு பின்னர் பதவிக்கு வந்த அரசியல் தலைமைகள் சர்வதேச நாணய நிதிய பரிந்துரை என்ற பெயரில் 100,000 ரூபாய்க்கு மேல் மாத சம்பளம் பெறும் அரசாங்க ஊழியர்களின் மீது அதிகரித்த  வரி விதித்த நிலையில், அரசாங்க மருத்துவர்களின் சம்பளத்தில் சராசரியாக 35,000 ரூபா வரியாக கழிக்கப்பட்டது. ஏனைய நாடுகளுடன் ஒப்பிடும்போது இலங்கையில் குறைந்தளவு சம்பளம் பெறும் மருத்துவர்கள், சம்பளம் குறைக்கப்பட்ட இந்த செயலால் அதிருப்தி அடைந்து ஆயிரக்கணக்கில் நாட்டை விட்டு வெளியேற தொடங்கினார்கள்.

இதனால் பல வைத்தியசாலைகள் செயலிழந்துள்ள நிலையில் கலக்கமடைந்த ஆட்சியாளர்கள் இதை ஈடு செய்ய- அதாவது அண்மைக்கால வரி விதிப்புக்கு முன்னர் இருந்த நிலைக்கு வைத்தியர்களது சம்பளமாகப் பெறும் தொகையைக் கொண்டு வருவதற்கு 35,000 வழங்க- தீர்மானித்து விட்டு அதை தான் 35000 ரூபாய்களினால் மருத்துவர்களின் சம்பளம் அதிகரிப்பதாக கண்துடைப்பு செய்கிறார்கள்.

உதாரணமாக ஒரு மருத்துவ நிபுணரின்  சம்பளம் வரியினால் 40000 ரூபாய்களினால் குறைக்கப்பட்டு இருந்தது. இப்போது 35000 ரூபாய் வருமான அதிகரிப்பு என்று கூறிக்கொண்டு மேலும் வரிவிதிப்பை மொத்த சம்பளத்தில் அதிகரிப்பார்கள். இதனால் உண்மையான அதிகரிக்கும் அளவு 25 000 ஆக இருந்தாலும் வரி விதிப்புக்கு முன்னர் இருந்ததை விட அவர்  இன்னும் 15000 குறைவாகவே பெறுவார்.

இதேவேளை வரிவிதிப்புக்கு உட்படாத சம்பளத்தை பெறும் மருத்துவ ஆய்வுகூட தொழில்நுட்பவியலாளர்கள்  (MLT) மற்றும் போராட்டத்தில் ஈடுபடும் ஏனைய தொழில் சங்க  உறுப்பினர்கள் உயர்தரத்தில் 3 பாடம் சித்தியுடன் 1 அல்லது  2 வருடத்துக்கு மேற்படாத மாதாந்தக் கொடுப்பனவுடன் கூடிய சுகாதார திணைக்கள பயிற்சி நெறிகளை முடித்துவிட்டு தமது பணிநியமனங்களைப் பெற்றுக்கொண்டுள்ளனர்.

இடைநிலை சுகாதார  ஊழியர்களான இவர்கள் தங்களை தாங்களே சுகாதார நிபுணர்கள் என்று அழைத்துக் கொண்டு, உயர்தரத்தில் சிரமப்பட்டு  படித்து அதிகளவு புள்ளிகளை பெற்று எதுவித மாதாந்தக் கொடுப்பனவுகளும் இன்றி 5 வருடம்  மருத்துவ  பீட அடிப்படைக் கற்கைகளை நிறைவுசெய்த பின்னர் 1 வருடம் உள்ளகப் பயிற்சி பெற்று வேலைக்கு அமர்த்தப்பட்டுள்ள மருத்துவர்களுக்கு சமனாக,  வரிக்கு உட்படாத தமது சம்பளத்தையும் 35000 ரூபாய்களினால் அதிகரிக்குமாறு கேட்பது எப்படி நியாயம் ஆகும்?

மேலும் நாடு வெள்ள அனர்த்தம் மற்றும் டெங்கு பரவல் காரணமாக  ஒரு பேரழிவை   எதிர்நோக்கும் நேரத்தில் இவ்வாறான அநியாயக் கோரிக்கைகளை முன்வைத்து போராடுவது சுகாதார ஊழியர்களின் ஒழுக்க நெறிக்கு பொருத்தமானதா ?

இன்றைய வாழ்க்கைச் செலவு  அதிகரிப்பு, அனைத்து ஊழியருக்கும்  அதிகரித்த சம்பளத்தை வழங்குவதை நியாயப்படுத்தி உள்ளது. ஆனால் சர்வதேச நாணய நிதியத்தின் பரிந்துரையான அரச செலவீனங்களை குறைப்பது என்பது பொருளாதாரத்தில் முன்னேறி வரும் ஏனைய நாடுகளை போல பாதுகாப்பு செலவீனங்களை குறைப்பது மூலமாக அடையப் பட்டிருக்க வேண்டும். ஆனால் பாதீட்டில் அண்ணளவாக  50% செலவை பாதுகாப்புக்கு ஒதுக்கிவிட்டு அதை சரி கட்டுவதற்கு அரச ஊழியர்களின் மீதான வரியை அதிகரிப்பது அவ தந்திரமாகும்.

வைத்தியர்களுக்கு வழங்கப்பட்டது போல சம்பள உயர்வு தமக்கு வழங்கவேண்டும் என்று கேட்கும் தொழில் சங்கங்கள் கூட பாதுகாப்பு செலவை குறைக்க வேண்டும் என்ற கோரிக்கையை வெளிப்படுத்தவில்லை என்பது கவனிக்கத்தக்கது.

அரச ஊழியர்களை செலவுகளை குறைத்து சிக்கனமாக இருக்க உபதேசிக்கும் அரசியல்வாதிகள் தொடர்ந்தும் ஊழலில் ஈடுபட்டு அதிகரித்த செலவுகளை ஏற்படுத்துகிறார்கள். சில தினங்களுக்கு முன்னர் கூட  மகிந்த குழுவினர் வரி செலுத்துவோரின் பணத்தில் கப்பலில் பயணம் செய்து களியாட்டம் நடத்தினார்கள்

பாதுகாப்பு செலவை ஆட்சியாளர்கள் அதிகரித்த நிலையில் வைத்திருப்பதற்கு இலங்கை மீது அந்நிய  .நாடுகள் எதுவும் படை எடுக்கவில்லை. வல்லரசுகள் இலங்கை மீது படையெடுக்க தேவையுமில்லை. ஏனென்றால் இலங்கை மக்களை சுரண்டி வல்லரசுகளுக்கு வருமானம் தரக்கூடிய  அனைத்து வியாபாரங்களுக்கும்  ஒத்துழைக்க ஆட்சியாளர்கள் தயாராக இருக்கின்றனர் .

அப்படி இருந்தும் அதிகரித்த பாதுகாப்பு   செலவு ஏன் ஏற்படுகிறது என்ற கேள்விக்கான பதிலை தமிழர்கள் அதிகமாக வாழும் பகுதிகளில் குவித்து வைக்கப்பட்டுள்ள ஆயுதப்படையினர் மூலமாக அறிந்து கொள்ளலாம். கடந்த காலங்களில் இடம்பெற்ற தவறுகளை நேர்மையாக ஏற்றுக் கொண்டு பாதிக்கப்பட்டவர்களுக்கு நிவாரணம் வழங்கி இனங்களுக்கு இடையில் நல்லிணக்கத்தை ஏற்படுத்தி ஒன்றுபட்ட இலங்கைக்குள் கௌரவமான ஒரு தீர்வை வழங்குவதன் மூலமாகவே  ஆயுதப்படையினரை அங்கிருந்து அகற்ற முடியும்.

எது எப்படி இருந்தாலும் பாதுகாப்பு செலவீனத்தை குறைப்பதாலும்  ஊழல் மிக்க அரசியல்வாதிகளில்  இருந்து நாட்டை மீட்டு எடுத்தால் மாத்திரமே வைத்தியர்களுக்கு  கண்துடைப்புக்காக வழங்கிய தொகையை விட அதிக சம்பள அதிகரிப்பை பெற முடியும் என்பதை அனைத்து அரசாங்க தொழிற்சங்கங்களும் உணரவேண்டும். அந்த நிலை ஏற்படுவதற்கு உரிய அழுத்தத்தை அனைத்து  தொழிற்சங்கங்களும் ஒன்றிணைந்து  பிரயோகிப்பதே சகல இலங்கையர்களும் தத்தமது சம்பள உயர்வை பெற்றுக்கொள்ளவும் நாட்டை பொருளாதார சீரழிவில் இருந்து நிரந்தரமாக மீட்டெடுக்கவும் உதவும் சாத்தியமான வழியாகும்.

### CEAT helps keep Suwa Seriya ambulances on the road

*2024-01-16 23:10:00 - [islandlk](http://island.lk/ceat-helps-keep-suwa-seriya-ambulances-on-the-road/)*

The 322-strong fleet of ambulances operated by the Suwa Seriya Foundation will continue to fulfil its humanitarian mission in Sri Lanka with tyres supplied by CEAT Kelani Holdings as the preferred tyre supplier.

CEAT Kelani recently renewed its commitment to Suwa Seriya, undertaking to provide tyres for five ambulances free of charge and to provide the others at a special price that is marginally above the cost of production.

Suwa Seriya runs a minimum of 25,000 kms a day to save lives. CEAT Kelani has undertaken to produce customised ‘Rhino Plus’ tyres with the Suwa Seriya number 1990 on the side walls of the tyres to identify them as belonging to the ambulance service.

“The Suwa Seriya ambulance service has saved many lives, and we are happy to be able to help the Foundation make a substantial saving on the price of tyres, thereby ensuring that the service is not curtailed due to escalating costs,” CEAT Kelani Chief Operating Officer Shamal Gunawardene said. “These tyres are designed and built for reliability and excellent handling in local conditions, ensuring a safe drive for users.”

The Suwa Seriya Foundation was established in Sri Lanka in July 2016 with the support of the Government of India. It provides free pre-hospital care emergency ambulance services to any person in Sri Lanka, offering 24-hour emergency medical services with a team of nearly 1400 people. The Foundation has achieved an average response time of 14:38 minutes, rescuing and assisting people in accidents and emergencies quickly and competently.

The CEAT brand originated in Italy and is backed by German manufacturing technology and extensive research and testing facilities in India and Europe. CEAT Kelani Holdings currently manufactures half of Sri Lanka’s pneumatic tyre requirements, exports about 20 per cent of its production to 16 countries and plays a significant role in helping the national economy conserve foreign exchange by reducing dependence on imported tyres.

### Another ship hit in Red Sea, disruption seen driving up prices

*2024-01-16 21:29:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96459/another-ship-hit-in-red-sea-disruption-seen-driving-up-prices)*

Disruptions to Red Sea shipping caused by Houthi attacks will push up prices of consumer goods, an executive from port and freight operator DP World said on Tuesday as a missile struck another vessel in the region.

The Iran-allied Houthi militia has threatened to expand its attacks to include U.S. ships in response to American and British strikes on its sites in Yemen.

Attacks by the Houthis on ships in the region since November have impacted companies and alarmed major powers - an escalation of Israel’s more than three-month-old war with Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza. The Houthis say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians.

DP World CFO Yuvraj Narayan said he expected disruptions to hit European consumers hardest.

“The cost of goods into Europe from Asia will be significantly higher,” Narayan told Reuters at the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

“European consumers will feel the pain ... It will hit developed economies more than it will hit developing economies,” the Dubai-based logistics company’s finance chief added.

Two heads of international banking groups said privately in Davos they were worried the crisis might cause inflationary pressures which could ultimately delay or reverse interest rate cuts and jeopardise hopes for a U.S. economic soft landing.

War risk insurance premiums for shipments through the Red Sea are rising, insurance sources said on Tuesday.

In Spain, four factories owned by French tyre maker Michelin are planning to halt output again this weekend due to delays in the delivery of raw materials.

A Malta-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier was targeted and hit by a missile while northbound in the Red Sea 76 nautical miles northwest of the Yemeni port of Saleef, a security firm and two Greek shipping ministry sources said on Tuesday.

The vessel, the Zografia, was sailing from Vietnam to Israel with 24 crew on board and was empty of cargo when attacked, one of the Greek sources said. “There were no injuries, only material damage,” the source added. It was still sailing but would probably reroute for safety checks.

Underlining concerns, Japanese shipping operator Nippon Yusen (9101.T), opens new tab, also known as NYK Line, instructed its vessels navigating near the Red Sea to wait in safe waters and is considering route changes, a company spokesperson said.

Shipping giant Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), opens new tab, however, sent two container ships through the Red Sea carrying goods for the U.S. military and government.

Container vessels have been pausing or diverting from the Red Sea that leads to the Suez Canal, the fastest freight route from Asia to Europe. Many ships have been forced to circumnavigate South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope instead.

British oil major Shell (SHEL.L), opens new tab has suspended all shipments through the Red Sea indefinitely after the U.S. and UK strikes triggered fears of further escalation, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. Shell declined to comment.

Russian tanker group Sovcomflot (FLOT.MM), opens new tab is also considering alternative routes in case the crisis escalates, TASS news agency reported. Sovcomflot did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

European diplomats said member states of the European Union had given initial backing to creation of a naval mission by Feb. 19 to help protect ships from Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.

The existing U.S.-led coalition meant to safeguard commercial traffic in the Red Sea is weak because regional powerhouses Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have not taken part, Yemen’s vice president said on Tuesday.

“This Bab al-Mandab corridor is of interest to the whole world and to the region, so regional intervention is key,” Aidarous al-Zubaidi told Reuters in an interview, referring to the narrow strait at the southern entrance to the Red Sea.

Zubaidi’s separatist Southern Transitional Council is part of an alliance that opposes the Houthis in Yemen.

Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister underline the link between Houthi attacks on commercial ships to the war in Gaza. Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said the kingdom’s priority is finding a path to de-escalation through a ceasefire in Gaza.

Also speaking in Davos, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said it was important to keep global supply chains “stable and smooth”.

About 12% of world shipping traffic accesses the Suez Canal via the Red

The revised fees unveiled by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development are: From SR15,900 to SR14,700 for the Philippines; from SR15,000 to SR13,800 for Sri Lanka; from SR13,000 to SR11,750 for Bangladesh; from SR10,870 to SR9,000 for Kenya; from SR9,500 to SR8,300 for Uganda and from SR6,900 to SR5,900 for Ethiopia.

The decision is part of the ministry’s efforts to review and regulate recruitment costs, ensuring fair pricing in line with the changing costs in the recruitment industry.

Furthermore, the ministry has previously instructed licensed recruitment companies and offices to establish upper limits for the costs of recruiting domestic workers from specific nationalities.

The set upper limit for recruiting domestic workers from Sierra Leone and Burundi is SR7,500, and SR10,000 from Thailand, exclusive of the value-added tax (VAT).

The decision ‘aligns with the ministry’s broader goals to develop all services, improve the labour market environment and enhance its appeal,’ according to the ministry.

It reflects the ministry’s commitment to periodically reviewing costs, services, and systems in response to economic changes, ensuring they are appropriately aligned.

The ministry also emphasized the importance of adherence to these new price ceilings and stated that compliance would be monitored through the Musaned platform.

This initiative highlights the ministry’s dedication to creating a balanced and fair recruitment environment in the kingdom.

### பெருந்தோட்ட பகுதி மாணவர்களின் இடைவிலகல்கள்..!

*2024-01-16 20:29:00 - [virakesarilk](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174094)*

சுதந்திரத்துக்கு பின்பும் இலவச கல்வியை பெறமுடியாத ஒரே சமூகத்தினராக இந்நாட்டில் மலையக பெருந்தோட்ட சமூகத்தினர் விளங்கினர். இந்த அவலம் சுமார் நாற்பது வருடங்கள் வரை நீடித்தன. அதன் பின்னர் படிப்படியாக தோட்டப்பாடசாலைகள் அரசாங்கத்தினால் உள்வாங்கப்பட்டு மாகாண பாடசாலைகளாக மாற்றம் பெற்ற பின்னரும் இலவச கல்வியை அவர்களால் முழுமையாக அனுபவிக்க முடியாத அவலம் தொடர்கின்றது.

2023 ஆம் ஆண்டு மத்திய மாகாணத்தில் அதிக மாணவர் இடைவிலகல்களை கொண்ட மாவட்டமாக நுவரெலியா விளங்குகின்றது. இந்த புள்ளி விபரங்களை மத்திய மாகாண கல்வித் திணைக்களம் வெளியிட்டுள்ளது. அதன் படி மத்திய மாகாணத்தில் கடந்த வருடம் மொத்தமாக 1986 மாணவர்கள் தமது கல்வியை இடைநிறுத்தியுள்ளனர். அதிகமாக நுவரெலியா மாவட்டத்தின் நுவரெலியா கல்வி வலயத்தில் 570 மாணவர்களும் அட்டன் கல்வி வலயத்தில் 541 மாணவர்களும் கொத்மலை கல்வி வலயத்தில் 319 மாணவர்களும் கம்பளை கல்வி வலயத்தில் 209 மாணவர்களும் இடை விலகியுள்ளனர்.

குறித்த கல்வி வலயங்கள் பெருந்தோட்டங்களை அதிகமாகக் கொண்ட பிரதேசங்களாகும். ஆகவே பொருளாதார நெருக்கடி மற்றும் வறுமை ஆகியன இந்த இடை விலகல்களில் செல்வாக்கு செலுத்துகின்றன.  ஆனால் 2022 ஆம் ஆண்டே மாணவர் இடைவிலகல் கணிசமாக அதிகரித்திருந்தன. அதற்கு  கொவிட் தாக்கம் மற்றும் அதைத் தொடர்ந்து நாட்டில் உருவான பொருளாதார நெருக்கடிகள் காரணமாகக் கூறப்படுகின்றன.

இதில் உண்மைகள் உள்ளதை ஆய்வுகள் நிரூபிக்கின்றன. பொருளாதார பாதிப்பு காரணமாக பெருந்தோட்டப்பிரதேசங்களில் 42.8வீதமான குடும்பங்கள் கடனாளிகளாக மாறி விட்டதாக நிதி இராஜாங்க அமைச்சர் செஹான் சேமசிங்க  நாடாளுமன்றில் கடந்த ஒன்பதாம் திகதி தரவுகளை முன்வைத்திருந்தார். ஆகவே பெருந்தோட்டத் தொழிலாளர்களின் வறுமை நிலையை அரசாங்கமே ஏற்றுக்கொள்கின்றது என்பது தான் உண்மை.

ஆனால்  அவர்களுக்கு உரிய நிவாரணங்களைப் பெற்றுக்கொடுக்க அரசாங்கமோ அல்லது இந்த மக்களின் பிரதிநிதிகளோ அக்கறை கொள்வதில்லை.  உணவுப் பொருட்கள் விலையேற்றத்தால் இந்த சமூகத்தினர் மூன்று வேளை உணவை முழுமையாக பெறுவதில்லை. அவ்வாறிருக்கும் போது தமது பிள்ளைகளுக்கான பாடசாலை சீருடைகள்,காலணிகள்,புத்தக பைகள் போன்றவற்றை எவ்வாறு இவர்களுக்கு கொள்வனவு செய்ய முடியும்?

சில தோட்டப்பிரதேசங்களிலிருந்து பாடசாலைகளுக்கு பஸ்களில் செல்ல வேண்டும். பல பகுதிகளில் இ.போ.ச பஸ்கள் இல்லை. இதனால்  மாணவர் பருவகாலச் சீட்டுகளையும் பெற முடியாது. தனியார் பஸ்களில் பாடசாலை சென்று வருவதற்கு தமது பிள்ளைக்கு ஒரு நாளைக்கு இருநூறு ரூபாய் வரை செலவளிக்க இந்த பெற்றோர்களுக்கு முடிவதில்லை. இதன் காரணமாக தொடர்ச்சியாக பாடசாலைக்கு செல்வதில் இந்த பிள்ளைகள் நெருக்கடிகளை எதிர்நோக்குகின்றனர்.

இந்த காரணங்களை வைத்தே சில பாடசாலை நிர்வாகங்களும் மாணவர்களை இடை நிறுத்துகின்றன. மாணவர்களின் தனிப்பட்ட பிரச்சினைகளை ஆராய்ந்து அவர்களை பாடசாலைக்கு வரச்செய்வதில் இக்காலத்தில் எந்த பாடசாலை சமூகமும் கூடுதல் அக்கறை காட்டுவதில்லை.

இடைவிலகலுக்கு வறுமை ஒரு பிரதான காரணமாக விளங்கினாலும் பாடசாலைகளில் சில மாணவர்களுக்கு இழைக்கப்படும் உளரீதியான கொடுமைகள் பற்றியும் இங்கு பேச வேண்டியுள்ளது. குறிப்பாக சாதாரண தர மற்றும்  உயர்தர மாணவர்கள் இவ்வாறு இலக்கு வைக்கப்படுகின்றனர்.

மிகவும் கடினங்களுக்கு மத்தியில் தமது பிரதேச பாடசாலைகளில் சாதாரண தரம் சித்தியடைந்து சிறந்த பெறுபேறுகளுடன் நகர்ப்புற பாடசாலைகளுக்கு வருகை தரும் மாணவர்கள் எதிர்நோக்கும் பிரச்சினைகள் மிக அதிகம். சராசரி புள்ளிகளைப் பெற்றாலும் பாடசாலை பெறுபேறுகளை இலக்கு வைத்து செயற்படும் சில அதிபர்கள் மற்றும் ஆசிரியர்களினால் அவர்கள் மனரீதியான துன்புறுத்தல்களுக்கு உட்படுகின்றனர்.

பாடசாலை சமூகம் எதிர்ப்பார்க்கும் பெறுபேறுகளை குறித்த மாணவனோ மாணவியோ பெற முடியாத சந்தர்ப்பத்தில் அவர்கள் கட்டாயப்படுத்தி பாடசாலைகளிலிருந்து இடை நிறுத்தப்படுகின்றனர். அல்லது வேறு பாடப்பிரிவை தெரிவு செய்வதற்கு வற்புறுத்தப்படுகின்றனர்.

இது தொடர்பான தகவல்கள் மூடி மறைக்கப்படுகின்றன. ஏனெனில் பாடசாலைகளிலிருந்து குறித்த மாணவர்கள் விலகிச்செல்லும் போது தமது சொந்த விருப்பத்தின் பேரிலேயே இவர்கள் செல்கின்றனர் என்றவாறு அவர்களின் பெற்றோர்களிடமும் கடிதங்கள் பெறப்படுகின்றன. இல்லாவிடின் அவர்களுக்கான விடுகை பத்திரத்தை குறித்த பாடசாலை நிர்வாகங்கள் வழங்குவதில்லை.

மலையக பெருந்தோட்ட கல்வி சமூகம் எதிர்நோக்கிவரும் இவ்வாறான பிரச்சினைகளை மலையக அரசியல்வாதிகள் கண்டுகொள்வதில்லை. அவற்றை தவிர்க்கவே பார்க்கின்றனர். மத்திய மாகாணத்தின் முதல் கல்வி அமைச்சரிலிருந்து முப்பது வருடங்களாக அந்த பதவியை அலங்கரித்து வந்த அனைவருமே நுவரெலியா மாவட்டத்தைச் சேர்ந்தவர்கள்.

அவர்களில் பலர் பாராளுமன்ற பிரவேசம் கண்டு எம்.பிக்களாகவும் பிரதி அமைச்சர்களாகவும் , இராஜாங்க அமைச்சர்களாகவும் பணியாற்றியவர்கள். நுவரெலியா மாவட்டத்தை பிரதிநிதித்துவப்படுத்தி இப்போது நாடாளுமன்றத்திலுள்ள இரண்டு எம்.பிக்களும் மத்திய மாகாண தமிழ்க் கல்வி அமைச்சர்களாக  இருந்தவர்கள்.

அதில் ஒருவர் கல்வி இராஜாங்க அமைச்சராகவும் விளங்கியவர். இவர்களது காலத்திலும் மாணவர் இடைவிலகல்கள் இருந்திருக்கலாம். ஆனால் அப்போது இது குறித்து அவர்கள் அக்கறை கொள்ளாமலிருந்த காரணத்தினாலேயே பாதிப்பு இன்று எல்லை மீறி சென்றுள்ளது.  இப்போதும் காலம் கடந்து விடவில்லை என்பதை உரியவர்களுக்கு ஞாபகப்படுத்த விரும்புகிறோம்.

### ஜனாதிபதித் தேர்தலில் ஐக்கிய தேசியக் கட்சி 100 இலட்சம் வாக்குகளை பெறுவது நகைப்புக்குரியது - கம்மன்பில

*2024-01-16 20:21:00 - [virakesarilk](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174104)*

பொதுத்தேர்தலில் மூன்று இலட்சம் வாக்குகளைக் கூட பெறாத ஐக்கிய தேசியக் கட்சி ஜனாதிபதித் தேர்தலில் 100 இலட்சம் வாக்குளை பெறுவதாக குறிப்பிடுவது நகைப்புக்குரியது.

பொய்யான வாக்குறுதிகளை வழங்குபவர்கள் மீது நம்பிக்கை கொள்ளும் நிலையில் இருந்து நாட்டு மக்கள் முதலில் விடுபட வேண்டும் என பிவிதுரு ஹெல உறுமய கட்சியின் தலைவரும் பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினருமான உதய கம்மன்பில தெரிவித்தார்.

கொழும்பில் உள்ள பிவிதுரு ஹெல உறுமய கட்சியின் காரியாலயத்தில் செவ்வாய்க்கிழமை (16) இடம்பெற்ற ஊடகவியலாளர் சந்திப்பின் போது மேற்கண்டவாறு குறிப்பிட்டார்.

பொருளாதார பாதிப்புக்கு மத்தியில் சம்பள அதிகரிப்பை கோரி சுகாதார சேவையினர் பணிப்புறக்கணிப்பு போராட்டத்தில் ஈடுபட்டுள்ளனர்.குறுகிய அரசியல் நோக்கத்துக்காக இவர்களுக்கு சம்பளத்தை அதிகரிக்குமாறு குறிப்பிட முடியாது.

வங்குரோத்து நிலையை தொடர்ந்து வைத்தியர்கள் நாட்டை விட்டு வெளியேறுகிறார்கள்.ஐக்கிய அரபு இராச்சியத்தில் வைத்தியர்களுக்கான கேள்வி அதிகளவில் உள்ளதால் வைத்தியர்கள் அந்த நாடுகளுக்கு செல்கிறார்கள்.

வைத்தியர்கள் நாட்டை விட்டு வெளியேறுவது தீவிரமடைந்தால் சுகாதார துறை மிக மோசமான விளைவுகளை எதிர்க்கொள்ள நேரிடும்  என்பதால் வைத்தியர்களுக்கான கொடுப்பனவை அதிகரிக்க அரசாங்கம் கொள்கை ரீதியில் தீர்மானித்துள்ளது.

ஆகவே பொருளாதார நெருக்கடிகளுகளுக்கு மத்தியில் தமது தேவைகளை மாத்திரம் நிறைவேற்றிக் கொள்ளுவற்கு முயற்சிப்பதை தொழிற்சங்கத்தினர் தவிர்த்துக் கொள்ள வேண்டும் அத்துடன் குறுகிய அரசியல் நோக்கத்துக்காக தொழிற்சங்கத்தினரை தவறாக வழிநடத்துவதை அரசியல்வாதிகள் தவிர்த்துக் கொள்ள வேண்டும்,

2020 ஆம் ஆண்டு இடம்பெற்ற பொதுத் தேர்தலில் 3 இலட்சம் வாக்குகளை கூட பெறாத ஐக்கிய தேசியக் கட்சி இடம்பெறவுள்ள ஜனாதிபதித் தேர்தலில் 100 இலட்சம் வாக்குகளை பெறுவதாக குறிப்பிடுவது நகைப்புக்குரியது.ஐக்கிய தேசியக் கட்சியின் உறுப்பினர்களின் உளவியலை பரிசோதனை செய்ய வேண்டும்.

இலங்கை அரசியல் வரலாற்றில் முதன் முறையாக அரசாங்கத்தினால் களமிறக்கப்படும் ஜனாதிபதி வேட்பாளர் மிக குறைந்தளவிலான வாக்குகளை பெறுவார்.இது இலங்கையின் சாதனை மாத்திரமல்ல,உலக சாதனையாகவும் கருதப்படும்.ஒருவேளை கின்னஸ் புத்தகத்திலும் இடம் பிடிக்கலாம்.

பொதுஜன பெரமுனவின் பொதுச்செயலாளர் உட்பட ஆளும் தரப்பினரது கருத்துக்கள் நகைப்புக்குரியது.கட்சியின் அடிப்படை கொள்கைகளை ஐக்கிய தேசியக் கட்சியிடம் தாரைவார்த்து விட்டு கட்சியின் கொள்கைகளை முன்னிலைப்படுத்தி செயற்படுவதாக குறிப்பிடுவது வேடிக்கையாக உள்ளது என்றார்.

### சவூதி தலைமையில் உலகின் முதல் ஸ்மார்ட் சிட்டி மன்றம்

*2024-01-16 20:19:00 - [virakesarilk](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174103)*

உலகின் முதல் ஸ்மார்ட் சிட்டி மன்றத்தை சவூதி அரேபியாவின் தரவுகள் மற்றும் செயற்கை நுண்ணறிவு ஆணையம் (SDAIA) வருகின்ற பெப்ரவரி மாதம் 2 முதல் 13 வரை சவூதி அரேபியாவின் ரியாத் நகரில் நடாத்த தீர்மானித்துள்ளது. எரெனா என்ற கண்காட்சிகளுக்கான அரங்கத்தில் நடக்கவிருக்கும் இம்மன்றத்தில் 40க்கும் மேற்பட்ட நாடுகளைச் சேர்ந்த 80 பேச்சாளர்கள் கலந்து சிறப்பிக்கவுள்ளனர்.

இந்த நிகழ்வைப் பற்றி, SDAIA இன் தலைவர் கலாநிதி அப்துல்லா பின் ஷரஃப் அல்-கம்டி கருத்து தெரிவிக்கையில்,  “இந்த உலகளாவிய மன்றமானது ஸ்மார்ட் நகரங்கள் என்றால் என்ன என்பது பற்றியும் அவற்றின் மற்றும் முக்கியத்துவத்தையும் அறியப்படுத்தும் வகையில் அமையப்பெறவுள்ளதோடு, இந்த நகரங்களை உருவாக்க செயற்கை நுண்ணறிவு (AI) தொழில்நுட்பங்களை எவ்வாறு பயன்படுத்தலாம் என்றும் தெளிவூட்டவுள்ளது” என கூறினார். சவூதி அரேபியாவின் பிரதமர் மற்றும் SDAIA இன் இயக்குநர்கள் குழுவின் தலைவருமான பட்டத்து இளவரசர் முஹம்மத் பின் சல்மான் அவர்களின் வழிகாட்டளுக்கு இணங்கவே இந்த மன்றத்தை ஏற்பாடு செய்வதில் இராச்சியம் ஆர்வம் காட்டியதாகவும் அவர் கூறினார். தரவுகள் மற்றும் AI அமைப்பு, மேம்பாடு மற்றும் சவூதியில் அதன் செயல்பாடுகளுக்கான தேசியக் குறியீடாக SDAIA இன் முக்கியப் பங்கையும் அவர் எடுத்துரைத்தார்.

மேம்பட்ட தொழில்நுட்பங்களின் துரித வளர்ச்சியை அங்கீகரிக்கும் விதத்தில் உலகெங்கிலும் உள்ள பல நாடுகள் தங்கள் குடிமக்களின் வாழ்க்கைத் தரத்தை மேம்படுத்த AI போன்ற தொழிநுட்பங்களை பயன்படுத்தியும் அவற்றை மேம்படுத்தியும் வருகின்றன. இதற்கு சவூதி அரேபிய இராச்சியமும் விதிவிளக்கல்ல.

ஸ்மார்ட் நகரங்களின் எதிர்காலம் பற்றிய கலந்துரையாடல், அவற்றின் உள்கட்டமைப்புடன் தொடர்புடைய சவால்களை எதிர்கொள்தல் மற்றும் உலகெங்கிலும் உள்ள நகரங்களில் வளர்ந்து வரும் மக்கள்தொகையின் தேவைகளைப் பூர்த்தி செய்வதற்கான புதுமையான தீர்வுகளை ஆராய்வதுடன் சம்மந்தப்பட்ட கலந்துரையாடல்கள் மற்றும் அமர்வுகளை இம்மன்றம் கொண்டிருக்கும்.

மேலும், 2030 ஆம் ஆண்டிற்கான ஐக்கிய நாடுகள் சபையின் நிலையான வளர்ச்சி இலக்குகளுக்கு (SDGs) இணங்க, ஸ்மார்ட் நகரங்களை நிறுவுவதில் சவூதி மற்றும் பிற நாடுகள் அடைந்துள்ள முன்னேற்றங்களையும் இம்மன்றம் எடுத்துக் காண்பிக்கவுள்ளது.

இம்மன்றமானது 18,000க்கும் மேற்பட்ட பார்வையாளர்களை நேரிலும் நிகழ்நிலையிலும் ஒன்றுசேர்த்து நடத்தவுள்ளதோடு, ஸ்மார்ட் நகரங்கள் மற்றும் AI தொழில்நுட்பங்களை நிர்மாணிப்பதில் நிபுணத்துவம் பெற்ற உலகெங்கிலும் உள்ள நிபுணர்களை ஒன்றிணைக்கும் வகையில் ஸ்மார்ட் நகரங்களுக்கான உலகளாவிய தளத்தையும் நிறுவுகிறது.

உலகளாவிய நகரங்கள், நகர்ப்புற நடமாட்டத்தின் எதிர்காலம், ஸ்மார்ட் பொது சேவைகள், அடுத்த நூற்றாண்டில் சுற்றுச்சூழலுக்கு உகந்தவகையிலன நகரங்களை உருவாக்குவதற்கான திட்டமிடல், மேம்படுத்தப்பட்ட புதிய கண்டுபிடிப்புகளை நிறுவுதல் உள்ளிட்ட பல்வேறு தலைப்புகளை இம் மன்றத்தில் கலந்துரையாடவுள்ளனர்.

செயற்கை நுண்ணறிவு AI மற்றும் தொழிநுட்பவியலோடு சம்மந்தப்பட்ட சவூதியின் இவ்வாறான முன்முயற்சிகள் அனைத்தும் அந்நாட்டின் விஷன் 2030 திட்டத்திற்கமைவாகவே இடம்பெறுகின்றன.

### தேசிய வேட்பாளராக ரணில் களமிறங்குவார்! - பிரசன்ன ரணதுங்க

*2024-01-16 20:15:00 - [virakesarilk](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174106)*

பெட்டிக்கடை அல்லது நிறுவனத்தை நிர்வகிப்பதை போன்று நாட்டை நிர்வகிக்க முடியாது. வீரவசனம் பேசுபவர்களால் நெருக்கடிகளுக்கு தீர்வு காண முடியாது.

ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலில் போட்டியிடும் தகைமை ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்கவுக்கு மாத்திரமே உள்ளது. பொருளாதார ஸ்திரப்படுத்தலுக்காக நாட்டு மக்கள் ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்க தலைமையிலான நிர்வாகத்தை இந்த ஆண்டும் தோற்றுவிக்க வேண்டுமென வீடமைப்பு மற்றும் நகர அபிவிருத்தி அமைச்சர் பிரசன்ன ரணதுங்க தெரிவித்தார்.

உடுகம்பொல பகுதியில் திங்கட்கிழமை (15)  மக்கள் பிரதிநிதிகளுடன் இடம்பெற்ற சந்திப்பின் போது மேற்கண்டவாறு குறிப்பிட்டார்.

இடம்பெறவுள்ள ஜனாதிபதித் தேர்தலில் பொதுஜன பெரமுனவின் வகிபாகம் என்னவென்று அனைவரும் கேட்கிறார்கள்.ஜனாதிபதி வேட்பாளரை பொதுஜன பெரமுன தெரிவு செய்யவில்லை என்பதை பொறுப்புடன் குறிப்பிட்டுக் கொள்கிறேன்.வேட்பாளர் ஒருவரை களமிறக்குவதாஇல்லையா என்பதை கட்சி பரிசீலனை செய்கிறது.

ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்கவுக்கு ஒத்துழைப்பு வழங்க வேண்டும் என்பது எனது தனிப்பட்ட நிலைப்பாடு.ஜனாதிபதி பதவி வகிப்பதற்கு அவருக்கு மாத்திரமே தகுதி உள்ளது.

2022 ஆம் ஆண்டு நாட்டு மக்கள் மிக மோசமான நெருக்கடிகளை எதிர்கொண்டார்கள். எரிபொருள் மற்றும் எரிவாயுக்கான போராட்டம் தேசிய பாதுகாப்பை அச்சுறுத்தலுக்கு உள்ளாக்கியது.பல பிரச்சினைகளுக்கு இன்று தீர்வு எட்டப்பட்டுள்ளது.நாடு இயல்பு நிலைக்கு திரும்பியுள்ளது.

தேசிய பிரச்சினைகளை முன்னிலைப்படுத்தி நாட்டு மக்கள் ஜனாதிபதியை தெரிவு செய்தார்கள். யுத்தத்தை வெற்றி கொள்வதற்காக 2004 ஆம் ஆண்டு மஹிந்த ராஜபக்க்ஷவை ஜனாதிபதியாக்கினார்கள். நல்லாட்சியை ஸ்தாபிப்பதற்காக 2015 ஆம் ஆண்டு மைத்திரிபால சிறிசேனவை ஜனாதிபதியாக்கினார்கள்.தேசிய பாதுகாப்பை உறுதிப்படுத்துவதற்காக 2019 ஆம் ஆண்டு கோட்டபய ராஜபக்க்ஷவை ஜனாதிபதியாக்கினார்கள்.அதுபோல இந்த முறை தேசிய பொருளாதாரத்தை ஸ்திரப்படுத்துவதற்காக ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்கவை ஜனாதிபதியாக தெரிவு செய்ய வேண்டும்.

ஜனாதிபதி வேட்பாளராக ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்க போட்டியிடுவதாக இருந்தால் கட்சி என்ற அடிப்படையில் கூட்டணியமைத்து அவருக்கு ஒத்துழைப்பு வழங்க வேண்டும். தேசிய வேட்பாளராகவே ஜனாதிபதி ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்க ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலுக்கு முன்னிலையாவார்.

ஜனாதிபதி வேட்பாளர் போட்டி தற்போது தீவிரமடைந்துள்ளது. பெட்டிக்கடை அல்லது நிறுவனத்தை நிர்வகிப்பதை போன்று நாட்டை நிர்வகிக்க முடியாது. வீரவசனம் அனைவருக்கும் பேச முடியும்.பொருளாதாரத்தை ஸ்திரப்படுத்துவதற்கு குறுகிய காலம் மாத்திரமே மிகுதியாகவுள்ளது. .ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்க என்பவர் வீரவசனம் பேசாத வீரத்தை செயலால் காட்டும் சிறந்த தலைவர்.ஆகவே ஜனாதிபதி தேர்தலில் போட்டியிடும் தகைமை அவருக்கு மாத்திரமே உள்ளது என்றார்.

ඒ සඳහා ඉදිරිපත්වන ආයෝජකයන්ට පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්ති ක්ෂේත්‍රය තුළ ඉහළ මට්ටමේ සහ වෙනස් නොවන ප්‍රතිපත්තියක් ශ්‍රී ලංකා රජය සහතික කරන බවද ජනාධිපතිවරයා පෙන්වා දුන්නේය.

ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා මේ බව සඳහන් කළේ ස්විස්ටර්ලන්තයේ ඩාවෝස් නුවර ඊයේ (15) පැවති “හරිත තාක්ෂණ සංසදය” (Green Tech Forum) අමතමිනි. ස්විස් – ආසියානු වාණිජ මණ්ඩලය විසින් මෙය සංවිධානය කර තිබිණි.

“බලශක්තියෙන් සුරක්‍ෂිත ශ්‍රී ලංකාවක් කරා මාවත සැකසීම” යන තේමාව යටතේ සිය දේශනය සිදු කළ ජනාධිපතිවරයා පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්ති ක්ෂේත්‍රයේ ශ්‍රී ලංකාව තුළ ඇති ඉහළ විභවය මෙන්ම පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්ති ක්ෂේත්‍රය වෙනුවෙන් ප්‍රශස්ත ආයෝජන සහිත වාතාවරණයක් ඇතිකිරීම වෙනුවෙන් පසුගිය වසර 2 තුළ රජය විසින් ගත් පියවර ද අනාවරණය කළේය.

දේශගුණික විපර්යාස අවම කර ගැනීමේ දී ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ කැපවීම අවධාරණය කළ ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා ඩුබායි හි පැවති COP28 සමුළුවට ඉදිරිපත් කළ “නිවර්තන කලාපීය මුලපිරීම” ඇතුළු අනෙකුත් ක්‍රියාමාර්ග පිළිබඳව ද පැහැදිළි කළේය.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාවට සිය තිරසර, හරිත සංවර්ධන න්‍යාය පත්‍රය ඉටු කර ගැනීම සඳහා බලාපොරොත්තු සහගත සැලසුම් තිබෙන බවත් 2050 වන විට ශුද්ධ ශුන්‍ය විමෝචන තත්ත්වය ළඟා කර ගැනීම සඳහා ශ්‍රී ලංකාව කැපවී සිටින බවත් ජනාධිපතිවරයා අවධාරණය කළේය.

කඩිනම් පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්ති සැලැස්ම මෙම සමස්ත ප්‍රයත්නයේ ප්‍රධාන අංගයක් වන අතර එය බලශක්ති සුරක්ෂිතභාවය කරා යන මාවතේ ද අත්‍යවශ්‍ය පියවරක් බව ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා සඳහන් කළේය.

මෙහිදී ජනාධිපති රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහතා සිදු කළ සම්පූර්ණ කථාව මෙසේය,

මෙම දේශනය සිදු කිරීම සඳහා මා වෙත ආරාධනා කිරීම පිළිබඳව ස්විට්සර්ලන්ත – ආසියානු වාණිජ මණ්ඩලයට සහ මෙම උත්සවය සංවිධානය කළ සියලුදෙනාට ස්තූතිවන්ත වෙනවා.

දේශගුණික විපර්යාස අවම කිරීම සඳහා ගෝලීය ක්‍රියාමාර්ග වේගවත් කිරීමේ හදිසි අවශ්‍යතාවයක් මතුව තිබෙනවා. මේ සඳහා විවිධ අයුරින් කැපවීම් සිදු කර ඇති ගෝලීය සංසද කිහිපයක් තිබෙනවා. කෙසේ වෙතත් මේ පිළිබඳ කැපවීම්වලට වඩා ක්‍රියාමාර්ග ගැනීම අවම මට්ටමක පවතින බව කිවයුතුයි.

ගෝලීය නායකත්වය තුළ පවතින මෙම අසාර්ථකත්වය හේතුවෙන් ඇතිවන ප්‍රතිවිපාක බොහෝ දුරට ගෝලීය දකුණේ සංවර්ධනය වෙමින් පවතින රටවලට දැරීමට සිදුවී තිබෙනවා.

කෘෂිකාර්මික නිෂ්පාදනය අඩාල කරමින් නියං කාලසීමාව සාමාන්‍ය කාලසීමාවට වඩා දීර්ඝ වන විට අපගේ ආහාර සුරක්ෂිතතාව අනතුරේ වැටෙනවා. එසේම මෝසම් වැසි ප්‍රමාද වීම නිසා ජල විදුලි ජනනයට බාධා ඇතිවන විට අපේ බලශක්ති සුරක්ෂිතතාව අවදානමට ලක්වනවා.

බොහෝවිට නියඟය අවසානයේ ගංවතුර තත්ත්වයන් ඇතිවෙනවා. විශේෂයෙන්ම එය සාමාන්‍ය ජන ජීවිතය මෙන්ම ඔවුන්ගේ ජීවනෝපායන් ද කඩාකප්පල් කරනවා.සංවර්ධනය වෙමින් පවතින රටවලට මෙම දේශගුණික විපර්යාස හේතුවෙන් ඇතිවන අහිතකර ප්‍රතිඵල මඟින් සිදුවන බලපෑම අසමානුපාතික බව මෙයින් ඉතා පැහැදිලියි.

මෙමගින් දේශගුණික යුක්තිය පිළිබඳ ප්‍රශ්නය සඳහා මෙන්ම ගෝලීය දකුණේ රටවලට දේශගුණික විපර්යාස සඳහා අනුවර්තනය වීමේ සහ ඒවා අවම කිරීමේ ප්‍රයත්නයන් වෙනුවෙන් දියුණු ආර්ථිකයන්ගෙන් සිදු විය යුතු වඩාත් ප්‍රබල දායකත්වයක අවශ්‍යතාවය පෙන්නුම් කරනවා.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාව දේශගුණික විපර්යාස අවම කිරීම සඳහා කැපවී සිටින බව අවධාරණය කළ යුතුයි. ඩුබායි හි පැවති COP28 සමුළුවේදී අප “නිවර්තන කලාපීය මුලපිරීම” ද ආරම්භ කළා. මෙමඟින් නිවර්තන කලාපයේ රටවල වනාන්තර, බලශක්තිය, සාගර, කඩොලාන පරිසර පද්ධතින් තුළ පෞද්ගලික ආයෝජන සඳහා උත්ප්‍රේරණයක් ඇති කිරීම සඳහා වැඩපිළිවෙලක් නිර්මාණය කරනවා.

එවැනි ප්‍රයත්නයන්හි එක් ප්‍රධාන අංගයක් වන පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්තිය සඳහා අපගේ ඇති උත්සාහය පිළිබඳව මම ඔබගේ අවධානයට යොමු කිරීමට කැමතියි.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාව පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්තිය පිළිබඳ දීර්ඝ ඉතිහාසයක් ඇති රටක් බව ඔබ දන්නවා. නිදහසින් පසු ශ්‍රී ලංකාව ජල විදුලි බලය සඳහා පුළුල් ජාලයක් නිර්මාණය කළ අතර 1950 වර්ෂයේදී එහි පළමු ප්‍රධාන ජල විදුලි බලාගාරය ආරම්භ කළා. එය ජලාශ හතරකින් සමන්විත වෙනවා.

රටේ බලශක්ති අවශ්‍යතාවන් සඳහා ඉන් පසුව අපි මහවැලි සංවර්ධන ව්‍යපෘතිය ආරම්භ කළා. එමඟින් ප්‍රධාන ජලාශ පහක් නිර්මාණය කෙරුණු අතර වලවේ ගඟ ව්‍යාපෘතිය හයවන ජලාශය ලෙස එක් කෙරුණා.

මහවැලි ගඟ ව්‍යාපෘතියේ අවසන් අදියර සම්පූර්ණ වුණේ මීට වසර හතකට පෙරයි. මේ අනුව ජල විදුලිය සඳහා අප සතුව ප්‍රවතින ප්‍රභවයන් භාවිතාවට ගෙන තිබෙනවා.

අදටත්, ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ විදුලි උත්පාදන ධාරිතාවෙන් 40% ක් පමණ පවතින්නේ ජල විදුලියයි. ජල විදුලිය බොහෝ දුරට ප්‍රශස්ත මට්ටමින් යෙදා ගෙන ඇති නිසා සුළං සහ සූර්ය බලශක්ති උත්පාදනය ජාතික විදුලි බල පද්ධතියට එක් කර ගැනීම සඳහා වැඩි උත්සාහයක් ගෙන තිබෙනවා.

2030 වසර වන විට ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ විදුලි අවශ්‍යතාවයෙන් 70%ක් පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්තියෙන් සපුරා ගැනීම සහතික කිරීම වෙනුවෙන් රජය මේ වන විට මෙම ක්‍රියාවලිය වේගවත් කරමින් සිටිනවා.

මෙම ඉලක්කය සපුරා ගැනීම සඳහා ඇමෙරිකානු ඩොලර් බිලියන 11.5ක් දක්වා විශාල ආයෝජනයක් අවශ්‍ය වෙනවා. කෙසේ වෙතත්, මෑතක් වන තුරුම පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්ති ක්ෂේත්‍රයේ පෞද්ගලික අංශයේ ආයෝජන සඳහා පැවති රාමුව එතරම් හිතකර තත්ත්වයක පැවතියේ නැහැ.

පසුගිය වසර 2 තුළ රජය විසින් මෙම අඩුපාඩු නිවැරදි කිරීමට සහ පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්ති ක්ෂේත්‍රය වෙනුවෙන් ප්‍රශස්ත ආයෝජන සහිත වාතාවරණයක් ඇතිකිරීම සඳහා පියවර කිහිපයක් ගෙන තිබෙනවා.

එහි පළමු පියවර පිරිවැය පිළිබිඹු කරන ගාස්තු ක්‍රමයක් ඇති කිරීමයි. 2014 වසරේ සිට 2022 වසර දක්වා කාලය තුළ ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ විදුලි ගාස්තු සංශෝධනයක් සිදු කර නැහැ. මෙය ලංකා විදුලි බල මණ්ඩලයට මුදල් ගලා ඒම පිළිබඳ ගැටළු ඇති කිරීමට හේතු වූ අතර ඇතැම් අවස්ථාවන්හිදී විදුලි සැපයුම්කරුවන්ට සිදු කළ යුතු ගෙවීම් ප්‍රමාද වීමටද හේතු වුණා.

කෙසේ වෙතත් 2022 අගෝස්තු මාසයේ සිට පිරිවැය පිළිබිඹු කරන මිල සුත්‍රයකට මාරු වුණා. ඒ අනුව, අනාගතයේ විදුලි උත්පාදනය සඳහා පවතින පිරිවැය පිළිබිඹු කරමින් සෑම කාර්තුවකටම වරක් විදුලි ගාස්තු සංශෝධනය කෙරෙනවා.

දිගු කලක් පාඩු ලබන ආයතනයක් වූ ලංකා විදුලිබල මණ්ඩලය, 2023 වසරේ දී ලාභ ලබන ආයතනයක් බවට පත් වූ අතර, එමඟින් අතීතයේ සිට පවතින ණය සැලකිය යුතු මට්ටමකින් පියවා ගැනීමට ද හැකි වුණා.

මෙම ආයතනයට දැන් ශක්තිමත් ශේෂ පත්‍රයක් මෙන්ම වඩා ශක්තිමත් මුදල් ප්‍රවාහ තත්වයක් සහ මූල්‍ය ද්‍රවශීලතාවය සහතික කරනු ලබන ගාස්තු අය කිරීමේ ක්‍රමවේදයක් තිබෙනවා. සමවර්ත ගාස්තුව නම්‍යශීලී නොවීම ආයෝජකයින්ගේ කනස්සල්ලට හේතු වී තිබෙනවා. අභ්‍යන්තර ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණවලට අමතරව හරිත මූල්‍යකරණය ආකර්ෂණය කර ගැනීමේ රාමුව ද අපි සකස් කරමින් සිටිනවා.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාව තිරසාර මූල්‍යකරණය සඳහා වන මාර්ග සිතියම, හරිත මූල්‍ය වර්ගීකරණය, තිරසර සංවර්ධන ඉලක්ක (SDG) සඳහා වන ආයෝජක සිතියම සකස් කර ඇති අතර දැනට සකස් කරමින් පවතින හරිත බැඳුම්කර රාමුව සඳහා වන මාර්ග සිතියම යන පියවර මඟින් ශ්‍රී ලංකාවට දේශගුණික මූල්‍යකරණයේ ශක්තිමත් නියැලීමක් සඳහා අවශ්‍ය පරිසරය නිර්මාණය කරමින් පවතිනවා. තිරසර මූල්‍ය පහසුකම් සැපයීම, ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්ති ක්ෂේත්‍රයේ ආයෝජන සඳහා අමතර ශක්තියක් වනු ඇතියි.

පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්ති ක්ෂේත්‍රයේ පෞද්ගලික අංශයේ මහා පරිමාණ ආයෝජන සඳහා නීතිමය බාධක තිබෙනවා. 2022 වසරේදී හඳුන්වා දුන් විදුලිබල පනතේ සංශෝධන මඟින් එම නීතිමය බාධා ද ඉවත් කිරීමට කටයුතු කිරීම එහි දෙවන පියවරයි.

තුන්වැන්න, රජය ලංකා විදුලිබල මණ්ඩලය ප්‍රතිවුහගතකිරීමේ අවසන් අදියරේ සිටීමයි. මෙමගින් විදුලිබල මණ්ඩලයේ බෙදා හැරීම, උත්පාදනය සහ සම්ප්‍රේෂණය සඳහා වැඩි මූල්‍ය සහ මෙහෙයුම් ස්වාධිපත්‍යයක් ඇති වන අතර එහි ප්‍රතිඵලයක් ලෙස තරගකාරීත්වය සහ විනිවිදභාවය ඇති වෙනවා.

විදුලිය උත්පාදනය සඳහා පුද්ගලික අංශයේ සහභාගීත්වය ලබාගැනීම දැනටමත් සිදුවන අතර, මෙම ප්‍රතිව්‍යුහගතකරණ වැඩසටහන හරහා පුද්ගලික අංශයේ සහභාගීත්වය සඳහා වැඩි අවස්ථාවක් සැලසෙනවා.

ආසියානු සංවර්ධන බැංකුවේ සහාය ඇතිව ක්‍රියාත්මක කරන ලද මෙම ප්‍රධාන ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ මගින් පාරිභෝගිකයින්ට මෙන්ම වඩාත්ම තරගකාරී හා කාර්යක්ෂම විදුලි නිෂ්පාදකයින්ට වඩා ඵලදායී අවස්ථා නිර්මාණය වෙනවා. එමෙන්ම විදුලිබල මණ්ඩලය කාර්යක්ෂමව ක්‍රියාත්මක වන බව එමගින් සහතික කෙරෙනවා. මෙම ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ සඳහා වන නීති කෙටුම්පත් පසුගිය මාසයේදී ප්‍රකාශයට පත් කරනු ලැබුවා.

විශේෂයෙන් 2026 වන විට මෙරට ජාතික විදුලිබල අවශ්‍යතාවයෙන් සියයට 70ක් පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්තියෙන් සපුරා ගැනීමේ අභිලාෂය වෙනුවෙන් පද්ධතියේ කාර්යක්ෂමතාව වැඩිදියුණු කිරීම සහ පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්තිය ඒකාබද්ධ කිරීම සඳහා වැඩි දියුණු කිරීම් අවශ්‍ය වෙනවා. එසේම ගබඩා කිරීම, සම්ප්‍රේෂණය සහ බෙදා හැරීම සඳහා ආයෝජන අවශ්‍යයි. 2030 දක්වා මෙම ඒකාබද්ධ කිරීම සඳහා සැලසුම් සකස් කර ඇති අතර ඒවා ක්‍රියාත්මක කිරීම මේ වන විට ආරම්භ කර තිබෙනවා.

පසුගිය වසර දෙක තුළ බලශක්ති ක්ෂේත්‍රයේ ක්‍රියාත්මක කරන ලද ප්‍රධාන ප්‍රතිසංස්කරණ හේතුවෙන් මෙම ක්ෂේත්‍රය කෙරෙහි නව උනන්දුවක් ඇති වී තිබෙනවා. දැනටමත් මහා පරිමාණයේ සූර්ය හා සුළං බලශක්ති ව්‍යාපෘති ක්‍රියාත්මක කිරීම ආරම්භ කර තිබෙනවා.

ඉන්දියාවේ ප්‍රමුඛ පෙළේ ව්‍යාපාරයක් මෙගාවොට් 350 ක සුළං විදුලි බලාගාරයක් ක්‍රියාත්මක කිරීමට ඉදිරිපත්ව සිටින අතර එය 2025දී ආරම්භ කිරීමට අපේක්ෂිතයි. මෙම සමාගම තවත් ඩොලර් මිලියන 750ක් සුළං බලශක්තිය සඳහා ආයෝජනය කිරීමට ද සැලසුම් කර තිබෙනවා. ඒ අනුව සුළං බලය මඟින් ශ්‍රී ලංකාවට විශාල අවස්ථාවක් සැලසෙනවා.

විශේෂයෙන් වෙරළාසන්න සුළං බලයට ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ අවශ්‍යතාවයට වඩා වැඩි බලයක් උත්පාදනය කිරීමේ හැකියාව පවතින බව ලෝක බැංකුවේ මෑතකාලීන වාර්තාවක් පෙන්වා දී තිබෙනවා.

මෙම තත්ත්වය සැලකිල්ලට ගනිමින්, ශ්‍රී ලංකාව සහ ඉන්දියාව අතර බලශක්ති අන්තර් සම්බන්ධතාවයක් ඇති කර ගැනීම සම්බන්ධයෙන් වන සාකච්ඡා ප්‍රගතිශීලී අදියරක තිබෙන බව කිව යුතුයි. විශේෂයෙන් ඉන්දියාවේ දකුණු කොටසෙහි වේගයෙන් වර්ධනය වන කාර්මික කලාපය වෙත ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ අතිරික්ත විදුලිය අපනයනය කිරීමට එමගින් අවස්ථාව සැලසෙනවා.

සූර්ය බලශක්තිය සඳහා ද ඉහළ විභවයක් පවතිනවා. එය ගිගාවොට් 40ක් පමණ වන බවට ගණන් බලා තිබෙනවා. වහලය මත රඳවන සූර්ය පැනල මඟින් උත්පාදනය කරන බලශක්තිය හැරුණු කොට සූර්ය බලශක්තියේ විභවය ගිගාවොට් 200 ක් පමණ වෙනවා. ඒ අනුව මුළු ප්‍රමාණය තවත් වැඩි විය යුතුයි. මෙය ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ සුළං බලයට වඩා වැඩි ප්‍රමාණයක්. ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ හරිත හයිඩ්‍රජන් සහ හරිත ඇමෝනියා සතුව පවතින විභවය පිළිබඳව ද අප සොයා බලනවා.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාවට සිය තිරසර, හරිත සංවර්ධන න්‍යාය පත්‍රය ඉටු කර ගැනීම සඳහා බලාපොරොත්තු සහගත සැලසුම් පවතිනවා. 2050 වන විට ශුද්ධ ශුන්‍ය විමෝචන තත්ත්වය ළඟා කර ගැනීම සඳහා ශ්‍රී ලංකාව කැපවී සිටිනවා.

කඩිනම් පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්ති සැලැස්ම මෙම සමස්ත ප්‍රයත්නයේ ප්‍රධාන අංගයක් වන අතර එය බලශක්ති සුරක්ෂිතභාවය කරා යන මාවතේ ද අත්‍යවශ්‍ය පියවරක් වෙනවා.

වර්තමානයේ වියළි කාලවලදී ශ්‍රී ලංකාවට අධික මිල සහිත ඉන්ධන මත යැපීමට සිදු වී ඇති නිසා, මෙම පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්ති ප්‍රභවයන් මඟින් ජනන පිරිවැය අඩු කර ගැනීමේ හැකියාව පවතිනවා.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාව දේශගුණ විපර්යාස අවම කිරීමේ ජාත්‍යන්තර විශ්ව විද්‍යාලයක් පිහිටුවීමේ කටයුතු සඳහා මේ වන විට මුලපුරා තිබෙන අතර එමඟින් හරිත බලශක්තිය සඳහා පවතින අවස්ථා තවදුරටත් විවෘත වනු ඇතියි.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්තිය පිළිබඳ ප්‍රතිපත්තියේ දිශානතිය සඳහා විවිධ අභිප්‍රේරණයන් හා පාර්ශ්වකරුවන් විසින් සහාය දක්වන බව පැහැදිලියි.

එබැවින් ආයෝජකයින්ට මෙම ක්ෂේත්‍රය තුළ ඉහළ මට්ටමේ සහ වෙනස් නොවන ප්‍රතිපත්තියක් අපේක්ෂා කළ හැකියි.

ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ පුනර්ජනනීය බලශක්ති ක්ෂේත්‍රයේ ආයෝජනය කිරීමට හොඳම කාලය මෙය වන අතර, එවැනි ආයෝජන ඉදිරි දශක කිහිපය තුළ එහි පාර්ශ්වකරුවන්ට මෙන්ම ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ පාරිභෝගිකයින්ට ද සැලකිය යුතු ප්‍රතිලාභයක් ලබා දෙන බවට මට කිසිදු සැකයක් නැහැ.

### ஜனாதிபதிக்கு 2 ஆயிரம் இலட்சம் ரூபா மேலதிக நிதி ஒதுக்கீட்டுக்கு ஒப்புதல் - எதிர்க்கட்சி தலைவர் சஜித் கடும் விசனம்

*2024-01-16 19:54:00 - [virakesarilk](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/174109)*

சுகாதார தொழிற்சங்கங்கள் கோரிக்கைகளை முன்வைக்கும் போது நிதி இல்லை என அரசாங்கம் கூறுகின்ற சந்தர்ப்பத்தில், ஜனாதிபதியின் செலவுக்காக வரவு செலவு திட்டத்தில் ஒதுக்கப்பட்ட தொகைக்கு மேலதிகமாக மேலும் 2000 இலட்சம் மேலதிக மதிப்பீட்டின் ஊடாக ஒதுக்குவதற்கு ஒப்புதல் வழங்கப்படுத்துள்ளதாக எதிர்க்கட்சி தலைவர் சஜித் பிரேமதாச தெரிவித்தார்.

பிரபஞ்சம் தகவல் தொழிநுட்ப நிகழ்ச்சித் திட்டத்தின் 67 ஆவது கட்டமாக, கலாவௌ சிறிமாபுர மகா வித்தியாலயத்திற்கு 10 இலட்சம் ரூபா பெறுமதியான நவீன வகுப்பறை உபகரணங்களை வழங்கும் நிகழ்வில்  செவ்வாய்கிழமை (16) கலந்து கொண்டு உரையாற்றும் போதே எதிர்க்கட்சி தலைவர் மேற்கண்டவாறு தெரிவித்தார்.

கூலித்தொழிலாளர்களின் அன்றாட வருமானத்தை திருடிக் கொள்ளும் அரசாங்கமே தற்போது காணப்படுகிறது. சுகாதார ஊழியர்களின் பணி பகிஷ்கரிப்பினால் நோயாளர்களுக்கு தமக்கான சேவைகளைப் பெற்றுக் கொள்வதில் சிரமம் ஏற்பட்டுள்ளது.

சுகாதார தொழிற்சங்கங்கள் தமது கோரிக்கைகளை முன்வைக்கும் போது நிதி இல்லை என அரசாங்கம் தெரிவிக்கிறது. ஆனால் ஜனாதிபதியின் செலவுக்காக வரவு செலவு திட்டத்தில் ஒதுக்கப்பட்ட தொகைக்கு மேலதிகமாக மேலும் 2000 இலட்சம் மேலதிக மதிப்பீட்டின் ஊடாக ஒதுக்குவதற்கு ஒப்புதல் வழங்கப்படுத்துள்ளது.

சுகாதார சேவையே தற்போது நாட்டுக்கு அத்தியாவசிய தேவையாகக் காணப்படுகின்ற போதிலும், ஜனாதிபதியின் வெளிநாட்டுப் பயணங்களுக்கான 2000 இலட்சம் ரூபாவுக்கு அங்கீகாரம் வழங்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.

ஜனாதிபதிக்கு ஒதுக்கப்பட்ட நிதி எவ்வாறு போதாது என்று கூறுகின்றனரோ, அவ்வாறே நோயாளர்களுக்கு வழங்கப்படும் சுகாதார சேவைகளுக்காக ஒதுக்கப்பட்டுள்ள நிதியும் போதாது. பலவீனமான தலைமைத்துவத்தினாலயே சுகாதார சேவை முடங்கியுள்ளது என்பது தெளிவாக புலப்படுகிறது.

சுகாதார சேவை முழுமையாக முடங்கிக் கிடக்கும் இந்நேரத்தில் நாட்டு தலைவர் வெளிநாடுகளுக்குச் சென்று விநோதங்களில் ஈடுபடுவது நியாயமில்லை. பாடசாலைகளுக்கு கணினி மற்றும் நவீன வகுப்பறை போன்றவற்றை வழங்க முடியாவிட்டாலும், ஜனாதிபதியின் இவ்வாறான விநோதங்களுக்கு நிதி ஒதுக்கப்படுகிறது.

சுகாதார ஊழியர்களின் பணிப்பகிஷ்கரிப்பினால் அப்பாவி நோயாளிகள் பாதிக்கப்படுகின்றனர். அறுவை சிகிச்சைக்காக வரிசையில் காத்திருப்பவர்களுக்கும் கூட அநீதி இழைக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.

இதற்கு அரசாங்கத்தின் பலவீனமான நிர்வாகமே காரணமாகும். தொழிற்சங்கத்துறையில் உள்ளவர்களை குற்றம் சாட்டுவதை விடுத்து,வெளிநாட்டு பயணங்களை விட சுகாதாரத்துறை குறித்து சிந்தித்து செயலாற்றுவதை ஜனாதிபதி தலைமையிலான அரசாங்கம் அறிய வேண்டும் என்றார்.

ඇතැම් බන්ධනාගාර නිලධාරීන්ට මත්ද්‍රව්‍ය චෝදනා එල්ලවීම බරපතල ප්‍රශ්නයක් බව අධිකරණ අමාත්‍ය විජයදාස රාජපක්ෂ මහතා පවසයි.

නිරීක්ෂණ චාරිකාව අවසන් කිරීමෙන් පසුව පැවති සාකච්ඡාව අමතමින් අධිකරණ අමාත්‍යතුමා මෙසේ පැවසීය.

ඇතැම් බන්ධනාගාර නිලධාරීන් මත් ද්‍රව්‍ය ජාවාරම හා සම්බන්ධ බවට බරපතල චෝදනා පවතිනවා. යුක්තිය මෙහෙයුම අතරතුර බන්ධනාගාර නිලධාරීන් කිහිප දෙනෙකු අත් අඩංගුවට පත්ව තිබෙනවා . එම තත්වය කණගාටුදායක තත්වයක් බව කිව යුතුයි.

එහෙත් යාපනය බන්ධනාගාරයේ නිලධාරීන්ට එවැනි ආකාරයේ චෝදනා නොමැති බවට අදහස් පළ වුණා. එය අගය කරනවා. අපේ රටේ සෙසු බන්ධනාගාරවලට වඩා ඉතා පිරිසිදු බවින් යුක්තව බන්ධනාගාර පරිශ්‍රය පවත්වා ගෙන යාමට මෙහි නිලධාරින් කටයුතු කර තිබෙනවා. එය ඉතාමත් ප්‍රශංසනීයයි.

ආදර්ශමත් ආයතනයක් ලෙස යාපනය බන්ධනාගාරය හදුන්වා දිය හැකියි. එ පිළිබදව බන්ධනාගාරයේ පරිපාලනයට ස්තූති වන්ත වන අතරම, යාපනය බන්ධනාගාරයට අවශ්‍ය අඩුපාඩු සම්පුර්ණ කර දීමට කටයුතු කරන බවද අමාත්‍යතුමා සදහන් කළේය.

යාපනය බන්ධනාගාරය තුළ අද දිනය වන විට (16) සිරකරුවන් 852 ක් රදවා සිටින අතර, කාන්තා රැදවියන් 38 දෙනෙකු ඒ අතර වෙයි.

நாட்டில் முறைசாரா துறையில் பணிபுரியும் அனைத்து தொழிலாளர்களுக்கும் கௌரவத்தையும் பெருமையையும் வழங்கும் வகையில் ஆரம்பிக்கப்பட்ட 'கரு சரு' திட்டத்தின் ஊடாக முச்சக்கரவண்டி சாரதிகளின் தொழிற்சங்கங்களை நிறுவுவதற்கான இடைக்கால வழிநடத்தல் குழு இன்று (16) முதற்கட்டமாக ஸ்தாபிக்கப்பட்டது.

தொழில் திணைக்களத்தின் கேட்போர்கூடத்தில் தொழில் மற்றும் வெளிநாட்டு வேலைவாய்ப்பு அமைச்சர் மனுஷ நாணயக்காரவின் தலைமையில் நடைபெற்ற துறைசார் குழுக்களை நிறுவது  தொடர்பான கலந்துரையாடலின் போதே இந்தக் குழு ஸ்தாபிக்கப்பட்டது.

முச்சக்கர வண்டி சாரதிகளுக்கான நிபுணத்துவ சபை ஸ்தாபிக்கப்படும் வரை இந்த  இடைக்கால வழிநடத்தல் குழு முச்சக்கரவண்டி சாரதிகளின் தொழில்சார் மற்றும் சமூகப் பாதுகாப்பை உறுதிப்படுத்தும்.

இதன்போது நாடு முழுவதிலும் செயற்பட்டுவரும் அனைத்து முச்சக்கரவண்டிச் சாரதிகளின் சங்கங்களின் பிரதிநிதிகளையும்  உள்ளடக்கிய இந்த இடைக்காலக் குழுவில், அவர்களின் தொழில் கௌரவத்தையும், வளர்ச்சியையும்  மேம்படுத்துவது தொடர்பாக இதற்கு முன்னர் இடம்பெற்ற கலந்துரையாடலில் இணக்கம் காணப்பட்ட விடயங்கள் அடங்கிய பிரேரணை அமைச்சரிடம் கையளிக்கப்பட்டது

இப்பிரேரணைகளை நடைமுறைப்படுத்துவதற்கான முன்மொழிவுகளை சட்டமாக்கி வர்த்தமானியில் வெளியிட நடவடிக்கை மேற்கொண்டு முச்சக்கரவண்டி சாரதிகளாக பணிபுரியும் அனைவரையும் தரவு அமைப்பில் பதிவு செய்து மிகக் குறுகிய காலத்திற்குள் புதிய  கியூ.ஆர். குறியீட்டு முறையயை அறிமுகப்படுத்த நடவடிக்கை எடுக்கப்படும் என்று இதன்போது அமைச்சர் உறுதியளித்தார்.

எந்தவொரு சந்தர்ப்பத்திலும் தனியார் துறை காப்புறுதி நிறுவனங்களோ அல்லது வேறு எந்தவொரு தரப்பினரும் சமூகப் பாதுகாப்பு நடவடிக்கைகளில் ஈடுபட மாட்டார்கள். அவ்வாறே நாட்டில் தற்போதுள்ள சமூக பாதுகாப்பு நடைமுறைகள் மற்றும்  புதிய சமூக பாதுகாப்பு முறைமைகள் என்பன அரசின் கண்காணிப்பில்  நடைமுறைப்படுத்தப்படும் எனவும் அமைச்சர் சுட்டிக்காட்டினார்.

### Sri Lanka Ambuluwawa tourist project to attract thrill seekers

*2024-01-16 19:00:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-ambuluwawa-tourist-project-to-attract-thrill-seekers-147479/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – The Ambuluwawa Biodiversity Center will be developed as a tourist zone with opportunities for adventure sports, State Minister of Justice and Prisons Anuradha Jayaratne said.

“We hope to bring fifteen percent of the tourists coming to Sri Lanka to Ambuluwawa,” Jayaratne was quoted by the Government Information Department.

Various adventure sports and recreational activities will be offered in an area spread over 8 acres of the 450-acre Biodiversity Center, the minister said at an event to promote Ambuluwawa as a tourist area.

“The Ella Odyssey train will stop at Gampola station for a short while so tourists can take in the Ambuluwawa tourism experience.”

According to Jayaratne, 8% of tourists coming to the island visit Ambuluwawa.

He claimed the area will be developed into an economic hub of the Kandy District, particularly Gampola town, with the introduction of a cable car project.

Sri Lanka’s Board of Investment signed an agreement to develop a cable car system in the country in November 2023.

“Amber Adventure signed an agreement for 4.5 million US dollars, in collaboration with Ambuluwawa Bio Diversity Center, and technical and product expertise from China Machine-Building International Corporation,” the BoI said on X (twitter) at the time.

Several proposed cable car systems in various parts of the island, including one in the hill country town of Nuwara Eliya, have not materialized so far.

Sri Lanka is targeting 2.3 million tourists in 2024 with India, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and Germany expected to bring most of the arrivals, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), Priyantha Fernando has said.

Tourist authorities say Sri Lanka needs to sell a product that attracts high spending tourists.

“We are going to market Sri Lanka in a way that you can’t think possible,” President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said. “So we will have to re-think our tourist policies.” (Colombo/Jan16/2024)

### President discusses effective progress of debt restructuring at Business Roundtable in Switzerland

*2024-01-16 18:48:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96455/president-discusses-effective-progress-of-debt-restructuring-at-business-roundtable-in-switzerland-)*

Addressing the Business Roundtable organized by BOI Sri Lanka and the Swiss-Asian Chamber of Commerce yesterday, during his official tour to Switzerland to attend the 54th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum, President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted significant strides in Sri Lanka’s economic recovery and outlined future growth prospects.

President Wickremesinghe began by acknowledging the challenging times the nation faced, noting the adverse effects of the recent crisis on businesses, small enterprises and the overall population. He mentioned a constructive meeting with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), where it was surprising to learn that Sri Lanka had over performed despite the difficulties.

One key aspect highlighted by the President was the successful debt restructuring in collaboration with the IMF, emphasizing its necessity for dealing with creditors. He outlined the reforms undertaken in 2022 and 2023, addressing crucial business impediments and resolving supply bottlenecks in fuel and electricity. Additionally, import restrictions were lifted, foreign exchange liquidity was restored and a primary surplus in the balance of payments is anticipated for the first time since 1977.

President Wickremesinghe highlighted positive indicators such as the stabilization of the currency, a significant reduction in inflation, and the reversal of negative economic growth from the third quarter of 2023. The achievement of a primary budget surplus in 2023 marked a notable improvement.

The President went on to discuss the effective progress in debt restructuring, with key creditors agreeing in principle. The IMF’s approval of Sri Lanka’s first program review in December 2023 sets the stage for a shift from stabilization to recovery and growth in 2024.

Looking ahead, President Wickremesinghe emphasized the government’s focus on fostering growth through exports, services and investments, including foreign direct investment (FDI). He announced concluded and upcoming FTAs with Singapore, Thailand, India and China, along with ongoing talks with other South Asian nations. The President highlighted Sri Lanka’s initiatives to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the benefits of GSP Plus for access to European markets.

The address concluded with the President unveiling opportunities for investments in renewable energy, agriculture modernization, tourism, IT and infrastructure development through public-private partnerships. He highlighted forthcoming laws and commissions aimed at enhancing market access, fostering trade and investment and ensuring the competitiveness of Sri Lanka’s economy. President Wickremesinghe reassured foreign investors by mentioning the removal of restrictions and the ongoing commitment to economic reforms.

Meanwhile, sharing his perspective during the roundtable discussion on Sri Lanka’s undertaken reforms, Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka, the President’s Senior Advisor on National Security and Presidential Chief of Staff, emphasized a comprehensive approach encompassing both economic and governmental facets.

Mr. Ratnayaka highlighted that alongside economic reforms, the government embarked on an extensive array of changes. This included a proactive engagement in a diagnostics exercise initiated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Notably, the government did not wait for the completion of the IMF diagnostics exercise but initiated various measures beforehand. Initiatives like the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office were implemented even before the governance diagnostics report was published.

Subsequent to these initial steps, a comprehensive program was launched to implement diagnostic reforms. Mr. Ratnayaka underscored the significance of introducing critical legislation, such as the anti-corruption law. He explained the process by which the Constitutional Council would recommend commissioners for the Anti-Corruption Commission to the President. Emphasizing a forward-looking approach, Mr. Ratnayaka affirmed that all undertaken actions aim to elevate international standards.

The Senior Advisor highlighted the introduction of a substantial number of pieces of legislation on the governance front, with approximately 20 already completed. Looking ahead, the focus includes labour laws, with a target of 40 or 50 new laws and the consolidation of around 40 to 50 existing legislations into a modern, forward-looking framework. The overarching goal is to create a favourable environment for employers and align Sri Lanka with contemporary global standards.

The Business Roundtable provided a platform for Sri Lanka to showcase its economic resilience and commitment to growth, leaving attendees optimistic about the nation’s future prospects.

Representing the Sri Lankan business community at this Business Roundtable were Mr. Krishan Balendra – Chairman John Keels Holdings, Mr. Sanath Manatunge – CEO/MD Commercial Bank PLC, Mr. Dilshan Wirasekara – Chairman Colombo Stock Exchange, Mr. Prakash Schaffter – Deputy Chairman Janashakthi Insurance PLC, Mr. Keith Bernard – Chairman, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Ms. Stasshani Jayawardena – Joint Deputy Chairman/MD, Aitken Spence PLC, Mr. Sanjeev Gardiner – Chairman Galle Face Group, Mr. Ashok Pathirage – Chairman Sri Lankan Airlines, Mr. Sujeewa Rajapakse – Chairman People’s Bank, Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake – Deputy Chairman & Managing Director, Aitken Spence PLC and ⁠ Mr. Supun Weerasinghe – CEO Daialog Axiata.

In addition, Mr. Dinesh Weerakkody – Chairman Board of Investment/Chairman Colombo Port City Economic Commission, Mr. Revan Wickramasuriya – Chief Operating Officer Colombo Port City Economic Commission, Mr. Prasanjith Wijayatilake – Executive Director Investment Promotion Board of Investment, Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka – Chief of Staff to the President & NSA, Mr. Deshal De Mel – Advisor to the Finance Minister and Mr. Ruwan Wijewardene – Advisor to the President on Climate Change participated in this roundtable discussion.

### Evacuation underway for stranded tourists after multiple avalanches trap 1,000 people in China

*2024-01-16 18:35:00 - [adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/96454/evacuation-underway-for-stranded-tourists-after-multiple-avalanches-trap-1000-people-in-china)*

Rescuers evacuated tourists on Tuesday from a remote skiing area in northwestern China where dozens of avalanches triggered by heavy snow have trapped more than 1,000 people for a week, state media said.

The avalanches have blocked roads, stranding both tourists and residents in a village in Altay prefecture in the Xinjiang region, close to China’s border with Mongolia, Russia and Kazakhstan.

Those injured were being airlifted out on a military helicopter while supplies such as food and fuel were being flown in.

State broadcaster CCTV said a snow-blocked road linking Hemu village to major roads was cleared on Tuesday, enabling vehicles to enter and tourists to drive themselves out.

Footage showed dozens of tourists dragging luggage over snow-covered areas toward a military helicopter, while a long line of outgoing cars was seen on the cleared road.

State media cited the local highway administration as saying the avalanches affected 350 kilometers (220 miles) of roads. Road clearing efforts were hampered due to the area’s geography as roads leading to Hemu are situated in a valley with tree-covered slopes.

Known as an emerging ski destination, Altay prefecture had been hit by heavy snowfall since early January. China Daily, citing the Xinjiang meteorological bureau, said at least 31 avalanches were reported as of Saturday.

Authorities at the Kanas scenic area, where Hemu village is located, said the area will be closed until at least Jan. 20 due to continued extreme weather.

The committee reportedly includes representatives of all three-wheeler drivers’ associations in Sri Lanka.

Meanwhile, a resolution consisting of the matters agreed upon in the previous discussions regarding the development of the dignity of their profession was also handed over to the minister during the event.

### Invest in Sri Lanka renewable energy sector: President at Davos forum

*2024-01-16 18:00:00 - [economynextcom](https://economynext.com/invest-in-sri-lanka-renewable-energy-sector-president-at-davos-forum-147448/)*

ECONOMYNEXT – Now was the time for investing in Sri Lanka’s renewable energy sector, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has told a forum in Davos, Switzerland on Monday (15).

Wickremesinghe said he was confident in the sector’s potential to yield benefits for stakeholders and consumers in the coming decades, according to a statement by his media division.

“Investors venturing into this sector can anticipate a comprehensive and unwavering policy framework,” Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying in his address at the ‘Green Technology Forum’.

After a forex and energy crisis in 2022, there has been an increased effort on Sri Lanka’s part to include wind and solar power generation to its national grid.

“The government is now accelerating this process to ensure that by 2030, 70% of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs are fulfilled by renewable energy sources.

But the country lacks the financial resources to do so on its own.

“To reach this target requires a large investment of up to USD 11.5 billion. However, until recently the framework for private investment in the renewable energy sector has not been very conducive. Over the last 2 years several measures have been taken by the government to correct these shortcomings and ensure an optimal investment climate for renewable energy is in place.”

I thank the Swiss Asian Chamber of Commerce and their partners in organising this event for the invitation to speak today.

There is an urgent need for acceleration of global actions towards climate change mitigation. There have been multiple global forums which have resulted in numerous commitments towards this end. However, actions have fallen drastically short of commitments.

The fallout of this failure in global leadership is borne largely by developing nations of the global south. When periods of drought extend beyond normal, undermining agricultural production, our food security is in jeopardy. When hydropower gets disrupted due to delayed monsoons, our energy security is in jeopardy. Droughts are often followed by a deluge, leading to flash floods and landslides, disrupting lives and livelihoods of under-privileged communities in particular.

It is very evident that there is a disproportionate impact of the adverse outcomes of climate change on developing countries. This brings to light the issue of climate justice and the need for a stronger contribution from the advanced economies towards adaptation and mitigation efforts in the global south.

That being said, Sri Lanka will forge ahead with its efforts towards climate mitigation. We have also recently launched the Tropical Belt Initiative at the COP28 in Dubai – this creates a framework for catalysing private investment in forests, energy, oceans, mangroves, in the countries of the tropical belt.

Today I want to focus on one key aspect of such efforts, which is our drive towards renewable energy.

In fact, Sri Lanka is a country with a long history of renewable energy. Since independence Sri Lanka developed an extensive network of hydropower, commissioning its first major hydro-power plant in 1950. Hydropower was able to provide for most of the country’s energy needs until the 1990s. Even today, hydropower accounts for around 40% of Sri Lanka’s installed electricity generation capacity.

With hydropower largely exploited to the optimal levels, there has been an increased effort to include wind and solar power generation to the national grid. The government is now accelerating this process to ensure that by 2030, 70% of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs are fulfilled by renewable energy sources.

To reach this target requires a large investment of up to USD 11.5 billion. However, until recently the framework for private investment in the renewable energy sector has not been very conducive. Over the last 2 years several measures have been taken by the government to correct these shortcomings and ensure an optimal investment climate for renewable energy is in place.

The first step was to ensure cost reflective pricing. Between 2014 and 2022 electricity tariffs had not been adjusted. This resulted in major cash flow problems for the Ceylon Electricity Board that sometimes led to payment delays to power suppliers. However, from August 2022 we have shifted to a cost-reflective pricing structure. Accordingly, electricity tariffs are revised every quarter to reflect costs on a forward looking basis.

The CEB, which has long been a loss making entity, returned a profit in 2023, enabling it to settle significant levels of past debt along with some balance sheet structuring. The company now has a strong balance sheet, a far stronger cash flow position, and a pricing structure that ensures liquidity.

Rigidities in the feeding tariff has also been a concern of past investors. However, this has also been addressed with greater flexibility being introduced to the tariff options, including choices between fixed tariff and variable tariff formulas.

In addition to internal reform, we are also putting in place the framework to attract green financing. Sri Lanka has developed the Road Map for Sustainable Finance, Green Finance Taxonomy, the SDG Investor Map and the Green Bond Framework, that is currently under formulation, creates the enabling environment for Sri Lanka to have a robust engagement in climate finance. The availability of sustainable finance will be an added boost for renewable energy investments in Sri Lanka.

There have also been legislative barriers to large scale private investment in the renewable energy sector. Those legal hurdles have also been cleared through necessary amendments to the Electricity Act introduced in 2022.

Thirdly, the government is in the final stages of implementing unbundling of the Ceylon Electricity Board. This will result in greater financial and operational autonomy for the distribution, generation, and transmission arms of the CEB, resulting in competition and transparency. Whilst private participation in generation is already available, the unbundling process will open up opportunities for private participation in distribution as well.

This major reform, implemented with the support of the Asian Development Bank, will ensure the CEB operates at the frontier of efficiency, delivering the best outcome for consumers and the most competitive and efficient producers of electricity. The draft legislation for this reform was already been published last month.

The ambition of 70% electricity from renewals also requires improved system efficiency and upgrades to integrate more renewable energy, particularly from 2026. Investments will be required in storage, transmission, and distribution, along with the ongoing private investments in generation. Plans for this integration up to 2030 are in place and have begun implementation.

Following the major reforms implemented in the energy sector in the last 2 years, there has been renewed interest in this sector. There are already large scale solar and wind power projects that have commenced implementation. A major Indian player has commenced implementation of a 350MW wind power plant that is expected to be commissioned in 2025. The same player is considering a further USD 750 million investment in wind power.

Wind power is a major opportunity for Sri Lanka. A recent World Bank report indicates that off-shore wind power in particular has the potential to generate power far greater than Sri Lanka’s requirements. Considering this, Sri Lanka and India are in advanced stages of talks regarding grid inter-connection to enable Sri Lanka to export surplus electricity particularly to the fast growing industrial belt in the Southern part of India. There is also tremendous potential for the development of green hydrogen in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka has ambitious plans to fulfil its sustainable, green development agenda. By 2050 the country has committed to achieving net zero. The accelerated renewable energy plan is a key component of this overall effort and is also an essential step on the path towards energy security. Renewable energy will also drive down costs of generation since at present Sri Lanka is compelled to rely on high cost heavy fuels during the dry season. Sri Lanka is in the process of establishing an international climate university, which will continue to unlock opportunities in green energy.

It is clear that Sri Lanka’s renewable energy policy direction is underpinned by multiple motivations and drivers. Therefore investors can expect a high degree of policy continuity in this sector going forward as well. This is the best time to invest in Sri Lanka’s renewable energy journey, and I have no doubt such investments will generate significant value for shareholders and Sri Lanka’s consumers over the next several decades.

The collective of health sector trade unions have decided to continue with their strike action as discussions with the government were unsuccessful.

Representatives of health sector trade unions, engaged in a token strike since this morning (16 Jan.), held a discussion with Acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe and Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana regarding their demands.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the trade union representatives said that the token strike will continue until 06:30 a.m. tomorrow (17 Jan.), as talks had failed.

72 health sector trade unions, led by the Health Service Trade Unions, launched a 24-hour token strike this morning in protest of the government’s decision to increase the  Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors by Rs. 35,000.

The strike action represents a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, Public Health Inspectors, and entomology officers.

Speaking with regards to the strike on Monday (15 Jan.), President of the Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) Upul Rohana stressed that because Minsiter Pathirana is yet to provide any discussion regarding their demands, around 100,000 health workers including all paramedical services, hospital secretaries, administrative officers as well as health administrative assistants, minor staff and 75 other trade unions of the health staff will join together with this island-wide strike.

“This action will completely disrupt the hospital service. The government should understand that it is not possible to maintain medical services only with the doctors”, Upul Rohana said.

This brings to light the issue of climate justice and the need for a stronger contribution from the advanced economies towards adaptation and mitigation efforts in the global south.

That being said, Sri Lanka will forge ahead with its efforts towards climate mitigation. We have also recently launched the Tropical Belt Initiative at the COP28 in Dubai – this creates a framework for catalysing private investment in forests, energy, oceans, mangroves, in the countries of the tropical belt.

Today I want to focus on one key aspect of such efforts, which is our drive towards renewable energy.

In fact, Sri Lanka is a country with a long history of renewable energy. Since independence Sri Lanka developed an extensive network of hydropower, commissioning its first major hydro-power plant in 1950. Hydropower was able to provide for most of the country’s energy needs until the 1990s. Even today, hydropower accounts for around 40% of Sri Lanka’s installed electricity generation capacity.

With hydropower largely exploited to the optimal levels, there has been an increased effort to include wind and solar power generation to the national grid. The government is now accelerating this process to ensure that by 2030, 70% of Sri Lanka’s electricity needs are fulfilled by renewable energy sources.

To reach this target requires a large investment of up to USD 11.5 billion. However, until recently the framework for private investment in the renewable energy sector has not been very conducive. Over the last 2 years several measures have been taken by the government to correct these shortcomings and ensure an optimal investment climate for renewable energy is in place.

The first step was to ensure cost reflective pricing. Between 2014 and 2022 electricity tariffs had not been adjusted. This resulted in major cash flow problems for the Ceylon Electricity Board that sometimes led to payment delays to power suppliers. However, from August 2022 we have shifted to a cost-reflective pricing structure. Accordingly, electricity tariffs are revised every quarter to reflect costs on a forward looking basis.

The CEB, which has long been a loss making entity, returned a profit in 2023, enabling it to settle significant levels of past debt along with some balance sheet structuring. The company now has a strong balance sheet, a far stronger cash flow position, and a pricing structure that ensures liquidity.

Rigidities in the feeding tariff has also been a concern of past investors. However, this has also been addressed with greater flexibility being introduced to the tariff options, including choices between fixed tariff and variable tariff formulas.

In addition to internal reform, we are also putting in place the framework to attract green financing. Sri Lanka has developed the Road Map for Sustainable Finance, Green Finance Taxonomy, the SDG Investor Map and the Green Bond Framework, that is currently under formulation, creates the enabling environment for Sri Lanka to have a robust engagement in climate finance. The availability of sustainable finance will be an added boost for renewable energy investments in Sri Lanka.

There have also been legislative barriers to large scale private investment in the renewable energy sector. Those legal hurdles have also been cleared through necessary amendments to the Electricity Act introduced in 2022.

Thirdly, the government is in the final stages of implementing unbundling of the Ceylon Electricity Board. This will result in greater financial and operational autonomy for the distribution, generation, and transmission arms of the CEB, resulting in competition and transparency. Whilst private participation in generation is already available, the unbundling process will open up opportunities for private participation in distribution as well.

This major reform, implemented with the support of the Asian Development Bank, will ensure the CEB operates at the frontier of efficiency, delivering the best outcome for consumers and the most competitive and efficient producers of electricity. The draft legislation for this reform was already been published last month.

The ambition of 70% electricity from renewals also requires improved system efficiency and upgrades to integrate more renewable energy, particularly from 2026. Investments will be required in storage, transmission, and distribution, along with the ongoing private investments in generation. Plans for this integration up to 2030 are in place and have begun implementation.

Following the major reforms implemented in the energy sector in the last 2 years, there has been renewed interest in this sector. There are already large scale solar and wind power projects that have commenced implementation. A major Indian player has commenced implementation of a 350MW wind power plant that is expected to be commissioned in 2025. The same player is considering a further USD 750 million investment in wind power.

Wind power is a major opportunity for Sri Lanka. A recent World Bank report indicates that off-shore wind power in particular has the potential to generate power far greater than Sri Lanka’s requirements. Considering this, Sri Lanka and India are in advanced stages of talks regarding grid inter-connection to enable Sri Lanka to export surplus electricity particularly to the fast growing industrial belt in the Southern part of India. There is also tremendous potential for the development of green hydrogen in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka has ambitious plans to fulfil its sustainable, green development agenda. By 2050 the country has committed to achieving net zero. The accelerated renewable energy plan is a key component of this overall effort and is also an essential step on the path towards energy security. Renewable energy will also drive down costs of generation since at present Sri Lanka is compelled to rely on high cost heavy fuels during the dry season. Sri Lanka is in the process of establishing an international climate university, which will continue to unlock opportunities in green energy.

It is clear that Sri Lanka’s renewable energy policy direction is underpinned by multiple motivations and drivers. Therefore investors can expect a high degree of policy continuity in this sector going forward as well. This is the best time to invest in Sri Lanka’s renewable energy journey, and I have no doubt such investments will generate significant value for shareholders and Sri Lanka’s consumers over the next several decades.

### பிக்குகள் மாத்திரம் காவி உடையணியும் சட்டம் வேண்டும்: ஒரு சில தேரர்களுக்கு வெளிநாடுகளிலிருந்து கோடிக்கணக்கில் நிதி கிடைக்கிறது! - உதய கம்மன்பில

பௌத்த மதத்தை இல்லாதொழிக்கும் வகையில் ஒழுங்கமைக்கப்பட்ட செயற்பாடுகள் முன்னெடுக்கப்படுகின்றன. இந்த நாட்டில் காவி உடை அணிவதை பிக்குகளுக்கு மாத்திரம் வரையறுக்கும் சட்டம் இயற்றப்பட வேண்டும் என பிவிதுரு ஹெல உறுமய கட்சியின் தலைவரும் பாராளுமன்ற உறுப்பினருமான உதய கம்மன்பில தெரிவித்தார்.

கொழும்பில் உள்ள பிவிதுரு ஹெல உறுமய கட்சியின் காரியாலயத்தில் இன்று  (16) இடம்பெற்ற ஊடகவியலாளர் சந்திப்பின் போது மேற்கண்டவாறு குறிப்பிட்டார்.

அவர் மேலும் தெரிவித்ததாவது, பௌத்த மத கோட்பாடுகளை திரிபுபடுத்தி, பௌத்த மதத்தை இல்லாதொழிக்கும் வகையிலான திட்டமிட்ட செயற்பாடுகள் முன்னெடுக்கப்படுகின்றன. இதற்கு புலம்பெயர் அமைப்புக்கள் நிதியுதவி வழங்குகின்றன.

பௌத்த மதத்தை அவதிக்கும் வகையிலான கருத்துக்களை இன்று பல்வேறு தரப்பினர் குறிப்பிடுகின்றனர். பௌத்த கோட்பாட்டை திரிபுபடுத்தும் கருத்துக்களை குறிப்பிடும் ஒரு சில பௌத்த தேரர்களுக்கு வெளிநாடுகளில் இருந்து கோடிக்கணக்கில் நிதி கிடைக்கிறது. ஒரு சிலர் தம்மை பிக்கு என்று அடையாளப்படுத்திக் கொண்டு பௌத்த மதத்தை அவமதிக்கிறார்கள்.

காவி உடையை அனைவரும் அணியும் நிலை இன்று காணப்படுகிறது. இவ்வாறானவர்களை கைது செய்யவும்  முடியாது.பிக்கு ஒருவர்  காவி உடை தரிக்க வேண்டும் என்று ஒழுக்கச் சட்டத்தில் குறிப்பிடப்பட்டுள்ளது.ஆனால் ஏனையோர் காவி உடைய அணிய முடியாது என்று சட்டத்தில் குறிப்பிடப்படவில்லை. ஆகவே காவி உடை அணிந்தவர்கள் எதை செய்தாலும் அவர்களை உடனடியாக கைது செய்ய முடியாத நிலை காணப்படுகிறது.

தான் விரும்பும் ஆடைகளை அணிந்து கொள்ளும் உரிமை அனைவருக்கும் உண்டு. 2300 வருட கால தொன்மையை கொண்டுள்ள பௌத்த கோட்பாட்டை பாதுகாக்க வேண்டுமாயின் இந்த நாட்டில் காவி உடை அணிவதை பிக்குகளுக்கு மாத்திரம் வரையறைக்கும் சட்டம் இயற்றப்பட வேண்டும் என்றார்.
