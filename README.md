Earlier in the day, Sunak held a rare morning press conference to demand that the Lords stop blocking his key proposal for ending the tide of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, promising that both houses of Parliament would remain in session until it was approved.

Unfortunately, the same mysticism and beliefs that Buddha dispelled two and a half millennia ago have crept back into Buddhism. It is true that some of it has cultural, artistic, or sentimental values. But if the human affliction for beliefs and mysticism, or the shortcomings in our sensory apparatus, are used to exploit the innocent and waste valuable resources that could be put into better use, that would be an insult to Dhamma, its author, and purveyors. The preferred outcome of comparing Buddhism and science would be to enable science savvy young generations to relate to Buddha Dhamma and prevent falling prey to mysticism

### An тАШarriere-penseeтАЩ to proposed debate of SJB vs JVP/NPP

*2024-04-23 00:39:46* ┬╖ [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/An-arriere-pensee-to-proposed-debate-of-SJB-vs-JVP-NPP/14-760889) ┬╖ `en`

The Leader of the Opposition (LoO) having a public debate with Anura Kumara Dissanayaka (AKD) is simply a mismatch and an insult to the office of the LoO.

It is a globally accepted practice that an argument, debate or a discourse on an important issue or subject has to be conducted between two equal individuals, groups or societies. Otherwise, it will become a joke or useless exercise that fails to meet the expected objectives.

The office of the LoO is a statutorily established legislative body headed by the leader of the second largest political party in Parliament and not affiliated to the government in a parliamentary democracy according to Thomas Erskine May (1815 тАУ 1886).

The Leader of the Opposition is the Prime Minister-in waiting in a Westminster form of governance or in any other legislature that practices a form of parliamentary democracy. He or she has a responsibility to safeguard the honour, dignity and statutory obligations of himself and his office.

Palitha Thewarapperuma, a controversial politician from the Kalutara district met a tragic death last week. His popularity was reflected in the huge crowd that gathered, including thousands of Muslim men and women from many parts of the district.

He had been famous for what many described to be stunts or antiques, but he always represented the sensitivities of the ordinary people, except for one or two incidents. In December 2013, when the authorities decided to close the Badureliya hospital, Thewarapperuma chained himself to a truck and threatened to fast to death. The hospital was reopened

There is no doubt that this title itself will bring bemusement to the denizens of the land of Mahavamsa. An entire nation failing to recall such an important place may seem impossible, but up until the colonial occupiers started probing the past in the 19th century, the historical significance, or the geographical location of Lumbini had been completely erased from the collective memory of India and Nepal.
