ECONOMYNEXT – Indian External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar met President Ranil Wickremesinghe and a range of political leaders during his visit to Sri Lanka, focusing on commitments made by Sri Lanka to India, including land and energy pipeline connectivity.

Sri Lanka has committed to renewable energy deals for the Indian Adani group, Trincomalee port development, an investment zone around the port, a bridge between the island nation’s Northern Mannar and South India’s Rameshwaram, a power grid, and an oil and gas pipeline between the two nations.

Though most of the committed projects have been discussed and some already signed, they face delays amid public protests, court cases on environmental concerns, anti-Indian sentiments triggered by high prices of renewable projects, local politicians as well as perceived Chinese influence, analysts say.

### Remembering Mervyn de Silva on his 25th Death Anniversary

*2024-06-21 03:51:00* · [`islandlk`](http://island.lk/remembering-mervyn-de-silva-on-his-25th-death-anniversary/) · `en`

When Mervyn de Silva left us on 22nd June 1999, it was not just the twentieth century that was drawing to a close. In retrospect one could sense, and now we know, that with his passing, an era in the literary history of Sri Lanka had ended. Because he was the last of a golden age of journalism, an illustrious tradition of English journalism in Sri Lanka that gave us H. A. J. Hulugalle, Jayantha Padmanabha, Tarzie Vittachi and Denzil Peiris. They were brilliant editors who provided us with not just world-class newspapers; they were also erudite men who helped build a Ceylonese literati that any society can be proud of.

I make no apologies for repeating what I have written before on my editor, my guru, my role model and my friend Mervyn de Silva, because all of it remains just as valid as it did a quarter of a century ago. The defining attributes of Mervyn and their importance bear repetition and deserve considered reflection.

Citing the Parliamentary Privileges Committee report, Bakeer Markar pointed out numerous irregularities in the bill’s submission process to the Parliamentary Drafting Office and the Attorney General’s Department.

“It is evident that this unfairness resulted from a deliberate failure to adhere to established procedures for bills presented by individual members,” Bakeer Markar said. He urged MPs to review specific sections of the report that highlight these injustices.

It is worrying that only 12 female representatives are representing parliament, with 52 per cent of women living in the total population. The appointment of women in state and private institutions should be appointed as a good example of the Parliament.

He was speaking at a debate on the women's reinforcement bill held in Parliament on Thursday (20).

We have submitted the report of the Department of Education Department of the Department of Education on the Sri Lanka National Commission Bill for the UNESCO. The Commission should include state institutions including the Cultural Fund, Wildlife and the Department of Wildlife and the Department of Education.

Women's reinforcement Bill is spoken. In the social structure, women are resistant to many problems.

There are only 12 female representatives in Parliament. Fifty years ago, there was less representation. There was no major change. In the present state and private high positions, women should be given priority.

In the Sajith Sabha, it was highlighted that numerous housing projects initiated during the Gotabhaya Rajapaksa administration were suspended, allegedly as political retaliation. This decision impacted thousands of families, many of whom had ceased receiving aid from India. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa called for the government to address this issue, ensuring justice for those affected and facilitating the completion of their homes. The President recently approved funds for these projects, expressing confidence in their implementation under the United People's Power Government.

Several housing projects in the government of goodwill have been suspended for political revenge. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said the government should take action to provide justice to the beneficiaries affected by this.

After the 2019 presidential election, a large number of housing projects being carried out in our country were suspended simultaneously. Thousands of hundreds of thousands of houses have been suspended. Thus the displaced millions of people have been displaced. Those who have benefited from these housing projects have even stopped assistance from India.

This was carried out as a political revenge when Gotabhaya Rajapakse became president. Even the people of the North East have informed me about this. I urge the government to focus on this, as there is a large number of people who are not able to get the rest of the installment and to complete the houses.
