In the case of bilateral credit, the overall debt level has not come down but only the payment terms have been eased

What Sri Lanka has got is a relief on the annual cashflow till 2027 by way of a debt moratorium. But for Sri Lanka to get full relief, it is necessary for the country to get a fair amount of the principal loans as the debt forgiven by the creditors. This is known as a haircut. Considering the gap in the foreign exchange receipts and payments during 2022-27, IMF had anticipated a debt forgiveness of about $ 14 billion which amounted to about 51% of the total debt to be restructured. Hence, Sri Lanka should get a haircut of about 51% if it is to resolve its foreign debt problem permanently

Aseni and Sarath Mahatthaya have been continuing their interactive conversation on Sri Lanka‚Äôs debt and the process involving the debt restructuring to facilitate the country to get into debt sustainability, a requirement under the ongoing Extended Fund Facility or EFF from IMF.
