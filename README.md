*2024-02-06 06:01:00* · [`newsfirstlk`](https://www.newsfirst.lk/2024/02/06/king-charles-diagnosed-with-undisclosed-form-of-cancer/) · `en`

Colombo (News 1st) – King Charles III has been diagnosed with cancer and began treatment on Monday, Buckingham Palace said in a statement. It did not state what type of cancer the King has been diagnosed with.

The cancer was identified during the King's recent hospital 3-day treatment for a benign enlarged prostate. "A separate issue of concern was noted, and subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer", the Palace said.

Charles, 75, who assumed the throne last May, will postpone public duties, but will continue to undertake state duties.

His treatment is being carried out on an out-patient basis, and he does not need to stay overnight in hospital.

The King, 75, "remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible," it added.

No further details are being shared on the stage of cancer or a prognosis.

Charles informed both his sons personally about his diagnosis and the Prince of Wales was said to be in regular contact with his father.

The Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, who lives in the United States, spoke to his father and will be travelling to the UK to see him in the coming days.

DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan, Feb 5 (Reuters) - At least 10 police personnel were killed and six others injured in a pre-dawn attack on Monday by militants on a police station in northwest Pakistan, police said, as violence escalated ahead of general elections this week.

"After entering the building, the terrorists used hand grenades which caused more casualties to the police," said Malik Anees ul Hassan, the deputy superintendent of police in Draban.

It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack and whether it was related to the election.

"The action of the said medical officer has not only allowed VIPs but also imprisoned drug smugglers to comfortably stay inside the prison hospital," he said.

Dr. Bellana said that in this situation, the real patients who are in the Welikada prison have lost the opportunity to receive a response.

Moreover, he said several complaints have been made to the Human Rights Council and to internal doctors and no action have been taken against the doctor yet.

Dr. Kingsley Bernard, CIOB President Dr. Rohan Karunaratne and Secretary Eng. Saliya Kaluarachchi

The Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) says the SLEDB can support the exports of the construction industry to boost foreign exchange earnings.

“This is the best time for the Construction Industry to look for opportunities overseas. This is because; due to the economic crisis, over 60% of the construction industry in Sri Lanka has been halted,” CIOB President Dr. Rohan Karunaratne said.

“Many contractors are trying to accrue overseas projects and the main barrier for them is the Central Bank ruling which restricts cross-border guarantees and capital funding to establish abroad,” he added.

According to CIOB, the CBSL is allowing only $ 1 million for cross border guarantees which is severely insufficient and does not even begin to scratch the surface of contractors’ requirements.

### Sri Lankans should fight for economic freedom and not for economic independence

*2024-02-06 00:47:57* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lankans-should-fight-for-economic-freedom-and-not-for-economic-independence/4-758152) · `en`

It is the economic interdependence and not economic independence that matters

Sri Lankans’ fight for economic independence is futile since modern economies are interdependent. But they should aspire to win economic freedom since it helps them to become creative and win over those who are moving forward fast in the globe. That will necessarily require them to worship brain over belly

Sri Lanka as a matter of routine habit celebrated the anniversary of independence from Britain on 4 February. This relates to the political independence in which Sri Lankans are empowered to elect their own rulers. The exercise of this power has happened on numerous occasions in the past 76 years. As such, Sri Lanka has been branded as one of the longest surviving democracies in South Asia, next only to India which has done so for 77 years.

### December sees surge in credit card expenditures, signalling rebound in consumer spending

Card balance surges by Rs.6.2bn in December while full-year growth at Rs.8.3bn

The credit card activity, which remained anaemic for a prolonged period, appears to have broken its trend and set off to potentially a robust run of spending in the period ahead. The cardholders were seen swiping more frequently for their festive spending and leisure and travelling needs in December last year.

The latest data available showed that in December 2023, the cardholders have ramped up their spending considerably, as the outstanding credit card balance of the licensed commercial banks has jumped by a robust Rs.6,176 million, the largest monthly increase from a very long time.

This was in comparison to the Rs.1,205 million increase in November and Rs.309 million contraction in the month before.

Following is an interview with Department of Inland Revenue former Deputy Commissioner General N.M.M. Mifly

Q: Digital company taxation local versus foreign has become a subject of concern in the COPF, where it has been pointed out that an unfair playing field is prevalent with the advantage going to foreign digital players operating in Sri Lanka. How do you think this has happened?

A: The digital economy allows room for tax evasion, avoidance, and double non-taxation of both direct and indirect taxes, by using loopholes in the domestic tax statutes. This is done, especially by non-resident digital service providers.

It goes without saying that the non-payment of due taxes by international digital service providers has a direct adverse impact on their local competitors/counterparts. Creating such an uneven playing field has resulted in a loss of confidence in the efficiency of our tax system.

“We reiterate that the Online Safety Bill poses a grave threat to fundamental rights and democratic principles enshrined in the Constitution of Sri Lanka and regret to note that the current Government’s adamant pursuit of this legislation is a clear indication of its intention to silence dissent and suppress civic activism during this critical time of economic reform and upcoming elections,” the statement read.

The March 12 Movement said it noted with grave concern that in addition to introducing an undemocratic law, Parliament outrageously acted in violation of the constitutionally guaranteed right to pre-enactment judicial review of legislation.

### Solution for Somali Piracy has to be found on Land, not at Sea

The SalamaFikira (FP) Group, a leading global security and risk management firm, warned in January, that despite a perceived decline in Somali piracy, recent incidents indicate that the menace has not been eradicated and remains a formidable challenge.

By January 2011, 736 people were taken as hostages and 32 ships were captured by pirates. Piracy impeded the delivery of shipments and increased shipping expenses, costing an estimated US $ 6.9 billion a year in global trade, according to Oceans Beyond Piracy (OBP).

According to the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), a veritable industry of profiteers also arose around the piracy. Insurance companies significantly increased their profits from the pirate attacks as these companies hiked premium rates in response.

### Sri Lanka needs to balance global powers for economic growth: Minister

*2024-02-05 19:39:00* · [`economynextcom`](https://economynext.com/sri-lanka-needs-to-balance-global-powers-for-economic-growth-minister-149918/) · `en`

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka will have to manage and balance all the global powers to achieve its economic growth and thus the island nation’s foreign policy should aim for economic diplomacy instead of political diplomacy, State Foreign Minister Tharaka Balasuriya said.

Analysts say Sri Lanka has become the center of proxy geopolitical war between the country’s neighbour India and the World’s second largest economy China.

China’s increasing influence in Sri Lanka has raised security concerns to India and that has already led Colombo to suspend the arrival of Chinese research vessels to the island nation.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe government has promised a non-aligned foreign policy which was not followed by his predecessors. Successive Colombo governments’ foreign policy had leaned towards either China or the West in the past.

Sri Lanka expects to attract about US$5 billion in foreign funds in the next two years once it is able to finalise the restructuring of its overseas debt, the country’s foreign minister said on Monday (Feb 5).

The nation defaulted on its overseas debt in May, 2022 after a severe shortage of foreign exchange reserves triggered the worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948.

Sri Lanka has since made progress on about US$11 billion of bilateral debt restructuring and hopes to have agreements in place with all key creditors, including bondholders, by May at the latest, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry told Reuters.

It will then focus on kick-starting major infrastructure projects suspended during the crisis, including a highway, an expansion of the main airport near Colombo and a US$2 billion light railway project with Japan.
