*2024-07-06 01:43:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187795) ¬∑ `ta`

President Ranil Wickremesinghe's regime, facing criticism for its handling of Sri Lanka's economic crisis, has secured international debt relief totaling $580 million. Despite initial praise from key nations like the US, Japan, India, and the IMF, there's concern over transparency and equal treatment of all creditors, especially China. The government's strategy includes delaying bilateral loan repayments until 2028 and extending the repayment period until 2043. However, the public reception remains mixed, with no immediate economic benefits seen by ordinary citizens. The cost of living continues to rise, and despite promises to maintain social spending, actual reductions have occurred. The government's shift towards privatizing education has also sparked protests, highlighting broader discontent with the administration's economic policies and lack of engagement with public concerns.

*2024-07-06 01:15:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187790) ¬∑ `ta`

CV Wigneswaran, a TNA parliamentarian, suggests distrusting the upcoming presidential election due to economic recovery concerns and potential instability. He supports a petition in the Supreme Court to delay the election, arguing that holding it now could lead to no clear winner and further destabilize the country's economy. Wigneswaran emphasizes the importance of prioritizing national welfare, economic stability, and public safety over adhering strictly to democratic processes under current circumstances.

üü©

The Tamil People's National Alliance parliamentarian CV Wigneswaran said that as the country's economy is gradually recovering, it should not be re -adopted to ensure that the presidential election will be the best decision to regain the presidential election.

A fundamental violation petition has been filed in the Supreme Court by businessman CD Lnava seeking to prevent the presidential election as being planned until the presidential election is being issued on the day of the presidential election.

In the wake of the opposition of various parties, CV Wigneswaran, a Member of Parliament of the Tamil People's National Alliance (TNA), one of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), said that it would be beneficial to the country if the High Court ruled that the presidential election would be retaliated.

The systemic stigmatisation of minority religious groups during a global health crisis not only violates medical ethics but also exacerbates societal divisions, especially in a country scarred by decades of civil war

Sri Lanka initially stood out as a success story in South Asia during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020. However, this success wasn‚Äôt merely luck or a reflection of a robust health system. Instead, it was largely attributed to the impending parliamentary elections. These elections, originally slated for 25 April 2020, became a significant factor in the Government‚Äôs response to the crisis. With a new Executive President elected on 16 November 2019, and the dissolution of Parliament on 2 March 2020, the timing of the pandemic‚Äôs emergence and the subsequent actions taken by the Government were intricately tied to political considerations

*2024-07-05 17:11:00* ¬∑ [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/187771) ¬∑ `ta`

"7G," a ghost film directed by Haroon, revolves around IT professional Rajiv (Roshan Bashir) and his wife Varsha (Smriti Venkat), who move into a haunted apartment named '7G.' Unsettling occurrences begin when Rajiv's ex-girlfriend, Nisha (Sneha Gupta), performs black magic. The plot thickens with the revelation that the house belonged to Manjula (Sonia Agarwal), who died there under mysterious circumstances. Varsha aids Manjula's spirit, leading to its departure from the house. Despite initial intrigue, the film lacks novelty and tests the audience's patience with predictable ghostly elements. Performances, especially from the lead actors, are criticized for lacking depth.

Even though Sri Lanka does not manufacture products which contain POPs or mercury, many products containing these substances are imported to the country for various uses every year.

‚ÄúThough stringent regulations have been introduced, a lack of capacity in the application of these regulations results in the continued mismanagement of chemical imports to the country,‚Äù the UNDP said in a statement.
