### World Court to hear arguments on Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories

*2024-02-19 12:07:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97385/world-court-to-hear-arguments-on-israeli-occupation-of-palestinian-territories) · `en`

The United Nations’ top court on Monday opens a week of hearings on the legal consequences of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, with more than 50 states due to address the judges.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki will speak first in the legal proceedings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.

In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly asked the court for an advisory, or non-binding, opinion on the occupation.

While Israel has ignored such opinions in the past, it could pile on political pressure over its ongoing war in Gaza, which has killed about 29,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, since Oct.7.

Among countries scheduled to participate in the hearings are the United States - Israel’s strongest supporter, China, Russia, South Africa and Egypt. Israel will not, although it has sent written observations.

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s politicians are protesting a once in a lifetime valued added tax of 3 as well as the imposition of VAT on some new items, but far more damaging to the poor is the deadly power given to macroeconomists to generate 5 to 7 percent inflation every year.

Sri Lanka’s macro-economists had inveigled President Ranil Wickremesinghe and handed them the power to conduct monetary policy (read print money) and generate inflation of 5 percent a year with room to push up price rises to 7 percent.

Related Sri Lanka central bank gets political nod to create up to 7-pct inflation

Legislators had already been misled by inflationists into passing the new IMF backed monetary law to target potential output (print money for growth) in the style of John Law, so positive inflation targeting was a piece of cake.

### Abolishing the Executive Presidency; Prudent Proposal  - But DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT FIRST

The movement to abolish the Executive Presidency is gaining traction and drawing significant interest as the deadline approaches

A prudent suggestion is to abolish the Executive Presidency through a referendum, ensuring that the process is not driven by ulterior motives. An alternative approach could involve the immediate dissolution of Parliament after securing the necessary two-thirds majority.  Following this, a two-in-one approach can be adopted by combining the referendum with the Parliamentary elections, streamlining the process and saving time, manpower and financial resources.

Sri Lanka is described as a multilingual country but this definition could perhaps be deceptive when reflecting on the past and present. One may be quick to point fingers at various state policies that were implemented which made one language superior to the rest. However, language is an integral part of communication and is a key marker of identity. Sri Lanka witnessed a time when minority groups faced linguistic discrimination which in fact was a political recipe for disaster. As the world prepares to celebrate International Mother Language Day on February 21, it would be timely to reflect on the ‘mistakes’ that dragged Sri Lanka towards ethnic separatism.

The consequence for the developing countries with high levels of debt is a prolonged development crisis with capital extracted for debt repayments and little capital left for investment to stimulate growth.

Two years ago in February 2022, Sri Lanka rapidly descended into an economic crisis that had long been in the making. The war in Ukraine and the sudden escalation of global commodity prices made it very difficult to import essential goods such as fuel. Having exhausted its foreign reserves without prioritising the imports of essential goods, the government defaulted on its external debt two months later.
