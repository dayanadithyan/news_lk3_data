OSA - newest weapon in Govt.’s arsenal to suppress freedom of expression and dissent

Sri Lanka’s beleaguered Government, amidst fighting a faltering economy and battling to increase state revenue is now facing a barrage of criticism after bringing into law the Online Safety Act (OSA). Amnesty International Sri Lanka called it an ‘additional weapon’ in the hands of the Government. Late last week Sri Lanka’s Justice Minister acknowledged deficiencies and called for all-party consultations.

The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has issued a stark warning to the President – that the OSA was not validly passed by Parliament.

In a detailed analysis the HRCSL highlights 30 instances of failure to comply with requirements set out by the Supreme Court, where several petitioners made applications challenging various aspects proposed by the Government in the Bill.

### Political aspirations with greed for power still continue with our present politicians too

Time is ripe for the voters to elect politicians who are honest, educated, and young, and people with principles and a vision to change the systems management and implementation – Pic by Shehan Gunasekara

It is most unfortunate that the bungling of national issues commenced with the greed for power by one of our most educated politicians in Sri Lanka, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, in bringing the “Sinhala Only” bill into effect in Parliament after his victory in 1956. That caused the division in Sri Lanka driving away some of the most educated and qualified public officers, including the “Burgher” population, to leave the country in search of better pastures. It reversed the economic and political stability we had.

The long drawn out war commencing from the assassination of the Mayor of Jaffna Alfred Duraiappah in 1975 till 2009, saw the darkest period of racial riots in this country caused by blatant mistakes committed by our leading politicians.

### Anura Bandaranaike: “Always the bridesmaid, never the bride”

*2024-02-14 03:42:27* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Anura-Bandaranaike-Always-the-bridesmaid-never-the-bride/4-758467) · `en`

What do Ranil Wickremesinghe, Dinesh Gunawardena and Anura Bandaranaike have in common? They were born a year after independence in 1949 and were classmates together at Royal College, Colombo. All three were from illustrious families involved in politics and went on to be brightly shining stars in the Island nation’s political firmament.

Anura Bandaranaike born on 15 February 1949 was regarded as the crown prince of Lankan politics due to the fact that he was the son of SWRD and Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Both of them served as Prime Ministers. Despite this impressive political pedigree, Anura was never a Prime Minister or President. That honour went to his elder sister Chandrika Kumaratunge who was both premier and president. Anura however held many posts like MP, Leader of the Opposition, Cabinet Minister and Speaker but was never “crowned as a King.” Anura passed away 16 years ago at the age of 59 in 2008.

### Fact, opinion, and truth

*2024-02-14 03:36:00* · [`dailyftlk`](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Fact-opinion-and-truth/4-758466) · `en`

“The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving servants of tyranny a good conscience “

History will remember President Ranil Wickremesinghe elected by a secret vote in Parliament to serve the remainder of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s presidential term for another curiously distinctive reason. He will be remembered for the number of policy statements and ceremonial openings of Parliament during his tenure.

Moral high ground is not a podium to preach from. It is an arduous mountain; one climbs on one’s own.

In his latest address he asked - “Why can’t we unite in a shared vision for the country’s well-being and the future?” Why can’t we reach a collective understanding for the benefit of our nation’s youth? Why can’t we join hands to reach great heights?” Rhetoric failed to conceal past failure.

People waiting for hours to refill liquefied petroleum gas cylinders during Sri Lanka's economic crisis of 2022

There are worrying signs that policymakers and political parties simply have not grasped the magnitude of the problem at hand. The current direction of Sri Lanka’s economy and the overall mindset of a majority of economic and policy elites within and beyond the State, suggests a trajectory that will keep Sri Lanka dependent on foreign debt-financed trade deficits, vulnerable to shocks from energy prices, and unprepared for the next wave of transformation and economic growth.

### NGO Activities Amid Closing Civic Spaces - EDITORIAL

*2024-02-14 02:42:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/NGO-Activities-Amid-Closing-Civic-Spaces-EDITORIAL/172-276954) · `en`

On 10 February, this newspaper drew attention to a ‘not so new’ law – the ‘Non-Governmental Organisations (Registration and Supervision) Bill’, which the government claims is now ready. The Bill itself has been in the making for a long period, dating back to the era when our present President was Prime Minister of the country in 2017.

The aim of the bill as its name suggests is to register and supervise the activities of the NGOs in the country. Many Lankan leaders have attempted to use NGOs to promote their particular agendas. Unfortunately, at different times NGOs have fallen for the ruses of politicians.

Rather than involving themselves in meeting emergency situations or human needs, a number of NGOs have entangled themselves in narrow party political affiliated activities. However, whatever the rights and wrongs of the situation, what is frightening about the ‘Non-Governmental Organisations (Registration and Supervision) Bill’ is its timing.

### Counterfactual History: ‘Rohana Wijeweera visiting New Delhi in 1987.’

On the eve of JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s much-talked-about visit to India, let’s take a journey into counterfactual history!

Imagine the late JVP leader, Rohana Wijeweera travelling to New Delhi in 1987, or more plausibly, an industrious J.R. Jayawardene coaxing his Indian counterpart to invite Wijeweera (Granted, that is a tall order, considering that in the JVP’s assessment, payoffs of perpetuating violent opposition to the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord, favoured it over striking a compromise). That favourable context for a violent takeover remained so until Black Cats, PRA, and all the other assorted state-backed anti-JVP para militaries came to life. The JVP started targeting families of military personnel (or someone else did it and conveniently put it on the JVP account), shifting the military attitude into outright hostility towards the JVP.

### It is impossible to abolish the executive presidency - Pradeepa Mahanama

*2024-02-14 01:56:00* · [`virakesarilk`](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/176317) · `ta`

If the executive presidency is to be abolished, the parliament must go to a two -thirds majority in parliament.. Pradeepa Mahanama, former chairman of the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission, said that it is not possible to abolish the executive presidency.

The abolition of the executive presidency is seen as the current main speech.

The 'Executive Presidential System' is the main feature of the second Republican Constitution in 1978.

The leaders who came to power after 1994 promised to abolish the executive presidency. But the promises made by the people have not been fulfilled. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has taken action through Parliament twice to abolish the executive presidency.

In most of the countries that promote democracy, the executive presidency is not in effect. The Cabinet -led governments that highlight the Parliament are currently in operation, so it is best to abolish the executive presidency.

But in an environment where the country today is present, there is a need for executive power. The reason is that we believe that we can solve many problems through executive power.

"In foreign countries, healthcare workers are assisted by private companies in carrying out these activities. Turning these tasks into government services was a significant mistake on the part of the government. Those who engaged in election campaigns and poster campaigns were elected for their satisfaction in these roles," he said.

### US Senate passes $95 billion Ukraine aid bill

*2024-02-13 18:39:00* · [`dailymirrorlk`](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/US-Senate-passes-95-billion-Ukraine-aid-bill/108-276932) · `en`

US, Feb 13- The US Senate passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine and Israel in a vote early Tuesday morning, setting up a showdown with the House as Speaker Mike Johnson has criticized the legislation.

The foreign aid package includes billions of dollars to support Ukraine and for security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine, among other priorities. It’s unclear whether Johnson would hold a vote on it and many House Republicans are opposed to further aid to Ukraine.

The bill passed the Senate despite Johnson’s criticism of the legislation and former President Donald Trump signaling opposition to the bill by arguing the US should stop providing foreign aid unless it is in the form of a loan. The Senate vote was 70 to 29 with 22 Republicans voting in favor, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

US, Feb 13- The US Senate passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine and Israel in a vote early Tuesday morning, setting up a showdown with the House as Speaker Mike Johnson has criticized the legislation.

*2024-02-13 18:18:00* · [`dbsjeyarajcom`](https://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/?p=83620) · `en`

“The best laid schemes  of mice and men often go awry, ”penned the Scottish bard Robert Burns in his poem”to a mouse”. This truth was brought home in an explosive manner to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE)  37 years ago when  a massive explosion rocked the Kaithady area in the Thenmaratchi division of Jaffna peninsula.

February 14th 1987 was a bloody valentine’s day in northern Jaffna. A bold attempt  by the LTTE known popularly as the tigers  to attack the Navatkuli army camp on that day was  aborted due to an accident which killed 43 persons and injured 51 persons. A carefully planned operation by the LTTE with a tremendous chance of success was not implemented  as a result of it.

The casualties included three senior leaders of the LTTE at that time. 14 February 1987  remains  an explosive date in the annals of contemporary military history and is worthy of being recounted as  it’s 34th anniversary draws near.

### US Senate passes $95 bln aid bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan

*2024-02-13 18:07:00* · [`adaderanalk`](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97240/us-senate-passes-95-bln-aid-bill-for-ukraine-israel-and-taiwan) · `en`

The Democratic-led U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed a $95.34 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, amid growing doubts about the legislation’s fate in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

The lawmakers approved the measure in a 70-29 vote that exceeded the chamber’s 60-vote threshold for passage and sent the legislation on to the House. Twenty-two Republicans joined most Democrats to support the bill.

“It’s certainly been years, perhaps decades, since the Senate has passed a bill that so greatly impacts not just our national security, not just the security of our allies, but the security of western democracy,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.

The Senate vote occurred before sunrise, after eight hardline Republican opponents of Ukraine aid held an overnight marathon of speeches that dominated the chamber floor for more than six hours.
