    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Executive officers of Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank has written to the parliamentary speaker raising concerns over draft monetary law which appears to allow the Finance Minister to interfere in senior management appointments and have the governor serve in perpetuity.",
    "\u201c\u2026[T]he bill gives the power to the Minister of Finance to determine the number of Deputy Governors and to appoint them with the concurrence of the Governing Board,\u201d the Central Bank Executive Officer Union said.",
    "\u201cThis practice could be interpreted as direct interference with the management of thee central bank.\u201d",
    "The Executive Officers called for appointments to be made by Governing Board.",
    "The move comes amid public calls to have an independent public service where appointments are made by a constitutional council.",
    "The law provides for an appointed member of the board to be 06 years. But the appointed member does not include the Governor, \u201cwhich would mean that the Governor holds office perpetually, until death, removal or resignation,\u201d the Union said.",
    "\u201cHence it is recommended to impose a predetermined term for the post of Governor.\u201d",
    "Other critics have also pointed out that the new law, does not end money and exchange rate policy conflicts which trigger forex shortages and currency crisis and has instead attempts to legalize it and also appears to legalize output gap targeting or stimulus, despite having overt exchange rate policy.",
    "The setting up of a reserve collecting central bank was perhaps the most serious early institutional breakdowns that happened in the country, that brought severe monetary instability which in turn triggered social unrest and political instability."
