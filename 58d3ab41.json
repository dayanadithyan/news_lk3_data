    "NATO countries have delivered more than 98% of the combat vehicles promised to Ukraine amid its war with Russia, the military alliance\u2019s chief said Thursday, giving Kyiv a bigger punch as it appears poised to launch a counteroffensive.",
    "Along with more than 1,550 armored vehicles, 230 tanks and other equipment, member nations have sent Ukraine \u201cvast amounts of ammunition\u201d and also trained and equipped more than nine new Ukrainian brigades, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.",
    "More than 30,000 troops are estimated to make up the new brigades.",
    "\u201cThis will put Ukraine in a strong position to continue to retake occupied territory,\u201d Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels.",
    "His comments came a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping had a \u201clong and meaningful\u201d phone call in their first known contact since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion more than a year ago.",
    "Though Zelenskyy wsaid he was encouraged by Wednesday\u2019s call and Western officials welcomed Xi\u2019s move, the development didn\u2019t appear to bring about any immediate shift in peace prospects.",
    "Russia and Ukraine are far apart in their terms for peace, and Beijing \u2014 while looking to position itself as a global diplomatic power \u2014 has refused to criticize Moscow\u2019s invasion. The Chinese government sees Russia as a diplomatic ally in opposing U.S. influence in global affairs, and Xi visited Moscow last month.",
    "Stoltenberg said the 31 NATO allies were committed to shoring up Ukraine\u2019s military, adding that taking back land occupied by the Kremlin\u2019s forces would give Kyiv a stronger negotiating position if peace talks occur.",
    "The Kremlin gave a lukewarm response to the call between Xi and Zelenskyy.",
    "Asked if the call could help end the fighting, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: \u201cWe are ready to welcome anything that could lead to the termination of the conflict in Ukraine and the achievement of all the goals set by Russia.\u201d",
    "Peskov said the conversation between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders was \u201cthe sovereign business of those countries and the issue of their bilateral dialogue.\u201d",
    "With battlefield positions in Ukraine largely static as a war of attrition took hold in recent months, Russian forces have kept up their bombardment of Ukrainian areas, often hitting apartment buildings and other civilian infrastructure.",
    "At least seven civilians were killed and 33 were injured between Wednesday and Thursday, Ukraine\u2019s presidential office said Thursday.",
    "They included one person killed and 23 wounded, including a child, when four Kalibr cruise missiles hit the southern city of Mykolaiv, official said.",
    "The governor of Mykolaiv province, Vitalii Kim, said 22 multi-story buildings, 12 private houses and other residential buildings were damaged in the attack.",
    "Kalibr missiles are launched from ships or submarines, The ones that hit Mykolaiv were fired from somewhere in the Black Sea, according to Ukraine\u2019s Operational Command South."
