    "The CSE was extremely bullish throughout yesterday and shares jumped in mid-day trade following President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s address to Parliament, wherein he mentioned that a Letter of Intent has been signed covering the deal with the IMF. The latter is to be submitted to the IMF Executive Board for approval, a market analyst said.",
    "We expect Board approval in the third or fourth week of March, President Wickremesinghe said. \u201cNews of the IMF process coming to its conclusion has pushed up banking counters massively, which in turn is pulling the market up, because that is the biggest share counter in the stock market. Investors expect a fall in market rates once the IMF has agreed to provide its loan to Sri Lanka, the analyst added.",
