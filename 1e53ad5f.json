    "Direct selling or network marketing could be used as a device to eliminate poverty in Sri Lanka, however, it is a matter of regret that the lack of proper legal provisions for such marketing methods in Sri Lanka and the lack of proper gazettes to regulate these have hindered the trend of the country\u2019s economy, Economist Dr. Sarath Ranathunga says.",
    "\u201cThe online marketing strategy was developed in the late 1800s by David McConnel, founder of the first-ever marketing company; \u201cCalifornia Perfume Company\u201d which we all know today as Avon, the network marketing giant of the world. Network marketing is about turning people from employees to entrepreneurs. It\u2019s a fabulous way to grow and help other people to grow and realize their full potential in life,\u201d he says.",
    "He further notes: \u201cIn order to eliminate poverty in such countries as Sri Lanka, the generated wealth should be equally distributed if you want to generate wealth. Developed countries are already successfully doing \u201cnetwork marketing\u201d, which directly or indirectly affects the upliftment of the economy.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis enables a young enterprise to produce local products, obtain a fixed purchase price for them and sell goods locally and abroad through online marketing which would increase the inflow of dollars to the country.\u201d",
