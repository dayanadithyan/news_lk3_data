    "Sri Lanka\u2019s most focused power, energy, construction and interior products exhibition",
    "The Power, Energy and Construction Expo is set to take place from 7 to 9 July 2023 at BMICH Exhibition Centre, Colombo. The expo will showcase the latest developments and innovations in the power, energy, and construction industries. This event is organised by Lanka Exhibition and Conference Services (LECS), a presidential award-winning company for organising exhibitions in Sri Lanka.",
    "The expo will feature exhibitors from various sectors of the industry, including power generation, renewable energy, solar power technologies, housing, building and construction materials and machinery, Interior D\u00e9cor etc.",
    "Due to the increasing cost of living and soaring electricity bills, the organisers have identified a high demand for quality products and services for renewable energy, solar power and building materials. One of the key challenges facing the industry is the need to diversify our energy mix and need to improve energy efficiency across all sectors of the economy.",
    "This will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including government, industry, and consumers. While Sri Lanka has made great strides in developing its renewable energy capacity, there is still significant potential for growth in the country.",
    "Apart from the energy sector, the government has been investing heavily in infrastructure development projects such as highways, airports, and ports. This has led to an increase in demand for construction materials such as cement, steel, and concrete etc.",
    "Many establishments are looking at revamping and renovating their work places. It\u2019s been 3 years since the COVID pandemic and industries like the tourism sector are heavily investing in upgrading their facilities to serve the number of tourist visiting our country. This is where interior products and services can be useful.",
    "This expo is a great opportunity for all the industry leaders to showcase their products and services to a wide audience. It will also be an excellent platform for networking and building relationships with potential clients and partners.",
    "Overall, the Power, Energy and Construction Expo is a must-attend event for anyone involved or interested in these industries and we as organisers identified the need for such an event in this nation and we invite you to join hands with us to explore the opportunities in Sri Lanka."
