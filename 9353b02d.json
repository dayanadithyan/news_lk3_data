    "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s remarks on May 18 that \u201cCanada will not stop advocating for the rights of the victims and survivors of this conflict, as well as for all in Sri Lanka who continue to face hardship,\u201d in the context of the recognition of May 18 as \u201cTamil Genocide Remembrance Day\u201d has met with a strong rebuttal from the Sri Lankan government.\u00a0 It is tragic that 14 years after the end of the war, and with a President as internationalist and liberal as Ranil Wickremesinghe at the helm, that Sri Lanka should be losing ground internationally and its embassies abroad are unable to stem the tide because there is no political progress on the issue of national reconciliation at home. This is particularly tragic as Sri Lanka, after its economic collapse, needs international support more than ever.",
    "The reality is that Sri Lanka continues to be a divided society.\u00a0 This was seen when people in the North and East, on May 18, remembered their loved and missing ones who are no longer with them.\u00a0 The following day on May 19, the government remembered the war victory and the sacrifices of security forces who lost their lives to keep the country united.\u00a0 In view of the tragedy of divided sentiment in the country, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission appointed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2010 recommended that commemoration of all victims of the war should take place on a single day: \u201cA separate event should be set apart on the National Day (4 February) to express solidarity and empathy with all victims of the tragic conflict and pledge the collective commitment to ensure that there should never be such blood-letting in the country again.\u201d",
    "So far February 4 remains a pageant of military might and not of remembrance.\u00a0 It was so this year as well. It is worth quoting at length from the LLRC report at this time when views seem to be hardening on both side of the ethnic and political divides.\u00a0 \u201cThe process of reconciliation requires a full acknowledgement of the tragedy of the conflict and a collective act of contrition by the political leaders and civil society, of both Sinhala and Tamil communities. The conflict could have been avoided had the southern political leaders of the two main political parties acted in the national interest and forged a consensus between them to offer an acceptable solution to the Tamil people.\u201d",
    "Indeed, the time is opportune and the situation is ripe for a bipartisan approach to resolving the ethnic conflict. \u00a0Speaking to a group of civil society members, Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa observed that the country\u2019s ethnic problem had become easier to resolve in the aftermath of the  Aragalaya.\u00a0 One of the protest movement\u2019s notable features was the visible bridging of ethnic and social divides.\u00a0 There was a celebration of unity in diversity that befits Sri Lanka\u2019s plural, multi-ethnic and multi-religious composition.\u00a0 During the Aragalaya the country, and world at large, heard the slogans of the youthful demonstrators who proclaimed the equality of all citizens and denounced the politicians who had come to power on narrow nationalist platforms that mobilized the sentiments of fear and suspicion against each other.",
    "Opposition leader Premadasa also said that at the root of the ethnic conflict and difficulty to resolve it was the suspicion and insecurity that has existed between the communities, but which the economic hardships that precipitated the Aragalaya had contributed to mitigate by uniting the people.\u00a0 The unity of the people who came together to protest was brought about by the common problem they faced when the economy collapsed and there were shortages and queues for most essential commodities.\u00a0 However, while the protest movement could dislodge the government leadership in power, it could not replace it with a new leadership of their own. They were suppressed. Similarly, it would be the case that the unity of the people by themselves will not find a solution to the ethnic conflict. The answer needs to come from political leadership which will make them feel secure and represented.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been recently involved in a process of dialogue with the Tamil political parties to find a solution to the problem as has taken place many times in the past without success.\u00a0 In fact, a few months ago he even made a pledge to solve the problem by February 4, the day on which Sri Lanka celebrated its 75th anniversary of independence.\u00a0 He was statesmanlike in his aspirations when he said he did not wish to leave the problem to the next generation. The Opposition leader\u2019s invitation to civil society members to make their ideas on the reconciliation process known to him and his observation that the Aragalaya had made the ethnic conflict easier to resolve can be taken as indications of his willingness to engage constructively in the resolution of the ethnic conflict.\u00a0\u00a0 This could provide the much-needed bipartisan consensus necessary to both negotiate and implement a political solution.",
    "The revival and empowerment of the provincial council system is at the heart of the long-term resolution of the ethnic conflict.\u00a0 The issue of regional autonomy, which would enable the different ethnic and religious communities to run their own affairs in the areas in which they are majority has had a long history dating back to the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957 which was the first instance of a negotiated settlement between the leadership of the government and Tamil polity.\u00a0 This was followed by the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Agreement of 1965, the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord of 1987, the draft constitution of 2000 of Chandrika Kumaratunga, the All-Party Representatives Committee proposals of 2010 during Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s period, and the constitutional assembly of 2015 by the Sirisena- Wickremesinghe government that came up with multiple proposals.",
    "The political solution to the ethnic conflict has been worked and reworked on multiple occasions. They have been accepted by the government in power or by sections within the government but rejected by the opposition that is out of power. \u00a0This time it can be different.\u00a0 During the meeting between Opposition leader Premadasa and the civil society members, when he was asked what his position on the devolution of power was, he replied that it was the maximum devolution of power within the unitary state, which was also his position during the presidential election of 2019.\u00a0 Such a position would correspond to President Wickremesinghe\u2019s position that the provisions of the constitution should be followed by fully implementing the 13th Amendment.",
    "Among President Wickremesinghe\u2019s most positive qualities has been his lifelong rejection of ethnic nationalist politics.\u00a0 He has never tried to fan communal fears or prejudices in order to win votes at elections and has lost elections for that reason against less scrupulous political challengers whom the Aragalaya rights denounced.\u00a0 In a similar way, Opposition leader Premadasa has also never engaged in the politics of ethnic nationalism.\u00a0 It is important that these two non-racist leaders should work together to ensure that Sri Lanka can find a political solution and as well as deal with the human rights issues of the past through the truth and reconciliation commission that the government led by President Wickremesinghe is proposing to set up.\u00a0 As a victim of the war\u2019s atrocities himself, the Opposition leader has shown magnanimity and non-hatred that can show the way to healing the wounds of the past and regaining Sri Lanka\u2019s place in the community of nations.",
