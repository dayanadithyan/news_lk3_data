    "In the 1970s amid bad Fed policy which pushed up oil prices, US banks also re-cycled so-called \u2018petro collars\u2019 to Latin American nations as bondholders re-cycled abundant liquidity to third world nations which had monetary instability historically in recent yearsm",
    "China also shifted some of its reserves from US Treasury bills to policy banks and gave loans to countries with a history of monetary instability amid questionable feasibility of some projects.",
