  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Attorney General has filed a revision application before the Colombo High Court calling to set aside the order issued by Colombo Chief Magistrate releasing the Convener of the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) Wasantha Mudalige from all charges filed against him.",
    "The Attorney General's Department had filed the application before the High Court and it was fixed to be taken up for inquiry on April 3 by the Registrar of High Court No 4 yesterday.",
    "The Attorney General by the revision application had contended that the Magistrate does not have jurisdiction to release the suspect who was arrested and remanded under the Prevention of Terrorism Act without the Attorney General's sanction.",
    "The Attorney General asserted that that the order given by Magistrate Prasanna Alwis without considering the objections raised by the State counsel Deleepa Pieris during the inquiry before the Magistrate Court is a defilement of the law and releasing a suspect from all charges is contrary to the law and a violation of the law of the country.",
    "Therefore the Attorney General by the revision application has pleaded with the High Court to set aside the Magistrate\u2019s order and to remand the suspect.",
    "Wasantha Mudalige, who was remanded under the PTA, was released on the 31st of January 2023 after the Colombo Chief Magistrate who considered the requests made by counsels representing him after being remanded for 167 days. (Farook Thajudeen)"
