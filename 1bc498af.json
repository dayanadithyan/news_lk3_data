    "CSE trading started on a positive note in the morning session yesterday but in the second session profit- takings were noted even with the Central Bank announcing an interest rate decline, market analysts said.",
    "The rate cut assurance by the Central Bank gave an impetus to the market but investors are still concerned about the domestic restructuring issue. Accordingly, investor sentiment had not picked up to a significant level, analysts added.",
