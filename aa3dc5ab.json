    "ECONOMYNEXT -Sri Lanka\u2019s state hospital system is facing a shortage of specialists, a top official said as doctors leave the country in the wake of the worst currency crisis in the history of the island\u2019s flexible exchange rate central bank.",
    "\u201d We have a shortage of specialists in the country, because they are leaving the country,\u201d Director General of Health Asela Gunawardena told reporters Monday.",
    "\u201cWe hope to assign specialist doctors who are coming back from foreign training. But it will take some time and we will see some sort of a shortage within that time period.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s mainstream economists printed money for two years to mis-target rates and push growth without working for it (monetary stimulus or output gap targeting) after the International Monetary Fund taught the country to calculate an output gap.",
    "In 2022, the rupee collapsed from 200 to 360 to the US dollar after an attempt was made to \u2018float\u2019 the rupee without removing a surrender rule first. The rupee has since appreciated after rates were hiked and the surrender rule was removed.",
    "After a surrender rule by the Central Bank was lifted earlier this year the rupee started appreciating and is currently trading at the spot market below 300 to the US dollar.",

    "\u201cWe still have a shortage of 100-120 medicines, \u201d Gunawardena said. \u201cWe have ordered them and we are getting them and going forward we will be able to minimize the shortage\u201d. (Colombo/ June 23/2023)"
