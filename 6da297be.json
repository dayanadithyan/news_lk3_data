    "Claims Sri Lanka is now practising form of disaster capitalism in reference to X-Press Pearl disaster",
    "MP Nalaka Godahewa questions why Justice Minister opposed debate when he himself had suggested matter be taken up",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress member MP Dilan Perera on Wednesday called the appointment of United National Party (UNP) leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as Sri Lanka\u2019s President in July last year the \u2018most despicable conspiracy\u2019 in the country\u2019s history.",
    "The MP made the comment during a press conference in response to a statement made by the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Sagara Kariyawasam, where the latter was quoted as saying the party will not allow any political conspiracy to take place. \u201cThey appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe through a conspiracy. That is the truth,\u201d he said. The MP said therefore the SLPP does not have the moral higher ground to speak of conspiracies.",
    "Perera also highlighted the comments made by Minister Prasanna Ranatunge in parliament this week where he called the activists of the Aragalaya \u2018good for nothing\u2019. \u201cThe President they elected was an initial supporter of the Aragalaya and he tweeted in support of them often. Does he mean to say their President is good for nothing as well,\u201d Perera asked.",
    "Commenting on the X-Press Pearl disaster and its compensation process, Perera said Sri Lanka is currently practising disaster capitalism.",
    "Meanwhile holding a press conference yesterday Freedom People\u2019s Congress member MP Nalaka Godahewa questioned why Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa opposed the debate on the disaster when he himself had proposed the matter to be taken up in parliament. \u201cWhy the sudden opposition?\u201d Godahewa asked."
