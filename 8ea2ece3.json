    "\u201cIt is now up to us, as the private sector, to stand together to preserve our enterprises and prepare our businesses for a growth mode as we emerge from the darkness. The SLRA and retail firms are vital engines of growth. It is an opportunity for the retail sector to forgo partnerships with foreign players and principals and encourage investment and collaboration with local players.

    "\u201cThe retail industry has shown great resilience albeit the recent setbacks and continues to be the engine of the economy. It is the machinery that enables trade and services and uplifts rural economic activity. Considering its scope and breadth, it is important to understand the impact of retail to the national economy. Retail plays a vital role in three key areas - GDP, employment and tourism,\u201d he outlined. Established in 2015, the SLRA has an ambitious vision to \u2018Achieve Retail Excellence\u2019 and be the \u2018Voice of the Retail Industry in Sri Lanka\u2019. The SLRA aims to educate retailers as to how they could work together to improve retail standards in an inclusive manner, improve consumer service across all facets of retailing and facilitate the growth of the retail industry through innovation."
