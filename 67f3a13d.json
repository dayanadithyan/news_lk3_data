    "Merril J. Fernando\u2019s recently published autobiography would be considered by many to be best story of its kind coming out in recent times, if not all time, of the life and times of a business leader in Sri Lanka. Similar volumes published in recent years that come readily to mind are the life and career stories of C.P. (Chari) de Silva of Aitken Spence, Ken Balendra of John Keells, Hemaka Amarasuriya of Singer and Rienzie Weeraratne of Unilever.",
    "Undoubtedly many more resources have been poured into this production than to its predecessors. The result is spectacular both in appearance and substance. Over 200 interesting photographs scattered throughout the well-designed volume, makes reading its 400+ pages easy. The reader cannot but be impressed about MJF\u2019s meticulous record keeping that is a feature of the book; also the author\u2019s deliberate decision not to pull back his punches aimed at some prominent figures in the country, many of them now dead.",
    "Merril Fernando, undoubtedly, is the best known face in Sri Lanka\u2019s tea industry. He\u2019s not the biggest producer or exporter of tea in the country. But his Dilmah brand, coined from the names of his two sons, Dilhan and Malik, is also the best known Sri Lankan-owned brand worldwide. Few would know until they read the book that the original brand name was Dilma, The \u2018h\u2019 was added later to give it added punch as recommended by advertising professionals in Australia; nor would many know that Fernando served four years as a seminarian at St. Aloysius Seminary in Borella (\u201cI was very unhappy and frequently reduced to tears\u201d). Training a youth who had his sights on the legal profession to be a catholic priest was forced on him by his parents to whom he couldn\u2019t say \u201cNo\u201d at that point of time in his life and the prevailing culture.",
    "Also that very early in his working life when he was training as a tea taster at Heath and Co., a hard to get opportunity then when that work was largely a preserve on the British, that he broke away to take up a job offer in the U.S. multinational, Mobil Oil. Fernando says the terms offered were \u201cquite attractive,\u201d and the offer too good to turn down at age 22-years with about Rs. 1,500 monthly on the table. He admits a \u201cdistressing lack of responsibility in suddenly abandoning my trainee tea taster programme.\u201d Although he enjoyed the work the work at Mobil and was good at it, he says \u201cthe business was open to and driven by bribery\u201d and he returned to tea at AF Jones, a small firm run by a British father and his two sons.",
    "A condition of that employment was that he had to train in London at his own expense. In arranging his training slot, the head of a British firm here wrote to a friend in London recommending MJF (letter reproduced in the book) raising an interesting points about Merril (1) \u201d His general appearance and ways of doing business have always struck me as displaying a certain amount of integrity, which is more than I can say for most of his brethren\u201d The second was \u201cI have made it perfectly plain to him that in the UK there are no bottle washers or Tea Boys to wait on learners and practically all the messy work has to be done by the learners themselves.\u201d",
    "Fernando started at AF Jones, a company he was to later acquire, as an Assistant Tea Taster at Rs. 750 a month in May 1955. His UK experiences makes good reading including the story that he brought back pounds 325 when he returned to Ceylon at the end of five months. His landlady in London, Mrs. Butler, had tried to persuade him to buy her terraced house for pounds 750 and offered to arrange a mortgage. \u201cI didn\u2019t even consider it,\u201d says Fernando. \u201cThat apartment was worth four million pounds in 2019.\u201d",
    "What comes out strongest in the book is Merril Fernando\u2019s passion for \u201cpure Ceylon tea\u201d and his determination that this product be offered globally to discerning consumers worldwide. When strong lobbies were hard at work saying that Sri Lanka should be made an International Tea Hub like Dubai and Rotterdam by permitting the import of cheaper teas for blending, packaging and exporting, he battled unrelentingly against a move he considered would be disastrous making many enemies in the process.",
    "Equally strong is the projection of Dilmah as a family business with his two sons figuring in both text and pictures. Merril promoted his tea using his own photo widely and with homely messages to consumers of a product coming from \u201cus to you.\u201d His own avuncular appearance and the excellence of the photography, perhaps an offshoot of Dilhan\u2019s passion for the camera, played a major role in promoting Dilmah, evident in many of the photographs included in the book. Fernando\u2019s faith in God and belief in divine intervention is a continuing thread through the publication.",
    "There is no doubt that Merril Fernando has made a major contribution towards preserving the authenticity of Ceylon tea which had over the long period when it succeeded coffee in this country had built the reputation for unique flavour and quality that made tea drinkers worldwide recognize the product as the best available. His early training exposed him to the harsh realities of international tea export trade and he says he learned many important lessons he would never forget. These helped him to chart his business course over the next few decades. This experience and the absence of severe work pressure gave him time as a trainee in London for reflection, absorbing new impressions, acquiring new tastes and inculcate in him a lifelong passion for travel and new cultural experiences.",
    "Attacks directed at him over the years included accusations that he was getting favours from his former father-in-law, Major Motague Jayawickreme, onetime Minister of Plantation Industries, although his marriage to Devika Jayawickreme had long ended by then. The fact that President J.R. Jayewardene made Jayawickreme dispose a small shareholding in MJF\u2019s listed Ceylon Tea Services Ltd. (the predecessor to Dilmah Ceylon Tea Compny PLC) on a conflict of interest argument is duly recorded in the book. But Fernando makes the telling point that Jayawickreme bought the shares three years before he became minister. He also says he once refused to speak to Jayawickreme for three months when the latter called for a vote on an appointment to the new Tea Centre in New York with Fernando\u2019s the only dissenting vote against the proposal.",
    "The reader must not be misled by what\u2019s written above to think that Merril Fernando has made his autobiography a platform to merely hit out at those who opposed him. On the contrary, he has been lavish in his praise of many including senior bureaucrats and political authorities that include one time Plantation Industries Minister, Dr. Colvin. R. de Silva and his former teacher and later Trade Minister Hugh Fernando. But there is another side to that coin when he discusses estrangements with business partners at AF Jones and later in his own companies.",
    "I have known Merril Fernando for over 50 years and reported on his journey through the tea industry. One anecdote I will relate here is an occasion he took me to his home on Gower Street in Havelock Town for a string hopper dinner. That was the first time I had eaten a seer fish kiri hodda with pol sambol. I was so impressed about the meal that I mentioned it to his neighbour, my friend Mrs. Bertha Samarasinghe, the wife of the then Judge-Advocate of the Navy. A fine cook herself, Bertha responded: \u201cMerril understands fish. I see him buying his fish from vendors at his gate.\u201d This came to mind when I read a reference in the book to the \u201cever-faithful Alice, the best chef I have ever known apart from my mother.\u201d She probably cooked the meal I enjoyed.",
    "He could have found no better writer than Anura Gunasekera, a retired tea planter who worked for Dilmah for 10 years after he quit planting to collaborate in the writing which took all of three years to finish. With Merril Fernando completing his 92nd birthday days before the book was launched in May, there were constant challenges including covid, MJF\u2019s hospitalization off and on during the writing and many more. But an excellent production of a compelling read has been the result.",
    "The book is priced at Rs. 10,000 with all proceeds of sales going to MJF supported charities. But it looks as though it would have cost more to produce if all costs are factored. However that be, it\u2019s a compelling read on the life of a remarkable man, a self-made billionaire who\u2019s fond of saying that \u201cbusiness is a matter of public service\u201d \u2013 his many charities testifying to this. It\u2019s the history of a battle to preserve the integrity of Ceylon Tea which Merril Fernando says ought to be marketed like wine and champagne.",
