    "The main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) yesterday questioned the latest report which said Sarah Yasmin, the wife of the suicide bomber who blew himself up in Katuwaputiya Church on Easter Sunday 2019 has been confirmed dead.",
    "Former MP Mujibur Rahman questioned how the latest DNA test confirmed that she was dead when previous tests confirmed the body that was buried were not hers.\" This sounds more like a conspiracy. Bodies of those who died during the bomb blast should be exhumed and further checks should be conducted,\" he said. (Yohan Perera)"
