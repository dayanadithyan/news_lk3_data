    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has informed the CID Director to commence an immediate investigation against Pastor Jerome Fernando's controversial statements where he insulted the Buddha in front of a packed congregation recently and said even the Buddha needed Jesus.",
    "In a national security council meeting held on Monday morning, the National Security Head raised concerns with the President over the Pastor's critical remarks against Buddhism and said this could lead to communal tension in the country.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he would not allow any individual to destabilize the country and said anyone instigating religious disharmony should be probed and stern action should be taken.",
    "Wickremesinghe then advised the senior security heads to probe into Jerome's controversial statements as well as his past preachings. The National Security Head immediately handed over the investigation to the CID Head and asked for a team to commence an extensive investigation against Pastor Jerome Fernando.",
    "The Daily Mirror reported on Monday that\u00a0Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Minister Vidura Wickramanayake came out strongly against Jerome's comments insulting the Buddha and said there would be no room for anyone to insult any religion and stern action would be taken against such individuals.",
    "Minister Vidura also said there are a number of unlawful places of religious worship, including the one in which Pastor Jerome had made such inflammatory remarks.",
    "Over the weekend, a video showing Jerome preaching against Lord Buddha and Buddhism made its rounds on social media, creating an uproar amongst the majority of Buddhists, who demanded immediate action against the Pastor for his derogatory remarks.",
    "In his video, Jerome claimed that in a Buddhist\u2019s mind, they never hear the love of Buddha as their focus is enlightenment.",
    "\"But to be enlightened you need light. The name Buddha itself means enlightened one. So what is greater, light or enlightenment? Jesus said I am the light of the world. So I tell you now, Jesus didn\u2019t say I am the enlightened one. No, Jesus came from a dif\u00adferent wavelength. Jesus said I am the light. So I submit to you, the Buddha was looking for light. Buddha was actually looking for Jesus. This is why every Buddhist needs Jesus,\u201d Jerome preached in his prayer to a packed audience.",
    "Jerome Fernando has hit the headlines in recent months against his controversial preachings and many have questioned on his source of funding to host such large religious events. (JAMILA HUSAIN)"
