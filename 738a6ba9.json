    "Internal issues of Samagi Jana Balwegaya (SJB) and crossovers are not the most important issues at the moment as there are greater issues that have to be focused on, such as violation of the IMF agreement, SJB MP Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday",
    "\u201cThe most important is the violation of the agreement which the government has signed with the IMF,\u201d the MP told a press conference.",
    "\u201cAs per the agreement the government is bound to identify governance and weakness risks across certain core state functions namely fiscal governance, financial sector oversight, Central Bank Governance, market regulations and rule of law. What is critical here is that the government has violated this on six occasions. One aspect of this is the postponement of local government polls,\u201d the MP said.",
    "\u201cWhat is important is the consequence which the government would suffer as a result of violating the rule of law,\u201d he added.",
    "Asked about the crossovers and taking action against those who are to crossover, he said these are not important at the moment. \u201cI have already talked about crossovers in Parliament and I don\u2019t want to talk about them anymore,\u201d he said in this regard.",
    "The media institutions were informed that MP Mayantha Dissanayake will also participate in the press conference but he did not turn up for it. (Yohan Perera)"
