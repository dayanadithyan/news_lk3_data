    "Accordingly, although it was initially decided to allow for migrant workers to import electric vehicles equivalent to 50% of the value of remittances they have transmitted to Sri Lanka through official channels from 01 May 2022 to 31 December 2022, this time period has now been extended until 23 September 2023.",
