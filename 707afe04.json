  "original_body_lines": [
    "President Tayyip Erdogan and supporters on Monday revelled in an election victory lengthening his rule into a third decade while Turkey\u2019s opposition, which once counted on winning, braced for \u201cdifficult days\u201d against an increasingly autocratic government.",
    "His rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu said it was \u201cthe most unfair election in years\u201d but did not dispute the outcome, which gave Erdogan a mandate to pursue policies that have polarised Turkey and strengthened its position as a regional military power.",
    "The election had been seen as Erdogan\u2019s biggest political challenge, with the opposition confident of unseating him and reversing his policies after polls showed a cost-of-living crisis left him vulnerable.",
    "But he prevailed with 52.2% of the vote to Kilicdaroglu\u2019s 47.8%. It reinforced Erdogan\u2019s image of invincibility in the deeply divided NATO-member country, whose foreign, economic and security policy he has redrawn.",
    "Pro-government newspapers, part of an overwhelmingly pro-Erdogan media landscape that buoyed his election campaign in the nation of 85 million people, cheered his victory.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a good result because Tayyip Erdogan is a good leader, he knows what the people want. If people have been voting for him for 20 years, he must be a successful leader,\u201d said Altay Sahin, a construction worker in Istanbul.",
    "Addressing supporters in a victory speech, Erdogan declared democracy the winner. \u201cNow is the time to put the disputes and conflicts of the election period to one side and unite around our national goals,\u201d he said.",
    "But the prospect of five more years of Erdogan rule was a harsh blow to an opposition which accused him of undermining democracy as he amassed ever more power - a charge he denies. Kilicdaroglu had promised a new \u201cspring\u201d if he had won.",
    "\u201cI look at the people around me, who were supporting the opposition, and all of them are resentful,\u201d said Hulya Yildirim, a lawyer. \u201cWe forgot about spring in this country, we have to make our own spring because the people seem to be happy with winter.\u201d",
    "The lira slipped to a record low of 20.08 against the dollar. It has lost 90% of its value in the last decade, buffeted by currency crisis and rampant inflation.",
    "Its most recent losses were driven by uncertainty about what an Erdogan win would mean for economic policy. Critics have blamed his unorthodox, low interest-rate economic blueprint that the opposition had pledged to reverse, for the currency\u2019s woes.",
    "Erdogan said inflation, which hit a 24-year peak of 85% last year before easing, is Turkey\u2019s most urgent issue.",
    "Though he called for unity, Erdogan stuck to a major theme of his campaign in accusing Kilicdaroglu and the opposition of siding with terrorists, without providing evidence.",
    "Turkey\u2019s main pro-Kurdish party, parliament\u2019s third largest, was among the opposition parties opposed to Erdogan and is accused of links to Kurdish militants, which it denies.",
    "\u201cFor the opposition, very difficult days are ahead,\u201d said Atilla Yesilada, analyst at GlobalSource Partners, forecasting more judicial moves against the Kurdish party and saying it was not clear whether the opposition alliance would remain intact.",
    "Kilicdaroglu\u2019s defeat will probably be a cause for concern among Turkey\u2019s NATO allies that have been alarmed by Erdogan\u2019s amicable relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who congratulated his \u201cdear friend\u201d on his victory.",
    "U.S. President Joe Biden wrote on Twitter: \u201cI look forward to continuing to work together as NATO allies on bilateral issues and shared global challenges.\u201d He and Erdogan were to speak by phone later on Monday, Erdogan\u2019s office said.",
    "U.S. relations with Turkey have been impeded by Erdogan\u2019s objection to Sweden joining NATO as well as Ankara\u2019s close relationship with Moscow, even as Russian forces wage a 15-month-old invasion of Ukraine, and differences over Syria.",
    "Erdogan\u2019s victory extends his tenure as the longest-serving leader since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk established modern Turkey after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire a century ago - a politically potent anniversary to be marked in October.",
    "Erdogan, head of the Islamist-rooted AK Party, appealed to voters with nationalist and conservative rhetoric in a divisive campaign that deflected attention from Turkey\u2019s economic problems.",
    "Kilicdaroglu, who had promise to set Turkey on a more democratic and collaborative path, said the election outcome showed there was a will among many Turks to remove an authoritarian government, but \u201call the means of the state were laid at the feet of one man\u201d.",
    "Erdogan\u2019s performance wrong-footed opponents who thought voters would punish him over the state\u2019s initially slow response to earthquakes in February, in which over 50,000 people died.",
    "But in the first round of voting on May 14, which included parliamentary elections, his AK Party emerged top in 10 of the 11 provinces hit by the earthquakes, helping it to secure a parliamentary majority along with its allies."
