    "HSR Engineering, a member of the Wardena Holdings Group, has announced that it has legally changed its name to Megakem Engineering.",
    "This decision has been made with the primary objective of better integration and further leveraging the product expertise of its sister company, Megakem Lanka.",
    "Megakem Lanka is a leading manufacturer and supplier of construction chemicals in Sri Lanka, while Megakem Engineering (formerly known as HSR Engineering) is a reputed leader in the professional application of construction chemicals and coatings, and associated engineering services, while also being the authorised distributor of UK-based Cormix construction chemicals solutions.",
    "Discussing the decision, Megakem Engineering General Manager Manjula Kalubowila said, \u201cThe new name, Megakem Engineering, represents a renewed commitment to serving customers and suppliers with the highest levels of technical excellence, consistent quality, and efficient channels of distribution. It\u2019s important to note that this is only a change of name and not of ownership or management, and operations, logistics or supply chains will not be impacted. It will simply enable us to work better with our sister company, and primary supplier of construction coatings and chemicals, Megakem Lanka.\u201d"
