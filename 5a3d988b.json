    "A petition was filed before the Supreme Court today (March 21), alleging Finance Ministry\u2019s Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana of contempt of court.",
    "National People\u2019s Power MP Vijitha Herath put forward the petition, accusing Siriwardana of failing to comply with an order issued by the Supreme Court.",
    "On March 03, a three-member Supreme Court bench delivered an interim order preventing the Finance Ministry\u2019s Secretary from withholding the budgetary funds allocated for the Local Government election.",
    "In his petition, the parliamentarian has sought the Supreme Court to issue another order directing the Finance Ministry\u2019s Secretary to act on the previously issued interim order.",
    "The election, which was repeatedly postponed citing inadequacy of funds due to the ongoing economic crisis, is now rescheduled for April 25.",
    "MP Herath, recalling the Supreme Court\u2019s interim order previously which was issued after granting leave to proceed with a fundamental rights (FR) petition filed by SJB\u2019s general secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara, noted that a second interim order was also issued on March 03 preventing the Finance Secretary from withholding the budgetary funds allotted for the printing of ballot papers.",
    "On March 07, the Election Commission chairman, in a written request, appealed to the Finance Secretary to fund the polls. The letter detailed that Rs. 460 million is required to settle the payments to the Sri Lanka Police, Rs. 400 million for the Printing Department and another Rs. 500 million for the Postal Department.",
    "Referring to the election body\u2019s request, MP Herath noted that the Finance Secretary, who is named as the respondent in his petition, has not yet released the requested funds to go ahead with the election preparations.",
    "Stressing that the Finance Secretary has no authority to disregard the Supreme Court\u2019s interim order, the petitioner said Siriwardana\u2019s conduct is in contempt of court pursuant to Article 105(3) of the Constitution.",
    "He also sought a Supreme Court order directing the Attorney General to file indictments against the Finance Secretary."
