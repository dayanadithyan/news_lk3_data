    "Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis yesterday critically commented over the behaviour of lawyers in the courtroom during the inquiry into a forged Birth Certificate case of State Minister Diana Gamage and remarked that whatever category a lawyer may be, he should behave decently before the Court.",
    "Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis made this remark when President\u2019s Counsel Shavindra Fernando interrupted as Counsel Rienzie Arsecularatne PC was making submissions.",
    "The incident took place when Arsecularatne objected to the submissions of the CID by asserting that the CID was maintaining double standards by making submissions in court without arresting Diana Gamage.",
    "Arsecularatne said the CID had not arrested Diana Gamage while there was ample proof that she had committed a punishable offence. Arsecularatna further told the Magistrate that a \u201cB\u2019 report filed in court by the CID had clearly stated that Diana Gamage had obtained a passport by tendering a forged birth certificate to the Immigration and Emigration Department and now without arresting the suspect the CID was trying to let her go scot-free by saying that they are further investigating the matter and had sought the assistance of the Foreign Department of Great Britain to ascertain her British Citizenship.",
    "At this point Shavindra Fernando PC attempted to interrupt Arsecularatne PC and subsequently Senior Counsel Gunaratna Wanninayake intervened into the incident."
