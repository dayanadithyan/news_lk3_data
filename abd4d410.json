    "\u201cMPs like Harsha de Silva are willing to support President Wickremesinghe no matter what anyone says. We will support the President as a group if the party fails to make a decision,\u201d the MP said responding to a question raised by journalists at a media briefing.",
    "\u201cMany want to work with the President but are a bit reluctant to contest an election with him,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cThere are no policy differences between President Wickremesinghe and the SJB. SJBers went separately not because there were policy differences but because they were not happy about his decision making style,\u201d he added.",
    "Also, he said the notion that the President has put the country to a better position is a reality.",
    "Senaratne further said that he had discussions with the President especially on the health sector crisis. The President had promised to do whatever that should be done to correct it.",
