    "Change is just a fact of life. We have to accept it and live with it. Impermanence is the cornerstone of Buddhist teachings and practice. All that exists is impermanent and nothing lasts. Buddhists should fully appreciate this simple but profound truth. Annica (impermanence), dukkha (suffering) and anatta (selflessness) are the three characteristics common to all phenomenal existence.",
    "Impermanence is an inescapable and essentially painful fact of life. Life is perpetually in a state of flux and change. The great Greek philosopher Heraclitus, observing the fluid nature of things, declared \u201d No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.\u201d We must recognize this fact of impermanence and learn to see the subtle reality that the human body, too, undergoes an incalculable series of mutations and change every moment. The human body never remains the same for two consecutive moments, as it is subject to the law of impermanence",
    "In Buddhism, mindful reflection on the human body is considered a fundamental tool for our overall wellbeing that helps us gain an insight into the fact of impermanence, as we move through our life.",
    "It is said that Buddhism recognizes 40 subjects of meditation which can differ, according to the temperaments of persons. Contemplation of the human body is one of them. Of all the subjects of meditation, reflection on the human body, as a subject, is not popular among certain people, particularly in the western world. They regard it as a subject that may be somewhat unpleasant and not conducive to human wellbeing. In Buddhism it is called \u2018asuba bavana\u2019 or mindfulness of the impurities of the body. It is all about our physiology and individual body parts and organs, internal as well as external.",
    "This subject of meditation is unique to the Buddha\u2019s teachings. Normally, people who are infatuated and intoxicated with sensual pleasures develop an aversion towards this subject of meditation.There is also a misconception, among some people, that such contemplation would lead to a melancholic morbid and pessimistic outlook on life.",
    "But reflection on the human body, as subject of meditation, is an essential component of the Buddha\u2019s teaching, as knowledge of the true nature of the human body would be essential to our wellbeing. In order to comprehend the true nature of the human body, we got to put aside our preconceived ideas about it and ask ourselves dispassionately, Is the body something attractive or not? What is it composed of?. Is it something that is everlasting? Most people are under the delusion that the body is very attractive and that it is something desirable.",
    "Repulsiveness of the body can be clearly seen if we do not wash our body for a few days. We got to keep washing it otherwise the body would stink before long and become unbearable. We feel certain parts of our body so abominable. For instance, if a few strands of hair are found in our plate of rice we tend to lose our appetite. There are many such aspects of the body that we can look at to determine whether it is a pleasant thing or not, whether beautiful or not. (Rev. Ajahn Pannavaddho)",
    "As worldlings our mind has been enamored with the body. We generally look at the human body as a thing of beauty. We regard it as beautiful and spend a lot of time, energy and money to make it more beautiful and attractive. We admire beautiful eyes, teeth, face, hair and figure. We spend a lot of time feeding the body, clothing it and resting it. People like to look as young as they can, as long as they can, and increase their chances of having a lifelong healthy body.",
    "As Buddhists, we have to look at the human body from a realistic point of view. From the Buddhist perspective, the human body is a bag of impurities. Moreover, we cannot control everything that happens in our lives. For instance, we cannot change the natural aging process of our lives. Aging is a gradual, irreversible and inevitable process. Everyone should come to terms with his or her aging process",
    "With time, we all get visible lines and wrinkles on our face,it is natural with the passage of time for our face to lose its youthfulness. We notice our skin becoming thin and drier. We lose our teeth. We tend to lose our mental faculties. A lot of people, particularly women, feel inadequate about their physical appearance. They always think of ways of becoming younger and attractive. People spend an enormous amount of money on cosmetic procedures, skincare, and grooming products, to make themselves presentable. But it must be understood that use of grooming products, available in the whole world will not enable a person to recover his or her youthfulness, as the time takes its toll. When fears centre around aging, decay and disease, we cannot overcome them by pretending they do not exist. Only facing these inevitable features of life can bring insight and relief to us.",
    "Therefore, contemplation of the human body (kayanupassana) enables a person to gain an insight into the real nature of the human body. The Buddha dealt with 32 parts of the human body and spelt out its constituents.  Asuba bavana, in brief, is the contemplation of those 32 impure parts of the human body in their true nature. Practice of mindfulness of the human body can begin by contemplating on this very passage from satpattana sutta. \u201cIn this very body, from the soles of the feet up, from the crown of the head down, surrounded by skin, full of these various mean impurities, he reviews thus\u201d.  (Satipatthans Sutta, trans, Ven, Nanamoli).",
    "Head hair (Kesa), Body hair (Loma), Nails (Nakha), Teeth (Danta), Skin (Taco), Flesh (Mamsam), Sinews (Naharu), Bones (Atthi), Bone-marrow (Atthiminjam), Kidneys (Vakkam), Heart (Hadayam), Liver(Yakanam), Membranes (Kilomakam), Spleen(Pihakam), Lungs (Papphasam), Gut (Antam), Gut (Antagunam), Gorge (Udariyam), Dung (Karisam), Bile (Pittam), Phlegm (Semham), Pus (Pubbo), Blood (Lohitam), Sweat (Sedo), Fat (Medo), Tears (Assu), Grease( Vasa), Spit (Khelo), Snot (Sinhanika), Joints (Lasika), Urine (Muttam), lastly Brain Skull making up 32 parts. Observation of the repulsive nature of our body, constantly, and rapidly, leads a person to gain a realistic perspective of the human body.",
    "In the world today, for many people the most enduring desire is sexual desire, so to deal with this phenomenon, contemplation on the impure side of the human body would be important. At a time, people are subjected to bombardment of sensuality, by way of the mass media, resulting in defilement of the mind, notably lust, greed and attachment. Reflection on this aspect of the human body enables a person to gain tranquility. When the emphasis is so much on sensuality, such as youthfulness, beauty, we find the darker sides of life get pushed away, and swept under the carpet.",
    "Contemplation on the dead body is another appropriate subject recognized in Buddhism, in which the Buddha identified nine stages of decomposition of the dead body. The Buddha showed us how to realize this truth through contemplation on the human body. He drew attention to the activities of the body, how it is formed and inevitably passes away. intelligent contemplation on the dead body will strengthen one\u2019s mind sufficiently to develop Samadhi, which can be achieved by anyone.",
    "All beings that are born must die eventually. all creatures that inhabit the earth, whatever their status, undergo the common fate of death. Consequent to the death of a person, the body undergoes a series of biological changes and the decomposed body is returned to the earth, as an organic matter. It is part of this earth. When we look at a dead body properly, we realise that body does not belong to us, nor is it really ourselves, or a part of ourselves.",
    "One who has not realized this truth will be forever seeking another existence, in a different form, prolonging the journey through  samsara. Only a developed mind can see an end to this samsaric  journey.",
    "When you attend a funeral, looking at a dead body, one can reflect for a few moments in this manner. What has happened to you will also happen to me one day soon or later. The body which I thought was mine will one day become food for the worms and other creatures. The attractive form will inevitably disintegrate into pieces of bones and become a mass of rotting flesh. In a few days, the whole body will assume a disgusting and repulsive shape and form, exuding a foul-smelling odour. My attractive body, which I nurtured throughout, will also undergo the same fate. In this manner, by comparing the body with a dead body one can develop tranquility (Rev. K. Wipulansiri).",
    "It also helps immensely in recognizing and understanding the  tri-lakana as well as in controlling lust and attachment towards the human body.",
