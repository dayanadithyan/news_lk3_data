    "The man, in his thirties, was detained on landing. He told police that he opened the door because he \u201cwanted to get off the plane quickly,\u201d Yonhap said on Saturday, citing the Daegu Dongbu Police Station.",
    "He also told police he was stressed after losing his job recently.",
    "The man opened the door when the plane was about 700 feet (213 metres) above the ground, causing panic onboard.",
    "Nine passengers were taken to hospital with breathing issues. They were all discharged after about two hours, a fire department official said.",

    "A South Korean Transport Ministry official said on Friday that it was possible to open emergency exits at or near ground level because the pressure inside and outside the cabin is similar."
