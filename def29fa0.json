    "(AP) \u2014 Alabama law enforcement officers Sunday were imploring people to come forward with information about a shooting that killed four people and injured 28 others during a teenager\u2019s birthday party.",
    "Among those killed was a high school senior who planned to play college football and was celebrating his sister\u2019s 16th birthday. The shooting erupted Saturday night at a dance studio in downtown Dadeville.",
    "During two news conferences Sunday, Sgt. Jeremy Burkett of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency did not take questions. He did not say if a suspect was in custody or if investigators knew about any motivation. He did not provide the names of those killed.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have information from the community,\u201d Burkett said during a Sunday evening news conference.",
    "Philstavious \u201cPhil\u201d Dowdell, a Dadeville High School senior who had committed to Jacksonville State University, was celebrating at his sister Alexis\u2019 party before he was shot to death, his grandmother Annette Allen told the Montgomery Advertiser.",
    "\u201cHe was a very, very humble child. Never messed with anybody. Always had a smile on his face,\u201d Allen told the newspaper, calling it \u201ca million-dollar smile.\u201d",
    "Burkett said the shooting occurred about 10:30 p.m. Saturday. \u201cThere were four lives tragically lost in this incident,\u201d he said.",
    "The shootings rocked the city of 3,200 residents, which is about 57 miles (92 kilometers) northeast of Montgomery, Alabama.",
    "Keenan Cooper, the DJ at the party, told WBMA-TV that the party was stopped briefly when attendees heard someone had a gun. He said people with guns were asked to leave, but no one left. Cooper said when the shooting began an hour later, some people took shelter under a table where he was standing, and others ran out.",
    "Pastor Jason Whetstone, who leads the Christian Faith Fellowship, said the granddaughter of one of his church members was shot in the foot and underwent surgery Sunday.",
    "\u201cAll of our hearts are hurting right now. We\u2019re just trying to pull together to find strength and comfort,\u201d Whetstone said before an interfaith vigil in the parking lot of First Baptist Church.",
    "\u201cWe are a loving community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re pulling together in every aspect to comfort each and every one of these children, the teachers, all of the community.\u201d",
    "Dadeville\u2019s compact downtown is centered around a courthouse square with one- and two-story brick buildings. The town\u2019s busiest commercial district is a few blocks north of the square, off a bustling four-lane highway that runs between Birmingham and Auburn. Dadeville is close to Lake Martin, a popular recreational area.",
    "Investigators on Sunday continued filing in and out of the Mahogany Masterpiece dance studio, denoted by a banner hanging on the outside of a one-story brick building just off the square. At least five bullet holes were visible in the studio\u2019s front windows. Less than a block away, the American and Alabama flags were lowered to half staff outside the Tallapoosa County Courthouse.",
    "Dadeville Mayor Frank Goodman said he was in bed asleep when a council member called him just before 11 p.m. Saturday. He said he went to Lake Martin Community Hospital in Dadeville, where some of the people who had been shot were taken.",
    "\u201cIt was chaotic,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cThere were people running around. They were crying and screaming. There were police cars everywhere, there were ambulances everywhere. People were trying to find out about their loved ones. That was a scene, where we never had anything like this happen in our city before.\u201d",
    "Pastor Ben Hayes, who serves as chaplain for the Dadeville Police Department and for the local high school football team, said most of the victims are teenagers. Dowdell was within weeks of graduation and faced a bright future, Hayes told The Associated Press.",
    "\u201cHe was a strong competitor on the field,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to try to tackle him or get tackled by him. But when he came off the field, he was one of the nicest young men that you could ever meet, very respectful and well-respected by his peers.\u201d",
    "Antojuan Woody, from the neighboring town of Camp Hill, was a senior and fellow wide receiver with Dowdell on a Dadeville Tigers football team that went undefeated before losing in the second round of the playoffs last year. He said he and Dowdell had been best friends for all of their lives. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d Woody said as a steady stream of friends and teammates walked over to hug him during Sunday\u2019s prayer vigil. \u201cIt\u2019s unreal. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d",
    "Woody said he and Dowdell had a special relationship on the football field. \u201cUs being friends forever like that, our chemistry was spot on. We always celebrated together on the field,\u201d he said.",
    "He described the victims \u201cas great people who didn\u2019t deserve what happened to them.\u201d",
    "Hayes, the pastor, said worried families swarmed the local hospital Saturday night trying to find the condition of their children. He said serious crime is rare in Dadeville, and the small city is \u201csad, traumatized, in shock.\u201d",
    "Jacksonville State football coach Rich Rodriguez said in a statement Sunday: \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the family of Philstavious Dowdell and the other victims of the senseless tragedy last night. He was a great young man with a bright future.\u201d",
    "Dowdell also recently won medals at a high school track meet at Troy University.",
    "Counseling will be available for students at Tallapoosa County schools Monday, said the school district superintendent, Raymond C. Porter.",
    "\u201cThis morning, I grieve with the people of Dadeville and my fellow Alabamians. Violent crime has NO place in our state, and we are staying closely updated by law enforcement as details emerge,\u201d Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said on social media.",
    "President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting, the White House said, adding that it is closely monitoring the situation and has been in touch with local officials and law enforcement to offer support.",
    "\u201cWhat has our nation come to when children cannot attend a birthday party without fear? When parents have to worry every time their kids walk out the door to school, to the movie theater, or to the park?\u201d Biden said in a statement Sunday. \u201cGuns are the leading killer of children in America, and the numbers are rising \u2013 not declining. This is outrageous and unacceptable.\u201d",
    "Biden called on Congress to \u201crequire safe storage of firearms, require background checks for all gun sales, eliminate gun manufacturers\u2019 immunity from liability, and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\u201d",
    "The mayor said Dowdell was \u201ca great young man.\u201d He also said he is concerned about those wounded and psychologically traumatized by the shooting.",
    "\u201cWe are praying for them,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cWe ask God, if it\u2019s his will, to bring them back to their parents safe, so they can mend.\u201d",
    "Goodman said guns and violence are not a frequent presence in Dadeville. He said trying to control guns would prove as futile as trying to control illegal drugs.",
    "Dadeville High School had 485 students in grades 6-12 in 2022, according to Alabama state data. It serves Dadeville and nearby parts of Tallapoosa County. Like the rest of Dadeville, it\u2019s tucked away just out of view off a busy highway that runs from Birmingham to Auburn.",
    "Dadeville High\u2019s head football coach Roger McDonald said he would try his best to support grieving students.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s not a playbook for something like this,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the best you\u2019ve got to do is just love on your kids, let them all know how much you care about them, be there for them.\u201d",
    "\u201cHe was a leader, and as far as his ability, an electrifying player,\u201d the coach said.",
    "Michael Taylor, an assistant coach, said he met Dowdell when the boy was 9 and coached him in youth football. Taylor said the team was invited to Atlanta to play in the stadium used by the NFL\u2019s Atlanta Falcons.",
    "\u201cHe did some amazing things there, and he never stopped doing them since then,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the No. 1 athlete in the school.\u201d",
    "Taylor said he last heard from Dowdell on Friday, when Dowdell was seeking video of his athletic exploits. Taylor said he drove to the shooting scene Saturday night from his home in nearby Camp Hill.",
    "\u201cMan, I couldn\u2019t get close,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSo once I found out what\u2019s going on, I really I just had to leave because it was going to be all night.\u201d",
    "Taylor said he returned Sunday to see Dowdle\u2019s body carried out from the dance studio. He said he\u2019s not sure what he will tell other athletes Monday.",
    "\u201cThe first thing we\u2019ve got to do is we\u2019ve got to pray our way out of this,\u201d Taylor said Sunday. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no other way. And then I can tell you, they\u2019re all real close like family at the high school.\u201d",
    "This is at least the second time in recent years that multiple people were shot in Dadeville. Five people were wounded in July 2016 during a shooting at an American Legion hall, and a man was later charged with five counts of attempted murder, news outlets reported."
