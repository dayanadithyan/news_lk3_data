    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign reserves grew 722 million US dollars to 3,483 million US dollars in May 2023 from 2,761 million US dollars in April, official data showed as deflationary policy and weak credit reduced \u2018above the line\u2019 outflows.",
    "Sri Lanka lost almost all its reserve in over two years as the central bank sold reserves and printed money to keep rates down (sterilized reserves sales) including borrowed dollars from India.",
    "Gross official reserves fell to a low of 1,705 million US dollars in September 2022.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank hiked rates in April 2022 to slow credit and also stopped printing money after it ran out of borrowed Asian Clearing Union dollars from India.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s gross official reserves are made up of both monetary reserves of the central bank and any balances of the Treasury account from loans or grants it gets.",
    "The central bank\u2019s net foreign reserves are still negative after busting up borrowed reserves to suppress rates. By April (before the collection of reserves in May) the central bank\u2019s net reserves were negative by 3.7 billion US dollars.",
    "In May alone 662 million US dollars were bought from the market, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.",
    "No pre-determined level to stop Sri Lanka rupee appreciation: CB Governor",
    "Borrowing dollars through swaps and busting them up, was invented by the US Federal Reserve as it was printing money and breaking the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s.",
    "Sri Lanka received a 350 million US dollar tranche from the Asian Development Bank and 331 million US dollars from the IMF to the Treasury for budget support.",
    "The loans can be sold to the central bank by the government to generate rupees and spend. However, since credit is weak, not all the inflows go out of the country particularly as the central bank is conducting deflationary open market operations on a net basis.",
    "By allowing the rupee to appreciate unlike in previous episodes of recovery in an IMF program, after a bout of money printing, the central bank is bringing down inflation \u2013 in some cases absolute prices \u2013 and restoring confidence and easing the \u2018pain\u2019 of \u2018monetary policy\u2019 or stimulus.",
    "Though exports are falling, tourism revenues are also picking up.",
    "The budget support loans, tourism receipts less the reserve collected will widen the trade deficit. Building foreign reserves involves lending money to the US or other western nations and is similar to repaying foreign debt. (Colombo/June07/2023)"
