    "Says the newly proposed Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) is being introduced by Govt. in preparation to face imminent social unrest",
    "Notes it is a direct response to citizen\u2019s protest movement last year and continuation of it this year amidst economic, social and political crisis",
    "Says ATA is a continuation of PTA in a much more repressive form",
    "Stresses that new law will identify the country\u2019s common man as a terrorist",
    "Senior political scientist and constitutional expert Prof. Jayadeva Uyangoda says the newly proposed Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) is being introduced by the Government in preparation to face the imminent and inevitable social unrest which will arise in the country. According to Uyangoda, with the entire burden of economic revival being placed on the country\u2019s poor and the middle class, the country\u2019s leaders are already aware of an impending social crisis and are taking necessary steps to quash it.",
    "\u201cOne can read the proposed ATA as a direct response to the citizen\u2019s protest movement last year and the continuation of protests this year amidst a very serious economic, social and political crisis,\u201d he said. Uyangoda opined that the proposed ATA is a continuation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) in a much more repressive form. \u201cIt has another element that the terrorism that it seeks to counter is citizen\u2019s political activism,\u201d he added. Prof. Uyangoda made these comments while addressing an online seminar on the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) organised by the Federation of University Teachers' Associations (FUTA yesterday.\u00a0 \u201cThe Economic program implemented by the Government with the support of the IMF to revive the country\u2019s economy is placing the entire burden of rebuilding the economy on the country\u2019s poor, working class and middle class. They are going to create a social crisis through it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ruling classes are aware this social crisis will be inevitable. Therefore, they are now preparing to face it. It is in preparation for it that this new law is being introduced.\u201d he said.",
    "According to Uyangoda the ruling class are aware that as a result of this heavy burden on the people, daily demonstrations and protests on the country\u2019s roads will take place. \u201cThey intend to prevent this. Their undemocratic response to quash such events is to strengthen their capabilities and laws allowing them to oppress the people\u201d he said.\u00a0 Issuing a stark warning, Uyangoda said these oppressive laws enacted by the Government will turn the common man of the country into terrorists.",
    "He noted that the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) currently in existence which was enacted in 1979, was unable to prevent terrorism in the country and instead contributed to the flourishing of acts of terrorism, identified as terrorism in Sri Lanka at the time."
