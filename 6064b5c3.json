    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Net foreign buying into Sri Lanka\u2019s government securities has nearly tripled to 73,9 billion rupees so far this year, the Central Bank data showed, and currency dealers said offshore investors are gradually buying the island nation\u2019s treasury papers due to higher return.",
    "Foreign investors hardly bought any of Sri Lankan government securities as the central bank maintained the interest rates artificially at record low by printing trillions of rupees of money.",
    "The excess money was printed to lend a cash-strapped government to maintain higher state spending as the administration of then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa failed to increase the revenue.",
    "Foreigners also did not buy the government securities due to exchange rate risks.",
    "However, the central bank, soon after the country declared sovereign debt default, raised the key interest rates significantly and the market interest rates shot up to more than 30 percent.",
    "The central bank also allowed the rupee currency to reflect the market price by allowing an administered flexible exchange rate.",
    "As a result, the foreign buying in T-bills and T-bonds increased to 25.6 billion rupees by end of 2022 from 2.7 billion rupees when the island nation declared sovereign debt default. The amount has now jumped to 73.9 billion rupees as of April 4.",
    "\u201cThere is interest from foreign investors on the (government) bonds and it is mainly due to the higher yield,\u201d a currency dealer told EconomyNext.",
    "Another dealer said that some foreign investors who had already invested in the island nation\u2019s stock market shifted their money to rupee-denominated T-bonds as they could not repatriate their money easily due to restrictions in banking system to prevent large foreign currency outflows.",
    "Currency dealers said though the yields have now fallen to around 25 percent, the return is still attractive for foreign investors. (Colombo/April10/2023)"
