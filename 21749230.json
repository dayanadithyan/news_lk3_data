    "(Text of Media release Issued by the Presidents Media Division)",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the economy could not be built through the reconciliation alone and the economic development rate of the country depends on the attitude and commitment of the people.",

    "I believe that a massive development in the Northern Province should take place in parallel to the economic development program in the country. The economy of Jaffna completely collapsed due to the war. It has not yet reached the anticipated level of economic development.",
    "Therefore, we hope to work under a 10-year plan to bring the country to that stage.",
    "Therefore we have to get not only foreign aid but also aid from the diaspora to realize this end.",

    "Most of the people who joined the discussion spoke on those problems that required to be solved. There are many issues that could be solved within a short period of time. Although it is difficult to provide solutions for them this year due to the existing critical situation in the country, we would focus on them in the future.",
    "We have to work a plan to recover from today\u2019s economic collapse. We have to pay back the debts that we have already taken. In addition we have got to get foreign loans this year for the country\u2019s future. They should also be paid back. In addition it is required to maintain a foreign exchange surplus.",
    "Therefore, our expectation is to develop an export-oriented economy as well as a competitive economy. To achieve this target, we have selected some major provinces out of which the Northern Province is one. If that program would be implemented properly, the economy of the Northern Province would change commendably turning to be a major economy.",
    "Accordingly, our first effort is to see the agriculture in the North-Central and Eastern provinces being modernized. Our ambition is to get 06, 07 metric tons of harvest per acre from the paddy cultivation from Kilinochchi to Kumana area and in the area from there to Udawalawe. Thus, when paddy production increases in those areas, land in other areas will be available for other investments.",

The future lies with green ammonia and green hydrogen production. Most of it would come from the Northern Province and that can turn the economy of the North completely transforming to be a strong economy.",

    "Also, we should implement Trincomalee port development activities with the help of India, which will strongly affect the development of the Northern Province. Before the war, the Northern Province made a wide contribution to the country\u2019s economy. As a government, we hope to restore that situation and raise it rapidly.",
    "Reconciliation alone will not solve these problems. Poverty in the country should be eradicated and a better future should be built for the youth. Otherwise there will be no permanent solution to this problem.",
