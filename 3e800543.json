  "original_body_lines": [
    "Claiming that two individuals who came under tear-gas attack recently had died, the National People's Power (NPP) said they have reasonable doubt whether hazardous smoke was being used to suppress the protests that are taking place in the country.",
    "NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a news conference that NPP member Nimal Amarasiri died after being exposed to tear-gas attack during a protest carried out by the NPP and a security guard at the Colombo University also died after being exposed to tear-gas attack.",
    "\"Nimal Amarasiri, who was exposed to tear-gas attack, had vomited and fainted after an hour or so and died unfortunately. He did not die due to a stampede, attack or run over by a vehicle during the protest. He died due to a reaction to the tear-gas. A security guard at the Colombo University, Priyantha Vanninayake, did not die due to accident or shooting. He died in a while after being exposed to tear-gas attack. These are murders,\" he said.",
    "Dissanayake said they have reasonable doubt whether Chemical weapons or banned hazardous smoke were used to suppress protests and added that these suppressive moves should be defeated.",
    "He said the government must stop the suppressive moves and invited all to join hands to defeat these disruptive moves of the government.(Ajith Siriwardana)"
