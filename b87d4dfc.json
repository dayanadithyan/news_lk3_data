    "A Presidential election will be held next year and It is important for the nation to elect incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe for another term, UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene said.",
    "\"The incumbent President should rule the nation for five years if the nation is to be stabilized economically,\" Mr. Wijewardene told the UNP Bala Mandala meeting in Gampaha.",
    "\"President Wickremesinghe predicted the economic crisis three years ago. He predicted the economic downturn even before the COVID pandemic broke out. He has been able to stabilize the nation to a fair extent. It took ten years for Greece to earn some kind of stability after the economic crisis. However, Sri Lanka had moved towards stability in a short time. Therefore Mr. Wickremesinghe should rule the nation for at least another five years,\" he said.",
    "\"All parties should forget political differences and must unite to form national policies on behalf of the nation.\" We are happy to see some SJB and SLFP Gampaha District organizers joining the UNP,\" he added.",
    "UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara said President Wickremesinghe had taken timely action with regards to pastor Jerome after receiving information on a possible destruction.\" No one will be allowed to create disharmony, as timely action has been taken,\" he said. (Yohan Perera)"
