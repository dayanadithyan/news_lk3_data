    "Coming up with more staggering disclosures on the ill-fated X-PRESS Peral ship, Minister of Justice Wijedasa Rajapakshe told Parliament today that Chamara Gunasekera who had received US$ 250 million to delay the prosecution is a close associate of MP Nalaka Godahewa who was the minister in charge of Ports during that time.",
    "\u201cChamara Gunasekera is a fake name, the real name of this person is Manjusiri Nissanka and is an associate of MP Godahewa,\u201d the Minister said.",
    "MP Ajith Mannaperuma who is the chairman of the relevant consultative committee informed me that some officers attached to the Attorney General\u2019s Department had demanded US$250 million as a bribe to prevent Sri Lanka from securing damages for the tragedy. However the MP has asked for a copy of the case. Asking for a document after accusing the Attorny General\u2019s department is also an issue. The lawyers retained by the accused are going everywhere in Sri Lanka to collect information on the case. They were present at the consultative committee meeting and therefore I prevented those who were present from raising questions on the case,\u201d he added.",
    "The Minister who justified the decision to file a case in Singapore said it was done as the operating company of the ship is being registered in Singapore while the charter party company is also registered in the same country. \u201cThe hearing date was fixed for next month. The Singaporean Courts have advanced the date and hearing was held yesterday. This comes as a\u00a0 result of the coverage given\u00a0 to the issue by the local media.,\u201d he said.",
    "The Minister claimed that the debate on XPRESS Peral fixed for today is against the standing orders. \u201cHouse cannot debate on a matter on which a court case is pending. Debating on this might have a negative effect on the case which is pending. Therefore I would like to request the party leaders to rethink having the debate today,\u201d he stressed.",
    "Opposition MP Kumarasiri Ratnayake who responded to Minister Rajapakshe said MP Godahewa has been drawn to the issue in an unfair manner. \u201cWe cannot understand why MP Godahewa is dragged into the issue as he is innocent,\u201d he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriweardana)"
