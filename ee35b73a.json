    "\u201cWe are proud to witness his courageous and timely decisions with transparency, being one of the youngest ministers in the Cabinet, holding the most challenging portfolios of power and energy.\u00a0 During the recent past, we all Sri Lankans were experiencing bitter hardships to normal life in the face of prolonged power cuts, long and deadly queues for gas and fuel, etc.",
    "The introduction of Fuel Pass and provision of uninterrupted fuel and power supply revived the nation with renewed hope.

    "The CNCI also expressed hopes that the other ministers too would act in a similar passion, if there is any act of disturbance to the public and if the rights of the people are misused."
