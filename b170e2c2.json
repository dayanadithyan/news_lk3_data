    "With the Sri Lanka country statement to COP21 held in 2015, Paris being ignored by the \u2018Climate Change\u2019 bureaucrats for eight years, there is concern that the agricultural community is running out of time. The recent change in management seemed to show some promise by appointing Eric Solheim as the Advisor on climate change. Thus in August of 2022 the Sri Lanka country statement to COP 21 was submitted to him in the hope that he could initiate the urgent actions that need to be attended to. Sadly, there seems to have no acceptance of this statement by the Government up until today. One trusts that the stupid public statements like \u201cSri Lanka will take the lead in ensuring the developing economies have the resources to mitigate\u00a0climate change\u201d has been crafted by the bureaucrats and not the advisors. Now we are presented with another silly political gundu a \u2018Climate Change University\u2019. Who are these types whispering in the years of politicians, convincing them to mouth idiotic statements and make them look fools? In terms of climate change, they are compromisers of our farmers and our fishermen.\u00a0 They are guilty of not putting in place the official machinery, to prepare for the oncoming stress factors, driven by climate change. Heat stress to our crops and the loss of ocean productivity are the most obvious. A nation would respond to such a scenario by having its agricultural scientists focus on breeding heat tolerance into our crops. We do not need a university to tell us that heat was going to be a problem it was stated eight years ago in the Sri Lanka country statement to COP21.\u00a0 It said\u00a0 :",
    "\u201c(1) We are aware that the optimum operating temperature of chlorophyll is at 37 deg C. In a warming world where temperatures will soar well above that, food production will be severely impacted. We would request the IPCC to address responses to this phenomenon.\u201d",
    "If we are a nation unable to listen to its own voices or even the voices of others. What can be done to penetrate the echo chamber that politicians\u00a0 benefitting from earmarked funds have created around themselves? Globally, the scientific community are warning us that the crisis coming, we can see the\u00a0 wave on the horizon, but most people are still rooted in the dream that life will proceed as normal and\u00a0are willing to let the corporations and politicians, calm us by moving the deck chairs a bit more, for us to enjoy our ride on their Titanic.",
    "The oceanic levels are going up as a consequence of climate change. In Sri Lanka the current rate is around 3.6mm per annum. However, research published in February 2022 shows that sea level rise is accelerating and\u00a0projected to rise by a foot by 2050. If there was any co-ordination on climate change, we should be mapping out the rice growing areas prone to salinization. We should be accessing salt tolerant rice varieties into the national rice breeding program. We should be evaluating alternate crops for saline areas. We have the resources to respond, we do not need to wait for a climate change university to tell us that.",
    "Without awaiting the lucrative construction of a new university, could we not consider the request of the Sri Lankan Country statement to COP 21 to be considered by the line ministries today and action plans drawn up ? If we have funds for this new university is it not better to award the funds to existing institutions to respond to the on coning crisis.",
    "To the UN Conference for Climate Change (COP21) Paris 1-10 December 2015",
    "Sri Lanka is a vulnerable island in the face of Climate Change. An increase in the intensity of rainfall, will erode our mountains and create increased flood damage. An increase in the sea level will render much of our productive agricultural lands saline. An increase of ambient temperatures will reduce our agricultural productivity. We are in agreement with the view that an increase of the Carbon Dioxide concentration in our atmosphere will contribute to this vulnerability.",
    "We are aware of the great difference in carbon dioxide that is emitted from biological sources and carbon dioxide emitted from fossil sources. One has sequestered rates measured in thousands of years while the other in millions of years.\u00a0 Yet the cost is still the same. We would request the IPCC to address the relative costs of each.",
    "We are aware that the optimum operating temperature of chlorophyll is at 37 deg C. In a warming world where temperatures will soar well above that, food production will be severely impacted. We would request the IPCC to address responses to this phenomenon.",
    "We are aware that the critical Ecosystem services such as; production of Oxygen, sequestering of Carbon, water cycling and ambient cooling is carried out by the photosynthetic component of biomass. This is being lost at an exponential rate, due to the fact that these Ecosystem Services have not been valued, nor economically recognized. We would request the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC) to examine the value of photosynthetic biomass.",
    "Sri Lanka will place her development agenda on a fossil free target and will promote an economic recognition of the ecosystem services generated by the photosynthetic biomass. In this way we offer to act in a globally responsible manner as well as to contribute in creating a cushioning effect for the climate extremes that are before us."
