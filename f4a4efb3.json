    "Board members at Amnesty international USA including Secretary General Agnes Callamard, recently came together to support Sri Lankans to stand against the 'anti-terrorism' act. The recently proposed anti-terrorism act will replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). The international community is particularly concerned with\u00a0clause 4(1)(a) of the Bill, which, would introduce the death penalty for \u201cthe terrorism offence of murder\u201d.\u00a0Moreover, if enacted in its current form, the bill would provide limited judicial oversight while granting law enforcement officials additional powers than those they currently enjoy under the PTA.",
