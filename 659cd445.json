    "Recent tremors in Moneragala could be a worrying factor if it repeats and if the magnitude is increased, a leading Geologist in the country said today.",
    "Professor Kapila Dahayanake of the Geological Unit University of Peradeniya said one has to be vigilant if more such tremors take place in the area and if the magnitude of such tremors is increased.",
    "\u201cThe magnitudes of the tremors which occurred on Feb.10 and the 11th were around 3 . Therefore it is not a worrying factor but it could become a serious issue if more tremors are repeated and if the magnitude of such tremors increases,\u201d he said.",
    "Also he ruled out any connection with the tremors in Moneragala and the deadly earthquake in Turkey.",
    "\"There cannot be any form of connection between the tremors in Moneragala and the quakes in\u00a0 Turkey and Syria as Sri Lanka is located in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean plate,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe tremors can happen if a landslide takes place somewhere close by,\" he added. (Yohan Perera)"
