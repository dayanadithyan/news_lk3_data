    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka, still recovering from a series of financial, political and social crises that erupted in a singularly cataclysmic year, on Monday May 01 marked its first International Workers\u2019 Day since the South Asian nation entered a crucial reform programme backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "Supporters of mainstream and fringe political parties new and old congregated in various parts of the capital Colombo and elsewhere in the island to celebrate May Day. As is tradition, the events were less about workers and more about power \u2013 either its capture or its consolidation \u2013 with every party doing their best to project an image of strength and resilience against myriad odds, real or imagined.",
    "The United National Party (UNP), headed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, held its May Day event at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo. In a notable departure from convention, President Wickremesinghe addressed party members remotely, via Zoom, purportedly in a bid to keep the office of the executive prescient separate from party politics.",
    "Addressing the gathering, Wickremesinghe spoke of his vision of a developed Sri Lanka by 2048 when the country is due to celebrate its 100th anniversary of independence from the British empire. He also touched on the contentious matter of Sri Lanka\u2019s decades-old ethnic issue, which he said must be resolved by the end of the year.",
    "Wickremesinghe has on several occasions spoken of both of these objectives since he was elected president by parliament following the ouster of then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in July last year. Wickremesinghe\u2019s ambitious plans to arrive at a final solution to the ethnic issue by February 04 this year, the country\u2019s 75th anniversary of its independence, did not materialise as consensus on an India-backed devolution programme could not be arrived at on time.",
    "In his May Day speech, the president said he is committed to rebuilding Sri Lanka by following the path of his uncle and Sri Lanka\u2019s first executive president J R Jayawardena who opened the economy in the late 1970s after years of central planning and nationalisation.",
    "\u201cIt is imperative that we move beyond our current economic system and establish an economy that can achieve a rapid GDP growth rate of 6 percent to 7 percent annually. To illustrate this point, I have two examples: one is from the time of [Ceylon\u2019s first prime minister] D S Senanayake, where we had the second strongest economy in Asia and were even able to lend to England. The other is from the tenure of J R Jayawardena, where we advanced with an open economy, and Sri Lanka became the second country in Asia to adopt this system. After our success, China followed suit.",
    "\u201cTherefore, I am determined to pursue a new economic model that will elevate Sri Lanka\u2019s economy to new heights and foster continued growth and prosperity for our citizens,\u201d an official translation of Wickremesinghe\u2019s speech quoted him as saying in Sinhala.",
    "Former finance minister and UNP heavyweight Ravi Karunanayake speaking at the event said the UNP must work toward forming its own government together with all parties allied with it and have Wickremesinghe elected by the people as president by next year.",
    "Meanwhile, Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition party the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) held its May Day rally at the A E Goonesinghe grounds in Colombo after a march led by SJB and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa.",
    "Addressing a large crowd of party supporters, Premadasa said he is in politics not for power or position but to change systems. \u201cSystem change\u201d has been a popular if vaguely defined demand in Sri Lanka since the Aragalaya (Struggle) youth-led protests that emerged in April last year around the time the then government announced that it would be defaulting on its debt obligations.",
    "Premadasa also took what sounded like a thinly veiled swipe at those in his own camp that are rumoured to harbour crossover plans.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re not a group of people\u2019s representatives that are greedily salivating over government positions. There are people like that in today\u2019s political world. I have a clear message for them. Do not be two-timers. Do not plant your feet on every side. Stay if you want, or just leave, I say,\u201d he said to applause from the crowd.",
    "\u201cThere are no such two-timers. I\u2019m just saying, just in case there was any,\u201d he added wryly.",
    "The SJB has been dogged by weeks of speculation that an unspecified number of its more visible members were planning to cross over to the Wickremesinghe government purportedly to support the latter\u2019s IMF-backed reform agenda. While various party spokesmen have denied reports of coming crossovers, at least one MP \u2013 former health minister Rajitha Senaratne \u2013 has openly expressed his admiration for Wickremesinghe. Another MP has alluded to \u201cone or two\u201d members possibly breaking ranks. All this, however, was before all but one SJB MP chose to abstain from an important parliamentary vote on Sri Lanka\u2019s 17th IMF programme. A real, indisputable of changed loyalties has yet to occur.",
    "With one possible exception, depending on how things go in Sri Lanka\u2019s central hills. SJB MP Vadivel Suresh, who was speaking at a parallel SJB-led May Day rally in Badulla Monday afternoon, issued an ultimatum to the opposition leader. Suresh demanded an apology from Premadasa to a perceived slight on his people, Sri Lanka\u2019s Indian-origin Tamils, most of whom have historically worked in the plantation sector and live in dire conditions on wages widely considered unacceptably low. The Badulla district MP said Premadasa must apologise to the estate Tamils for allegedly snubbing them at an event in Madulsima that he failed to attend.",
    "\u201cI would like to say to our leader, sir, do not take us for granted,\u201d said Suresh.",
    "\u201cIf you need us to stay with you, come right now to Madulsima and apologise to my people and then we shall restart our journey. Otherwise I won\u2019t be part of that journey. There will be no Vadivel Suresh. If you don\u2019t apologise to my people, I won\u2019t be with the SJB,\u201d he said.",
    "Making matters worse, the MP also expressed a willingness to join President Wickremesinghe if he was able to raise the daily wage of plantation workers and resolve their grievances. He also said the president has been successful in containing the disruptions caused by the currency crisis.",
    "\u201cOn this May Day, we say to both the opposition leader and the president, I and my people would join hands with a leader that worked to increase [estate workers\u2019] wages and give them [access to the Samurdhi welfare scheme] and include them in national policy,\u201d he said.",
    "Back in Colombo, Premadasa said his party has no intention to work with a corrupt government, which he accused of a litany of financial crimes. This is against a backdrop of a call for a national government or an arrangement where the opposition parties could support reforms while remaining in the opposition.",
    "\u201cThis is a government that asked for commissions from the Japanese government, a government that paid dollars to fertiliser ships it never saw, a government that pays penalties for nonexistent Airbuses, a government that robs even from the X-Press Pearl tragedy,\u201d said Premadasa.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re asked if we intend to join the government. We will go to the government with an SJB president,\u201d he said.",
    "Premadasa added that there was no need to wait till 2048 for development, as, according to him, the SJB has the right team with the likes of MPs Harsha de Silva, Kabir Hashim and Eran Wickramaratne who have the vision to rebuild the country in the very first term of a future SJB government.",
    "Meanwhile, the Marxist-Leninist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) who leads a more \u201csocial democratic\u201d-oriented alliance known as National People\u2019s Power (NPP) \u2013 which according to at least one opinion poll currently enjoys a significant lead over the SJB \u2013 held its May Day rally in Colombo under explicitly anti-IMF themes. True to its communist roots, the JVP parade leading up to the rally was led by vehicles displaying Marxist iconography, with larger than life images of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and V I Lenin leading the way, followed by a portrait of slain JVP founder revolutionary Rohana Wijeweera.",
    "A sea of red was seen making their way to the event proper near Town Hall, where a platform for the speakers had been erected against a backdrop of high-rise luxury apartment buildings. One of the slogans on display read: \u201cLet\u2019s save the country from IMF imperialism.\u201d",
    "JVP frontliner and former MP K D Lal Kantha called for a new Aragalaya that unites trade unions, many of whom have been on strike against IMF-backed progressive income tax hikes, and the general public.",
    "\u201cSince everyone is under immense pressure now [in light of Sri Lanka\u2019s worst currency crisis in decades which triggered high inflation that\u2019s now on the decline], a single people\u2019s Aragalya is needed,\u201d he said, inviting the country\u2019s frontline \u201cfighting forces\u201d such as trade unions, student movements, women\u2019s and youth movements, among others to come together.",
    "JVP and NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, meanwhile, warned of repercussions of Sri Lanka\u2019s plans to restructure its domestic debt.",
    "\u201cBefore they restructure external debt, they have to restructure domestic debt. Total debt of the government is 27 trillion rupees, 14 of which is owed internationally and 13 owed locally.",
    "\u201cA third of this debt is to the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) and the Employees\u2019 Trust Fund (ETF),\u201d said Dissanayake, adding that 96 percent of the EPF is invested in the government.",
    "\u201cThis is the working people\u2019s money. Every month, workers in the private sector have eight percent of their salary taken as contribution to the EPF. That money is being lent to the government,\u201d he said, claiming that the government has either wasted or looted the money it loaned.",
    "\u201cThis is not wealth earned by the Wickremesinghes. This is the people\u2019s wealth, which they\u2019re attempting to trim,\u201d added Dissanayake.",
    "President Wickremesinghe, however, has insisted that EPF members will not be hurt by domestic debt restructuring.",
    "\u201cI would like to say that wel will not allow any harm to come to the beneficiaries,\u201d Wickremesinghe said in parliament on April 26.",
    "Dissanayake also took a potshot at the main opposition and other parties, claiming that they were all fixated on the rising NPP.",
    "\u201c[They\u2019re all] talking about us. There was a puddle of mud at Gunasinghepura. There too, it\u2019s us being discussed,\u201d he said.",
    "The ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the former behemoth which has splintered into several factions post-Aragalaya, held what had the appearance of a comeback event for the Rajapaksa family that controls the party. Party leader and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and organiser Basil Rajapaksa were among those in attendance at the SLPP May Day rally held at the Campbel Park in Borella.",
    "\u201cSome criticise us. In 2004, there were those who claimed that they held the remote control to the government. They\u2019re the ones who helped us come to power,\u201d said SLPP leader Mahinda Rajapaksa, referring to the JVP which campaigned hard for his presidential bid in 2005.",
    "\u201cThe SLPP will never be agitated. I\u2019d like to remind you all that we will take the right decisions with you at the right time,\u201d said Rajapaksa.",
    "The former president said the previous SLPP government, under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, had to contend with the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, but acknowledged that \u201cmistakes\u201d were made.",
    "\u201cWe had to start with COVID, from a place where the economy had collapsed. We must admit that some wrong decisions led to that. But we now understand where we went wrong,\u201d he said.",
    "Rajapaksa also told SLPP affiliated union leaders who faced \u201cproblems\u201d recently that the party will not abandon them. He was likely referring to union leaders in the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) who were recently sent on compulsory leave after a disruptive trade union campaign against IMF-backed reforms. These unionists reportedly included an SLPP member.",
    "Rajapaksa also warned that any undemocratic means to grab power will not bear fruit.",
    "SLPP stalwart and MP Johnston Fernando swore that his party will never allow anyone to illegally form a government.",
    "\u201cEven if you kill us, we won\u2019t let you form a government. We remind you that not just the next government, but also the next president will be democratically elected from our party,\u201d he said.",
    "The former minister\u2019s comment came against a backdrop of speculation that the SLPP, specifically the part of the SLPP that\u2019s in government under President Wickremesinghe, is divided on its support for him at a future presidential poll.",
