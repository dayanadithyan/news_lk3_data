    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Women contribute significantly to Sri Lanka\u2019s economy and the government is committed to increasing women\u2019s representation in parliament and their participation in decision making, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said in a women\u2019s day message recognising their support in rebuilding a collapsed economy.",
    "In a statement issued Wednesday March 08 morning, Wickremesinghe said the establishment of a National Women\u2019s Commission as an independent body through an Act of Parliament has been envisaged, while the need to appoint an Ombudswoman has also been recognised.",
    "\u201cThe Government is further committed to increasing women participation in management and political decision-making, and therefore has implemented a comprehensive program to secure an increase of women\u2019s representation not only in Parliament, but also in the public and private sectors,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIn addition, the measures required to present to Parliament, the Act on Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment have already been initiated. It is also envisaged for a National Women\u2019s Commission to be established as an independent body through an Act of Parliament. Further, the need to appoint an Ombudswoman as well as women to Directorate Boards in the fields of plantations and apparel have been recognised.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe, who once held the portfolio of women\u2019s affairs, said the government has already implemented plans to empower women with required skills based on equality, in order to broadly contribute to the country\u2019s economy.",
    "In December 2022, President Wickremesinghe proposed a new bill on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment to be submitted to parliament. In Sri Lanka, critics say violence against women is not dealt with with the seriousness it demands.",
    "Despite the island nation being the first country to produce the first woman prime minister and president, very few women join active politics despite more than half of the population being women.",
    "There are also only a handfuls of women at the higher levels of top corporates.",
    "Sri Lanka has only 12 lawmakers in the 225-member legislature. Most women politicians complain that their party leadership do not provide them them opportunities they deserve.",
    "Wickremesinghe\u2019s last 2015-2019 government enacted a law to mandatorily allocate 25 percent of the local government seats to women from 2018 local government polls. However, no women were given opportunities for decision making.",
    "In his 2023 women\u2019s day message, he said: \u201cI extend warm greetings on this International Women\u2019s Day, being confident of the support of the female generation of this country in its entirety, in order to facilitate the government\u2019s new reform program in rebuilding the country\u2019s collapsed economy and create a successful \u2018Developed Nation in 2048\u2019.
