  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The latest findings of an independent opinion poll in Sri Lanka indicate that, in March 2023, the leftist National People\u2019s Power (NPP) maintained a clear lead over the main opposition party the Samagi Jana Balaweagya while President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party (UNP) showed early signs of a possibly real increase in support.",
    "The Institute for Health Policy (IHP), which conducted the general election voting intention survey said that its latest Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) polling in March 2023 revealed little change from February, with the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led NPP at 41 percent of likely voters maintaining a clear lead over the SJB on 30 percent. The UNP share did increase two points to 6 percent, it said, noting that though this was within the margin of error, it might be early signs of a real increase.",
    "The NPP continued to lag a little in voter enthusiasm, with this reducing its lead over the SJB in likely voters by 2 percent versus all voters, the IHP said in its summary of the findings.",
    "During the four months ending in March 2023, the orgainsation said, there was also little change in preferences at provincial level, although the NPP took a clear lead in Sabaragamuwa over the SJB, whilst closing the gap in Uva.",
    "SLOTS lead investigator and IHP Executive Director Ravi Rannan-Eliya was quoted in the statement as saying that the March polling does not show any evident impact from the recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement, which is surprising given that SLOTS also showed some recovery in consumer confidence. But he stressed that any changes might be too small at this time to be picked up by the SLOTS sample.",
    "The IHP\u2019s own consumer confidence survey found that consumer confidence in Sri Lanka saw significant improvement in March despite pessimistic sentiment overall, suggesting the island nation\u2019s agreement with the IMF has lifted perceptions. The institute said there was broad improvement in consumer sentiment in March, during which the IMF approved new funding for Sri Lanka.",

    "According to the statement, SLOTS combines interviews from a national sample of adults (ages 18 and over) reached by random digit dialling of mobile numbers, and others coming from a national panel of respondents who were previously recruited through random selection. IHP estimates voting intent using an adaptation of Multilevel Regression and Post-Stratification (MRP), with multiple imputation to account for uncertainties in its modelling, exploiting data from all SLOTSinterviews to estimate voting in a particular month.",
    "The March 2023 MRP estimates are based on 521 interviews conducted in March 2023, and",
    "10,601 interviews conducted overall from 31 August 2021\u20139 April 2023, with a margin of error",
    "assessed as 4\u20135 percent for the NPP, SJB and SLFP, and 1\u20133 percent for the other parties, the statement said.",
    "As the March update uses a more recent data set than the previous update, it further said, there are small changes in estimates of voting shares for previous months. Additionally, the number of multiple imputations used in the modelling was increased from 20 to 30, yielding a small improvement in the precision of estimates of voting shares and of margins of error.",
    "MRP is a method that is increasingly used by polling firms in other countries to leverage small",
    "samples, most notably by YouGov which used it to forecast results of the UK Brexit Referendum and recent UK general elections. All estimates are adjusted to ensure the sample matches the national population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, geographical location, and voting in the 2019 Presidential and 2020 General",
    "According to the statement, funding for the opinion tracker comes from the Neelan Tiruchelvam Trust, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), the Asia Foundation, and others. The sponsors play no role in the study design, analysis, or interpretation of findings, the IHP said, adding that interested parties can contact IHP for more detailed data and results.
