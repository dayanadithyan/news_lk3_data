    "Conspiracies attributed \u201cto the deep state\u201d and their exposure seem to be the order of the day. Princeton educated sociologists, as well as populist politicians like Wimal Weerawansa, are examples of this genre of activists where they delight in writing about \u201cdeep state machinations\u201d. Has the American Ambassador, in Colombo, declared these \u201cfictional writings\u201d, so giving the authors someone who picks up the hat?",
    "Their writings are also part and parcel of \u201cidentity politics\u201d, neo-nationalist rhetoric, as well as the chronically atrophied politics of Marxist analysts who still continue to quote from Rosa Luxembourg or Antonio Gramsci!",
    "All of them eye the West with deep suspicion and actively engage in fear mongering for political gain. This activity even transforms into support and justification of the most heinous acts of the Russians or the Chinese, while being totally insensitive to the massacre of innocent civilians by Putin and his Wagner fighters, led by Evgueni Prigojine.",
    "The US, too, as insensitive as ever, shows no improvement from the days when the people cried, \u201cYankee go home\u201d. The US follows its concept of \u2018manifest destiny\u2018 and imagines itself to be the \u201cpoliceman of the world\u201d, while ending up being the \u201cbully of the world\u201d. These insensitive policies are intellectually supported by Ayan Randian libertarian thinking, made respectable by great economists like von Hayek and von Mieses.",
    "But the practical reasons for the military agenda are found in the enormous profits made by arms merchants, oil merchants as well as tech companies during any war, when governments buy arms, using public funds. The public gets impoverished while rich oligarchs, be they American, Russian, Chinese or Arab and Indian, get even richer and even more powerful. Meanwhile, Switzerland chooses to be neutral, and allows the oligarchs to hoard their money in Helvetia!",
    "The US insists on \u201cHuman Rights\u201d from weak nations, and blacklists people on mere NGO hearsay when it fits its agenda. It suppresses evidence of war crimes against its own leaders and its own soldiers. It props up odious dictators and topples democratic governments that it doesn\u2019t like. Countries like Canada, too, find it politically convenient and economically and militarily necessary to follow the USA, as they exist in the shadow of the big bully and fear the Russian bear.",
    "So, this bullying by powerful nations, like the US, applies not only to Sri Lanka, but also to other small nations that have nevertheless prospered. Small nations that are neighbours of Russia or China also have to accept a degradation of their sovereignty and \u201cFinlandize\u201d, a term that defined the Soviet union\u2019s relationship with Finland.",
    "Nation like Vietnam and Cuba (to give just two examples) were existentially affected by the US. Vietnam faced a full-scale open war and not mere \u201cmachinations\u201d. The division of Pakistan into two, and the conversion of the Western part of old Pakistan into a military-dominated state, at the beck and call of the US, had much to do with US foreign policy. But countries, like Bangladesh and Vietnam, have overcome all that and made progress.",
    "Vietnam has not stagnated at asking for damages from the West; instead, even while being Communist it has collaborated with Monsanto and other Western multinationals. Monsanto made \u2018agent orange\u2019, on orders by the US Army that used it to defoliate Vietnam\u2019s forests, destroy its vegetation and rice paddies. But Monsanto has advanced agricultural technologies, and Vietnam knows their importance.",
    "Today, Vietnam has set up a biotechnology lab, with the help of Monsanto scientists (some of the best in the world), and proceeded to modernize its agriculture. It has recognized that the power of the West resides in its control of technology, and moved to acquire that technology. Japan, China, under Den Xio Ping, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, have made major progress, using the same logic.",
    "In Sri Lanka, in contrast, the successive governments were infiltrated by local Lysenkos and self-proclaimed \u201cexpert advisors\u201d on agriculture. A number of \u201cnationalist\u201d news channels supported them, claiming to create a \u201ctoxin-free\u201d nation, dear to Champika Ranawaka. While Sri Lanka has extensive capacity to become self-reliant on food, their so-called \u201csync with nature\u201d policies destroyed Sri Lanka\u2019s agricultural sector (https://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2023/01/05/the_us_must_learn_from_sri_lankas).",
    "The JVP and other neo-Marxist groups, too, played major negative roles, e.g., in scuttling sugar projects in the Uva-Bibile area, and blocking foreign investments that consequently went to other countries. Their role in destabilizing higher education, and the latter\u2019s impact on scientific progress have to be factored into any analysis. So, we have a tropical country with good arable land, and yet unable to produce its staple foods, or its own sugar, onions, chilies, or even its tear gas!",
    "The country had a big lead in rice breeding, with its scientists leading the world, prior to the setting of the International Rice Research Institute in Manila. Their research provided the means to feed the rapidly increasing population of the country, preventing malnutrition and nearly doubling life expectancy. But misguided activists began to claim that low-yielding but traditional varieties of rice were more \u201ceco-friendly\u201d and also had \u201cimmense health benefits\u201d.",
    "In reality, they are less ecofriendly and no health benefits from eating traditional rice have been established; and what is established falls well within the gray area of scientific doubt. All the initial technical advantages that had been built up were back-peddled and Luddite activists, like Vandana Shiva, were presented as the models to follow.",
    "The methods of the \u201cBaas Unnahe\u201d and the \u201cKattadiya\u201d are cheaper than those of the engineer and the medical man. Appointing a \u201cparty man\u201d, even if he were a \u201ckattadiya\u201d became the accepted approach. An attitude of \u201ccutting corners\u201d",
    "to achieve immediate objectives, irrespective of industry standards, fitted into this scheme, nourished by corruption. For instance, Sri Lanka, when it was Ceylon, had safe railroads set up according to technical specifications, using stone beds and wooden sleepers to position the metal rails. It had an engineering shop, at Ratmalana, second to none in the region. However, within decades after Ceylon became Sri Lanka, rail tracks were being laid on bare ground!",
    "Similarly, Sri Lanka had immense initial experience in hydroelectricity and reservoir construction. This knowledge was not harnessed into Sri Lanka becoming a world consultant in hydroelectricity. Instead, a politicized Ceylon Electricity Bureaucracy (CEB) came into being, without a research and development arm.",
    "Instead of the CEB becoming an innovative organization, it became an Albatross that wouldn\u2019t allow the country to move away from commission-generating fossil-fuels. That benefited the corrupt politicians and their select bureaucrats.",
    "The CEB had no interest in the immense possibilities that Sri Lanka has on developing bio fuels from local inedible oils (e.g., castor, rubber seed) that can be cheaply and rapidly deployed. Its engineers prevented any serious analysis of the potential for solar and wind energies, until circumstances forced them. Even today, the incredible potential of heat pumps, to save electricity, has not dawned on the electricity planners.",
    "While the private sector moved ahead to set up dendro-energy generation, using fast-growing wood like \u201cgiricidia\u201d, the CBE put all possible obstacles, e.g. by not authorizing connections to the grid. That, too, has not kept pace with the nation\u2019s needs.",
    "The CEB\u2019s managers, its union bosses, and its successive minsters of energy, are surely not part of the Western \u201cDeep State\u201d Conspiracy, or India\u2019s RAW in action \u2013 they are a part of a national myopia and a resultant entrenched corruption. This was given free reign by JRJ\u2019s belief that \u201crobber barons\u201d will develop the country even if they rob it.",
    "Well, the robber barons have robbed it of its wealth, and then indebted it to foreign lenders and robbed the loan money as well! The sovereign-bond loans jumped up during the Yahapalanaya period when the Treasury-bond scam also happened. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and his novice advisors, failed to see that they inherited a bombshell from the Yahapalanites, and proceeded to ignite it by destroying any revenue sources by generous handouts, cutting taxes, and undermining agriculture, even while facing a pandemic.",
    "But the likes of Wimal Weerawansa and other Cabinet rebels got little or nothing from Basil\u2019s power, and so they loosened the pegs holding the Gotabaya government, without anticipating the possibility of an Aragalaya.",
    "If the \u201cdeep state\u201d actually came to take advantage of the disaster, by supporting the Aragalaya, it is merely profiting from the events. Sri Lanka\u2019s problems are rooted in its own irrational populist, nationalist, eco-extremist, and chronic Marxist ideologies. These support confrontation among employees and employers, investors and rural people, or among ethnic or religious groups, and claim that the \u201cend justifies the means\u201d.",
