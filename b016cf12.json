    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s remittances from official channels rose to 454 million US dollars in April 2023, up 82.9 percent from a year earlier, as more expatriates use formal banking network to send their earnings following the central bank stopped propping up the rupee and money printing.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s monthly remittances coming through official channels ranged between 500 to 600 million US dollars a month before the central bank started to print money to target an output gap in early 2020.",
    "The remittances in the first four months of 2023 also jumped 81 percent to 1,867.2 million US dollars compared to 1,031.5 million in the same period last year.",
    "The remittances started to plunge from the fourth quarter of 2021 due the central bank\u2019s policy to maintain the rupee around 200 per US dollar.\u00a0 Many expatriates sent their earnings in foreign currency via informal channels like Hawala and Undiyal, resulting in a significant reduction in the remittances via formal channels.",
    "The government has aimed at boosting the monthly remittances to an ambitious 1 billion US dollar.",
    "The remittances hit a record high of $7.1 billion in 2020 as many Sri Lankan expatriates sent their earnings in the face of Covid-19 lockdowns in the island nation.",
    "Remittances, however, plunged to 3.8 billion US dollars in 2022 due to the government\u2019s past wrong policies, though the government allowed flexibility in the exchange rate in March last year and allowed the rupee to depreciate to as low as 360 per US dollar.\u00a0(Colombo/May 13/2023)"
