    "The Basin Reserve wicket had its traditional green sheen and Karunaratne wanted to give his bowlers the chance to attack the New Zealand batters early.",
    "\u201cIt's a pretty good wicket, it's got something for the fast bowlers. We have to grab the opportunity in the first few hours,\u201d Karunaratne explained.",
    "\u201cOur fast bowlers found really good lines in the last Test, so I think they will do the same thing and give the Kiwis some troubles.\u201d Sri Lanka made one change with wicketkeeper Nishan Madushka making his debut, replacing Niroshan Dickwella.",
    "New Zealand were forced into a single change with seamer Doug Bracewell playing his first Test since 2016, replacing Neil Wagner, who tore a hamstring in the first Test.",
