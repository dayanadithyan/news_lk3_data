    "If the government gives me a chance, I will control the spread of dengue within a week without allowing it to become adverse, former Minister Mervyn Silva said.",
    "He told the media that if he was in power, he will talk to the senior officials of the Dengue Eradication Unit and the Health Ministry.",
    "\"What has happened is now politicians do not get involved with the programme. The current Health Minister is a good friend of mine, and I do not know what has happened to him. As a minister, he should use his power to control the spread of dengue. He should bring all the officials to a round table and give them only two weeks to prevent the spread of dengue,\" he said.",
    "\"The minister should provide the essentials for the programme. When I was in power I did that and only one person opposed. Now dengue is becoming an epidemic,\" Silva said.",
    "Former Minister Silva urged the government to open its eyes and act immediately. He also urged the government to give him a chance without granting any posts, salaries or vehicles.",
    "\"I will stop the spread of dengue within a week after having discussions with the relevant officials and with the support of the people,\" added.",
    "He urged the government to give him that chance to control dengue. Strict decisions need to be taken if people do not listen, he warned. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
