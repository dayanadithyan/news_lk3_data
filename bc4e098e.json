    "With reverence and joy the Ajahn Brahm Society of Sri Lanka (ABS) announces the visit of Ven. Ajahn Brahmavamso in May this year. All Buddhists in the country know him well as he has visited many times previously and held hugely attended meditation sessions at the BMICH. His last event in 2017 had 7000 persons attending.",
    "These sessions are deep in significance and of immense benefit to us. However, their gravity is easily tempered by Ven. Ajahn Brahmavamso\u2019s informality and constantly smiling, benign face. One indication of his informality is his shortening of his religious name to Ajahn Brahm.",
    "Ven. Ajahn Brahm will be engaged in three principal events during his stay here. A nine-day meditation retreat will be conducted in Bandarawela from 20 to 30 May for bhikkhus, bhikkhunis and lay persons, totalling 150 participants. A singularly unique forum will be held exclusively for professionals and business persons at the Galle Face Hotel on 29 May. The much looked forward to Dhamma talk and meditation instructions for the public will be at the BMICH from 7.00 to 11.00 a.m. on 30 May. Anticipating the large crowds that will flock to the BMICH on that day, the ABS has organised sessions with the venerable monk moving from the Main Hall to Halls A and B so all can see and hear him. He will speak in English, followed by summarisations in Sinhala.",
    "The important question that follows this announcement is \u201cHow to gain entrance?\u201d The AB Society gives clear answers. With reference to the meditation retreat in Bandarawela, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis wishing to participate can obtain registration forms by emailing [email\u00a0protected] For WhatsApp messages the number is 0720735837. The completed applications are to be submitted before 10 April 2023.",
    "The sessions for the professional and business communities are by invitation, sent out well in time by ABS.",
    "To participate in the session to be held at the BMICH on 30 May, persons are invited by AB Society to collect their free passes from one of the venues named below:",
