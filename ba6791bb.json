    "ECONOMY NEXT- Sri Lanka\u2019s Employment Provident Fund\u2019s real return was a negative 47.2 percent in 2022 amid high inflation and a currency collapse and in terms of the US dollar, a hair cut in excess has already been imposed, legislator Harsha de Silva said.",
    "The real interest rate in 2022 was 47.2 percent in the Employees Provident fund. The US dollar value of the fund crashed from about 15.8 billion US dollars to 9.5 billion, indicating a \u2018haircut\u2019 of over 30 percent in US dollar terms.",
    "When the late minister T B Illangaratne set up the EPF, he envisaged a return of 2.5 percent a year should be paid to the account holders according to its governing law.",
    "If the payment cannot be made, by a motion in parliament and loan should be given to the monetary board to make payment.",
    "\u201cWhat is this 2.5 percent?\u201d de Silva questioned in parliament on May 10. \u201cIs this nominal or real? In the 1950s Treasury bill rates were around 1 percent I believe.",
    "\u201cSo the intention of the Minister Illangaratne was to give about twice the Treasury bill rate.\u201d",
    "Global interest rates and inflation were low in nominal terms before 1971-73 until the US dollar collapsed against gold amid Fed money printing under then Chairman Arthur Burns to boost growth, now called closing an output gap by stimulus.",
    "Sovereign defaults were also rare or non-existent until 1980, when soft-pegged money began to collapse against the US dollar which was itself a fully fiat money by then. The first wave of external sovereign defaults in the 1980s came from Latin America and Eastern Europe.",
    "At the time currency collapses were driven by dual anchor conflicts of reserves collecting central banks (de facto externally anchored) which attempted to target domestic money supply.",
    "The IMF was originally set up by Harry Dexter White, J M Keynes among others, to minimize currency collapses and maintain a stable exchange rate regime when currencies came under pressure from independent monetary policy or open market operations to suppress rates.",
    "The current wave of currency collapses come from targeting domestic price anchor which conflict with reserve collections.",
    "In 2022 Sri Lanka recorded the highest annual inflation in the history of Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank.",
    "Meanwhile de Silva said when domestic debt restructuring is discussed, when questions are being asked about what is going to happen to the\u00a0 EPF and ETF, people should also know the calamity that has already happened.",
    "If inflation is 58 percent, the interest given is 9 percent that is how a negative 47 percent return comes,",
    "There is already a hair cut in terms of US dollar, he said. (Colombo/May15/2023)"
