The agreement, signed today (22), marks a crucial step in ensuring a steady and uninterrupted fuel supply for the nation, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) said.",
    "The signing ceremony took place at the Presidential Secretariat, with representatives from both Sri Lanka and Sinopec in attendance.",

    "In response to the on-going foreign exchange crisis in Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Power and Energy has taken this decisive action to ensure an uninterrupted fuel supply to consumers.

    "To tackle this issue, the Ministry explored various strategies and one of them involved inviting Expression of Interests (EOIs) from reputable petroleum companies established in producing countries. The goal was to import, store, distribute, and sell Petroleum Products in predetermined Distribution Dealer operated Networks in Sri Lanka. The Cabinet of Ministers approved this initiative.",
    "One of the key requirements for new retail suppliers entering the market was their ability to secure forex requirements without depending on the domestic banking sector. It was mandated that these companies source their own funds for fuel procurement through foreign sources, at least during the initial one-year period of operation.",
    "After receiving EOIs, the companies that were shortlisted were invited to submit detailed proposals in response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) document.

    "Sinopec, along with its affiliated companies, is set to commence operations in Sri Lanka within 45 days following the issuance of the license.

Ltd, Sinopec China Pvt Ltd and Sinopec Singapore Pvt Ltd were present on this occasion, according to the PMD.",
    "The deal with Sinopec-- a state-owned Chinese company --was reached months after the two sides commenced their negotiations and Sri Lanka approved a proposal in March to liberalise the fuel retail marketing in the country with more players from China, Australia and the US.",

    "In June 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers had green-lighted the proposal to open up Sri Lanka\u2019s fuel import and retail sales market to companies from oil-producing nations.",
    "In October the same year, the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Bill, paving the way for new suppliers to enter as importers, distributors and retail operators for petroleum products, was approved by the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Power and Energy.",
    "Later on April 26, a team of officials from Sinopec visited Sri Lanka in order to finalise the agreements and commencement of operations for retail fuel sales, and accordingly, the timeline, conditions of the relevant agreement and other concerns were discussed between the team of officials and technical experts from the Chines energy giant and the Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijesekera.",
    "It had been decided that the agreements would be signed in mid-May, and that operation would commence 45 days thereon.",
    "Also, the US-based oil company RM Parks Inc. and the British multinational oil and gas company Shell PLC had held discussions with Minister Wijesekera on commencing retail fuel sales in Sri Lanka in the first week of June this year.",
    "Wijesekera, joining the political talk show \u201c360\u00b0\u201d on TV Derana earlier in April, revealed that each company will handle 150 CPC dealer-operated filling stations in the local market.",
    "At present, a total of 1,142 filling stations are under the purview of the CPC, however, the corporation fully owns only 234 of them, the minister explained, adding that 450 out of the remaining 908 filling stations owned by private distributors would be allocated to the three foreign oil companies."
