  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka has decided to revoke the Bread Ordinance No. 13 of 1864, which regulates the sale of bread and prevents the adulteration of bread offered for sale.",
    "At its meeting convened on Monday (June 12), the Cabinet of Ministers approved a proposal tabled by Trade, Commerce & Food Security Minister Nalin Fernando, seeking the revocation of the ordinance.",
    "In a statement issued in this regard, the government explained that the decision was taken as certain provisions of the Bread Ordinance do not correspond with the regulations of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) Act No. 09 of 2003.",
    "Thus, the government has observed that it is needless to continue to implement the Bread Ordinance.",
    "The Cabinet of Ministers also gave the nod to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a bill to repeal the Bread Ordinance."
