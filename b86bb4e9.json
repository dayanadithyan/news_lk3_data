    "Opener Nishan Madushka scored an unbeaten century after left-arm fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka ripped through the South Africa A top order as Sri Lanka A recorded a comfortable seven-wicket win in the second unofficial ODI in Pallekele.",
    "The win means Sri Lanka levelled the three-match series 1-1.",
    "Madushka's 107 came off 85 deliveries, including 13 boundaries and two sides, ensuring that the three wickets his team loss didn't trigger a batting collapse.",
    "All-rounder Sahan Arachchige also contributed with an unbeaten half-century, his 104-rub partnership with Madushka seeing Sri Lanka A across the line.",
    "Earlier, left-arm fast bowler Madushanka, who was overlooked for the ODI series against Afghanistan, took four wickets as Sri Lanka 'A' bowled out South Africa 'A' for 175.",
    "Madushanka took 4 for 33 in nine overs, accounting for the top four South Africa 'A' batsmen, Jordan Hermann, Zubayr Hamza, Kyle Verreynne and Matthew Breetzke, with the visiting team reduced to 20 for 4 in the 10th over.",
    "Janith Liyanage then took the wickets of South Africa 'A' captain Tony de Zorzi and Dewald Brevis, the visitors sliding further into trouble at 29 for 6.",
    "Pramod Madushan castled Beyers Swanepoel in the 16th over with the score on 42 for 7, before a 111-run partnership between Tristan Stubbs and Gerald Coetzee brought a semblance of respect to the South Africa 'A' innings.",
    "All-rounder Sahan Arachchige finally broke the partnership in the 39th over dismissing Stubbs for 59, taking the wicket of Lizaad Williams in his next over with the South Africa 'A' score on 157 for 9.",
    "Coetzee and Tshepo Moreki added 15 runs for the last wicket, before the former was bowled by Dunith Wellalage for a team high 77.",
    "South Africa A 175 in 43.2 overs (Gerald Coetzee 77, Tristan Stubbs 59, Dilshan Madushanka 4/33)",
    "Sri Lanka A 178/3 in 29 overs (Nishan Madushka 107*, Sahan Arachchige 50*, Lizaad Williams 1/25, Tshepo Moreki 1/25)"
