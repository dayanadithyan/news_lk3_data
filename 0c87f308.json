    "The Colombo Lotus Tower has once again reiterated to its visitors to stop confessing their love on the Lotus Tower walls as couples continue to draw hearts and scribble their names to confess their commitment to one another.",
    "Officials from the Lotus Tower Management told Daily Mirror that the walls continue to be scribbled by the young visitors but when they are caught and warned by the security present, the visitors burst out in tears.",
    "However, the love saga continues and officials have begun educating the visitors before they enter the observation deck at the top that confessing their love even at a height is only destroying the property.",
    "Meanwhile, the Lotus Tower Management has launched an inquiry as to how a video of a couple being detained over scribbling on the Lotus Tower walls was released to the media without the consent of the higher management.",
    "The top management of the Tower said they were unaware of the couple being detained as they do not want any visitors being arrested but will continue to warn those who continue to show their romantic skills.",
    "The Maradana Police said that no couple had been arrested over such a matter as reported in the media.",
    "\"We received a call from the Lotus Tower officials that a couple will be handed over for scribbling on the walls but no such arrests had taken place,\" the police said.\u00a0 (DSB)"
