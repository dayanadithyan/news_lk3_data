    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Several MPs from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna including Johnston Fernando and Mahindananda Aluthgamage said that a conspiracy took place in the country, as claimed by MP Namal Rajapaksa.",
    "They said that the conspirators will be exposed to the nation in the future.",
    "Namal Rajapaksa, the son of Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and nephew of Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said that removing the Rajapaksa's from power was the work of a third party conspiracy.",
    "He told a Facebook Live discussion that every single person involved in the Aragalaya was a pawn of a third party conspiracy, and that the people would understand it later on.",
    "\"When you say Go Home Gota, the Prime Minister is in line to the Presidency. That is why there was a call for Mahinda Rajapaksa to step down, before Gotabaya resigned. Those who led the campaign were never non-partisan. They were aware that when Gotabaya Rajapaksa steps down, the next President would be Mahinda Rajapaksa. That is why they strategically had Mahinda Rajapaksa removed and the next Prime Minister was eventually made the President,\" he revealed.",
