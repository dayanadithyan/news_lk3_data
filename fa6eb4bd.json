    "The proposed Counter Terrorism Bill will make citizens of the country into slaves as it can be used to harass people, Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith alleged today.",
    "\u201cThis new legislation is more draconian than the Prevention\u00a0 of Terrorism Act (PTA) which was enacted in\u00a0 1987. A person could be held only for three months under the old legislation while a person could be held for a longer period under the new propose law,\u201d Cardinal Ranjith\u00a0 told a meida briefing.",
    "\u201cAny MP who votes for this Bill will be branded as one who does not love his nation and her people,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cThere is an internationally accepted definition on terrorism when it comes to legislations such as this. However\u00a0 the definition\u00a0 of terrorism in this particular Bill is wider and some\u00a0 harmless acts\u00a0 have been defined as acts of terror in this Bill. It provides provisions for the government to control protests\u00a0 through drastic measures,\u201d he also said.(Yohan Perera)"
