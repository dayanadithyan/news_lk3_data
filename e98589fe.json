    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security says it will NOT recommend privatizing Sri Lanka Telecom, as matters sensitive to national security could be exposed.",
    "\"Further privatization would expose the countries critical communication infrastructure / sensitive information to private entities whose profit oriented interests can compromise national security. Hence, privatization of Telecom is not recommended, \" said MP Sarath Weerasekera, the Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security while presenting a report to the Parliament.",
    "He said that anyone/organization who had been blacklisted/ helped terrorists / extremists in any form should not be allowed to buy any share and have any control over our national assets.",
    "The report further notes that the state can buy back the other large shareholder of Telecom as provided for in the agreement, divide the segments into sensitive & vulnerable, excess lands & buildings, critical infrastructure and the business.",
    "\"Whilst retaining the first segments effecting National Security, the state can divest the others, holding a major share through Private Public Partnership ensuring critical infrastructure is protected, and all government regulations are adhered to. This way the government can exit from doing business whilst making profit and ensuring National Security,\" the report further recommended.",
