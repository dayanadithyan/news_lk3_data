    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Ceylon Tea production has dropped by 16.13 percent in January 2023 from a year earlier to 19.14 million kilograms, mainly due to policy mismanagement and bad weather, reports said.",
    "The effects of a chemical fertilizer ban under former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s government are still lingering in tea farms and bushes are still recovering from the lack of nutrition. The fertilizer ban was lifted in 2022 but supplies were limited amid forex shortages.",

    "\u201cSome private sector companies got it after the ban but it was also a very small percentage.",
    "\u201cJust because the fertilizer issue\u2019s being sorted out, does not mean everything is sorted now.\u201d",
    "The first three months may not indicate the response to fertilizer De Mel said but a recovery is likely to be seen later, on a lower base.",
    "\u201cSo my outlook is in the second quarter, April, May or June should be better than last year\u201d he said.",
    "In 2022, Sri Lanka produced 251 million kilograms of tea and the new target of 2023 is around 272-280 million kilograms, with an expected forex revenue of 1.4 billion US dollars. (Colombo/Feb 26/2023)"
