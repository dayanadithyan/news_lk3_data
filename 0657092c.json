  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The International Monetary Fund and Western lenders should devise a clause to be built into future bilateral loans, instead of delaying programs to countries like Sri Lanka while they try to get China into the international default resolution architecture.",
    "Such a rule, called a collective action clause (CAC), already exists in the case of private creditors where bond holders have to re-structure if a majority agrees.",
    "Such a rule promoted for bi-lateral loans can help at least in the future.",
    "But there are other ways of getting around existing loans under IMF policies, when creditors do not agree to re-structure, like using a Most Favoured Creditor Clause that has been talked about.",
    "Western nations and the International Monetary Fund had so far not succeeded in persuading China to agree to re-structure loans of Sri Lanka and other defaulting nations according to Fund requirement despite several discussions.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s IMF program had been partly delayed pending agreement by China to re-structure debt along the requirement of the Fund, though the IMF has said several prior actions are pending.",
    "Last week President Wickremesinghe said 15 items had been completed. However Sri Lanka still has a surrender",
    "IMF had previously approved programs in several defaulted countries including Suriname and Zambia following so-called \u2018soft assurances\u2019 from China. But a re-structuring has not been finalized.",
    "This has led to the demand for a \u2018hard assurance\u2019 in the case of Sri Lanka. A Global Sovereign Debt Round Table has also been initiated where Western lenders are trying to bring China to the existing default framework, which is usually followed by the Paris Club of lenders and others.",
    "A more \u201cpredictable, timely, and orderly processes are needed\u201d now according to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.",
    "\u201cThis is the goal of the new Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR): to bring together creditors\u2014official, old and new, and private\u2014and debtor countries to discuss key issues that can facilitate the debt resolution process,\u201d Georgieva said on February 25 after talks at the G20 meeting ended inconclusively.",
    "\u201cWe launched the GSDR under the auspices of India\u2019s G20 presidency last week at the deputies\u2019 level, followed by an engaged and constructive principals meeting earlier today. We will further build on this discussion during the World Bank-IMF Spring Meetings in April.\u201d",
    "The US Treasury initiated the IMF in the immediate post World War II era along with the State Department backed by some European and Latin American nations as part of setting up the failed Bretton Woods system of gold linked soft-pegs.",
    "The US has spearheaded debt work outs as Latin American nations started to default from the 1980s as the Fed tightened policy ending a weakened monetary standard that emerged in the aftermath of the Bretton Woods collapse.",
    "If the US Treasury is hoping to persuade China in April IMF World Bank spring meetings, Sri Lanka will have to wait till May to get its deal approved by the IMF.",
    "Recent statements by China\u2019s Foreign Ministry indicates that the country is doubling down on the original debt assurance sent by the Exim Bank to Sri Lanka and it is in no hurry to change its stance.",
    "China has said it is giving a two-year moratorium to Sri Lanka covering 2022 and 2023. As a result Sri Lanka technically has no official arrears to China. China has agreed to re-structure its loans to Sri Lanka this year.",
    "China however has not directly conveyed it to the IMF according to available information. As far as China is concerned, Sri Lanka is the counter-party to its contracts.",
    "Though Sri Lanka is trying to get another letter, China has insisted that it has provided debt assurances.",
    "China is also calling on lenders like the World Bank and ADB to re-structure their debt. These International Financial Institutions, considered senior creditor, do not usually re-structure debt.",
    "It happens rarely for instance during the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative involving the IMF, World Bank and the African Development Fund.",
    "Sri Lanka has classified some Chinese lending including syndicated loans given when the country.",
    "According to officials who negotiated with Chinese officials their line of questioning seems to reflect a concern that China was somehow being targeted by Western powers.",
    "It must be noted that the US AID is now mostly give grants unlike in the Marshall Plan days. US money goes through other multilateral agencies like the World Bank which are insulated from debt re-structure.",
    "The IMF does not usually lend to countries which have arrears to IFIs (called the Non-toleration policy). It lends despite arrears to bilateral creditors in some circumstances governed by its lending into official arrears policy.",
    "IMF programs usually have a Performance Criteria barring arrears. However, in the case of default, it has a policy of lending into official arrears.",
    "However in the case of Sri Lanka there is technically no official arrears to China at least until the end of 2023, so it is moot point whether it applies to Chinese lending.",
    "Sri Lanka is still servicing its debt to the World Bank and other accepted senior creditors.",
    "There is a number of countries with monetary instability and Chinese loans that are likely to default in the coming months.",
    "The IMF would understandably like to be ready and not get bogged down like in earlier cases.",
    "One way out that has been considered is a Most Favoured Creditor Clause.",
    "An MFCC written into say Paris Club or Indian re-structured loans will ensure that if any special treatment is provided to China, the others will also get it.",
    "However it is also expected to serve as a deterrent to anyone from asking for special treatment in the first place.",
    "The IMF lent to Ukraine with an MFCC relating to Russian debt.",
    "Of course with US as the main stakeholder in the IMF anything can happen.",
    "An MFCC clause written into Argentina private re-structured debt failed to deliver due to several shortcomings.",
    "The IMF and other lenders should devise a clause to be inserted into bilateral loan deals which compels the lender to agree to any default framework under its sanction.",
    "That way when countries borrow from China or any other countries it will have to agree to any future re-structuring.",
    "The IMF could also consider making a bilateral creditor clause a requirement for all re-structured loans when it is helping it re-structure loans.",
    "That way when these countries default again, it will be easier to re-structure them.",
    "Under flexible inflation targeting to which Sri Lanka and other reserve collecting nations are being pushed into, with legalized output gap targeting (stimulus), defaults of re-structured debt will be inevitable.",
    "The IMF itself is partially responsible for sovereign defaults in several ways and should expedite its programs \u2013 as long as the soft-pegged/flexible inflation targeting countries that collapse takes reasonable steps to change what is within their control.",
    "The IMF was set up originally because the architects of the Bretton Woods soft-peg system knew that attempts to operate an externally anchored pegged regime with artificially controlled policy rates (so-called monetary policy independence) to achieve objectives other than monetary stability would end up in balance of payments crises unlike the pre-Depression, pre-Keynesian gold standard.",
    "First IMF\u2019s currently peddled \u2018flexible inflation targeting\u2019 is much more dangerous than the Bretton Woods itself as the peg is no longer the final backstop against monetary policy errors.  Mis-targeted rates can be perpetuated with depreciation or what is now called exchange rate as the first line of defence policy.",
    "As a result, the IMF bears responsibility for peddling an extreme impossible trinity regime to unfortunate third world countries without a doctrinal foundation in sound money.",
    "Second when the IMF declares a country\u2019s debt as being unsustainable it makes default inevitable by stopping all multilateral lending and scaring away other lenders who may help.",
    "As a result, even if the country hikes rates to stop money printing and restore the ability to make external payments, default will be certain. Sri Lanka made no attempt to either hike taxes or rates in 2021 or 2022 when it had some reserves in hand.",
    "Pakistan is now trying to fix itself after running down most of its reserves during an IMF program. But Pakistan has no bullet repayment debts this year. Though reserves are down to 3.0 billion dollars and a float has succeeded.",
    "With doubts about external financing it is not clear whether IMF programs will continue.",
    "Significantly, Sri Lanka also ran into currency crises in 2012 and 2018 within IMF programs, borrowing heavily aboard all the time during each crisis and not just when the country was running monetary policy on its own.",
    "This is a feature found in several programs of late. Argentina defaulted in 2019 despite entering into an IMF program.  Pakistan is on the brink of default within an IMF program.",
    "Sri Lanka, managed to avoid sovereign default during 30 years of war where billions of were busted up in a military spending each year, but defaulted in peace time, following a series of quickfire currency crises which ratcheted up foreign debt as the country faced forex shortages.",
    "Third the IMF also and has an obligation to help countries as long as they do the prior actions and whatever is within their own control to hike rates to printing money so that the ability to make foreign payments come back and reducing deficits.",
    "There are serious problems with the current default framework. External sovereign defaults proliferated from 1980s in the Latin America and the IMF was unprepared for it at the time. The lender is still not prepared.",
    "Under flexible inflation targeting style extreme impossible trinity regime, following steep depreciation domestic re-structure is now practiced even through the currency collapses automatically impose a real hair cut.",
    "It is true that IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis have to be pessimistic. Under flexible inflation targeting and related intermediate regimes, a country has no hope of stability and steady growth. Forex shortages, output shocks and more defaults are the path once market access has been reached.",
    "The lack of clarity on domestic debt re-structuring and cut off dates on what domestic debt if any is re-structured has pushed -up interest rates to unsustainable levels. In addition to DDR itself the lack of a cut-off date is directly responsible for the elevated rates.",
    "The fear of DDR has pushed Sri Lanka\u2019s interest rates to 30 percent levels and it has persisted for about a year. As a result banks are unwilling to buy government debt.",
    "Domestic creditors are the last resort lenders, especially in countries like Sri Lanka with exchange controls and should be treated as senior lenders, which would keep rates down.",
    "In earlier currency collapse episodes in the midst of the civil war, where Sri Lanka also  went to the IMF, rates have risen to over 20 percent, but have come down within a few months of a float and the approval of a program.",
    "Rightly or wrongly external and domestic investors get confidence from an IMF program now, and therefore everyone waits with baited breath for program approval even though external stability has now been restored.",
    "A look at recently defaulted nations show that they have varying fiscal indicators. Some have high revenue to GDP ratios, while others had debt ratios of 60 percent of GDP and deficits around 5 percent of GDP before default.",
    "These ratios are better than what is found in some developed nations with floating rates.",
    "What is common to all these countries is monetary instability from flexible regimes.",
    "Fiscal metrics dramatically worsens with each currency crisis and then the country defaults, especially if it has market access.",
    "Market access Latin American countries defaulted after 1980s, with no war, simply on monetary policy.",
    "A currency crisis comes from trying to control the exchange rate while printing money to suppress rates. In Sri Lanka money was printed until inflation went up to 5 percent, triggering forex shortages.",
    "Under an IMF program which has reserve targets, there is no hope of going into a clean float.",
    "Recent crises in several countries have come from liquidity injections for Covid re-finance and rate cuts as the economies recovered strongly after the pandemic. Pakistan and Bangladesh are examples."
