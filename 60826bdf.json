    "One of America\u2019s best-known newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst has said news is something that someone wants suppressed. The rest is advertising. Thus, news conferences, media statements, and speeches made at political rallies are largely advertising. In this modern digital age, journalism is to dive deep down below the headlines and tell the people not only what happened but also why it happened. While maintaining the traditional principles of fair, balanced and accurate reporting or feature writing, journalists also need to venture into the risky assignments of investigative reporting or feature writing and interpret what happened, who was behind it, and why it happened. This needs to be done in a balanced way.",
    "Journalists need to keep these virtues in mind as we join the United Nations on May 3 in marking \u2018World Media Freedom Day\u2019 on the theme of shaping a future of rights: Freedom of expression as a driver for all other human rights. In a statement, the UN says 2023 year marks the 30th anniversary of World Media Freedom Day. Three decades have passed since it was proclaimed in 1993 and we have seen substantial progress towards achieving a free media and freedom of expression around the world. The proliferation of independent media in many countries and the rise of digital technologies have enabled the free flow of information. However, media freedom, safety of journalists and freedom of expression are increasingly under attack. This impacts the fulfillment of other human rights.",
    "According to the UN, the international community faces multiple crises: conflicts and violence, persistent socio-economic inequalities driving migration, environmental crises and challenges to the health and wellbeing of people all around the world. At the same time, disinformation and misinformation online and offline proliferate, with serious impact on the institutions underpinning democracy, the rule of law and human rights. It is exactly to counter these critical situations and threats, that media freedom, safety of journalists and access to information take centre stage. The right to freedom of expression, enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is a prerequisite and a driver to the enjoyment of all other human rights. This year\u2019s Special 30th anniversary celebration of World Media Freedom Day is, therefore, a call to recentre media freedom, as well as independent, pluralistic and diverse media, as key to the enjoyment of all other human rights.",
    "Outlining the origin and purpose of the day, the UN says World Media Freedom Day was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in December 1993, following the recommendation of General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). Since then, on every May 3, the anniversary of the UNESCO declaration is celebrated worldwide as World Media Freedom Day.",
    "After 30 years, the historic connection made between the freedom to seek, impart and receive information and the public good remains as relevant as it was at the time of its signing. Special commemorations of the 30th anniversary are set to take place during World Media Freedom Day International Conference.",
    "May 3 acts as a reminder to governments of the need to respect their commitment to media freedom. It is also a day of reflection among media professionals about issues of media freedom and professional ethics. It is an opportunity to celebrate the fundamental principles of media freedom; assess the state of media freedom throughout the world; defend the media from attacks on their independence and pay tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the line of duty.",
    "Referring to the freedom of information, the UN says the fuel that drives this engine is information and therefore, access to information is critical. Freedom of information laws, which permit access to public information are essential, but so are the means by which information is made available, be it through ICTs or the simple sharing of documents.",
    "Information can change the way we see the world around us, our place in it, and how to adjust our lives in order to maximize the benefits available through our local resources. Fact driven decision-making can significantly alter our political, social and economic perspectives. Therefore, open and pluralistic media are, perhaps, the most precious when they simply provide the mirror for society to see itself. These moments of reflection are instrumental in defining community objectives, making course corrections when society or its leaders have lost touch with each other or gone astray.",
    "One of the world\u2019s greatest statesmen Mahatma Gandhi had said that freedom of the media is a precious privilege that no country can forego. While the widely admired former UN President John F. Kennedy has said that a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market, is a nation that is afraid of its people. As they say on this World Media Freedom Day, journalists need to be aware not only of their rights but also of their responsibilities."
