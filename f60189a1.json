    "Asks if rulers are now telling people that franchise is not part of sovereignty granted through constitution",
    "Questions if few state officials can be allowed to strip people of their right to vote",
    "Says must change politics where benefits are enjoyed at expense of tax paying poor",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress member parliamentarian Prof. Charitha Herath says the current situation in the country is most unsatisfactory. He said while former Prime Minister J.R. Jayawardene also had reasons to postpone polls, Sri Lanka now however appears to be under the rule of King Kekille. Herath made these comments at a press conference held yesterday in Colombo.",
    "\u201cThe constitution has accepted franchise as a priority. The right to vote is one of the three inalienable rights granted to the individual where the constitution mentions sovereignty. Are we now being told that it is not a feature of sovereignty anymore? Is the President attempting to remove this right through the Government Printer? Can several state officials do this?\u201d the MP asked.",
    "Herath questioned if the Treasury Secretary can inform the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence that he cannot provide the funds necessary for the military.",
    "\u201cThis is the first time such an incident is taking place in Sri Lanka. This is the worst fate that can befall a country. The previous President ruined this country\u2019s economy and the current one seems to have taken up where he left off. Even J.R. had a reason to delay polls. This is now similar to the kingdom of King Kekille,\u201d he noted.",
    "\u201cThis is a country where everyone pays taxes but there is a disparity in how the resources are used and enjoyed. We must change the politics that enjoy all benefits at the cost of the poor who are even taxed for the sugar they purchase,\u201d the MP stressed."
