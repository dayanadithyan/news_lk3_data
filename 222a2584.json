  "original_body_lines": [
    "Calls rumours entirely false and blames those linked to the Govt. for spreading them",
    "Accuses Govt. of attempting to spread false rumours about the SJB from its inception",
    "Asks media organisations paying lip service to the Govt. to take leaf out of civilised media organisations in the country",
    "Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has refuted widespread rumours claiming that a group of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MPs will soon crossover to the Government. Issuing a special statement yesterday Premadasa said the rumours claiming SJB Parliamentarians will crossover to the Government in exchange for ministerial positions and other benefits are completely false and have been manufactured and disseminated by those linked to the Government.\u00a0 \u201cWe condemn this false news with the deep disgust that it deserves,\u201d the statement read. Premadasa said the current Government, a shadow of the former Rajapaksa Government, from its inception has attempted to spread false rumours about the SJB as it is the only party that poses a threat to lumpen capitalists and regressive forces in the country.",
    "Accordingly, Premadasa claimed these groups are prepared to pay any price to harm the SJB and their latest attempt at it, is by spreading rumours of SJB MPs leaving the party behind to join the Government moved by their alleged greed for positions and benefits offered. \u201cIt is a false and baseless piece of news,\u201d he said.",
    "The Opposition Leader said the SJB and those groups differ as the SJB believes in the power of the people whereas those groups trust in the deal culture. In his statement Premadasa also took a dig at media outlets paying lip service to the Government, calling on them to take a leaf or two out of civilised media organisations in the country. \u201cWe propose you use the media in a manner which is intelligent and ethical instead of publishing any falsehood for a price,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Premadasa also stressed that while people cannot change the truth, the truth can in fact change people. The Opposition Leader stressed that this is a critical time for the innocent and helpless people of Sri Lanka.\u00a0 \u201cTherefore we express our displeasure and disgust at the Government which is engaging in deals, conspiracies and \u2018billy boy\u2019 politics instead of doing whatever is necessary to ensure the welfare of the people,\u201d he noted."
