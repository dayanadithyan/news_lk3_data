  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lankans of all faiths joined hands and observed two minutes of silence on Friday, 21 April, giving voice to their support for the Catholic Church\u2019s quest for truth and justice over the attacks that killed more than 260 people and injured at least 500 on Easter Sunday 2019.",
    "The human chain initiative, on the theme \u201cWe are Watching until Justice is Done\u201d, was spearheaded by His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo, who has been tireless in his push for a transparent investigation and demand for accountability.",
    "On the eve of the anniversary, he told Vatican Radio the human chain would symbolically unite St. Anthony\u2019s church in Colombo and St. Sebastian\u2019s church in Negombo where the attacks wreaked most death and destruction.",
    "So far, he added, \u201cThe government, the security authorities, the intelligence services, have not done anything much on this matter and they have tried to put the blame on the Muslims and to say that it is the Muslims who did it.\u201d",
    "But, the Cardinal continued, there is evidence and we have indications that the attacks were carried out by some fundamentalist extremists who were \u201cfacilitated by government sources and political parties in order to create Islamophobia in this country.\u201d\u00a0 The idea, he explained was to make use of this [Islamophobia] in their push for power by gaining the votes of the majority Sinhalese community, by fuelling anger against the Muslims.",
    "\u201cNow this attempt has been exposed, but we want that to be firmly and clearly found out.\u201d",
    "That is why, Cardinal Ranjith said, \u201cWe are asking for a fresh investigation, a transparent investigation,\u201d and the human chain aims to highlight that determination.",
    "The Cardinal of Colombo confirmed that members of all faith groups would be participating in the human chain.",
    "In particular, he said, \u201cThe Muslims have declared, publicly, that they are with us,\u201d especially as are the ones who have been instrumentalized by what happened, so they are coming in large numbers because things have been clarified.",
    "Reiterating that the attacks were perpetrated by extremists, the Sri Lankan Cardinal said behind them \u201cThere is a political force we want to identify.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, it is clear the authorities are unhappy about the human chain, he said and have done their best to try and stop the initiative by creating diversions \u201cby saying that some Muslim mosques are under threat from attack and so on.\u201d",
    "But, he explained, these are tactics they have always used and the people in Sri Lanka are well aware of what he called \u201cthis kind of false strategy.\u201d",
    "The people, Cardinal Ranjith concluded, will not accept this so \u201cthe politicians will have to understand that they cannot carry on doing things like that.\u201d"
