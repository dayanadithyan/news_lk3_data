    "Contributing to the development of the national education platform, SLIIT is offering new Bachelor of Education programmes, namely the B.Ed (Hons) in Social Sciences and B.Ed (Hons) in Information Technology. These programmes enable students to obtain pathways to meaningful and fulfilling teaching careers with strong 21st-century skills. The SLIIT B.Ed programmes are four-year full-time degrees that offer both a professional component and a subject component catering to students who seek a career trajectory as teachers. In addition to the above-mentioned programmes, SLIIT also offers B.Ed degrees in English, Biological Sciences, and Physical Sciences.",
    "The B.Ed degree programmes are conducted by SLIIT\u2019s Faculty of Humanities and Sciences \u2013 School of Education. All B.Ed programmes have received prior permission and approval from the Ministry of Education and the University Grants Commission. The B.Ed (Hons) in Social Sciences offers students a balance between theoretical and practical sessions on Social Sciences and Education-related subjects. The programme particularly accommodates those who wish to become social science teachers.",
    "Components include philosophical, psychological, and sociological foundations, economics, commerce, and soft skills. The B.Ed (Hons) in Information Technology caters mainly to students who wish to become IT teachers. Particularly with the demand for IT skills to meet 21st-century work, IT teachers are required.",
    "Additionally, the SLIIT B.Ed (Hons) in IT will support the government in facilitating IT teachers for school vacancies. Prof. T. Thanaraj, Head of the School of Education, noted, \u201cSLIIT has taken on the national responsibility by producing teachers. We offer a very effective and powerful B.Ed programme, especially our B.Ed in IT, and I believe it will be recognised as a flagship programme not only for SLIIT but set an example for the whole country. Today, we can proudly note that several of our graduates are now successfully employed as teachers in schools across the country.\u201d The B.Ed (Hons) in English produces teachers who are competent to teach English Language and Literature in secondary schools, including G.C.E Advance Level classes. Components include English language and grammar, teaching methodologies, academic reading, and writing, etc.",
    "Similarly, we offer B.Ed (Hons) in Physical Sciences and B.Ed (Hons) in Biological Sciences. An important aspect of the SLIIT B.Ed programmes is the Teaching Practicum. As a precursor to students\u2019 graduation, they have to undergo 12 weeks of teaching practice, which is organised at the conclusion of their modules. Conducted under Stage 1 and 2, Stage 1 includes teaching in a classroom and is observed by outside lecturers/senior education officers, senior teachers/National Education Officers, etc., to monitor their delivery of lessons. SLIIT also appoints a mentor for each student to support their abilities in a classroom setting. Stage 2 involves SLIIT Faculty observing the students in a classroom setting. The students receive instruction and feedback from faculty supervisors on their performance and delivery.",
    "With the Government\u2019s recent announcement of recruiting as many as 8,000 new teachers in 2023, SLIIT B.Ed graduates who are recognised for their teaching acumen are able to join government schools as teachers, contributing to enhancing the level of education across the country and filling vacancies in the cadre.",
