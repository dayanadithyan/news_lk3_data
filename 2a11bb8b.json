    "Sri Lanka is going to the IMF for the 17th time. The island suffered currency crises and output shocks after a soft-pegged central bank was set up in 1950 allowing the agency to engage in both exchange rate and monetary policy (printing money to suppress rates).",
    "A new monetary law draft brings back exchange rate policy (which was dropped in the last reform as open market operations were started in the 1990s) and also output gap targeting. (Colombo/Mar07/2023)"
