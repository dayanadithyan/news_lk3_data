    "At least 50% of the population is estimated to be suffering from some form of mouth disease, Deputy Director General Dental Services Dr. Ananda Jayalal said.",
    "Addressing the media he said the majority of people used to consult dentists after suffering from toothache, swallowing difficulties, or being unable to eat food.",
    "Especially, tooth decay, oral cancer, and gum disease were considered the most common mouth diseases in society. Oral cancer is considered the number one cancer in Sri Lanka and it is spreading faster among people.",
    "The main cause of the spread of oral cancer is chewing betels mixed with arecanuts and tobacco and the Health Promotions Bureau is taking measures to discourage chewing betels, as well as a program for the early detection of such oral diseases. Also, measures had been taken to promote toothpastes with fluoride.",
    "Therefore. \"We recommend the public consult a dentist every six months and brush their teeth after every meal,\" he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
