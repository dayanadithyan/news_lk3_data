    "An effort made by members of Parliament today to stop an argument that flared up over the use of unparliamentary language ended up with MPs using more unparliamentary language.",
    "The initial argument flared up when TNA MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam complained about unparliamentary language allegedly used by Ministers Ali Sabry and Manusha Nanayakkara in the House on Wednesday.",
    "\u201cI am not surprised about the language used by Minister Nanayakkara but I was shocked by the unparliamentary words used by Minister Sabry,\u201d MP Rasamanickam said.",
    "\u201cI express my regrets if the words used by me have caused embarrassment to anyone. However I am not engaging in cheap politics practiced by MP Rasamanickam. I have the humility to apologise\u201d Minister Sabry responded.",
    "Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa who intervened at this point said Minister Sabry should put on record that he used the word \u2018communal bastard' and then tender an apology. \"I see that belligerent MPs are trying to support you,\u201d Mr. Premadasa said.",
    "\"These bunch of donkeys do not understand a word I am saying,\u201d he also said in response to some MPs who jeered at him.",
    "MP Premanath Dolawatta who responded, accused Mr. Premadasa of calling MPs as donkeys.",
