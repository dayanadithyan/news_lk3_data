    "Rabab Fatima, UN Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS, said such partnerships were key to sustainable development. \u201cGovernments and countries cannot achieve sustainable development alone,\u201d she says. \u201cThe private sector can play a big role.\u201d With one in seven people now living in an LDC, \u201cWe need to build on the success of the Partner2Connect Coalition and encourage more investment to tap into this potential for success.\u201d She called the ITU-led coalition an important step towards that end and an excellent example of what can be done.",
