    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe arriving at event accompanied by CA Sri Lanka\u2019s President Sanjaya Bandara, and Vice President Heshana Kuruppu",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe shares light moment with CA Sri Lanka President Sanjaya Bandara and Moderator Adamaly",
    "In its standing as the foremost national body of accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) took the leadership role in facilitating a productive dialogue between key stakeholders, including policymakers, business leaders, and experts, last week to promote a deeper understanding of the economic challenges facing Sri Lanka and the solutions needed to overcome them.",
    "The houseful CA Sri Lanka CEO Discussion Forum on \u201cIMF and Beyond\u201d at the Galle Face Hotel, which was keynoted by President of Sri Lanka Ranil Wickremesinghe attracted some of the country\u2019s most prominent business leaders and c-suite executives, who were provided an in-depth overview of what\u2019s in store for Sri Lanka in the coming months, along with the expectations of the business community as the nation attempts to weed through its worst ever economic crisis.",
    "CA Sri Lanka\u2019s President Sanjaya Bandara set the tone of the event with his welcome speech, in which he elaborated that the CA Sri Lanka, as a foremost independent professional body in the country, decided to bring together all parties, including the Government, Opposition, professional bodies, and chambers, for a vibrant discussion.",
    "\u201cWe hope that this constructive debate will help us all understand the road-map for recovery and Sri Lanka\u2019s way forward,\u201d Bandara said.",
    "Incidentally, the CA Sri Lanka Forum was one of the first open dialogues since the country received approval from the International Monetary Fund for the $ 2.9 billion loan last month.",
    "In his keynote, President Wickremesinghe elaborated that everyone is responsible for the current crisis.",
    "\u201cThere are people who skip one meal. There are 500,000 people who have lost their jobs. Many small and medium enterprises are on the verge of collapse. What happened? Who is responsible? All of us are responsible for the situation we are in today. We must remember that,\u201d he said.",
    "Wickremesinghe said that by continuing to point fingers at each other, the country will not succeed. He noted that what matters to us is not merely the IMF program, but also what comes beyond that.",
    "\u201cImplementing this program is how we seize the opportunity for a more prosperous future,\u201d he said, while adding: \u201cAll I request of you is to make up your mind that we are going to grow and this is the last chance, and let\u2019s press the accelerator to the floor.\u201d",
    "Guest speaker, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya highlighted that Chartered Accountants are highly skilled financial managers who possess great talents and responsibilities. \u201cTheir commitment and support are crucial in building the country, as they generate income from the main institutions,\u201d he said.",
    "Adding further value to the vibrant discourse was an all-powerful panel discussion featuring representatives from the Government, as well as Opposition, professional bodies and chambers.",
    "The Government side was led by President Wickremesinghe and also included Foreign Affairs Minister M.U.M. Ali Sabry, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, State Minister of Investment Promotion Dilum Amunugama as well as Secretary to the Treasury and the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies Mahinda Siriwardana, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Senior Economic Advisor to the President Dr. R.H.S Samaratunga and Economic Advisor to the Ministry of Finance Deshal De Mel.",
    "The Opposition was represented by Eran Wickramaratne, and Dr. Harsha de Silva, both Members of Parliament representing the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, and M.A. Sumanthiran, Member of Parliament representing the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi.",
    "The professional bodies and chambers were represented by Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chairman Vish Govindasamy, Joint Apparel Association Forum of Sri Lanka Chairman Sharad Amalean, Bar Association of Sri Lanka Harsha Fernando, Sri Lanka Association for Software Services Companies Chairman Ali Ashique, Chartered Institute of Personnel Management of Sri Lanka President Ken Vijayakumar, Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing President Nuwan Gamage, Woman\u2019s Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Sri Lanka Chairperson Anoji De Silva, Sunday Times Newspaper Business Editor Faizal Samath, and Hotels Association of Sri Lanka Vice President Asoka Hettigoda. The panel was moderated by Attorney-at-Law, director of several listed and unlisted companies, and marketer Mohamed Adamaly.",
    "Sharing his views, Dr. Harsha de Silva, emphasised that Sri Lanka cannot continue to borrow and borrow and should focus on bringing in investments. \u201cWe need to get the confidence back, and that is what is essential, and let\u2019s hope we can find some common ground and move forward,\u201d he said.",
    "Eran Wickramaratne proposed for Sri Lanka to follow a more radical approach in combating corruption, similar to how countries such as Hong Kong have addressed the issue. Sharing his view, he noted that what Sri Lanka needed was an independent public prosecutor who would go after corrupt cases, because, when it concerns a minister and the Attorney General\u2019s department, there is always a conflict of interest. \u201cWe need to build long term confidence so that the country\u2019s direction will not be reversed,\u201d he said.",
    "While agreeing that everyone must pay tax, Sumanthiran noted that there is disparity in the tax structure, with the poor being forced to pay tax, while the imposition of the wealth tax has been postponed. \u201cIn taxation, there has to be a strict yardstick on fairness, which has still not been achieved, and that is an area that needs to be looked at.\u201d",
    "Sharing his views on behalf of the apparel exports, Sharad Amalean urged the authorities to make the ease of doing export business easier. \u201cCertain gazettes that supported the export industry were recently repealed. Please don\u2019t do that,\u201d he urged.",
    "Vish Govindasamy said that a Government is not supposed to be doing business, but unfortunately, there are lots of resorts, hotels, restaurants, and various other things that the Government in some way or another got into, and now they need to get out.",
    "\u201cSEOS have also gotten into the form of subsiding, and we cannot continue this. The years of subsidies are out the window,\u201d he said.",
    "Anoji de Silva highlighted that, while for many, the tax increase was the issue, for the smaller businesses, including SMEs, the biggest issue has been the increase in interest rates, which has resulted in many of them being unable to pay.",
    "\u201cSMEs are a contributor and not a burden, and they get very little assistance,\u201d she said, while calling on the Government to step up and help the sector.\u201d",
    "Harsha Fernando said that transparency is not standalone and is just one element in the anti-corruption drive. He proposed to minimise the separation between anti-corruption and decision-making. \u201cIt is two areas, but they should be merged into one,\u201d he said. According to him, in decision-making when procedures and the law are followed, then transparency automatically happens.",
    "Speaking on behalf of the IT sector, Ali Ashique, highlighted the brain drain and how it has impacted his sector. \u201cIt has definitely affected, and when the middle leaves, it is difficult to build new talent,\u201d he said.",
    "Ken Vijayakumar also acknowledged that every company in Sri Lanka was facing a brain drain. \u201cThe Government must give them confidence to stay and explain how it is planning to turn the situation around and also shed light on how they plan to revise the tax structure to deter professionals from leaving,\u201d he said.",
    "Nuwan Gamage proposed a national branding like what countries such as Bahrain and Singapore have adopted. \u201cThey have put together BOI, the Export Development Board, and the Tourism Promotion Bureau with the intention that a \u2018tourist today is an investor tomorrow\u2019\u2012 and we are proposing the same approach,\u201d he said.",
    "In relation to national branding, Faizal Samath found Gamage\u2019s proposal to be an interesting point, especially at a time when, according to him, there was an ongoing debate in the tourism industry about whether the country should be called Sri Lanka or Ceylon.",
    "The discussion wrapped up with Hotels Association of Sri Lanka Vice President Asoka Hettigoda disclosing that there has been no global tourism campaign for Sri Lanka for the past ten years, and the Government must take steps to address this matter and fix it quickly, especially due to the high-earning potential from tourism."
