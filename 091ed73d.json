    "Commenting on the proposal to export toque monkeys to China UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara said over the weekend that not only monkeys but even peacocks should be exported, if possible.",
    "Range Bandara who was responding to a question raised by media at a New Year festival said not only monkeys destroy crops but peacocks too cause extensive damage to crops.",
    "\"Those who oppose the exportation of Toque monkeys including environmentalists should go to Wanathawilluwa, Anamaduwa and Anuradhapura and see the damage caused by these monkeys and peacocks to the plantations and witness the losses suffered by the farming community,\" he said.",
    "\" Some political leaders and government officers always created monsters whenever the government decides to do something. Now the environmentalists have joined the exercise of creating monsters\" he added. (Yohan Perera)"
