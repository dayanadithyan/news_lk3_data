    "Sunil Ariyaratne who wrote Nanda Malini\u2019s celebrated song \u2018Nidahas Baila\u2019 got it all wrong when he claimed that no blood was shed in the struggle for independence from British rule. He claimed that no one was beaten, as Nehru and Patel were in British India and that no lives were sacrificed (as Mahatma Gandhi did).",
    "Mahatma Gandhi didn\u2019t really sacrifice his life for India\u2019s independence. True, Indian leaders were assaulted and imprisoned, but so were the leaders of Sri Lanka\u2019s independence struggle. Indians were killed, so were Sri Lankans, from before formal subjugation in 1815 right up to February 4, 1948. Tens of thousands were slaughtered. Fields and libraries were torched. Temples were razed to the ground and churches built in their place. Reservoirs and wells were poisoned. Brutes. That\u2019s what the British were. And that\u2019s a soft word.",
    "The monarch, at his coronation on May 6, 2023, will be asked by the Archbishop of Canterbury to uphold the Church of England and he will duly pledge to do so",
    "Now here\u2019s the problem. Both parties, i.e., the viceroy wannabes and the empire-salaamists can\u2019t get enough of democracy. They can\u2019t get enough of secularism. And now they have to deal with Charles\u2019 coronation which makes a mockery of both",
    "The 1815 Convention included a clear pledge by the British to uphold the foremost place of Buddhism. They ignored this immediately. They not only pillaged temples, they built churches and launched massive proselytization campaigns complemented by unethical conversion",
    "Sunil Ariyaratne got one thing right though. The \u2018sudda\u2019 left and yet did not. (sudda yanna giyeth nae nogihin hitiyeth nae). British diplomats frequently act as though they are unofficial viceroys. When they are not demanding that we subscribe to their version of our reality, they use sway in multilateral organisations to seek punishment for intransigence. There\u2019s insult, humiliation and caustic condescension.",
    "I don\u2019t blame them. A nation in circumstances so reduced that they operate in international fora as an adjunct of the USA needs some kind of validation. Having claimed that the sun would never set on the empire, it must be hard to accept sunsets. It must be even harder since they have to live with the fact that their current comforts derive from the brigandry of their ancestors who pillaged, sacked cities, enslaved and murdered people. Thieves have to conjure thievery and condemn theft to look good. They have no moral authority. Others do.",
    "I don\u2019t blame those Sri Lankan who still think, talk and act as though the British haven\u2019t left. 500 years of colonialism could leave traces of servility. Moreover, if you and your ancestors played Uncle Tom for a century, deriving benefits in exchange for agreement to inhabit the version of reality authored by the oppressor and, as was common, conversion to the faith of the oppressor, it is not unnatural to look to the \u2018mother country\u2019 and its representatives for succour of one kind or another.",
    "Now here\u2019s the problem. Both parties, i.e. the viceroy wannabes and the empire-salaamists can\u2019t get enough of democracy. They can\u2019t get enough of secularism. And now they have to deal with Charles\u2019 coronation which makes a mockery of both.",
    "First of all the viceroy wannabes are representing a monarchy which the empire-salaamists, well, all but salaam. Secondly, the whole circus is handled by the Archbishop of Canterbury who, we are told, will say that the Church of England \u2018will seek to foster an environment in which people of all faiths may live freely.\u2019\u00a0 In contrast, Article 9 of Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution (which ensures foremost place for Buddhism and pledges to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana) is effectively negated by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e). Nothing big-brotherly about it.",
    "The monarch, at his coronation on May 6, 2023, will be asked by the archbishop to uphold the Church of England and he will duly pledge to do so while also solemnly stating that he is a faithful Protestant. That faith, by the way, is not adhered to by half the population or more.",
    "The jocularity of these individuals and the organisations they represent notwithstanding, there is certainly a case for secularism and democracy. History stands in the way, though. If history counts, that is.",
    "The 1815 Convention included a clear pledge by the British to uphold the foremost place of Buddhism. They ignored this immediately. They not only pillaged temples, they built churches and launched massive proselytization campaigns complemented by unethical conversion. It makes sense, therefore, for a restoration the moment the British left.",
    "SWRD Bandaranaike\u2019s demagoguery and cunning (to essentially copy-paste the left agenda) aside, the angst that enabled \u20181956\u2019 can be traced to the deliberate, vicious and pernicious crusades against Buddhists orchestrated by the British and by and large consented to by leaders representing or identifying with other faiths or else went along envisaging personal political gain somewhere down the line. Don Baron Jayatilleka was an exception.",
    "Here\u2019s one example. The official list of public and bank holidays, 1910. Yes, 1910. Long before 1956. Long before independence. The Christian holidays: Good Friday and the following day, Easter Monday and Tuesday, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and three subsequent days. That\u2019s nine. Add the 52 Sundays and you get a whopping 61 days. Muslim holidays: Hadji Festival. Hindu holidays: Thai Pongal Day, Vel Festival and Deepawali (bank holidays). Buddhist holidays: Vesak. Get this: April 13 was a holiday: \u2018Hindu New Year\u2019s Festival.\u2019",
    "Now consider the fact that although there were Tamil and Muslim elites (English educated, wealthy, upper caste and of the Christian faith) involved in the formal independence struggle, those who fought and died in their thousands from 1815 to 1948 were almost exclusively Sinhala Buddhists.",
    "That\u2019s a lot of angst. \u20181956,\u2019 then, one could argue was inevitable. In hindsight erroneous on certain counts though it is, the sheer numbers and the extent and nature of subjugation were sufficient preconditions, sufficient in terms of legitimacy too. Eminently logical in comparison with today\u2019s realities in the UK a la the coronation.",
    "But what of it? History is not cast in stone. We can throw it all away, someone might argue. Throw it all away and go with today\u2019s reality!",
    "Two problems. Today\u2019s reality may change tomorrow. One can\u2019t really legislate for every changed reality. Hey, the representatives of one community could ethnically cleanse another (as the LTTE ethnically cleansed Muslims from the Jaffna Peninsula) and then demand, \u2018look, realities have changed, now re-legislate!\u2019",
    "Secondly, if history goes out of the window, so do any claims of \u2018traditional.\u2019 No history, no tradition, simple.",
    "Want to secularise holidays even as you show respect to religious faiths? Sure. Designate religious holidays and permit any citizen to claim three (or four or any specific number) per year as religious holidays (like casual leave, sick leave etc). Others work. Take it to its logical conclusion and we might have to think of a weekend that excludes Sunday and Friday. But no holidays for Friday prayers, no leave on account of becoming a widow or widower or a divorcee. No extra maternity leave privileges for a particular community.",
    "We are not a monarchy, but we have religions. There are percentages (without which we really shouldn\u2019t talk about that kind of thing). We can be a country without any religious community having to feel marginalised, neglected or underprivileged. Informed, meaningful and logical secularism.",
    "Now that\u2019s something for everyone talking about democracy and secularism to think about.",
    "Meanwhile, good luck Charles and better luck his subjects, his representative in Sri Lanka included. And Sunil Ariyaratne could write a new song about Sri Lanka."
