    "Keeping the big picture in focus and strictly sticking to a roadmap of economic stability and growth, President Ranil Wickremesinghe last week questioned whether the implementation of economic reforms aimed at easing the burdens on the masses \u2018a fault\u2019 as some groups claim it to be.",
    "Urging the entire nation to rally round to create policy-based frameworks through collaborative discourses in order for the country and its people to be better off in the future, the President said,\u201d Unfortunately, some groups involved in traditional politics are actively working to hinder our economic revival. They are spreading false information about our reform agenda and intentionally misleading the public with claims that we are selling off the country,\u201d",
    "\u201cThroughout history, these groups have continuously resorted to fear-mongering tactics, falsely asserting that our actions are driven by a desire to sell out our nation. They have deceived many Sri Lankans in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and even the 1980s, instilling an irrational fear of the country being sold out. From then until now, these groups have disrupted real progress for economic reform by perpetuating this slogan of \u201cselling the country\u201d, he said.He made these remarks while making a special statement to the nation on the \u2018National Transformation Roadmap\u2019 designed for the country.",
    "The President went on saying, \u201cI am confident that you will no longer be deceived by such slogans. It is imperative for all of us to work diligently and to totally devote ourselves for the upliftment of our country. Our objective is to transform into a fully developed nation on the global stage by 2048. If we fail to align our economy with the modern world and the latest trends in technology, we will regress. If we don\u2019t bring in reforms now, the consequence of such failure will perpetuate the country in an economic malaise. Let us forge ahead and shape our economy in a way that enables us to compete on the global stage. Let us carry out the necessary economic reforms for the greater good of our nation.",
    "\u201cThrough these economic reforms, our aim is to rectify misguided policies, programmes, and projects. Rebuilding a bankrupt nation cannot be achieved by using traditional methods. We must adopt a fresh approach and embark on a new journey of transformation.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe cost of living for all Sri Lankans will decrease, and our standards of living will rise. Is that a fault? Is it tantamount to selling our country? These reforms generate new opportunities for businesses to grow and thrive, ranging from small-scale enterprises to large-scale ventures. Is that a fault? Is that about selling the country?",
    "\u201cWe are working to provide necessary relief and basic essentials to the poor and the most vulnerable segments of our society. Is that a fault? Is that a betrayal of our country?\u201d",
    "\u201cThe burden of covering losses incurred by state owned enterprises will no longer be placed on the people. Is that a fault? Does it lead to sale of the country?\u201d",
    "\u201cA culture of accountability and transparency is being fostered. Is that a fault? Does that mean the country is being sold? We are working to make Sri Lanka one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing nations. Is that a fault? Does that imply that the country is for sale?",
    "\u201cThe implementation of our economic reforms serves only to achieve sustainable development and prosperity in our country. Through these reforms, we will accelerate Sri Lanka\u2019s modernization, expand our markets and encourage greater contributions from the international community towards our development.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe acknowledge that this journey is not an easy one, and we anticipate numerous challenges along the way. However, we are determined to overcome these obstacles. Our government is always committed to acting in the best interests of our country,\u201d the President said.",
