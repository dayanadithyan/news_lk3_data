    "United National Party ( UNP) MP Vajira Abeywardane said Sri Lankan people should elect President Ranil Wickremesinghe uncontested for another term.",
    "Mr. Abeywardane who is believed to be a close confidant of the President said the possible rival candidates of Mr. Wickremesinghe could not even think of how to resuscitate the economy and make Sri Lanka a country to be reckoned with in the global context.",
    "\u201cThe president took over a country that remained engulfed in public unrest with petrol lines, demonstrations and food shortages. People were quarreling in queues for purchasing gas and fuel. Farmers were protesting with their agricultural implements. But, he brought normalcy back within a short time after taking over power. Therefore, people should elect him uncontested for the next term in my view,\u201d Mr. Abeywardane said.",
    "\u201cThe President should contest the next election. If he is in the fray, people should elect him as a national asset,\u201d he added. (Kelum Bandara)"
