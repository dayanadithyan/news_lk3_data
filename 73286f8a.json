    "As per Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the Maritime Rescue Coordination Center (MRCC) Colombo established at the naval headquarters is responsible for coordinating and facilitating maritime search and rescue operations in its designated region as well as neighbouring regions.",

    "Having reached the location, the Sri Lanka Navy divers meticulously searched for air pockets within the upturned vessel, hoping to find any survivors.
