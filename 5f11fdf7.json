    "The Ministry of Justice yesterday said it will welcome public proposals and suggestions on the proposed Anti-Terrorism draft Bill. The Ministry said any party interested in the proposed legislation can submit their ideas to the Ministry for consideration.",
    "According to the Ministry, persons and groups intending to submit proposals must inform their expression of interest to the Ministry in order to allocate a time and date for the discussion with the Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Ministry officials. The expression of interest must be submitted to the Ministry before 12 June either via email to [email\u00a0protected] or via fax to 0112470822. The discussions will take place on 14, 15 and 16 where those who expressed their interest will be able to discuss their ideas and concerns with the subject Minister and officials.",
    "In May, the Ministry also called for proposals from members of the public and civil society groups on the newly proposed anti-terror law. \u201cTaking those suggestions and ideas into consideration, the new draft bill is to be prepared and discussions will be held with relevant parties,\u201d the Ministry said.",
    "Minister Rajapakshe delayed the presentation of the bill in parliament in the last week of April after various persons and groups raised their concerns and alarm about certain provisions within the proposed bill. There were heightened calls for amendments to be applied before it is tabled in Parliament.",
    "Accordingly, Rajapakshe told Parliament the tabling of the bill has been delayed until a broader consensus is reached. The Minister said the Government does not wish to rush the process and will only present the proposed bill after making the necessary amendments."
