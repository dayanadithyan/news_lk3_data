    "We do not have the means to import essential food stuffs, fuel and gas and essential medicines. Our Minister of Health is calling on the medical fraternity to limit surgeries to do only essential ones. What that worthy means by this, it is hard to understand, as doctors perform surgeries only when all other options run out.",
    "The basic salary of an ordinary worker in the country is less than Rs. 35,000/-, providing two square meals for a family of four costs around the same price. This leaves no funds for medicines education, travel, clothing etc.",
