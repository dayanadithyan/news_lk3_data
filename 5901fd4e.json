    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings said it has confirmed Citibank N.A. Colombo Branch\u2019s (CitiSL) National Long-Term Rating at \u2018AAA(lka)\u2019 with a stable Outlook.",
    "\u201cCitiSL\u2019s rating reflects Fitch\u2019s expectation of a high probability of support from the head office Citibank N.A. (Citi, A+/Stable/a), if required,\u201d the rating agency said.",
    "Fitch said, that Citi\u2019s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is significantly higher than Sri Lanka\u2019s Long-Term Local- Currency IDR of \u2018CC\u2019, and the branch\u2019s support-driven credit profile is among the strongest",
    "\u201cThis results in CitiSL\u2019s rating being at the highest end of the National Rating scale for Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Fitch Affirms Citibank N.A. \u2013 Colombo Branch at \u2018AAA(lka)\u2019; Outlook Stable",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 29 Mar 2023: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Citibank N.A. \u2013 Colombo Branch\u2019s (CitiSL) National Long-Term Rating at \u2018AAA(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable.",
    "Parental Support: CitiSL\u2019s rating reflects Fitch\u2019s expectation of a high probability of support from the head office Citibank N.A. (Citi, A+/Stable/a), if required. This would be subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka, given CitiSL\u2019s status as a branch of Citi \u2013 being part of the same legal entity. Fitch\u2019s opinion of a high probability of support also stems from the alignment of CitiSL\u2019s objectives and strong operational integration with Citigroup. The branch, at only approximately 0.01% of Citibank\u2019s total assets, implies that support would not be material to Citi.",
    "Citi\u2019s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is significantly higher than Sri Lanka\u2019s Long-Term Local- Currency IDR of \u2018CC\u2019, and the branch\u2019s support-driven credit profile is among the strongest of rated domestic entities. This results in CitiSL\u2019s rating being at the highest end of the National Rating scale for Sri Lanka.",
    "Liquidity Buffers: CitiSL\u2019s liquidity coverage ratio of 624% at end-2022 is complemented by access to funding from Citi, if required. CitiSL has limited its exposure to government securities, with the majority of the branch\u2019s excess liquidity held with the central bank and in the form of placements with banks. These balances and cash accounted for about 63% of its total assets at end-December 2022, covering nearly 96% of its deposit obligations.",
    "Capital Ratios Above Peers: CitiSL\u2019s CET 1 capital ratio of 27% at end-2022 (excluding 2022 profit) was well above local peers, supported partly in recent years by restrictions on repatriation of profit and the bank\u2019s shift towards assets with low risk weights, like cash and balances with the central bank and other banks. We expect CitiSL to maintain CET1 ratios above 20% over the rating horizon.",
    "Asset-Quality Risks Manageable: CitiSL\u2019s operating profit/risk-weighted Assets (OP/RWA) improved to 12.4% in 2022 from 5.0% in 2021 on wider interest margins, driven by higher yields on loans and treasury bills and a sharp rise in low-cost deposits. Wider margins more than offset pressures from higher credit costs due to a rise in Stage 2 exposures.",
    "CitiSL has maintained zero non-performing loans since 2009 despite the challenging operating environment, which supports our view that asset-quality risks are manageable \u2013 given the bank\u2019s selective exposures limited to top-tier local and multinational corporates and financial institutions.",
    "Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:",
    "CitiSL\u2019s rating would most likely be downgraded on material changes to Fitch\u2019s expectation of support from Citibank, N.A., such as a change in the branch\u2019s legal status or the branch being divested. A further downgrade of the sovereign\u2019s Long-Term Local-Currency IDR or other developments that affect the branch\u2019s ability to service its obligations could also lead to a multiple-notch downgrade of CitiSL\u2019s National Rating.",
    "Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:",
    "There is no rating upside for the National Long-Term Rating, as it is already at the highest point on the scale."
