    "All Island School Van Operators' Association (AISVOA) Chairman Malsiri de Silva said today that they would reduce school van fares if the government reduces fuel prices by a significant margin.",
    "Even though fuel prices have dropped, he said vehicle spare parts, tyres, tubes, lubricants, and other accessories still remain high.",
    "However, we would like to request the parents discuss the school van fare reductions with the van operators, he said.",
    "\"With the fuel price increase, the prices of all spare parts and other accessories had gone up three times their original prices. Therefore, we cannot think of a common fare reduction,\" Silva said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
