    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s spot market has become active after the central bank reduced a surrender requirement leaving more dollars to be used in the banking system and a trading band was also widened.",
    "The rupee opened around 360/365 to the US dollar and business was done around 356 in intra-day trading, dealers said.",
    "The spot US dollar closed still wide around 350/357 to the dollar.",
    "On Monday several banks sold excess dollars to the central bank at a little higher levels, dealer said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee collapsed in March 2023 and the float failed due to a surrender rule where banks were asked to sell 50 percent of their export receipts and the central bank creating new money.",
    "A float involves suspending all convertibility. A surrender rule is a \u2018strong side\u2019 convertibility undertaking which weakens a peg.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s spot market died almost two years ago as the central bank printed large volume of money to mis-target rates and create unsustainable outflows.",
    "However from April 2022 rates were hiked and money printing was gradually stopped. Since then a peg or around 360/370 to the US dollar was maintained with the surrender rule preventing the currency from appreciating despite private credit becoming negative.",
    "Sri Lanka is expecting funds from an International Monetary Fund after certain prior actions are completed and China agrees to re-structure debt.",
    "The IMF usually does not give any money until monetary stability has been restored by halting money printing (usually through a float) and using reserves for imports are stopped. Instead a pegged central bank is made to collect reserves.",
    "Related IMF should approve Sri Lanka deal, devise bi-lateral debt-restructuring clause",
    "However due to lack of a consistent policy (either a hard peg or a clean float) such central banks end up in trouble as soon as the economy recovers by trying to operate a policy rate without floating exchange rate. (Colombo/Feb29/2023)"
