  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne rubbished speculation that key members of the party plan to cross over to the government, even as other party seniors continued to give mixed signals amid allegations from the party leader that the government was attempting to buy opposition MPs.",
    "In a telephone interview with EconomyNext on Monday April 03, Wickramaratne dismissed media reports of potential crossovers as \u201cridiculous\u201d \u201crubbish\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d, claiming that such reports raise questions about the credibility of the media rather than that of the individuals named.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t waste time answering such ridiculous questions,\u201d he said. A straight \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d response, it seemed, was not forthcoming. Other prominent SJBers have also resorted to ad hominem attacks on the media raising questions on opposition MPs joining the government in a time of crisis, a matter that most would consider important.",
    "He also said he cannot \u201cspeak for the whole world\u201d when asked if no colleagues of his in the SJB were planning to support the government.",
    "SJB MP Rajitha Senaratne speaking to reporters in Kalutara on Sunday April 02 said there was an opinion within the SJB that there is no difference between President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s economic development agenda and that of the SJB, a party that broke off from Wickremesinghe\u2019 United National Party (UNP) in the run-up to the 2020 parliamentary elections.",
    "An SJB government would be no different to Wickremesinghe\u2019s, who is working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) subject to its conditions, said Senaratne.",
    "\u201cToday we can see some major progress right before our eyes,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cpeople\u201d speak supportively of the president.",
    "\u201cWe must go with public consensus, not with the views of political parties. We must come to some understanding on the way in which we should come to an agreement,\u201d he said.",
    "SJB frontliner and former MP Hirunika Premachandra, who until has been one of Wickremesinghe\u2019s harshest critics, told reporters last week that the president was right to go to the IMF because \u201cif we were there, we would\u2019ve done the same.\u201d",
    "Opposition and SJB leader Sajith Premadasa, meanwhile, has accused the government of attempting to buy opposition MPs. Speaking at a public event in Borella on Sunday, Premadasa claimed that the going rate for an MP was 200 million rupees.",
    "MP Wickramaratne, however, is adamant that the SJB will continue to hold the government to account. His vehement denial of crossover talk comes in the wake of intense speculation that a number of the SJB\u2019s most prominent MPs, specifically three MPs who have come to personify the party\u2019s economic policy outlook, were looking to extend their support to their former party leader in the UNP.",
    "\u201cThe SJB will oppose this government on any violations of the rule of law, on undermining democracy and on violations of human rights. We are not an opposition that opposes for the sake of it, and if the government comes up with any progressive measures, will evaluate them and if they are in the interest, not of the government or of the president, but of the people, as a responsible opposition, we will decide whether we can support it or not,\u201d he said.",
    "Elaborating on his response, Wickramaratne said that, for example, while the SJB supports moves to make the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) more independent, the bill presented to parliament in that regard was inadequate.",
    "\u201cIt certainly does not strengthen the independence of the central bank to the extent that we want it to be strengthened. There are several causes that are problematic and if the government is open to making amendments to those then they could expect our support,\u201d he said.",
    "Wickramaranthe said the SJB is also opposed to government efforts to replace the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) with another piece of legislation \u2013 which has yet to be tabled in parliament \u2013 that may violate fundamental principles of human rights and may not even contain an exact definition of \u2018terrorism\u2019.",
    "\u201cPeople could be held for long periods of time without access to a lawyer or family. Innocent people who have nothing to do with terrorism could be detained under this act. We will have to closely examine it. If it violates any fundamental principles \u2013 we will only know for sure once it\u2019s tabled, because otherwise it\u2019s just a draft being floated and politicians just making comments about it \u2013 but if it comes in that form, we will certainly oppose it to the T,\u201d said Wickramaranthe.",
    "With regard to the IMF programme, Sri Lanka\u2019s 17th so far, which saw the international lender extend a 2.9 billion US dollar extended fund facility (EFF) to the crisis-hit island nation, Wickramaratne said the SJB supports the programme in principle.",
    "\u201cWe have always advocated that Sri Lank needs to have an arrangement with the IMF. Where we do differ are the details,\u201d he said.",
    "The banker turned MP claimed the government was not going about the IMF programme the right way. He accused the Wickremesinghe administration of not being transparent enough in the early stages.",
    "\u201cIf they had been open and transparent and discussed the details, we could\u2019ve influenced it, so that it would become more acceptable to everybody. But they didn\u2019t, and we saw it only after it was tabled in parliament. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to go about it. And if they\u2019re going to go in that way, I\u2019m afraid the country probably won\u2019t get the best results,\u201d he said.",
    "The party will continue to campaign for the changes that it envisions, he added.",
    "The government\u2019s ongoing efforts in restructuring state-owned enterprises (SOE), which have drawn protest from trade unions and left-leaning parties, was also questioned by Wickramarante.",
    "\u201cAny programme to succeed needs to have public buy-in. Sri Lanka has had 16 IMF programmes, only nine were completed, seven were not and this might become the eighth,\u201d he said.",
    "The \u201csevere burden\u201d of the government\u2019s reform programme falls on the poor and the \u201clower working class\u201d, said Wickraramatne, which he said leads to an obvious lack of buy-in for reforms.",
    "Asked about the social safety nets advocated by the IMF as part of its agreement with Sri Lanka, the MP said welfare in Sri Lanka is highly politicised and the party believes there is no point replacing one policitised system with another, in terms of targeting those who are truly deserving of benefits.",
    "\u201cWe have been saying this to the government and to the donor agencies. Don\u2019t replace one politicised programme with another. Every indication is that it is going in that direction,\u201d he said.",
    "Trade unions and professional associations representing Sri Lanka\u2019s high income earning government workers and other professionals have been protesting against an IMF-backed progressive income tax hike. Commenting on this, Wickramaratne said lower middle class groups have been adversely affected as they face tremendous issues. He said this particular socioeconomic group has already been taxed by inflation.",
    "\u201cMost people don\u2019t understand how difficult life is for that class of people. If they earn 100,000 rupees, inflation has knocked them out because they\u2019re spending 60 percent of that on basic household necessities. Food inflation and things have gone through the roof,\u201d he said.",
    "Medical expenses and other additional expenses, on top of medicine shortages in the country, have added to their woes, he said.",
    "\u201cPeople are under tremendous pressure. That\u2019s why we\u2019re saying the poor for sure and the lower middle class have to be sheltered,\u201d he said.",
    "Pointing to an ongoing pauperisation of the middle class, Wickramaranthe said that while the SJB agrees that taxes had to be raised, it was not fair to raise it at the lower income levels.",
    "\u201cYou have to go for the higher groups, and the burden on the higher groups is much less.\u201d",
    "Under the IMF programme, he said, gift taxes, inheritance taxes, property taxes et have been pushed to 2025, with the burden still remaining on the poor.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re talking about taxing the rich and the wealthy later. So we have looked at this programme very closely, and all the excuses they give that they don\u2019t have systems in place etc which don\u2019t take the burden off the poor.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s socialist parties, mainly rival opposition group National People\u2019s Power (NPP) has been at the forefront of the ongoing agitation against the government\u2019s reform agenda. Asked where the SJB, not being a leftist party, stood on that count, Wickramaratne said the party has always advocated a social market economy approach.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t put ourselves into boxes. Certainly, we want the market to function and we want to encourage the private sector. But we have to protect the poor and the vulnerable for sure. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019re not going to get our reforms through.",
    "\u201cAlso we mustn\u2019t forget this country has had some kind of blood bath or revolution every 25, 30 years. We don\u2019t want to leave room for that again,\u201d he said.",
    "Asked if he truly believed such an outcome was likely, he said:\u201c You can never rule it out, when you look at Sri Lanka\u2019s history.\u201d (Colombo/Apr03/2023)"
