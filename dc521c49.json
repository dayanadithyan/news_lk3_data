    "Brazil\u2019s supreme court voted on Wednesday to sentence former President Fernando Collor de Mello to 8 years and 10 months in prison on corruption and money laundering charges.",
    "The Brazilian prosecutor\u2019s office accused Collor, 73, of having received around 30 million reais ($6 million) in bribes from a subsidiary of state-run oil company Petrobras.",
    "The top court convicted the former senator in mid-May, but justices had still to decide on his sentence, which he can appeal.",
    "Collor was a dashing, liberalizing politician who became Brazil\u2019s first democratically elected president in 1989 after a two-decade military dictatorship, but he resigned three years later after the lower house of Congress impeached him.",
    "A rakish, dynastic heir with a penchant for expensive sports cars, Collor was one of Brazil\u2019s original free-marketeers who opposed Brazil\u2019s entrenched protectionism and sought to privatize state-run firms in his curtailed presidency.",
    "He continued in politics and later served 26 years as a conservative senator for the northeastern state of Alagoas, where his well-to-do family was from. He chaired the foreign relations committee He lost his seat in last year\u2019s elections.",
    "Collor himself could not immediately be reached for comment. In a note released by the time of his conviction, his defense lawyers said Collor did \u201cnot commit any crime\u201d and expressed confidence that he would ultimately be exonerated."
