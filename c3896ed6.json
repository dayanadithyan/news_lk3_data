    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has imported as estimated 4.5 million eggs from February 2023 to date, state Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitya said.",
    "Sri Lanka started importing eggs after price controls on eggs imposed by the Consumer Affair Authorities amid high feed prices following the collapse of the rupee from money printing, leading mass culling of layer chicken for meat and switching to broiler production.",
    "The fall in demand then led to culling of parent stock at hatcheries. Broiler chicken which was free from price controls saw a steep fall in prices to around 980 rupees kilo from 1700 levels amid higher production.",
    "Minister Siyambalapitiya said 277,360 kilograms of eggs have been imported from February 13.",
    "\u201cIf 16 or 17 eggs are assumed to be in a kilogram about 4.5 million eggs have been imported so far,\u201d Minister Siyambalapitiya has said.",
    "No steps have been taken against the Consumer Affaires Authority for decimating the layer chicken sector and driving egg production down.",
    "Cabinet Minister Bandula Gunawardana, a former trade minister said, farmers could consider going to court to seek relief.",
    "Meanwhile some field officers the CAA struck work after some egg farmers assaulted them, reports said. (Colombo/May10/2023)"
