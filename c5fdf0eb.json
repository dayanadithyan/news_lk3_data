    "The Chinese Embassy in Colombo today laid to rest what it called \u2018disinformation' on local and foreign media about Sri Lanka getting ready to export \u201c100 thousand endangered\u201d toque macaque monkeys to a Chinese private company for \u201cexperimental purpose.\"",
    "Issuing a press release, the Embassy said the Chinese National Forestry and Grassland Administration, the main government department supervising and managing the import and export of wild animals and plants, clearly clarified that it is not aware of the request and has not received any such application from any side.",
    "\u201cThe Embassy would like to further stress that as a contracting party of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), China has already adopted its Wildlife Protection Law in 1988 with several amendments afterwards. The Chinese government always attaches great importance to wildlife protection and actively fulfill international obligations, which makes China one of top countries in the world in terms of wildlife protection legislation and law enforcement,\" the statement said.",
    "Agriculture Minister Maninda Amaraweera earlier said he received a request from a private entity in China to import around 100,000 Torque monkeys from Sri Lanka.\u00a0 He said he would appoint a committee to study this request to explore the feasibility of it.",
    "However, the Chinese authorities have now denied any such request by any party there.\u00a0 (Kelum Bandara)"
