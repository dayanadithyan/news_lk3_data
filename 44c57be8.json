    "A brothel operated from a house in Mapanawatura in Kandy, suspected to be run by a popular actress was raided by the police yesterday and seven suspects including four women were taken into custody.",
    "The Kandy Division Crime Investigation Unit who carried out the raid said that they had carried it out on a tip-off received from the public.",
    "Police said the consumer\u2019s name on the electricity bill was similar to that of the actress but it was yet to be confirmed whether she was the owner of the house. They said steps would be taken to produce the electricity bill and obtain a court order to summon the individual named in the electricity bill to the police to record a statement.",
    "A senior police official said the absconding manager of the brothel had been informed to surrender to the police and to produce the agreement with the owner over the rent or lease of the house. (Shane Seneviratne)"
