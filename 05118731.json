    "The Sri Lankan Muslim Community organised an Iftar titled \u201cBreak-Fast at Sunset\u201d on 2 April 2023 at the Independence Square with the participation of nearly 3,000 people. Armed with the belief that prayers/ supplications of a fasting person are accepted by Almighty God; irrespective of their faith everyone raised their hands praying for goodness and prosperity for our motherland.",
    "The prayers called for strengthened togetherness through harmony, prosperity through stability, and success by growing together!",
    "They also prayed for ills and challenges surrounding the country and its people to disappear amongst other lines of prayer, in an evening that saw a light drizzle, as if the heavens acknowledged the call of one Sri Lankan people.",
    "The event was graced by people of different walks of life, including a few curious foreigners. Irrespective of their faith, there were teachers with their students, parents with their children, friends who decided to use the opportunity to meet, heads and members of diplomatic missions, members of political parties, members of the services, and more.",
    "The most beautiful sight to behold was the sheer unity that was present whilst all sat beside each other void of status or position and shared time, prayers, food without fear or favour. - Pix by Sameera Wijesinghe"
