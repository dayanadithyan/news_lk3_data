    "The number of suicides in the country this year might be considerably higher compared to previous years, Senior Lecturer in Psychiatry and Consultant Psychiatrist, Dr. Chathuri Suraweera warned.",
    "Addressing the media, she said 17 cases of suicide per 100,000 individuals were reported (100,000:17).",
    "\"Unfortunately, no data was received for the years 2022 and 2023. So far we have spent only four months this year, but we are receiving information that the number has increased much higher within the last four months.",
    "\"Still, 3,000 cases of suicide are reported annually, and nearly eight or nine incidents reported daily. There was a gradual decrease in the cases of suicide, but there is a slight increase now with the current economic crisis.\"",
    "Therefore, the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) pointed out that the media should be very responsible when reporting on suicides.\u00a0(Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
