    "The issue came up when COPE chairman Prof. Ranjith Bandara looked into the status update of the Land Reforms Commission following the recommendations issued at the meeting on December 22, 2022.",
    "It is reported that despite the insistence of the COPE at the previous meeting for a protocol for the conferring of lands by the commission, there has been no progress.",
    "A request was made by the COPE chairman to submit a detailed report into the conveyance lands and an instruction to the ministry to conduct an inquiry as to why protocol was not established.",
