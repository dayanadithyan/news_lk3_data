    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka former president Maithripala Sirisena dismissed claims that some opposition parties were planning to support the government but remained evasive when pressed about members of his own party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), crossing over.",
    "Speaking to reporters in Kandy Wednesday April 19 morning, Sirisena said any pronouncement from government members that opposition MPs were waiting to cross over to their side was not worth taking seriously.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s just how it is. In politics, everyone says such things. There\u2019s no need to take such remarks too seriously. Let\u2019s see what happens in the future,\u201d said Sirisena.",
    "Asked if anyone from the SLFP was planning to \u201cstrengthen the hand\u201d of the government, the former one-term president said: \u201cOur responsibility is to strengthen the country and the people. We stand for that.\u201d",
    "Sirisena, who appeared to be in a jovial mood, said the SLFP\u2019s political activities were successfully underway after the National New Year holidays.",
    "\u201cWe plan to hold our May Day rally in this historic Buddhist city of Kandy,\u201d he said, adding that the party was doing well.",
    "Asked if he planned to contest the next presidential election, Sirisena quipped: \u201cThose things are up in the air, flying in the wind. We don\u2019t know when an election will take place, which election will be held. Those are up to the government, the president and the election commission.\u201d",
    "Until then, the SLFP is committed towards working for the people, he said, adding that the party planned to contest future elections on the \u2018hand\u2019 symbol.",
    "Sirisena was also cautious with his comments on a controversial new counter-terror bill introduced to replace Sri Lanka\u2019s Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), which has been widely called a draconian piece of legislation.",
    "The PTA was helpful in winning Sri Lanka\u2019s war against the separatist Tamil Tigers, he said.",
    "\u201cWe have tasked the lawyers in our party, many of them president\u2019s counsels, to study the bill.",
    "\u201cThey will present a report to us on the bill, and we will act based on those findings,\u201d said Sirisena, noting that the party can weigh the bill\u2019s pros and cons and act accordingly in parliament when the bill is taken up for debate.",
    "\u201cWe have the power to propose amendments, to oppose [aspects of it] in parliament. If there are good things about it, we can talk about that, too,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Apr19/2023)"
