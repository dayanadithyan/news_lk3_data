  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka needs institutional reforms in order to achieve long-term debt sustainability, said Steve Hanke, who played a key role in establishing new currency regimes in emerging markets like Argentina and Montenegro.",
    "The South Asian country is grappling with its worst financial crisis in decades and needs to unlock a $2.9 billion IMF loan that was agreed to in September, to get its public finances in order.",
    "\u201cUnless you change the institutions and the rules of the game governing these countries, they\u2019re always going to remain in the same ... situation that they\u2019ve been in for a long time,\u201d Hanke, who is now professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box Asia\u201d on Thursday.",
    "\u201cIn fact, most of the personalities involved in Sri Lanka at the high level are exactly the same as they\u2019ve been for years. So nothing has changed.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka has struggled with severe shortages of food, medicine, fuel and electricity since last year. This has led to angry protests that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee from the country and resign. The country\u2019s lawmakers chose six-time Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as president last July as his successor.",
    "Hanke, who was previously economic advisor to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, was also skeptical whether the IMF bailouts will help Sri Lanka\u2019s crisis-stricken economy in the long term. He pointed out that the country has gone to the fund several times cap in hand for relief.",
    "\u201cYou have to remember that we have a country that since 1965 has had 16 IMF programs and they\u2019ve all failed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get temporary relief in anticipation of a bailout. But in the long run ... none of these IMF programs work.\u201d",
    "In September, the IMF outlined a series of steps that it wanted Sri Lanka\u2019s government to implement prior to loan approval, which included major tax reforms.",
    "\u201cDebt relief from Sri Lanka\u2019s creditors and additional financing from multilateral partners will be required to help ensure debt sustainability and close financing gaps,\u201d the fund said at the time.",
    "On Tuesday, Wickremesinghe said that China has given crucial debt restructuring assurances that could pave the way for final approval of the IMF\u2019s $2.9 billion four-year bailout.",
    "\u201cWe received the letter of financial assurance from EXIM Bank of China last night. Accordingly, on the same night, I and the Governor of the Central Bank signed the letter of agreement and forwarded it to the IMF. Now our duties are done,\u201d he told parliament, according to the transcript in local media.",
    "\u201cI hope that before the end of this month, by the fourth week, the IMF will do its duty.\u201d",
    "In a follow up tweet, the president said he has spoken with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on this matter.",
    "He also mentioned he expects financial assistance from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to start coming soon after the IMF deal is reached.",
    "In its readout, the U.S. Treasury Department said: \u201cDuring their meeting, Secretary Yellen expressed support for Sri Lanka\u2019s steps towards an IMF-supported program to advance economic reform and achieve a strong and durable recovery.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Secretary welcomed Sri Lanka\u2019s commitments to transparency and comparable treatment for all bilateral official and private creditors.\u201d",
    "IMF\u2019s Georgieva also commended Sri Lanka on its progress in resolving its financial situation.",
    "\u201cI welcome the progress made by Sri Lankan authorities in taking decisive policy actions & obtaining financing assurances from all their major creditors, incl. China, India & the Paris Club,\u201d she wrote in a tweet.",
    "\u201cLook forward to presenting the IMF-supported program to our Exec. Board on March 20.\u201d",
    "Still, JHU\u2019s Hanke said IMF programs do not tend to go down well with the Sri Lankan people.",
    "\u201cYou get the IMF in there trying to manage something,\u201d said Hanke. \u201cThe IMF tends to be ... very unpopular because they\u2019re going to try to introduce and ram through these old institutions that they have in Sri Lanka all kinds of things that the Sri Lankans won\u2019t like.\u201d",
    "During his speech Tuesday, Sri Lanka\u2019s president underlined \u201cthere is no room for failure in completing every task agreed upon with the IMF, unlike the previous 16 occasions.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe agreement with the IMF is of special importance to restore our economy, and there is no alternative path to be seen at present,\u201d said Wickremesinghe."
