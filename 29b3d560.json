He was selected as a winner by a 15-member jury, who evaluated 175 candidates in a blind tasting.",

    "\u201cI cried when I won because we are foreigners and we came here to learn to make traditional French bread. I am very happy to have won the prize. My bread is always made with love. Always smiling, always laughing, always singing,\u201d he said in an interview with AFP.",
    "Baking since 2009, the winning baker opened his own business \u2018Au Levain des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es\u2019 two years ago. Each baker was required to submit two baguettes between 55 and 70 centimetres, weighing 250 to 300 grams and containing 18 grams of salt per kilogram of flour. The baguette was scored on appearance, cooking, texture, smell and taste."
