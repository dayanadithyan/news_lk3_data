This represents the 14th consecutive year that Commercial Bank became the highest-ranked bank and one of the five best-performing companies in Sri Lanka overall, in the Business Today ranking.",
    "The ranking, based on the 2021-2022 results of companies, recognised the top corporate performers that reported positive financial growth amidst the turbulent situation of the country. Business Today said an analysis of the diverse portfolios of the ranked companies provides a broader picture of the profits and the risks undertaken by these corporates as they worked with resilience, passion, and dedication while gracefully embracing the challenges. Pictured here are Commercial Bank Chairman Prof. Ananda Jayawardane and Managing Director/CEO Sanath Manatunge (left and centre respectively) accepting the award from President Wickremesinghe.",
