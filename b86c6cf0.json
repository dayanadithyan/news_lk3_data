    "The SJB General Secretary asked as to why the government had failed to bring in an anti-corruption bill despite the assurances given by the government that the best anti-corruption Bill will be brought in soon. \u201cWe wonder as to why the government had failed to bring in an anti-corruption Bill as we are ready to support an effective piece of legislation of that nature,\u201d he said.",
