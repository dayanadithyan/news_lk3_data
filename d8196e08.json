    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Sanjeewa Edirimanna says those who defected from the party have failed to take the party\u2019s voter base along with them. This the MP said was evident from the labour day rallies held by the groups.",
    "\u201cThe Freedom People\u2019s Congress was not even able to attract 1% of their voter base for their rally held in Kandy,\u201d he said. \u201cMany were curious if they would take along the SLPP voter base with them.",
    "These concerns were valid as several of them were powerful political figures. But the May Day rallies have proved otherwise,\u201d he added. The MP made these comments at a party press conference held in Colombo yesterday.",
    "\u201cThey held the rally in Kandy. Two of their stalwarts are from the town. But if they had managed to bring in at least 1% of their voter base around 1500 would have been attendance at the rally. But was there even 0.2% there?\u201d Edirimanna asked. He said similarly Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila of the Supreme Lanka Coalition failed to attract even 000.1% of their voter base for the rally held in Colombo on the day. In comparison, Edirimanna said the SLPP rally was the most successful one of the day.",
    "\u201cThough we faced obstacles due to violence unleashed on our members in the recent past we were able to hold the rally successfully in the Campbell Park,\u201d he noted."
