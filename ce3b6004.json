    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe congratulated Chinese President Xi Jinping on his confirmation for a third term and praised China's progress under his leadership.",
    "The President's Media Division said that Wickremesinghe expressed appreciation for China's support in Sri Lanka's economic challenges, especially in the IMF process & expressed confidence that the two countries' robust cooperation will continue to flourish during Prez. Xi Jinping's new term.",
    "Chinese leader Xi Jinping was awarded a third five-year term as president on 10th March, putting him on track to stay in power for life at a time of severe economic challenges and rising tensions with the U.S. and others.",
    "The endorsement of Xi\u2019s appointment by the ceremonial National People\u2019s Congress was a foregone conclusion for a leader who has sidelined potential rivals and filled the top ranks of the ruling Communist Party with his supporters since taking power in 2012.",
    "Xi, 69, had himself named to a third five-year term as party general secretary in October, breaking with a tradition under which Chinese leaders handed over power once a decade. A two-term limit on the figurehead presidency was deleted from the Chinese constitution earlier, prompting suggestions he might stay in power for life.",
