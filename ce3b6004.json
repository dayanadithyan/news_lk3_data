    "The President's Media Division said that Wickremesinghe expressed appreciation for China's support in Sri Lanka's economic challenges, especially in the IMF process & expressed confidence that the two countries' robust cooperation will continue to flourish during Prez. Xi Jinping's new term.",
    "Chinese leader Xi Jinping was awarded a third five-year term as president on 10th March, putting him on track to stay in power for life at a time of severe economic challenges and rising tensions with the U.S. and others.",
    "The endorsement of Xi\u2019s appointment by the ceremonial National People\u2019s Congress was a foregone conclusion for a leader who has sidelined potential rivals and filled the top ranks of the ruling Communist Party with his supporters since taking power in 2012.",
    "Xi, 69, had himself named to a third five-year term as party general secretary in October, breaking with a tradition under which Chinese leaders handed over power once a decade. A two-term limit on the figurehead presidency was deleted from the Chinese constitution earlier, prompting suggestions he might stay in power for life.",
