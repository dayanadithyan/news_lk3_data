    "ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka\u2019s President Ranil Wickremesinghe who stood for freedoms and independence of the judiciary in the past has turned upside down like \u2018Singer\u2019 became \u2018Regnis\u2019 and is now promoting anti-freedom legislation and opposition legislator questioned in parliament.",
    "In 2015 Ranil Wickremesinghe was Prime Minister he established independence commissions and ensured the independence of the judiciary,\u201d legislator Thushara Indunil Amarasena told parliament.",
    "\u201cHe put in a commission for the public service. He gave freedom to the media. Now this is going back. A broadcast authority bill is being brought to suppress the media.\u201d",
    "Opposition legislators also questioned statements made by President Wickremesinghe about the elections in the presence of a Supreme Court justices at a law conference.",
    "\u201cAt one time there were sewing machines called Singer,\u201d Amarasena said. \u201cThen later we saw sewing machines called Regnis, which was the same name in reverse.",
    "\u201cSo we now have a big question whether this is the Singer branded Ranil Wickremesinghe or whether after 2020 whether this is the Ranil Wickremesinghe who had become Regnis.\u201d",
    "\u201cI do not understand whether he is now acting on his own agenda or the agenda of the Rajapaksas.\u201d",
    "Amarasena said under Wickremesinghe\u2019s current rule there were reports that a district secretary in Tissamaharama had resigned due to political pressure.",
    "Analysts have called for permanent secretaries and permanent ministries to be re-established to ensure and effective and independent public service who serve people equally. (Colombo/June07/2023)"
