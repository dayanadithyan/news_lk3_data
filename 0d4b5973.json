Also, the UK authorities informed Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane who is there, that this bill, unless changed, will have an impact on trade relations through preferential trading.",
    "Besides, some representatives of the EU member states raised concerns in this regard when they were called for high tea with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake on April 17, 2023. During the brief discussion, they said that the spirit of the bill would have a bearing on decisions regarding GSP + concessions.",

    "The repeal of the current Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) is a commitment made by Sri Lanka to qualify for US $ 500 million Gsp( generalized Scheme of Preferences) + trade concessions in exporting to the markets in the EU region. The European Commission\u2019s report on Sri Lanka is expected to be presented at the end of next month or early June.",
    "However, there is criticism from various quarters like some civil society organizations, political parties in the opposition and trade unions on the new Anti-terrorism Bill introduced to be enacted in place of the PTA. They even call it far more draconian than the PTA.",
    "The government has now delayed the presentation of the bill for discussion with the concerned parties. (Kelum Bandara)"
