    "CNN: The World Bank\u2019s board of governors on Wednesday elected former Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga to a five-year term as president, ushering in an Indian-born finance and development expert to revamp the lender to tackle climate change and other global crises.",
    "Banga, 63, was nominated for the post by US President Joe Biden in late February and was the sole contender to replace departing World Bank chief David Malpass, an economist and former US Treasury official who served in the Trump administration. He starts the new job on June 2.",
    "The election came after World Bank board members interviewed Banga for four hours on Monday. Malpass\u2019s last day at the bank will be June 1. The decision came in a vote by 24 of the board\u2019s members, with Russia abstaining, instead of the usual consensus-based process, a source familiar with the process said.",
    "Biden congratulated Banga on his \u201cresounding approval\u201d to run the World Bank, which he described as \u201cone of humanity\u2019s most critical institutions to reduce poverty and expand prosperity around the globe.\u201d",
    "\u201cAjay Banga will be a transformative leader, bringing expertise, experience, and innovation to the position of World Bank President,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe will help steer the institution as it evolves and expands to address global challenges that directly affect its core mission of poverty reduction \u2014 including climate change.\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Banga brought the \u201cright leadership and management skills\u201d to the job, and would play a critical role in pushing forward with additional reforms, including by forging partnerships between the public and private sectors and nonprofit groups. \u201cAjay understands that the challenges we face \u2013 from combatting climate change, pandemics, and fragility to eliminating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity \u2013 are deeply intertwined.",
    "He has effectively built a broad global coalition around his vision for the Bank over the course of his candidacy,\u201d Yellen said in a statement.",
    "Katie Malouf-Bous, interim head of Oxfam International\u2019s Washington office, said the bank needed \u201cserious reform\u201d to tackle the widening gap between rich and poor, but that would require huge new public investments and \u201cguardrails around private finance that has run riot for too long.\u201d",
    "One senior US official said Banga\u2019s election came at a critical moment marked by emerging debt distress in lower- and middle-income countries and ongoing problems in food and energy markets as a result of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
    "\u201cIt is a challenging moment, but it\u2019s a moment where the World Bank remains more vital than ever, and where getting the evolution of the World Bank is absolutely critical,\u201d the official said.",
    "The bank already loans out hundreds of billions of dollars to developing countries but is working to increase its lending to help them address overlapping global challenges such as climate change, conflict and brace for future pandemics.",
    "\u201cThe Board looks forward to working with Banga on the World Bank Group Evolution process \u2026 on all the World Bank Group\u2019s ambitions and efforts aimed at tackling the toughest development challenges facing developing countries,\u201d the bank said."
