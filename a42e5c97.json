    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC), a breakaway faction of Sri Lanka\u2019s ruling party, has accused the government of trying to \u201cdistribute\u201d responsibility for the country\u2019s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "FPC frontliner G L Peiris, who until recently was chairman of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), told reporters on Monday May 08 that the government broke convention to debate and pass the IMF deal in parliament to escape any blowback from the public.",
    "There is no tradition of parliament approving an agreement with the IMF, nor is there a legal requirement for it, said Peiris.",
    "\u201cThe government is well aware that this agreement is not going to be a very popular one when implementing it, due to certain conditions it contains,\u201d said Peiris, claiming that a wave of popular dissent on the agreement is on the cards.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s why they want to divide up the responsibility for this,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP added that the government was keen to pin the responsibility on parliament.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s important here is not whether it was appropriate to go to the IMF. Once you go to the IMF, how do you engage in the negotiations? What do you agree to and what do you not agree to? The government didn\u2019t do this right, at all,\u201d said Peiris.",
    "Other countries that had to approach the iMF, he said, made honest representations to the international lender with their specific needs and objectives in mind.",
    "\u201cNeither the Sri Lankan government nor its representatives want to do this,\u201d he said, accusing the government of politicising the matter.",
    "\u201cThe negotiations were not based on a national agenda and the people\u2019s needs but with maximum benefit to a party and its leader in mind,\u201d claimed Peiris.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition parties, most of whom urged the then government in early 2022 to go to the IMF at the onset of the country\u2019s worst currency crisis in decades, have now changed their stance on the deal that saw the IMF\u2019s board approve a 2.9 billion US dollar extended fund facility (EFF).",
    "Sri Lanka has had to agree to a painful but necessary reform agenda that includes debt restructuring, increased taxes and restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as part of the deal, and trade unions and a number of opposition parties have already started to protest.",
    "Some of these parties have also, somewhat contradictorily, accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s administration of attempting to take credit for the IMF programme, while also claiming that the government is also hesitant to take ownership of the deal.",
    "MP Peiris\u2019 Freedom People\u2019s Congress is closely allied with other factions of the SLPP whose foreign policies are closely aligned with China. One of these allies, the National Freedom Front, has openly accused the United States of conspiring to topple the previous government headed by then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",

    "The leftist National People\u2019s Power (NPP), led by the Marxist-Leninist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), has already taken up an anti-IMF position, likely anticipating some level of public discontent with the coming reforms.",
    "The main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) meanwhile appears undecided at best, but is confident of forming a government in three months.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s SJB no longer enamoured of IMF, promises new govt in three moonsSee more"
