    "The International Commission of Jurists (IC) has raised concerns over the newly proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill in Sri Lanka.",
    "Issuing a statement in this regard, the ICJ noted that they are \u2018extremely concerned\u2019 by the Bill in question, adding that clause 4(1) of the Bill, if adopted, would introduce the death penalty for the \u201cterrorism offence of murder\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe ICJ is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances, as a violation of the right to life, and as the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment\u201d, the statement read.",
    "Further, ICJ\u2019s Senior Adviser Livio Zilli said that\u00a0 \u201cPurported threats to national security, whether or not arising in connection with acts of \u2018terrorism\u2019, should not be used as a justification for the death penalty\u201d.",
    "Despite acknowledging that the Bill defeated certain discrepancies of the PTA, often referred to as a \u2018draconian\u2019 piece of legislation, the ICJ stated that the Bill still comprised of problematic aspects which outweighed the positives.",
    "Citing several other clauses of the proposed Bill, Zilli stated \u201cIf enacted as currently formulated, these vague and overbroad offences, similar to and building up on those contained in the PTA, are open to abuse and, as such, they violate Sri Lanka\u2019s international legal obligations and the country\u2019s own constitutional guarantees under Article 13\u201d.",
    "Thus, despite consistently having called for the PTA to be repealed, the ICJ stated that while it renews these calls, it also urges that Sri Lanka immediately halt its attempts to replace it with an \u201ceven worse piece of legislation\u201d."
