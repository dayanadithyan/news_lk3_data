    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Calls to reform a British era vagrancy law and a section in the penal used by police to harass young couples have intensified after another recent incident where a policeman molested a young woman after handcuffing her boyfriend to his motorcycle.",
    "Activists say police are in the habit of harassing young couples who visit public places and are extracting bribes threatening prosecution after claiming that they are behaving indecently.",
    "According to the Vagrants Ordinance originally brought by the British in 1842 \u2018a police officer may arrest without a warrant any person deemed to be an idle and disorderly person.\u2019",
    "Couples are also targeted under section 365 A of the Penal Code which prohibits \u2018gross indecency.\u2019 In 2020, 100 couples were arrested in Anuradhapura for \u2018gross indecency,\u2019 says Aritha Wickramasinghe, an Attorney-at-Law and the Equality Director at iProbono, an advocacy group.",
    "\u201cThere is rarely a prosecution,\u201d said Aritha Wickramasinghe, an Attorney-at-Law and the Equality Director at iProbono.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s because it is unlikely that the court will agree that holding hands and kissing will fall into this ambit. But the law definitely needs reform.\u201d",
    "Police sometimes confronts young couples threaten them and extracts bribes according to reports which appear from time to time.",
    "In 2015 three police officers attached to the Cinnamon Gardens police have demanded Rs. 2000 from a couple in exchange for not taking legal measures for behaving indecently in public. The couple in question were inside a car at the time of the incident.",
    "In April 2023, a police officer had accosted a couple while they were spending time at the Samanalawewa Dam and forcibly stripped the young woman and attempted to film her nude.",
    "Many couples who are harassed by police with the vagrancy law and section 365A of the Penal Code may not be coming forward to complain.",
    "\u201cNot many victims of police abuse are willing to come forward,\u201d Wickramasinghe said. \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s conservative attitudes also mean that couples are afraid of punishment by their parents, even as adults. Unfortunately, parental attitudes mean that young people are exposed to violence and abuse by the state for something as simple as falling in love.\u201d",
    "Neither the statute nor the court has provided a legal definition of idle and disorderly\u2019 leaving its definition vague and up to interpretation by law enforcement.",
    "Many of the individuals arrested are couples, who are frequently targeted by police regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.",
    "In 2016 security guards were caught driving away unmarried couples until minister Harsha De Silva witnessed the incident while visiting the Independence Square intervened on their behalf.",
    "A private member bill has been proposed by MP Premnath Dolawatte to repeal section 365A of the Penal Code.",
    "But no action had been taken by the government to take it to vote. Private member\u2019s bills are rarely acted upon by the government. (Colombo/ April17/2023)"
