    "Colombo High Court today discharged former Parliamentarian and Minister Sajin Vass Gunawardena from a lawsuit filed against him by the Commission to Investigate into Allegations of Bribery or Corruption for committing corrupting to the tune of Rs 883 million by Gunawardena during his tenure as CEO of Mihin Lanka.",
    "It is alleged that Gunawardena had entered into an illegal contract with a Singaporean Company while purchasing ground handling equipment for Mihin Lanka.",
    "At the outset of the investigation before Colombo High Court Counsel Shavendra Fernando PC defending Gunawardena took up a preliminary objection contending that a suspect once acquitted from a case cannot be charged for the same offense in another court of law.",
    "The Counsel took up the position that the accused was once acquitted by the Magistrate Court Colombo had been once again indicted before the High Court erroneously which is contrary to the law as there is no provision in law to frame charges against Gunawardena on the same charges. The Counsel said the plaint is bad in law.",
    "High Court Judge Damith Totawatte maintained the defense position and discharging Sajin Vaas Gunawardena from the case. (T. Farook Thajudeen)"
