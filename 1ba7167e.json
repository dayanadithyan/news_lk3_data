  "original_body_lines": [
    "Members of the Aragalaya are abandoning their illegitimate children on railway tracks, Minister of Housing Prasanna Ranatunga alleged yesterday.",
    "\u201cAragalaya members are behaving in an irresponsible manner. They are getting unwanted babies as a result. They dump their children on railway tracks,\u201d Minister Ranatunga said during a meeting he had with development officers.",
    "\u201cThere were Aragalaya members in state institutions as well. They should not be given a chance to launch another Aragalaya. One has the right to topple an elected government but no one has a right to disrupt a state. Disrupting a state is an act of terrorism,\u201d he added.",
    "Minister Ranatunga said he has always allowed the institutions which come under the purview of his ministry to function independently but would not hesitate to help wherever there is any issue within them. (Yohan Perera)"
