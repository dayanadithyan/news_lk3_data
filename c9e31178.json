  "original_body_lines": [
    "Royal College Colombo will look to retain the Mustangs Trophy when they face traditional rivals S. Thomas' College in the 46th annual encounter at the SSC today (24).",
    "A comfortable eight-wicket win last year meant the Royalists won the trophy for the 23rd time, with the Thomians sitting on 20 wins.",
    "The 2002 encounter ended in a tie, with both teams bowled out for 216, while the 2012 the trophy was shared in 2012 after a miscalculation in the Duckworth/Lewis equation.",
    "Victory for S. Thomas\u2019 today will not only see them edge closer to the Royalists, but also avenge the demoralising defeat in the three-day encounter last week.",
    "It would also be their first win since 2018, which was under the captaincy of Dellon Peiris, when the Thomians scored 216 for 9 before bowling out the Royalists for 85, recording an emphatic win.",
    "That victory bookended a run of five consecutive wins for the Thomians, but the Royalists have now won back to back, with two encounters in 2020 and 2021, not being played."
