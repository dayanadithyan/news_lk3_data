    "The Water Supply Professionals Trade Union Alliance (WSPTUA) has decided to continue with their trade union action on March 23 because they have not received solutions to their demands.",
    "The union convenor, Upali Rathnayake, said that they had engaged in a token strike on March 13 but did not receive an acceptable response from the responsible authorities.",
    "Therefore, the WSPTUA has decided to engage in their eight-hour trade union action, refraining from all duties at offices and workstations from 9 a.m. tomorrow.",
    "During the strike, employees will withdraw from all consumer services and cashier activities.",
    "Considering the inconvenience caused to the people, all pump houses are operating. There will be no breakdown repairs, and that will cause disruption of the water supply in certain areas.",

    "The protest will be conducted at all district water supply board offices in Anuradhapura, Kandy, Matara, Badulla, Ratnapura, Monaragala, and Vavunia. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
