    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Judicial Service Association of Sri Lanka has requested the Judicial Services Commission to step in to prevent an unwarranted conflict from being created between the Judiciary and the Executive.",
    "The Judicial Service Association representing the District Judges and the Magistrates noted that it has come to its attention that an attempt is being made to abuse the Parliament (Powers and privileges) Act, No.21 of 1953 to create an unwanted confrontation between the Judiciary and the Executive, based on the interim order that was issued by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka with respect to a fundamental rights application filed to secure the mandate of the people enshrined in the constitution of Sri Lanka.",
    "The Judicial Service Association said that its members met recently to discuss the matter in depth and decided that it would take necessary measures to prevent a wanted conflict from being created between the Judiciary and the Executive.",
    "It noted that the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary are the three main pillars of support of any form of democratic political system, and there needs to be Checks and Balances among them.",
    "The Judicial Service Association of Sri Lanka notes that if a decision is made that an order given by the court over a pending matter violates parliament privileges, and based on that if it is decided to summon the judges who delivered the order to the Parliament Privileges Committee, it would lead to the erosion of the Rule of Law and Judicial Independence, and also eventually lead to a total collapse of the state mechanism.",
    "The Judicial Service Association stressed that it would not back down from taking any action against anyone who tries to influence the system of service justice on behalf of the people whilst protecting the independence of the judiciary.",
