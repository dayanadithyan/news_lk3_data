    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Forbes has listed Sri Lanka as one of the 23 best places to travel around the world in 2023.",
    "Forbes said that Sri Lanka was chosen by Juliana Broste, a 12x Heartland Emmy Award-winning travel filmmaker and host, showcasing adventures and fun things to do around the world.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s no secret, Sri Lanka has had a hard time,\u201d says Juliana Broste.",
    "\u201cEven with inflation, visitors will find Sri Lanka a spectacular, affordable destination worth the long haul. Loop around the island and you\u2019ll see why this land will keep you guessing\u2014from the hustle and bustle of capital city Colombo to beautiful beaches, rice fields, waterfalls, plains, and mountains.\u201d",
    "There\u2019s a lot to see in a relatively short distance, so have your camera at the ready. \u201cSpotting the wildlife in Sri Lanka is really special,\u201d says Broste, who explored the country on a photo tour.",
    "\u201cYou can go on safari to an Elephant Sanctuary, go whale watching on the Indian ocean and spy on birds, lizards, jellyfish and monkeys in a mangrove.\u201d On Broste\u2019s bucket list for next time: spotting leopards at Yala National Park.",
    "Sri Lanka has plenty of interesting cultural attractions to explore, including the ancient cities of Anuradhapura and Kandy.",
    "\u201cBe sure to pack an all-white outfit that covers your shoulders and legs when visiting religious sites,\u201d says Broste. \u201cCatching a traditional Kandyan dance performance is a highlight, seeing men and women in traditional dress telling stories through dance.\u201d",
    "Tucked away in hill country, Nuwara Eliya, known as \u201cLittle England,\u201d is a cool climate escape where a famous Sri Lankan export, ceylon tea, is produced. \u201cWinding roads reveal rows and rows of tea bushes on the hillside\u2014be sure to stop in for a cup of tea on your visit to a tea factory and plantation,\u201d says Broste. \u201cEqually as fun: sampling a king coconut on the side of the road along your adventure.\u201d",
    "For an incredible view of Colombo, head to the top of the shimmering pink Lotus Tower for a bird\u2019s eye view of the city. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol of the city and just a touch taller than the Eiffel Tower,\u201d says Broste.",
    "\u201cAnother famous viewpoint worth the hike is the ancient city of Sigiriya known as Lion\u2019s Rock, with the ruins of an ancient stronghold located atop a dramatic rock outcrop. It\u2019s wild to think how an entire civilization lived here centuries ago,\u201d she told Forbes.",

    "Supreme Court should NOT be summoned to explain judicial orders to anyone \u2013 BASL",
