    "\"We do not want to postpone elections. Postponing elections in a democratic country is not appropriate.\u00a0 We will hold local government elections as soon as possible. However it is unlikely that local government polls will be held on April 25. I can say that the presidential election will be held in November,\" he said.",
    "\"There are about 8,000 members of local government bodies across the country and it is a burden to the country. A commission was appointed and steps were taken to reduce the number of members.\u00a0 Ready to proceed as soon as the report is received,\" the State Minister said.(Shantha Pradeep Kumara)"
