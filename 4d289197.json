    "Let us all unite and make this cultural revolution etched in golden letters in our history books so that the world at large will not only hasten to pay a glorious tribute to Sri Lanka but also provide us with the much needed economic assistance to redeem our country from its present plight",
    "\u201cChange is the law of life. Those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future\u201d \u2014 John F. Kennedy",
    "Ever since Sri Lanka (SL) became a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed by the United Nations in 1948, our political and civil democrats including pundits and academics joined the rest of the world adding two adjectives to the word \u2018elections\u2019 and constantly agitated for \u2018free and fair elections\u2019 whenever \u2018elections\u2019 are called.",
    "This phrase was based on Article 21 (3) of the Declaration which reads as follows: \u201cThe will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of Government; this Will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.\u201d",
    "It may be assumed that the words \u2018free and fair\u2019 were substitutes for the words \u2018universal\u2019, \u2018genuine\u2019 and \u2018equal suffrage\u2019 used in Article 21 above. Recently, a US Senator too specifically urged SL Government to hold \u2018free and fair elections\u2019!",
    "However, the sad irony we face today in SL is the relentless clamour by the so called democratic politicians, blinded by power hunger and political expediency to hold hackneyed elections very well knowing that our existing electoral systems are flawed and not genuinely free and fair. A coterie of political pundits, academics and NGOs too jumped in to the bandwagon (for reasons best known to them!) hot on the heels of the historic and peaceful Aragalaya that desperately upstaged the dire need for system changes in our defective and unproductive electoral and political administration systems through slogans such as \u2018Ditch the 225\u2019 and \u2018Gota go Home\u2019. Their action was traced to biased, corrupt, arrogant, undemocratic and unproductive 4 tiered political administration structure bereft of meritocracy but replete with nepotism and corruption over the last several decades.",
    "If our intelligentsia who joined the political bandwagon stopped barking up the wrong tree and started to clamour for system changes that ensure a genuine free and fair electoral system, the country-wide sovereign voters would have been assured of equality of vote asserting \u2018Sri Lankan ness\u2019 and the best \u2018fit and proper\u2019 \u2018country-first-political professionals\u2019 to represent them when they face the next election and achieve the real objectives of the Parliament, Provincial Councils and Local Govt. portending a better future for the country.",
    "In the above context, the rationale for crucial system changes in SL\u2019s political landscape can be tracked down to the following considerations:",
    "1. System changes and paradigm shifts are overwhelmingly essential for a nation that has declared bankruptcy.",
    "2. Historic, peaceful Aragalaya leveraged on long overdue system changes that are vital to keep step with the rapidly changing times and comply with the needs of the new generation with their desperate concern for \u2018genuinely free and fair elections\u2019 that guarantee equality of vote asserting \u2018Sri Lankan ness\u2019 and the quality of individuals who can deputise for sovereign voters to achieve the respective institutional objectives under a meaningful \u2018representative democracy\u2019.",
    "3. Integrating SriLankan ness with the electoral/political administration system is essential to catalyse the national reconciliation process.",
    "4. Objective changes in public and political administration systems are hallmarks of any vibrant and progressive society.",
    "Arising from the above, it is necessary to spell out the key actions to meet the aspirations of the principal stakeholders, viz. the sovereign voters in SL",
    "1. Rationalising the top and bottom layers of the existing 4 tiered political administration structure",
    "2. Refining the electoral system to ensure genuine free and fair elections",
    "5. Infusing appropriate work ethics, discipline, technology and methods for productivity enhancement of SL\u2019s workforce",
    "6. Instilling \u2018country first\u2019 attitude among the human capital involved in above areas plus schools and universities",
    "In view of space constraints, the scope of this article is confined to 1 and 2 above.",
    "It is pertinent to keep the readers in context by chronologically recalling the submission of a holistic package of electoral reforms/system changes by the writer to the relevant authorities/organisations over the years as follows:",
    "1. Lal Wijenaike Public Committee on new Constitution \u2013 2016 \u2013 January.",
    "2. NEC Chairman and senior officers \u2013 PP presentation \u2013 2017 \u2013 July",
    "3. \u2018Legal Experts Committee\u2019 to draft a new Constitution \u2013 2020 \u2013 Nov.",
    "4. Parliamentary Select Committee on Electoral Reforms \u2013 2021 \u2013 June",
    "8. Feature articles and letters to the Editor in the Press \u2013 1997 \u2013 to date.",
    "The outcome so far has been no less than an acknowledgement of receipt without any further ado!",
    "Recently proposed system changes to rationalise the political administration system",
    "1. A method to rationalise corrupt and unproductive LG Tier to achieve its real objective",
    "As far back as in April 1997 the writer proposed a simple alternative based on the \u2018Grama Rajya\u2019 concept to rationalise the bottom layer of the political administration system through an article to the press titled \u2018An alternate system to local Govt. Elections\u2019. As usual it fell on deaf ears of the authorities.",
    "As the rates/tax paying citizens are now fed up with the existing politicised Local Government administration where political bias, corruption, arrogance and self-aggrandisement are the hallmarks, they desperately look forward for system changes to ensure;",
    "1. Real needs of the specific locality are identified and resolved under an intensive approach",
    "3. Impartiality sans any political bias or corruption is sustained",
    "With the upcoming establishment of \u2018Jana Sabhas\u2019 proposed by the National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ), to create a sustainable nation through an advanced participatory democracy, the writer proposed a simple method to depoliticise LG machinery and integrate it with the Divisional Secretary Divisions (DSD).",
    "Since legal recognition for \u2018Jana Sabhas\u2019 (JS) at \u2018Grama Niladhari Division\u2019 (GND) level, is nearing completion, independent candidates can be nominated by \u2018Jana Sabhas\u2019 in each of the (GND) and the next depoliticised LG Election can be conducted using the following methodology:",
    "1. At the next LG election, allow each JS to nominate 3 honest, impartial and socially acceptable candidates (1 male, 1 female and 1 youth \u2013 below 35 years of age) with high integrity residing in the GND, so that the highest vote receiver shall become the JS representative for the GND taking up their JS recommendations and issues with LG authorities at \u2018Pradeshiya Sabha\u2019/Urban Council/Municipal Council level and at Divisional Secretary Division (DSD) level.",
    "2. To avoid wasteful costs and administrative bottlenecks, each Divisional Secretary should be empowered to conduct the election in his/her DSD in the presence of polling agents from JSS in the Division.",
    "3. The office bearers at \u2018Pradeshiya Sabha\u2019, Urban and Municipal Council level can be elected from among JS members by vote.",
    "4. The 14,000 strong JS representatives will surely make the LG machinery more meaningful and effective than the existing politically biased and corrupt LG system. They may be paid a monthly allowance that ensures a lesser total outlay compared to that of the existing politicised members.",
    "5. These representatives will eventually graduate as proven Provincial Councillors and MPs by becoming members of political parties of their choice with \u2018country first\u2019 attitude.",
    "6. If the next delimitation exercise will take a long time, we suggest that the existing GND and DSD boundaries be considered for the next LG Election.",
    "1. Abolish \u2018Mixed Member Voting\u2019 (MMV), \u2018Preference voting\u2019 and \u2018Cross over\u2019 mechanisms to pave the way for election of wise and genuine \u2018country-first-political professionals\u2019 from \u2018district-wise merit lists\u2019 of parties selected through a robust, standardised procedure subject to minimum eligibility criteria and a structured interview system laid down by the National Election Commission (Writer has already spelt out the methodology in articles to the press). This is a fundamental system change sought by the peaceful youth of Aragalaya.",
    "2. Members to Provincial Councils (PCs) and National Parliament to be elected purely on district and country-wide \u2018% Representation\u2019 basis respectively, enabling all voters in North, South, East and West to vote for only the party of their choice as \u2018True Sri Lankans\u2019 carrying a ballot paper of equal value untainted by race, caste or religion as proclaimed under UN Convention \u2013 1948. This is an important prerequisite for the success of the national reconciliation exercise.",
    "3. Secure women and youth representation (20% each) by mandating inclusion of at least 1 woman and 1 youth (below 35 years) among every 5 persons in all district/electorate nominee lists in merit order.",
    "4. A sustainable Sri Lankan Cabinet to be constituted based on National vote %, so that smaller parties too will be entitled to join the Cabinet. This step will greatly assist in resolving our national question paving the way for our country to become a model five-star democracy with \u2018Sri Lankans\u2019 as its citizens.",
    "5. Brand the 5-year party election manifestos as regulated, prosecutable documents that would primarily determine voter decision.",
    "6. Objectively strengthen PCs and rationalise the role and fringe benefits of MPs.",
    "7. Take cost-effective steps to ensure maximum productivity of the electoral system. E.g. Hold General and PC Elections and if possible, the relevant referenda too on the same day after introducing electronic voting system.",
    "Executive Presidency to be abolished with effect from a specified date, through a referendum, (if possible on the same day of the General and PC Elections) and replaced with a Parliament and PC member appointed hybrid Governor General as the Commander-in-chief with usual ceremonial powers plus limited powers to enforce and execute Parliament approved laws, programs, and national and decentralised budgets through Provincial Governors appointed by him/her. The Constitutional Council shall nominate 3 candidates for the post of Governor General who when elected will report to the Supreme Parliament.",
    "Due to corrupt, unprofessional, parochial and confrontational party politics, SL has missed several golden opportunities to put it back on track after overcoming uprisings/disasters such as the 1971 insurrection, 1989/90 insurrection, 2004 Tsunami, 30-year-war, 2019 Easter carnage, and COVID-19. Now, the 2022 Aragalaya did pave the way for an Interim Multi-party Government which is the ideal body to forge the above system changes without leaving room for any single party/alliance to take political advantage or score brownie points in the process. At the beginning, it received blessings of the people, all religious leaders, scholars, BASL and political parties. Unfortunately, it has not seen the light of day yet.",
    "Therefore, we as citizens with country at heart, re-appeal to the President, Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and the entire Parliament to place the country first and exercise their political will in unison, irrespective of narrow party politics, colour, creed and caste, to speedily legalise the above objective system changes leading to genuine free and fair elections and an efficient political administration system as suggested above and replace this failed and rotten system of corrupt and confrontational politics with a clean and consensual political culture.",
    "Only such a paradigm shift combined with corresponding changes in our media and peoples\u2019 culture can convince and prevent the new generation, professionals and the sovereign voters, from seeking greener pastures. Thereby, our bankrupt nation can be saved from being thrown to the dustbin of history.",
    "Therefore, let us all unite and make this cultural revolution etched in golden letters in our history books so that the world at large will not only hasten to pay a glorious tribute to Sri Lanka but also provide us with the much needed economic assistance to redeem our country from its present plight!",
    "\u201cChange is the only constant in life. Thus, if there is a will there is a way too\u201d!",
