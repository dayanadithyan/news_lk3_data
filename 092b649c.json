  "original_body_lines": [
    "World Rugby (WR) on Monday (29) informed the Sports Ministry of Sri Lanka that they would also be investigated as a part of WR review process following the ban imposed on Sri Lanka Rugby (SLR).",
    "Sports Ministry took some stern decisions in the last few months, which has resulted quite negatively on rugby in particular.",
    "SLR was officially suspended by WR on May 11 after which the Minister of Sports Roshan Ranasinghe wrote a letter to the WR in an attempt clear the air.",
    "In response to that the WR has now said that investigation will begin in collaboration with Asia Rugby (AR).",
    "\"Whilst recognizing Sri Lanka as a sovereign nation with its own domestic legal framework, in order to reach an outcome which ensures compliance with the World Rugby Bye-Laws, World Rugby must gain further insight into the issues surrounding Sri Lanka Rugby\u2019s governance. As such, World Rugby will be conducting a full review of these matters and will be liaising with Asia Rugby as to the most appropriate way to conduct this exercise. This will no doubt require World Rugby to engage with the parties closest to thematerial issues. It is also our intention to engage with the Ministry as part of this review process and are most grateful to you for your offer of a meeting to review these matters further. We hope to be in a position to visit Sri Lanka (with Asia Rugby) in early July and will liaise with your office to confirm a suitable meeting time,\" WR informed the Ministry via letter.
