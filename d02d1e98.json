  "original_body_lines": [
    "Donald Trump has said the US is \u201cgoing to hell\u201d in a defiant address after pleading not guilty to falsifying business records to hide damaging information ahead of the 2016 election.",
    "The former president was charged with 34 felony counts in a Manhattan court on Tuesday.",
    "These relate to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, who says they had an adulterous affair.",
    "Mr Trump is the first US president in history to face a criminal trial.",
    "\u201cThe only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it,\u201d the 76-year-old told supporters gathered at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida after he appeared in court.",
    "He said that the \u201cfake case\u201d was simply part of a Democratic conspiracy to interfere with next year\u2019s presidential election, in which he is running.",
    "Mr Trump also falsely claimed that every single pundit and legal analyst had said there was no case against him.",
    "Earlier, he sat stony-faced and silent for the nearly hour-long proceedings before Judge Juan Merchan, speaking out loud only in response to the judge\u2019s questions and to enter his plea of not guilty. Mr Trump said nothing to reporters as he left court.",
    "The case against the former president hinges on a hush-money payment of $130,000 (\u00a3104,000) made before the 2016 presidential election.",
    "While such a payment is not illegal, the prosecution says Mr Trump falsified business records and broke election laws as he tried to cover up the payments.",
    "His former lawyer, Michael Cohen - who turned against his former boss - has said he made the payment at Mr Trump\u2019s direction.",
    "Each of the charges carries a maximum of four years in prison, although a judge could sentence Mr Trump to probation if he is convicted.",
    "The odds of his being found guilty are so far unclear, but the charges have pulled the country into uncharted political territory.",
    "Mr Trump\u2019s trial could begin as early as January 2024, Judge Merchan said, meaning the Republican could be back in court just as primaries begin to select the party\u2019s nominee.",
    "Prosecutors also pointed to other payments they say were made via an intermediary on behalf of Mr Trump to suppress potentially politically damaging stories.",
    "They allege $30,000 was paid to buy the silence of a doorman at Trump Tower who claimed Mr Trump had a lovechild.",
    "And $150,000 was paid to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who said she had a sexual relationship with Mr Trump.",
    "Prosecutors said both payments were made by the National Enquirer, a US tabloid whose publisher is a long-time ally of Mr Trump.",
    "While a criminal conviction would not prevent Mr Trump from either running for president or from reclaiming the Oval Office, the prolonged legal fight could prove a major distraction for the Republican front-runner and may add a new layer of turmoil to his party\u2019s primary.",
    "Mr Trump is the focus of three other investigations, related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, and over his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House."
