  "original_title": "Is The BASL Undermining The Rule Of Law?",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "The\u00a0Organisation of Professional Associations\u00a0of Sri Lanka (OPA) must be called out on its sanctimonious statement issued obviously on behalf of its constituent member \u2013 BASL (Bar Association of Sri Lanka):\u00a0\u201cThe OPA firmly believes that in a representative democracy the elected representatives and the government are responsible for the sovereign people. Therefore, there is a constitutional responsibility to protect the independence of the judiciary and also to ensure that the rule of law is not undermined.\u201c (Colombo Telegraph\u00a0\u2018Protect Independence of the Judiciary: OPA\u2019)",
    "Prior to pontificating to the \u201cSpeaker of the Parliament\u201d and parliamentarians, should not the OPA first put its own house in order in regard to its constituent members \u2013 in this instance the BASL which has not even acknowledged receipt of my e-mail of 31 March 2023 sent to its \u2018Professional Purpose and Ethics\u2019 standing committee regarding an \u2018open and shut\u2019 case of a seemingly fraudulent \u2018Power of Attorney\u2019 which has been \u2018Certified and Attested\u2019 by a prominent attorney-at-law.",
    "The authorities are asked to believe that the \u2018Power of Attorney\u2019 of a former Chairman/Managing Director of arguably the country\u2019s most visible conglomerate has been voluntarily given after he is said to have placed his \u201cleft hand thumb impression\u201d under questionable circumstances.",
    "Despite it being widely known among the Colombo based business and professional community that this person is sadly incapacitated since July 2013 to date in every manner with the exception of breathing on his own, this attorney has claimed without corroboration from even a single qualified medical practitioner that this person \u201cappeared to be of sound mind memory and understanding and fully capable of any act requiring thought, judgment and reflection\u201d!",
    "This is not all, while tacitly accepting the authenticity of the \u2018Power of Attorney\u2019 provided by me, the attorney without any embarrassment states:",
    "\u201cthe law only requires\u00a0a Notary to satisfy himself as regards the mental capacity of the Executant\u201d.",
    "My demand that the attorney confirms that the \u2018Notary\u2019 can do so without the intervention of competent medical practitioners has been ignored.",
    "Since in the opinion of the attorney, the person giving the impugned \u2018Power of Attorney\u2019 (i) \u201cappeared to be of sound mind memory and understanding\u201d (ii) the given address of this person and his \u2018Attorneys\u2019 \u2013 wife and two adult children are one and the same (iii) the person concerned has never left the country since he fell ill in July 2013 \u2013 does not the question arise why there was a need for a \u2018Power of Attorney\u2019 in the first place?",
    "The \u2018Power of Attorney\u2019 is completely \u2018open ended\u2019 and gives his wife and two adult children untrammeled powers \u201cwithout limitation and with power to act jointly and/or severally and/or individually\u201d in regard to all his assets which includes his large holding of company shares and cash deposits.",
    "Is it not an anomaly for the person giving the \u2018Power of Attorney\u2019 and his \u2018Attorneys\u2019 to function at the same time? This maybe a first in this country!",
    "1) In the context of the general belief/understanding that the person giving the \u2018Power of Attorney\u2019 is definitely not of \u201csound mind memory and understanding\u201d, is it not unlawful/inappropriate for the conglomerate to have deemed it fit and proper to have this person as a \u2018Director\u2019 of an associate company? The question is whether here too he has placed his \u201cleft hand thumb impression\u201d on all connected documents?",
    "2) This person is also \u2018Chairman Emeritus\u2019 of this conglomerate.",
    "3) Coincidentally the legal chambers of this attorney is in a building owned by the wife of the Deputy Chairman & MD and major shareholder of this conglomerate.",
    "It is hoped the BASL will not emulate the corrupt CA Sri Lanka. I know a thing or two about corruption in the agency regulating the chartered accountancy profession in this country since I am the complainant to CA Sri Lanka on the professional misconduct of PwC and EY in relation to the fraudulent privatization of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC). The chartered accountants concerned have still not been made accountable. Some of them have entered the board rooms of this conglomerate.",
    "This \u2018open and shut\u2019 case is SYMPTOMATIC of the corruption plaguing this country. It could never occur if big business does not receive political cover which leads to impunity due to the nonchalance of regulatory agencies which in turn emboldens miscreant professionals. This is aided and abetted by the businessmen owned mainstream media hungry for advertising revenue.",
    "Let us see whether the \u2018Daily FT\u2019 which is the country\u2019s only stand-alone business newspaper which published \u2018OPA stands firm on independence of Judiciary\u2019 will publish this article?",
    "In most instances of whistle blowing, the standard practice of wrongdoers in this country is to \u2018shoot the messenger\u2019 with lies and deception or even the abuse of process of court which eventually is doomed to fail.",
    "Even if for argument the messenger is a \u2018nasty piece of work\u2019, are not the credibility of the message and the messenger two separate issues?",
    "Connected correspondence have been copied to inter-alia (i) Kaushalya Nawaratne \u2013 President, BASL (ii) Ms. Suranee Samarasekera \u2013 Administrative Secretary / CEO of BASL (iii) Ms. Wasantha Perera \u2013 Secretary, Ministry of Justice (iv) Pradeep Mahamuthugala \u2013 Supreme Court Registrar.",
    "Should not the BASL (i) acknowledge receipt of my e-mail dated 31 March 2023 sent to its \u2018Professional Purpose and Ethics\u2019 standing committee? (ii) demand from me a certified copy from the \u2018Land Registry\u2019 Colombo of \u2018Power of Attorney\u2019 No: 1137 dated 30 July 2017?",
    "It must be emphasized that amidst the \u2018bad eggs\u2019, there are some excellent principled professionals. The problem is their SILENCE as in this instance.",
    "The IMF which is supposed to be alarmed about systemic corruption in Sri Lanka better look deeper\u00a0 where the name of the game is impunity."
