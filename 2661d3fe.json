    "The Sri Lankan government has made it mandatory to test imported dried fish, sprats and fruits for heavy metals such as lead and arsenic with effect from today (June 01).",
    "The decision was taken after a survey conducted by the Food Control Administration Unit of the Health Ministry between 2021 and 2022 discovered that certain consignments of imported dried fish, sprats and fruits contain heavy metals, especially lead and arsenic, in large quantities.",
    "According to the survey, some imported fruit stocks contain alarming levels of lead \u2013 an extremely toxic heavy metal.",
