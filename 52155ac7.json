    "As a way of rewarding its remittance customer base for their loyalty, Pan Asia Bank has launched a new promotion wherein the top five customers who made highest remittances will win a sum of Rs. 50,000 every month.",
    "To be eligible for the new program, customers must remit their funds through one of the bank\u2019s remittance partners \u2013 Ria, Western Union or Small World \u2013 as over-the-counter cash pickups. This will continue until 31 December.",
    "Remittances from migrant workers have been supporting the country\u2019s economic growth for decades. As one of the trusted banks for Sri Lankans overseas, Pan Asia Bank\u2019s remittance service offers them a seamless experience in sending money to their loved ones in Sri Lanka.",
    "Pan Asia Bank\u2019s Chief Manager for Deposit Mobilisation Buddhika Perera said, \u201cWe believe this promotion is very timely. Overseas customers can remit large amounts as over-the-counter cash pickups for their loved ones to collect. In turn, we will reward their loved ones. Our base of remittance customers and value of remittances has been growing steadily which reflects the faith placed in the bank.\u201d"
