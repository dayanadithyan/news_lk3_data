    "\u201cMobile journalism is a tremendous step forward for the free flow of information in Sri Lanka,\u201d said USAID Mission Director Gabriel Grau. \u201cA well trained and responsible press is a cornerstone of democratic societies and especially important in these times when democracy is under pressure in so many places. USAID looks forward to the success of the Mojo Lanka Academy.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe are very excited to launch the MoJo Lanka Academy,\u201d said Jean MacKenzie, MEND\u2019s Chief of Party. \u201cMobile journalism offers a window into a society that is almost impossible to get any other way. Through the Mojolanka website and the upcoming festival, IREX is helping Sri Lankans acquire the skills to tell their stories.\u00a0 We feel strongly that this type of journalism has a very bright future, and we are happy to support its growth.\u201d"
