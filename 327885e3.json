    "In a backdrop where a lot of Sri Lankans are struggling to make their ends meet amid higher taxes and soaring utility bills, the country\u2019s first \u2018rage room\u2019 has been opened in Koswatta, Battaramulla.",
    "The concept of a rage room is well-known in modern countries. However, the idea of rage therapy is still alien to the Sri Lankan society. Rage rooms could provide a fun and entertaining way to vent out one\u2019s frustrations.",
    "Individuals can come with their friends, pick a package and smash objects. The concept is to allow people to have a fun experience while blowing off some steam, says Rage Academy founder Shaveen Perera.",
    "\u201cEven if you are not easily angered, rage rooms offer a quick adrenaline rush and a new experience. Most importantly, our rage room is completely judgement free. You can smash away your stress and walk out feeling like a better version of yourself,\u201d Perera said.",
    "\u201cHowever, our culture and its people would always find a way to condemn a new business idea. The misconception that rage rooms are inducing violence is complete hoax and that is because our country is so backward thinking,\u201d he added."
