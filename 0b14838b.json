  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says decision on polls is now in the hands of one all-powerful person",
    "Points out protests are being met with disproportionate force on the part of the Govt.",
    "Expresses his group\u2019s opposition to these actions of the Govt.",
    "Parliamentarian Prof. G.L. Peiris says at no time in the country\u2019s history were the country\u2019s people forced to agitate and demand timely elections.",
    "\u201cToday protests have become commonplace in the country and they are being met with disproportionate force on the part of the Government,\u201d the MP said, adding that in the past Sri Lankan people never had to get onto the streets, be baton charged, face water cannons and be admitted to hospital while profusely bleeding after being injured in order to demand elections to be conducted.",
    "The MP noted that while people are being obstructed from protesting, at the same time citizens are being prevented from going to the polling stations to mark their ballot papers. \u201cPeople cannot exercise their opposition to the Government by the exercise of freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution or the fundamental democratic right of voting at regular elections,\u201d he said.",
    "Noting that people in the past were always guaranteed the right to vote and never had to agitate for their rights, he said the question now before the people is if they should quietly submit to the situation or resist these despicable attempts to rid them of their constitutional rights.",
    "He said it now appears one all-powerful person is able to decide if the elections will be held or not. \u201cIt is according to that person\u2019s whims the holding of elections will be decided. If and when will it be held and if funds can be provided is up to him,\u201d he said. The MP noted there is no specific time frame now for elections to be held and said we are now under a dictatorial rule. \u201cWe do not accept this situation,\u201d Peiris said."
