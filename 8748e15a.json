    "Freedom People's Congress member Prof. Charitha Herath has called for a new political and economic reforms system to be implemented in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cThe current Government is an interim one. This is a successive period that we are currently facing,\u201d he said adding that the Government has not been able to find solutions for the country\u2019s economic issues. The MP made these comments at a press conference held yesterday.",
    "\u201cWe have only been able to secure funding from the IMF. Some say Ranil is good. Others are saying Ranil isn't. An internal split is visible,\u201d he said. The MP said old thinking is not what the country needs and instead needs a new political and economic reforms system. \u201cWe cannot recover without this,\u201d he added.",
    "The MP said that old ways of political parties speaking of past grandeur are no longer relevant and parties cannot play in the same playing field. \u201cBut the Government parties appears to think the country is their back yard. It so not. This is a country,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said by employing such measures one cannot win an entire country. \u201cIt doesn't matter if Pohottuwa appoints a new party or not,\u201d he added. The MP said family bandysm does not work in the current context.",
    "The MP commenting on the Government\u2019s moves to impose regulations on social media said this is not the answer to certain obstacles faced by the Government. \u201cThis will give rise to yet another citizen\u2019s struggle\u201d he said. The MP said the current Government is outdated in these regards. According to Herath, moves to regulate social media will only embarrass the country before the entire world."
