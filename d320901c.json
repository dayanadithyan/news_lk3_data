    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s National Water Supply and Drainage Board plans to increase the tariff in the near future as production costs have risen sharply following an increase in electricity prices, an official said.",
    "\u201cElectricity charges were increased in February, and that is a big component of the cost of production,\u201d an official from the National Water Supply and Drainage Board told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cAlong with that, the usage has also gone up during the month, and demand has increased by around 10 percent as the country is experiencing extremely hot weather conditions.\u201d",
    "Following the electricity tariff hike in 2022, the water tariff was also increased in September 2022.",
    "However, after the second electricity tariff hike in February 2023, no changes were made to the water tariff.",
    "The proposed tariffs will be run through the water board, the ministry, and will be presented to the Cabinet of Ministers for approval in the coming weeks, the official said.",
    "Last year the State Minister for Water Supply Sanath Nishantha said, the water tariff needs to be increased in order to get to a breakeven point as the water board is selling water incurring a loss at the moment.",

    "Nishantha said, the hike will be done in order to run the water board without the government\u2019s financial support. (April/May 01/2023)"
