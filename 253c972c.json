    "In a closely contested election in Finland, Petteri Orpo, the leader of the National Coalition Party, emerged as the winner, defeating Prime Minister Sanna Marin's centre-left party. Orpo secured 20.8% of the vote, narrowly ahead of the right-wing populist Finns Party, which won a record 20.1% of the vote. Marin's Social Democrats secured 19.9% of the vote. Although Marin's party increased its seats, it was a bitter defeat for her, given her popularity and success in steering Finland through the COVID-19 pandemic and towards NATO membership.",
    "Orpo pledged to begin negotiations with all parties, and the conservatives would have the first opportunity to form a government. However, forming a government would be challenging, requiring a coalition with either the Finns Party or the Social Democrats. Although Marin has been reluctant to state her aspirations, Finnish political culture is known for its flexibility and ability to negotiate and form compromises.",
    "Orpo, who has been in politics since the 1990s, is seen as a stable and calm career politician, lacking Marin's rock-star qualities. He is expected to pursue pro-European policies and emphasize economic policy. His victory was celebrated by his supporters, who see him as a sort of dream son-in-law. Despite the excitement surrounding Marin, many Finns view her as a polarizing figure. She faced heavy scrutiny last year over a video showing her singing, dancing, and drinking at a party. However, supporters saw the controversy as rooted in sexism and misogyny, leading to solidarity videos from women across Finland and around the world.",
