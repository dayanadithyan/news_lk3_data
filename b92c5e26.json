    "Twenty interrogatories have been served on Mr Jayaweera, some of the interrogatories are as to whether Hiru TV, Aruna Newspapers, online news websites telecast and published defamatory news items pertaining to the importation of Rapid Antigen Test Kits by the Plaintiff Company, and if so, did the Plaintiff Company institute legal action and if so, what are the case numbers?",
    "Did Dilith Jayaweera, Chairman of George Steuart Health (Pvt) Ltd institute action bearing DMR/216/2012 on the basis that he was defamed and by the said judgement in the said case, did court hold that Dilith Jayaweera, Chairman of George Steuart Health (Pvt) Ltd is not a person with good repute and character.?",
    "During that period, at a book-launch on 22.03.2019, of a book named Dadabbaraya, did Dilith Jayaweera, Chairman of George Steuart Health (Pvt) Ltd state in front of a large public audience, that he in fact consumes certain types of unlawful drugs and/or unlawful contraband; ie.

    "Mr.Sanath Wijewardane Attorney-at-Law appeared and objected to the application and informed the court that the interrogatories have been sufficiently answered by the Plaintiff and therefore there is no necessity for Dilith Jayaweera to be personally present in court.",
    "Having heard the submissions made by Mr Egalahewa PC for MTV, court overruled the objection raised by the Plaintiff\u2019s counsel and allowed the application of Mr.Uditha Egalahewa PC and ordered to issue notice on Dilith Jayaweera to be present in court on 18.05.2023 to answer the interrogatories.",
