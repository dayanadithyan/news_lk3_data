    "While many countries, even many European ones, are slow to make big moves in recognizing sex as a recreational activity, Sweden, in true trendsetter style, has not held back.",
    "This Nordic country was the first to register sex as a sport and is now all set to host the first-ever European Sex Championship which will be held on June 8. The championship is being organized by the Swedish Sex Federation and is open to anyone from any European Country.",
    "The tournament is expected to last for several weeks, with each participant having to compete for 6 hours a day. Challenges are bracketed under 16 disciplines, including seduction, oral sex, penetration and more.",
    "According to Dragan Bratych, the chairman of the Swedish Sex Association, the focus of sex as a sport is on maximizing pleasure, so the more pleasure one's partner experiences, the more points one earns. Creativity, strong emotions, imagination, physical fitness, endurance and workability are all under the scanner during the challenges.",
    "Contestants are also expected to be well-versed in the Kamasutra and will be given extra points for displaying as many of its disciplines in their challenges. During the final evaluation, winners will be determined through a 70-30 split; 70% audience votes and\u00a0 30% jury rating. According to the report, 20 contestants from different countries have already applied. The organizers have also expressed that sexual orientation can play a strategic role in this sport and believe that other European countries will adopt the same in the future.",
    "Sport has often been used as a loose term to apply to many weird and unusual activities such as wife-carrying, underwater hockey, extreme ironing, chess boxing - all legitimate sporting activities that a quick Google search will confirm. But none compare to Sweden's move to declare sex as a sport. As could be expected, the internet has a lot to say about it, both for and against.(Swirlster)"
