    "A mechanical engineer by profession and an environmentalist at heart, Ramveer Tanwar, gave up his promising career to take up full-time water conservation in India. The 30-year-old Tanwar from Gautam Buddha Nagar in India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh is affectionately called \u2018Pond Man\u2019 by his fellow countrymen for his tireless efforts in reviving India\u2019s water bodies including ponds, lakes and wetlands.",
    "Tanwar who founded the NGO, \u2018Say Earth\u2019 which is committed to revival of water bodies and creating environmental awareness, also provides consultancy to numerous like-minded organisations in India. On Tanwar\u2019s recent visit to Sri Lanka \u2013 his first ever to the island, to participate at the second SARNET (South Asia Rainwater Network) conference, Daily FT caught up with the water conservationist who has even been applauded by India\u2019s Premier Narendra Modi for his labours.",
    "The youngest of the five siblings, Ramveer Tanwar grew up in a pastoral setting in India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh. Born to a farming-family, young Tanwar often ferried himself between school and fields. While the family\u2019s herd of buffaloes were allowed to graze, Tanwar finished his homework and plunged into the waters, becoming a self-taught swimmer. \u201cSince my childhood I have had a great connection with water. And watching water bodies in the village dying in front of me kindled me to galvanise myself to revive them,\u201d recollects Tanwar.",
    "While reading for his degree in Mechanical Engineering at Uttar Pradesh Technical University (now known as Abdul Kalam Technology University/AKTU), Tanwar started tutoring youngsters in mathematics and physics as means of financing his studies. He was the first in his family to enter College. Together with his students, Tanwar launched the campaign \u2018Jal Chaupal\u2019 or Water Meeting in his village to urge people to conserve water and to save water bodies. In 2015 Tanwar and his team of volunteers including his students and their parents cleaned their first pond of all garbage and planted trees around it. Soon Tanwar was invited by neighbouring villagers to replicate the same in their settings as well. Tanwar\u2019s passion for pond-rejuvenating made his office colleagues name him \u2018Pond Man\u2019 \u2013 the title he is best known by today.",
    "In 2016, while his family was still celebrating his higher education and his lucrative job, Tanwar quit the same to become a full-time conservationist. \u201cFor about three months I pretended I was still doing my office job. Soon I was drained trying to keep it under the wraps,\u201d says the smiling \u2018Pond Man\u2019. Tanwar was a family man by this time with two young children and the family was dismayed by his bold decision to put his hard-earned engineering degree behind and to take up an \u2018unskilled job\u2019 as many would see it.",
    "In a conservative social setting, Tanwar\u2019s decision was even harder, he says. \u201cPond-cleaning is looked down upon by many as an illiterate man\u2019s job which requires no skill; a manual labourer\u2019s task for someone who cannot even dream of an office job. When I used to approach government agencies responsible for the water bodies in India, the officials used to give me that look, \u2018are you off your head?\u2019 kind-of,\u201d reminisces the activist who is now a trained conservationist. Having received his training at the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Ministry of Environment & Forests (MOEF) in India, Tanwar is a much sought after advisor and a consultant to government agencies and several NGOs committed to environmental protection and also a mentor to many young conservationists. Tanwar was recently appointed the brand ambassador of Swachh Bharat Mission, Ghaziabad and the district coordinator of the Groundwater Force by the Uttara Pradesh government.",
    "Watching Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledging Tanwar\u2019s efforts in reviving India\u2019s water bodies on national television was a momentous moment for the conservationist. Tanwar, who had to strive hard to source funds for the cause with public donations and the private sector, is today supported by some of the leading multinational giants as well. Looking back at his journey todate, Tanwar calls himself a lucky man and humbly admits that he is not doing anything extraordinary. \u201cI think we all have to play our part for the country and I\u2019m merely doing my role,\u201d says the advocate who mourns that India\u2019s rich hydraulic heritage is at stake with 40-50% of its water bodies already lost to the nation.",
    "The term \u2018pond\u2019, although would translate into a small, land-based body of water, is used to denote all kinds of water bodies including large lakes in his hometown, explains Tanwar whose mandate extends to all water bodies including wetlands. \u2018Pond revival\u2019 as the conservationist explains, is the process of bringing a pond back to its original condition where it fulfils its original purpose.",
    "\u201cA pond ideally serves three objectives: they support aquatic life, bio-diversity and human life. When a pond starts to fulfil these purposes, we say that the pond has been revived,\u201d explains Tanwar who goes on to note that a coordinated approach is required for each pond. \u201cWhile some are full of garbage, others may be full of aquatic weed, so each needs a different approach.\u201d",
    "With India now being the most-populated country, its water bodies are threatened more, reflects Tanwar who says that around 20,000 to 30,000 water bodies in the country have been lost in the past few decades due to overpopulation. A good number of traditional water bodies have lost their water-holding capacity which is also identified as one of the main causes of urban-flooding in India, he says. Although laws and policies are in place for rainwater harvesting (collecting and storing rainwater for later use) which serves as a flood mitigating tool as well, the implementation rate of it is only about 30%, says Tanwar.",
    "\u201cThe growing population will require more space to build and many water bodies are filled up. It is predicted that 40% of India will not have access to clean water by 2030 which is a serious situation.\u201d Although artificial rainwater harvesting systems have been adopted in urban India, natural water harvesting methods such as ponds cannot be undermined, maintains Tanwar. \u201cIn case of artificial water harvesting, although we can inject water into the systems, we cannot support biodiversity of aquatic life. On the contrary, natural ponds could support the entire ecosystem, the reason why it is critical that we conserve them.\u201d",
    "Habits die hard and it is the same with pollution, Tanwar says. \u201cRestoration of water bodies is no rocket science but changing people\u2019s minds is indeed rocket science,\u201d says the smiling environmentalist whose crusade has not been so easy. Empowering the public to be responsible for their water bodies has been no easy task for the conservationist. In a bid to make the exercise of reviving ponds a sustainable one, Tanwar has linked farmer communities with them, so that they are accountable for their waterbodies. \u201cIt is a win-win where they make a living out of the ponds either through fishing or lotus farming. But if their income is to be sustainable, they need to be responsible for the wellbeing of their ponds.\u201d",
    "To sensitise the younger generation about the \u2018back-end picture\u2019 of water, Tanwar launched the campaign \u2018Selfie with a pond\u2019 in 2018 which continues to date. \u201cAlthough the older generation did not have college degrees or apps on their mobile phones, they were more aware of their natural environment. Today many young people would not realise the connection between the natural water sources and tap-borne water. The main objective of the youth campaign I launched was to make them more sensitive to the water bodies in their hometowns.\u201d Participants had to take a \u2018selfie\u2019 with a pond and write an account of it- the observations of the state of the pond and recommended means of reviving it and post on social media.",
    "Tanwar who has revived 80 ponds in India so far, aspires to see a \u2018Pond Man\u2019 emerging for each village in India and also looks forward to possible collaborations with Sri Lanka. \u201cI\u2019d be the happiest to see my model replicated in Sri Lanka and even beyond as this is not to be one man\u2019s crusade but everyone\u2019s,\u201d he added."
