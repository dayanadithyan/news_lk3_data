    "In advocating Good Governance and Freedom of Expression, SLPI acts as an active agent that promotes one of the most vital legislations for Sri Lanka, \u201cThe Right to Information Act\u201d (RTI). ChangeMaker is developed as an interactive platform to promote RTI for the greater good of the general public and it compiles success stories and experiences of RTI users such as journalists and citizens. It also assists journalists and citizens to electronically create RTI requests, appeals and keep track of them in order to follow the process. The SLPI which was a pioneer in introducing RTI in Sri Lanka, expects that by introducing these types of tools and interventions more citizens can become a \u201cChange Agent\u201d in their humble contribution to achieve good governance in Sri Lanka."
