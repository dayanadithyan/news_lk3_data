    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The State need not engage in business as its mandate is to provide services such as education and maintain law & order, Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe said defending plans to divest government-held shares of seven state owned enterprises (SOEs).",
    "At a discussion held at the presidential secretariat Thursday March 23 morning, Wickremesinghe said responding to a question about the decision that Sri Lanka must no longer hold on to corporations and enterprises owned by the government.",
    "Sri Lanka has been spending more on the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) than it has been on education, he said.",
    "The following seven SOEs will undergo the divestment of state-held shars:",
    "Litro Gas Lanka Ltd., including Litro Gas Terminals (Pvt) Ltd., (LPG retailing)",
    "The State Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit of the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies will oversee the process, a statement said.",
    "\u201cNot all of them are loss making. We do have to repay debt. You can\u2019t keep these and pay back loans.",
    "\u201cIf we can\u2019t pay off our loans, we might have to sell something in the house and pay it,\u201d said Wickremesnghe.",
    "Asked why Sri Lanka should sell SOEs that aren\u2019t making losses, he responded: \u201cWhy is the state engaged in business? That\u2019s not our mandate. The state has no business engaging in business.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn what country is there a law that these should be there?\u201d he added.",
    "Noting that the crisis-hit island nation is trying to embark on a path of recovery and rapid development, President Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka must follow India\u2019s example.",
    "\u201cIndia is selling their airports, profit making ones. India has come to that stage. We have to go there too.\u201d (Colombo/Mar23/2023)"
