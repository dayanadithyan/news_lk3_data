  "original_body_lines": [
    "Excerpts of the committee report into former State Minister of Prison Management and Prisoners\u2019 Rehabilitation Lohan Ratwatte\u2019s forceful entry into the Anuradhapura and Welikada prisons and the ensuing events in September 2021 has now been released to the public.",
    "The release came after the Right to Information Commission issued an order in February this year, directing the Ministry of Justice to release the report compiled by retired High Court Judge Kusala Sarojini Weerawardena based on an appeal filed by a petitioner seeking the information. The full report into Ratawatte\u2019s controversial visits to the prisons is expected to be made public shortly. The petition had been filed by the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR).",
    "When the CSR had first submitted the RTI request to the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Prisons Reforms, it was rejected on the basis that the report and probe were ordered by the Cabinet and the information could not, therefore, be disclosed to the public.\u00a0 However, on appeal, it was discovered that the commission report is not a classified document and the Ministry of Justice was ordered to release the report to the information applicant or face legal action.",
    "The appeal was heard before RTI Commission Chairman Upali Abeyratne and members Attorney Kishali Pinto Jayawardena and Jagath Liyana Arachchi and A. M. Nahiya. The Commission delivering the order in February said legal action will be taken against the Ministry of Prisons under the powers vested in the 39th clause of the RTI Act if the latter does not comply."
