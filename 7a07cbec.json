    "The greatly anticipated and planned visit spanning nine days of Ajahn Brahmavamso is in its first week. Since his arrival on 22 May from Australia, he has been fully occupied with spreading the Dhamma in this island of ours. His itinerary was meticulously planned by the Ajahn Brahm Society of Sri Lanka (ABSSL) under the direction of Ven. Mettavihari.",
    "The nine day meditation retreat at Bandarawela for 157 persons comprising 55 bhikkhus, 44 bhikkhunis and 58 lay persons is ongoing at the National Holiday Resort managed by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Board. Meditators are housed in specially constructed temporary tents. Group sessions began on 23 May under the direct guidance of Ajahn Brahmavamso. Opportunities to receive personal guidance from Ajahn Brahm at appropriate interventions are also accommodated. The retreat ends on 28 May.",
    "The next item on the visiting Venerable Thera\u2019s busy schedule is the forum for invited participants from the business/professional community of Sri Lanka. This will be at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo on 29 May. It is both innovative and unique; the first time that professionals and businessmen have been invited for discussion and giving ear to what the Buddha said to persons of this category, which remains relevant even at present. Ajahn Brahmavamso with his Oxford University education, experience in life and as a world renowned meditating monk, is certainly the most unique person to guide such a forum.",
    "115 persons will be beneficiaries on this day. Each of the two sessions lasts 90 minutes, within which direct discussion with the Thera will be accommodated.",
    "Justifiably considered to be the highlight of the Venerable Thera\u2019s all too short visit to Sri Lanka is his making himself available to address the public. This much looked forward to event by the many, is on Tuesday 30 May at the BMICH starting at 7.00 a.m. and ending at 11.00 a.m. The ABSSL anticipates the presence of 5,000 persons from the free passes collected from the venues made known in mid-March.",
    "Suitable arrangements have been made to accommodate all pass holders in the main BMICH hall and in Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Halls A and B. Ajahn Brahm will deliver a Dhamma talk in the main hall, then another talk followed by a meditation session in Hall A. The focus when he is in Hall B will be answering questions which were already perused and collated. All halls are live\u2013linked enabling persons to see the Thera while listening to him. Ajahn Brahm\u2019s Dhamma talk in the main hall and key elements of questions asked will be supported by summary translation in Sinhala by Ven. Damita.",
    "The Ajahn Brahm Society of Sri Lanka kindly requests the public to be seated according to passes by 6.45 a.m. on 30 May, to enable the smooth commencement and progression of the program. Participants are advised to wear face masks and bring their drinking water."
