    "\"According to the statistics received, the dengue disease is getting out of control in the Gampaha District,\" he said.",
    "Rohana charged that this is a direct result of the failure of the National Dengue Control Unit and provincial officials to analyze data and take appropriate action at the correct time and that they act without a proper plan.",
    "Rohana requested the authorities to deploy officers and members of the public who have no technical knowledge and conducting dengue prevention programmes as the best opportunity to control the spread.",
