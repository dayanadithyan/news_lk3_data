    "Presents Graphene Oxide chemical to State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath",
    "State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath this week emphasised that now is the time to prioritise new research and scientific discoveries.",
    "In order to lay the foundation for the country\u2019s economy to grow, he emphasised the importance of developing new scientific discoveries and products that are integrated with cutting-edge technology and can be exchanged as value-added commodities with the rest of the world. This comment was made on Tuesday when the Bogala Graphite presented the chemical Graphene Oxide to the State Minister.",
    "The management of Bogala Graphite Company presented the chemical Graphene Oxide to Herath and informed him about the research products that were developed using this chemical.",
    "The Bogala Graphite Company highlights that Graphene Oxide has the potential to be utilised as a value-added element in the production of chemicals, cement, rubber, and plastics. The company further notes that if the ongoing research proves successful, the chemical can be utilised for the production of cement, rubber, and plastic in Sri Lanka.",
    "Graphene Oxide is a chemical that is subpar to Graphene. Graphene is a powerful chemical with electrical conductivity 200 times that of iron and 100 times that of copper metal. It is not possible to mix the chemical with cement or rubber. However, the chemical produced by Bogala Graphite Institute is Graphene Oxide chemical, the specialty of this chemical is that it can be mixed with cement or rubber and can also be used in the production of cement and rubber to increase its strength.",
    "State Minister Herath said that the opportunity to introduce such inventors to the international community will be available at the Industry 4.0 and 5.0 international conference and exhibition, which is scheduled to take place this year.",
    "\u201cPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe wishes to guide the country toward a digital economy,\u201d Herath said, adding that such new research and products are a significant step forward in this regard.",
    "Herath expressed gratitude for the Bogala Graphite Institute\u2019s discovery and stated that as a result of this discovery, Sri Lanka has the potential to produce cement, rubber, and plastic with high quality and value.",
    "Bogala Graphite Institute Managing Director Amila Jayasinghe and Anura Liyanage, who conducted this research, and a group of institute officials attended this event."
