    "All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja inspired the Chennai Super Kings to a 15-run win over the Gujarat Titans on Tuesday, reaching the Indian Premier League final for the tenth time in 16 editions of the tournament.",
    "The Titans, champions last year in their debut season, chasing a target of 173 were bowled out for 157 off the final ball of their innings, with Jadeja taking 2 for 18 in his four overs.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Maheesh Theekshana was similarly frugal, taking 2 for 28 in his four-over quota, while sling-arm pace bowler Matheesha Pathirana also took a brace of wickets, although at more than nine runs an over.",
    "Earlier, Jadeja made 22 off 16 deliveries, one of a handful of scores that pushed Chennai to a defendable score.",
    "The Super Kings were in control through the first half of their innings, well placed on 85 for no loss after 10 overs.",
    "The Gujarat bowlers pulled things back picking up regular wickets thereafter, before Chennai plundered 35 runs off the final three overs.",
    "The Titans lost two wickets in the powerplay overs of their innings and struggled to keep up with the required run rate, as Jadeja and Theekshana tightened the screws.",
    "Chennai withstood a late challenge from Rashid Khan, who struck 30 off 16 to give the Titans a whiff at victory, but Dhoni\u2019s team outlasted Khan to seal the win.",
    "While four-time champions Chennai move into the final, Gujarat will have another shot at making the May 28 final in Ahmedabad, when they face the winners of eliminator 1 between the Lucknow Super Giants and five-time champions Mumbai India.",
    "Chennai Super Kings 172/7 in 20 overs (Ruturaj Gaikwad 60, Devon Conway 40, Mohammed Shami 2/28, Mohit Sharma 2/31)",
    "Gujarat Titans 157 in 20 overs (Shubman Gill 42, Ravindra Jadeja 2/18, Maheesh Theekshana 2/28, Deepak Chahar 2/29, Matheesha Pathirana 2/37)"
