    "The People\u2019s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) claims that the 2023 Local Government (LG) polls are unlikely to be held on 25 April, in light of the current situation.",
    "Speaking in this regard, the Executive Director of PAFFREL, Rohana Hettiarachchi, accused the government of acting in a manner that was inconsiderate of the court\u2019s orders.",
    "Hettiarachchi further stated that the question of concern as of now is whether the government accepts that holding elections at \u2018the right time\u2019 is a democratic right of the people.",
    "\u201cIf the government does not give people the opportunity to express their opinion, then they (the government) must also accept responsibility for the adverse consequences that arise when people exercise their rights outside of the democratic framework\u201d, he said in this regard."
