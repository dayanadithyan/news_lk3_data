    "StrEdge Group is promoting technology consultancy for effective business transformation in diverse enterprises.",
    "The company said the impact of digital transformation in business is overwhelming, driving businesses to be more competitive in local and international markets. Nevertheless, certain gaps in terms of technology transformation and lack of internal and external resources to identify the required technology needs, leave many businesses, largely SMEs and mid-corporates striving to reach the next level.",
    "StrEdge Group said it is positioned to offer consultancy for need assessment before hiring a technology company for a solution. Armed with expertise in multiple segments of business, StrEdge helps businesses identify their need first and then explore best-suited and cost-effective technology solutions in the market.",
    "\u201cNeed identification is fundamental in all tech solutions, and once the need of each business is identified, business owners can find suitable tech-vendors out in the market independently,\u201d said StrEdge Tech Solutions CEO Udaya Samaradivakara.",
    "The contribution of SMEs to the economy is enormous, yet the lack of knowledge to identify the technology requirements for the current and future business needs of their own, leave many businesses challenged, stifling their technological growth and true potential.",
    "\u201cAs a home-grown company exposed to best global practices, our consultants and business analysts are geared to assist businesses to address this gap, and thereby give more muscle to SMEs which play a critical role in our economy,\u201d Samaradivakara added.",
    "StrEdge\u2019s Technology Need Analysis Consultation Package focusing on SMEs and mid-corporates is specially designed to ascertain the technology requirement in moving from their current state to the future desired state. This analysis will provide an in-depth study and guidance for businesses to raise a RFP for them to go to the market and hire a suitable technology solution. It will also highlight the current gaps in the processes and gaps in HR which will be challenging for technology implementation. The competency and experience of StrEdge as a consultancy group offering holistic solutions, has enabled businesses to align their processes and people for an effective digital transformation. The StrEdge approach will certainly increase the ROI on the potential investments in technology, especially in SMEs and mid-corporates, said StrEdge Group Director Janaka Epasinghe.",
    "\u201cWe, as a group, at all times offer the 360-view in all what we do for the optimal outcome,\u201d says StrEdge Advisory CEO Sumedha Wijesekera who noted that this approach will help businesses make empowered decisions in their \u2018business transformation\u2019 journey. \u201cThis helps our economy grow to greater heights which can be considered one of the most important national needs at this hour,\u201d he added."
