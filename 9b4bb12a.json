    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013\u00a0 Sri Lanka\u2019s shares edged down in mid day trade on a wait and see approach on domestic debt restructuring assurances and investors pulling out and selling off their shares as interest rates become unmanageable, an analyst said.",
    "The main All Share Price Index was down 0.89 percent or 78.37 points to 8,701.84, while the most liquid index S&P SL20 was down 1.38 percent or 34.12 points to 2,473.19.",
    "\u201cThere is nothing happening in the market, investors are clearly on a wait and see approach and selling out cause of interest rates becoming unbearable, margin rates are 36 percent and investors don\u2019t want to gatekeep shares for the long run cause of the rate of interest,\u201d an analyst said.",
