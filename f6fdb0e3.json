    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s external debts seeming to be sustainable on a forward looking basis after the financial assurances from its creditors, the International Monetary Fund said after its Executive Board approved near $3 billion, 48-month loan.",
    "The loan approval came after President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s government implemented several structural adjustments including tax hikes, raising electricity tariff in line with market prices, and pledging to bring in laws for more independent central bank and to fight against corruption.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s public debt has shot up to an unsustainable 128.1 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) by end 2022 and from 89 percent three years ago, while the foreign borrowing has risen to an unprecedented 64.4 percent of the GDP, the IMF data showed.",
    "\u201cIn Sri Lanka\u2019s case, the debt is not yet sustainable,\u201d Peter Breuer, Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka told a post-approval media briefing.",
    "\u201cBut with the financial assurances that have been provided, It is seeming to be sustainable on a forward looking basis. So it is up to the authorities to find ways how to meet these targets and ensure it is matched.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka has declared sovereign debt default in April last year after it ran out of dollars to repay its loans. The island nation has borrowed beyond its means under successive governments to consumptions and repay past loans amid failure to raise revenue.",
    "\u201cExpenditures are higher than revenues. So there is a significant efforts underway to bring in some balance there,\u201d Breuer said."
