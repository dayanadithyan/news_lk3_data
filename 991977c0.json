    "Says President and his cohorts are alarmed at the new political changes taking place in SL",
    "Claims public now understands that they have been tricked and their monies stolen by unscrupulous politicians",
    "Accuses Wickremesinghe of choosing a playing field of violence and chaos but says the NPP will not be drawn in and will instead defeat him peacefully and democratically",
    "National People\u2019s Party (NPP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake says 9 March, the date set for the Local Government elections in Sri Lanka will mark the end of traditional politics. He says Sri Lankan politics is taking a different turn today.",
    "\u201cTill today, politicians oppressed the people and were above the common man. They came into power through the votes of the people and forgot them in the end. Instead of developing the country, they worked towards the enrichment of their families and friends.",
    "\u201cWhen it came to another election, they would visit villages, and distribute liquor and job applications to trick the people. This has been the traditional political framework in Sri Lanka for the past decades,\u201d he said. Dissanayake made these comments while attending a political rally in Akuressa on Thursday.",
    "\u201cThis repugnant and unsuccessful form of politics will be brought to an end on 9 March. But the rulers will not come down from the terrace they are currently on easily,\u201d the NPP Leader noted.",
    "Dissanayake said if the political change expected to take place on 9 March was a traditional one, then polls would be allowed to go ahead as scheduled without any hindrance. He said however that President Ranil Wickremesinghe and his cohorts have realised the change on 9 March will not be a traditional one and are now alarmed by the change.",
    "\u201cToday a new form of politics unexpected by them has arisen in Sri Lanka. The time of fooling people is now over. The people now understand that billions belonging to them have been stolen and that they possess the true power in the country,\u201d he said.",
    "The NPP Leader said the people are now fatigued by their own decisions when it comes to appointing rulers. \u201cIf the people\u2019s aspirations are to come true, the compass must win on 9 March and the current rulers be ousted,\u201d he added.",
    "Noting that the Government is attempting to delay elections, Dissanayake said Wickremesinghe does not have a liking for elections which is a reflection of the people\u2019s opinion. \u201cInstead, he prefers a playing field of violence and chaos. But we would like to tell him the NPP will not play against him on such a field despite his efforts to draw them in.",
    "\u201cInstead, we will defeat him and his attempts to shut down elections peacefully, and democratically together with the people that respect human rights and the legal system. We will defeat him even prior to the holding of polls,\u201d Dissanayake added."
