    "The Department of Commerce (DOC) as the implementation agency of the UK GSP Scheme in Sri Lanka, organised a briefing session with the UK Team for the existing UK exporters registered with the DOC, potential exporters and its staff.",
    "The main objective of the briefing was to explore opportunities in the UK market under the DCTS. It was an attempt to enhance exports, diversify the export basket, introduce value added products, identify niche markets, and understand ways to increase the UK GSP utilisation rate.",
    "The UKDIT Team and the exporters representing apparel, tea, rubber, coconut, spices, fish, herbal and Ayurvedic products, beverages, animal feed, gems and jewellery, boat building, herbal and Ayurvedic products applauded the initiative taken by the Bilateral Affairs Division of the DOC in promoting exporters\u2019 products and establishing direct contacts between the UKDIT and the Sri Lankan businesses.",

    "It was an opportunity to receive first-hand information about the UK\u2019s new DCTS from the visiting UK team. They explained that the DCTS is aimed at helping developing countries to prosper and support sustainable growth in developing countries. Sectors such as tea, rubber, pet food, ship building were some areas that were identified by the UK Government for further analysis in facilitating the Sri Lankan exporters.",
    "Ministry of Trade, Commerce and Food Security Secretary A.M.P.M.B. Atapattu, Acting Director General of Commerce Gilma Dahanayake, and Bilateral Affairs Division Head Dr. Lakmini Mendis joined the discussion with the UK team.",
    "Discussions pivoted around penetrating the UK market, future direction of trade policy to integrate into the global economy and playing an active role in supply chains and working in collaboration to achieve objectives of both countries through this unilateral preferential scheme. Along with the launch of the UK DCTS in Sri Lanka, DOC established a desk for DCTS inquiries and introduced a QR Code for more information about the scheme as well.",
