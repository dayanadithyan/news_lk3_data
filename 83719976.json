    "The people of most countries in the world live hard lives due to the cold climates, but the people of Sri Lanka are fortunate enough to live without such conditions. It is a matter of great joy for the people who are affected by the cold climate to come to Sri Lanka even once. This training and research institute can be made into a place where the country can receive great contributions.",
    "While addressing the opening event, the minister said a Cabinet paper has been prepared to take necessary actions to provide compensation for the wildlife officers who are serving the department without considering their lives, and about Rs. 1,050 million has been spent and American aid (USAID) has been received for this purpose.",
