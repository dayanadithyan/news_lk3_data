    "The Sri Lankan Parliament should condemn Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeu for making a false allegation that there was a Tamil genocide during the civil war in Sri Lanka, MP Samanpriya Herath said today.",
    "\u201cWe have heard that the Prime Minister of Canada has said there has been a genocide of Tamils during the war in Sri Lanka. We all are aware that Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims suffered as a result of the war in Sri Lanka. Also, it has to be noted that the Sri Lankan Security forces were not engaged in a war with the Tamil community. In that situation I suggest that the Canadian Prime Minister's statement be condemned,\u201d the MP said.",
    "Sri Lanka recently stated its objections to the statement made by the Canadian Prime Minister. Accordingly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry summoned the Canadian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka and registered the government's objections to the recent speech made by the Canadian Prime Minister. (Yohan Perer and Ajith Siriwrdana)"
