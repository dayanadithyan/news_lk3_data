    "Global pioneers in sustainable integrated glove manufacturing, Dipped Products PLC (DPL), a subsidiary of the Hayleys Group, commenced commercial operations at its state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Biyagama, in line with its ambitious diversification into precision-engineered sports gloves.",
    "Constructed with an investment of Rs. 1.3 billion, the new facility aims to leverage DPL\u2019s exceptional scientific and technical expertise in producing gloves for industrial, household and medical applications to design and build sports gloves that offer maximum performance, protection and comfort.",
    "\u201cWe are excited to formally commence the production of DPL\u2019s precision-engineered sports gloves. Globally the segment is expected to hit $ 1.7 billion by 2027, and we see immense potential for DPL to capture significant market share. Our goal is to combine our nation\u2019s well-established apparel manufacturing capabilities with DPL\u2019s highly advanced technical capabilities in industrial hand protection to produce high quality, premium sports gloves right here in Sri Lanka,\u201d DPL Managing Director Pushpika Janadheera said.",
    "DPL will initially produce 10 new categories of custom-designed sports gloves including cycling, mountain biking, golf, baseball batting, American football, equestrian, winter sports, running and functional fitness, motorbikes and weight lifting.",
    "Weaving sustainability into its core process, the manufacturer has taken measures to locally source up to 60% of its raw materials \u2013 which include recycled yarn from PET bottles and recyclable/biodegradable packaging.",
    "DPL is pursuing Platinum LEED certification: the highest level of certification awarded by the US Green Building Council (USGBC). Developed by USGBC, LEED is a globally recognised program for buildings that are designed, constructed, maintained, and operated for improved environmental and human health performance. LEED buildings have a positive impact on the triple bottom line: people, planet and profit\u2013 reducing pollution, increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, while also creating healthier places for people.",
    "Accordingly, DPL will be investing in the holistic enhancement of sustainability standards spanning energy and water consumption \u2013 including the establishment of comprehensive water treatment and recycling as well as rainwater harvesting facilities, in addition to waste management, materials, health, and indoor environmental quality.",
    "The facility will also feature significant solar power generation capabilities, utilising 17,000 square feet of rooftop to produce 325 kilowatts \u2013 equivalent to approximately 110% of the facility\u2019s total energy requirements.",
    "Established in 1976, Dipped Products is one of the world\u2019s leading rubber glove manufacturers and accounts for a 5% global market share. With a manufacturing capacity of 16 million, DPL is the largest household gloves producer in Sri Lanka. The company\u2019s products now reach 70 countries."
