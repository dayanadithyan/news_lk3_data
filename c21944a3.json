    "Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa has denounced Pastor Jerome saying the controversial Pastor is disturbing religious harmony.",
    "\u201cWe vehemently oppose the statement made by Pastor Jerome who had made irresponsible statements. The statement he made on Buddhism will disturb harmony and coexistence. Therefore we denounce him to the maximum,\u201d Premadasa said in a special statement.",
    "\u201cI am extremely saddened by the statement made by this pastor, as a person who believes in Buddhism and is dedicated to safeguarding the religion. We are living in an era where religious and ethnic harmony is needed more than ever before. Therefore the irresponsible statement made by Pastor Jerome will unleash religious violence, hatred and it will release anger. Buddhism is a global religion. It promotes love to all beings, good behavior. The truth in Buddhism teaches to respect other religions. No one has the right to insult Buddhism,\u201d Mr. Premadasa said.",
    "The entire country is awake and watchful with regard to the issue pertaining to Pastor Jerome,\u201d he added.",
    "Mr. Premadasa\u2019s statement comes a day after Former MP P. Harison challenged Premadasa to come up with a statement on Pastor Jerome. (Yohan Perera)"
