    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) to introduce a mobile application for tourist to buy tickets to visit historic sites an official said amid concerns over higher prices charged from tourists.",
    "The price difference between the ticket price for foreigners and locals in Sri Lanka when visiting places has resurfaced as the country struggles to attract more tourists as the economy is contracting with purchasing power of consumers hit by a currency collapse.",
    "\u201cWe know there is a price difference, and we will address it, but not immediately,\u201d SLTDA Chairman Priantha Fernando said. \u201cWe know where our country\u2019s economy is at right now, and we need the dollars as well.\u201d",
    "Several tourists who visited Sri Lanka during 2023 have asked why the country is expensive for tourists and why there is a massive price difference between the foreign and local tickets.",
    "In Anuradhapura, the capital of one of the oldest historic kingdoms the charge is around 25 dollars per tourist. Polonnaruwa a later historic city is similarly priced. Sigiriya, another historic site is 30 dollars.",
    "When visiting eight sacred places and sites such as Sigiriya kingdom.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s say a 30-dollar ticket for a foreigner to visit a site is nothing much apart from low-end tourists,\u201d Fernando said.",
    "\u201cIt is unfortunate to have such a gap between the local and foreign prices. They have a local rate for a local. In other countries, if we were confronted because we are the foreigner in that country, we would have to pay a higher rate.\u201d",
    "Compared to Sri Lanka Vietnam\u2019s My Son historic city ticket is 150,00 dong (about 6 dollars). Indonesia\u2019s Borobudor costs 25 dollars. However tourist tickets are given a higher level of service with separate toilet and facilities to make tea or drink water before exiting.",
    "However, tourists who understand the situation of this country accept the fee that is being charged, Fernando said.",
    "\u201cYou feel a bit discriminated because you are a foreigner and all, but some people accept the fact that we are a developing country, we need the dollars, they know our situation and if we point it out correctly and project ourselves, this misunderstanding would mitigate to a great extent,\u201d Fernando said.",
    "\u201cBut I feel we have to come up with a mechanism, and we are working with travel apps. There will be a travel app where they can buy the ticket online, so that feeling of discrimination or the prices will not be an issue there.\u201d",
    "At one time a single cultural triangle ticket was available, which covered multiple site and museums, which reduce the hassle for tourists. (Colombo/April16/2023)"
