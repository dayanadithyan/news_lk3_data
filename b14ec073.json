    "An open and accountable government to avoid ineffectiveness of public institutions and eliminate the distance between public institutions and people was discussed at length at the Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee on the subject recently.",
    "The discussion held at the committee meeting held under the Chairmanship of Jagath Kumara Sumithraarachchi reviewed the role of important public institutions which are in direct contact with the public, and which can address a large number of public concerns, needs and grievances, and formulate a program for guiding and monitoring them.",
    "Former Presidential Secretary Udaya Seneviratne, Former Ayurvedic Commissioner Dr. Gamini Kariyawasam, Former Senior DIG Sunil Edirisinghe, Industrial Development Board Chairman Dr. Saranga Alahapperuma, Former Secretary of the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training Sandhya Wijebandara, Former Ministry Secretary Siripala Wirithamulla, Former Immigration and Emigration Controller General Sarath Rupasiri and Former District Secretary Sunil Kannangara participated in the discussion.",
    "There was a discussion at length about the actions to be followed to avoid the ineffectiveness of the government institutions and to eliminate the distance between the government institutions and the people. It was emphasised that it is more important to form an organisation by connecting local village leaders, viharadhipathi theros, other religious leaders, village workers, retired principals, and other local leaders and the police to discuss and find solutions to local problems.",
    "In 2019, the views on the \u201cGama Surakuma\u201d program implemented under the Cabinet approval were presented to the Committee and since it has become inactive, the Chair of the Committee asked the panel of experts to submit the proposal related to that program to the Committee.",
    "In addition, the panel of experts pointed out that although there are rules and regulations related to administration, it is problematic that those rules and regulations are not implemented properly and it is important to maintain the process properly and monitor its operation in an active manner.",
    "Furthermore, it was discussed that the proper implementation and updating of systematic systems designed for various processes related to government institutions is important for the efficiency of government institutions as well as for the good relations between those institutions and the people.",
    "Furthermore, it was emphasised that the panel of experts further stated that the decentralisation of the functions and powers of the institutions has the ability to overcome the inconveniences caused to the people, and the establishment of a proper national policy for public institutions and its good functioning in practice is important for building an open and responsible government.",
    "MPs W.D.J. Seneviratne, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Mohomad Muzammil, Udayana Kirindigoda, Marjan Faleel, Mayantha Dissanayake, Rajika Wickramasinghe were present at the Committee meeting held."
