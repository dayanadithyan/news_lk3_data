    "Despite rains having comparatively decreased, the Public Health Inspectors' Union (PHIU) warned that Sri Lanka is not out of the woods yet in terms of the dengue outbreak.",
    "Speaking to Daily Mirror, PHIU Secretary Indunil Bopitiya said Sri Lanka would continue to witness cases until the month of August as showers are expected in the next couple of months as well.",
    "\u201cThe average lifespan of an Aedes mosquito in nature is two weeks. The mosquito can lay eggs about three times in its lifetime, and about 100 eggs are produced each time. In this context, there are a lot of breeding places undetected in the country, which could result in more infections,\u201d he pointed out.",
    "Hence, Bopitiya requested people to keep their surroundings clean in order to keep dengue at bay. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
