    "Remember the bygone years! Daughters got married and became pregnant a few rounds more than the current rate. The average production line extended to a foursome. Some even went further, \u201cA\u201d team types and came close to two digit figures of adding new inhabitants to walk the planet.",
    "Today the story is different. \u201cOne is enough and he will get all we have,\u201d is quite a common comment and a few over-step the planned reproduction limitations purely by accident and reach the second round. Either way the count is kept low relative to the statistics of the previous generations.",
    "Let\u2019s make a few comparisons, I do recall the yesteryear, same show, as common as grass blades. The drum major of a mother-in-law invaded and took over the whole show, lock stock and cradle. Of course she did not come alone but with Asilin or Cicilin who was her lifetime faithful in the domestic department, Mary and the little lamb type who accompanied her everywhere. That was it!",
    "The husband and the mother to be had no chance, the whole traditional rigmarole was performed from tying a one cent coin to the \u2018buriya\u2019 to feeling the head lest it will not shape and the new born ends up looking like a miniature ET. And the cradle, it did its own rounds, booked at the conception to be borrowed at confinement. This here is a jealously protected family heirloom that had served the entire family tree and may have lasted so long that the mother herself had laid on it and swung crying for milk. Talk of sentimentality! Man, you only had to use your nails and chip a bit to see pink and blue layers covering each other on the cradle wall, a sure sign of the different types that started life here.",
    "Of course the grandmother duties lasted till the new \u2018mama\u2019 learnt the tricks of bathing and feeding and the rest that went along with the show. Then it was time to go. The bonus was there, Asilin or Cicilin was left behind in reserve mode; just in case the new mother found the going a bit too demanding. Don\u2019t forget this wasn\u2019t the diaper age, a dozen nappies hung like white bats on a long line to dry, hand-washed and hand-ironed.",
    "The fairy tale so begun continued. The other daughter residing in Galle, then the favourite niece in Kandy, they all needed the major-domo. Each one getting ready, \u201con your marks\u201d mode to contribute to the population explosion. Nothing like having the Mother Hubbard around, at times a little painful, but great asset, one had to weigh the pros and cons and compromise. Heads she wins, tails she wins too. That\u2019s how it all happened; we\u2019ve seen the script which hardly changed except for the granny actress. They all were the same, they only differed by name.",
    "Now the tune has changed. The elder daughter lives in Texas and the younger one is in Wellington. Tickets have to come and no Asilin and Cicilin, it is the Major Domo who has to trudge alone changing planes. She sits long hours in cheese class totally ignored by the Trolley Dollies (they do not know this here is a baby bringing expert) and she makes it to the destination before the baby pops out. Of course this is all done in happy mode and very convenient too for the daughters and sons-in-law to have these \u2018know-alls\u2019 coming across continents to take over baby matters.",
    "If you are lucky, the Seeya gets spared, but you could be unlucky too. The grandfather duties are so different from the Major Domo\u2019s. Travel half the world to sit and wait like yesterday\u2019s newspaper and maybe push the cart and carry the bags at the supermarket and come home and taste Shiraz and watch HBO. The neighbours are there but they only nod, and their kids maybe thinking you are from \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d with your chocolate-coloured face. It certainly is a solitary game for the Seeya, far removed from the chaotic serenade that he lives in Sri Lanka.",
    "And lo and behold if you object to accompanying the major domo, you have no choice, like the centipede who was asked to put his best foot forward. You refuse! The entire family tree would fall on you, from the trunk to the little leaves in condemnation; best make the trip, at least can come back home and tell the drinking buddies in counterfeited glee how great the first world is.",
    "The seasons too play a big part in this. If the birth is in the summer, great! But it would be otherwise, and the poor Major Domo now has to wrap herself in anything and everything to fight the chilly winter gray. Have to be like puss-in-boots inside the house, wearing the fluffy pink or indigo moccasins that were left behind by the other granny who arrived on holiday two years ago.",
    "The pre-journey preparation is something else. The bag can carry only so much weight but the entire grocery store has to go. Juggery, Lamprais Rai, Achcharu, milk toffee, and a bit of this and that which includes Siddhalepa and Dilmah tea and if space permits some Keell\u2019s sausages too (as if you cannot buy such things in the first world.)",
    "Of course now you\u2019ve got to find some friend who has a friend who knows a friend working at the airport to tilt the scale a bit for the over-weight. Can be done, of course this is Sri Lanka.",
    "Last week I spoke to a fellow Caucasian pilot who had just opened his innings as a grand-father. \u201cYes the baby was born, all normal, and Helen will go next month to London to see our grandson.\u201d Great, Helen will go and perhaps stay in a hotel and do an evening visit or two and return. Life goes on and my pilot friend is nailed to where he is, baby arrivals have no effect on him, he is just the grandfather who will post them a card with a stork carrying a baby that says \u201cCongratulations.\u201d",
    "Well, we can laugh at our Sri Lankan ways, but let\u2019s be happy that we have them. I have already been given instructions that I have to be in Melbourne, to drink Shiraz and watch HBO and carry shopping bags at the super market. But I will gladly go, for that is what we are. The first world can have all its glitter and gloss that is great. But we in our turpentine polish raise our heads too and run, Major-Domo leading, grandfather following, all to be present to bring back that \u201cold home feeling\u201d in a far away land.",
    "That\u2019s us, it is the Sri Lankan way, and no grandmother grudges that and no grandfather can afford to grumble. She is the \u201cmust\u201d for the occasion and he is the also ran, simply there not to win but to take part. Coubertin should have thought of grandfathers when he coined his great Olympic slogan. Yes, the trend is globe-trotting Vinnambu-ammas and they have come to stay, to fly to wherever they are needed to run the entire show when the grandchildren are born.",
    "When your daughters get married and go abroad and settle down in Toronto or Timbuktu that is a sure sign to begin the merry-go-round ride. Mother certain, father maybe, just be ready. It is only a matter of time before the call comes to pack the bags and go.",
