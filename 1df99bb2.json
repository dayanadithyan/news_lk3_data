    "The Kandy Police launched an investigation into turning genuine precious stones valued at Rs. 8 million into imitations by three men who called over at a leading business establishment in Kandy which is dealing with gems and jewellery.",
    "Police said the suspects who examined several gems under the pretext of buyers, had reportedly replaced the original precious stones with fake atones and fled the area.",
    "The gem merchant who noticed the reduced weight of the gem examined it to find that it was just a piece of cut and polished glass to imitate the genuine one.",
    "Police said the tricksters would have deployed an individual first to take a photo of the gem and turn out the fake gem.",
    "A senior police official said they were examining the CCTV footage in the showroom and in the surrounding area to net the culprits.",
    "A police team of the crime branch is conducting further investigations on the instructions of HQI Kandy, CI Rasika Sampath. (Shane Seneviratne)"
