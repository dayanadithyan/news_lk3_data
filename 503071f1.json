    "In a significant move aimed at preserving the nation\u2019s religious harmony President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday instructed the Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles, to immediately establish a dedicated police unit to take action against those threatening the peaceful coexistence among communities in the country.",
    "It is reported the swift decision comes after the President was briefed about an organised attempt by certain groups across the country to create religious disharmony through various acts. It is said the President was presented with intelligence information that similar incidents reported recently were not isolated incidents but were in fact a concerted effort to cause embarrassment to the Government.",
    "Accordingly, Wickremesinghe has now instructed his Senior Advisor on National Security Sagala Ratnayake to discuss the matter with Alles and take appropriate action. The unit\u2019s primary objective will be to protect the country\u2019s religious harmony and take decisive action against any individuals or groups that pose a threat to communal peace.",
    "Meanwhile over the weekend Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Vidura Wickramanayaka announced that the Government will present a draft bill in Parliament shortly to prevent the distortion of religion and to ensure religious freedom.",
    "In the latest incident, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) yesterday arrested controversial monk Rajanganaye Sadhdharathana Thera over allegations of making comments that threaten religious harmony in Sri Lanka.",
    "The Thera, who is known for his harsh and inflammatory speeches in videos uploaded to his personal Youtube page was arrested based on a complaint lodged by Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera. He was presented before the Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday and remanded till 7 June.",
    "On Sunday the Police also arrested stand-up comedian Nathasha Edirisuriya over making alleged derogatory comments about the Lord Buddha. The complaint against her was lodged by the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs. The CID has charged her under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act. She was also remanded till 7 June by the same court.",
    "Meanwhile, the CID is also probing certain comments made by self-proclaimed Pastor Jerome Fernando. Fernando has managed to avoid arrest by remaining abroad. Last week he filed a Fundamental Rights petition through his lawyers seeking an order from the Supreme Court to prevent his possible arrest by the CID on his return to Sri Lanka."
