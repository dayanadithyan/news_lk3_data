    "Since its resumption of international scheduled flight operations between Jaffna and Chennai after the global pandemic, Alliance Air completed its 100th flight to Jaffna International Airport (JIA) today,",
    "Alliance Air, a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India Asset Holdings Pvt Ltd. (AIAHL), recommenced commercial flight operations from Chennai International Airport (MAA) to JIA on December 12, 2022.",
    "At present, the airline operates four scheduled international flights a week, and is planning to increase its frequency to daily operations between Jaffna and Chennai.",
    "Up to date in 2023 the airline has handled approximately 12,000 passengers through the Northern Gateway. The Airport & Aviation Services (SL) Limited (AASL) ground handling team has provided all ground handling services for these flights, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for all passengers.",
    "Considering the growing demand for air travel from the northern part of the country, Alliance Air tapped that potential, and with the support of the governments of India and Sri Lanka, this direct flight operation between Jaffna and Chennai will enormously boost the tourism industry of Sri Lanka, especially in the Northern Province, offering better connectivity to all South Indian destinations.
