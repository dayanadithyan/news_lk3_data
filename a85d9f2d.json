    "A day after Pastor Jerome Fernando had expressed an apology via a live video stream over his controversial remarks, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles said an apology will not prevent the police from taking action against him.",
    "Pastor Fernando who is under investigation over his controversial remarks made against Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism, left the country last week.",
    "\u201cIf someone had committed an offence and said sorry, we cannot withdraw the investigations. It has not happened in the past and will not happen in the future. It is the procedure not only for this particular matter but for any case,\u201d Minister Alles said at a media briefing held at the Public Security Ministry today.",
    "He said the investigations against Pastor Fernando are being conducted by the CID.",
    "\u201cThe CID has received several complaints against him and they are investigating all the complaints currently. The court had issued a travel ban against him. So when that happens, the normal procedure is that when the person returned to the country, he is handed over to the CID at the airport,\u201d the minister said.",
    "He said the CID will question and record statements upon his arrival.",
    "\u201cThen only the CID can decide whether he will be produced before the court or sent home,\u201d the minister said.",
    "Pastor Fernando claimed that his lawyers are currently preparing the way for him to return to Sri Lanka.",
    "However, he earlier claimed that he would return to the country on Sunday (21). (Darshana Sanjeewa Balasuriya)"
