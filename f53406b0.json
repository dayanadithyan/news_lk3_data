    "Hayleys Solar, the renewable energy arm of Hayleys Fentons, has completed phase 1 of the grid-tied rooftop solar PV system for Emjay International, a leading apparel manufacturer. This project covered Emjay\u2019s manufacturing facilities located at Karandagolla, Kurunegala, and Panwila, Kandy.",
    "The project is part of Emjay\u2019s \u2018Mihiliya\u2019 sustainability initiative to create energy-efficient and sustainable environments. The installation of solar panels at Emjay\u2019s Karandagolla and Panwila factories will generate 54,737 kWhs and 21,146 kWhs of solar power respectively, reducing CO2 emissions by 40.5 tonnes and 15.63 tonnes monthly.",
    "This project is a testimony to Emjay\u2019s commitment to ensuring a high degree of social and environmental responsibility and their renewable energy transition. Furthermore, the project enables Emjay to meet its sustainability goals by consuming clean and renewable energy in its production facilities, to go net zero.",
    "Fentons Managing Director Hasith Prematillake mentioned that: \u201cAt Hayleys Solar, we are dedicated to delivering top-notch solar solutions and our partnership with Emjay International exemplifies our unwavering commitment to this goal. Projects like this one allow us to showcase our expertise and provide high-quality solar solutions to meet the diverse needs of our clients. We look forward to implementing more projects like this in our journey of building a more sustainable Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Emjay\u2019s sustainability strategy and meeting its objectives not only helps the company meet corporate goals, but has also attracted global brands that promote sustainability. The successful implementation of this project is a significant milestone in Emjay\u2019s journey toward sustainability and a positive contribution to preserving the environment.",
    "Emjay International Director Roshani Wijayapala shared her comments on the project: \u201cWe as Emjay have understood the importance of building a sustainable corporate, which needs to be positively contributing and preserving our mother nature. This resulted in the creation of \u2018Mihiliya\u2019, which is our sustainability strategy.",
    "\u201cWe partnered with Hayleys Solar, to meet one of Mihiliya\u2019s objectives of converting our production facilities into safe and clean energy sources. With the installation of solar panels in our Karandagolla and Panwila factories, 78% and 60% respectively of the energy demand is met through renewable energy. This is a huge milestone in our journey towards sustainability.\u201d",
    "Sharing his thoughts, Hayleys Solar Chief Executive Officer Roshane Perera said: \u201cThe successful completion of this project further solidifies our position as the number one solar provider in the country. Our team is ready and eager to continue supporting individuals and businesses to transition to clean energy. We would like to extend our gratitude to Emjay International for placing their trust in us.\u201d",
    "Commercial installations such as the projects completed at Emjay allow organisations to maintain their commitments to sustainability initiatives, whilst avoiding electricity tariff revisions and continuous financial challenges, ensuring economic health. Hayleys Solar has brought in the latest technology to effectively utilise solar energy and minimise fuel costs during power outages.",
    "So far, Hayleys Solar has completed over 125 Megawatts of Solar PV Systems across the island, covering domestic and commercial projects. Backed by over 100 years of engineering excellence from Fentons, Hayleys Solar can provide solar projects and solutions of the highest quality standard."
