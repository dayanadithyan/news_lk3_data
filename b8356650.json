    "A national \u201cbreakdown\u201d can become a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in terms of escaping the stranglehold of inefficient, ineffective and unaffordable \u201cgovernment\u201d that is bloated, bureaucratic and a deterrent to development",
    "One of the most powerful of these \u2018practices\u2019 is beginning with reality. It is launched fairly simply.",
    "We first face \u2018what is\u2019 not only by being present to what we are facing in all its fullness \u2013 where necessary its seeming brutality or even its almost giddying potential \u2013 but also to all our feelings about this reality.",
    "Cast your mind back to April 2022. The cracks in the Sri Lankan economy were evident, unrest was brimming, the viability of the state was in question, years of oblivious misrule were coming home to roost. To some extent, the protest movements were a way to physically manifest, to incarnate the outrage, the horror, and perhaps the shame in people having gone along, in being complicit to some extent by not pushing back and practicing \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d well before the storm clouds had gathered.",
    "Denying we have those feelings, we can stifle the very passion that can be fossil fuel as we aim to move on from and beyond that current base-line reality.",
    "This requirement above, of being present to all of our feelings about the way things are, is far from easy. In fact, to fully engage in this practice, we have to go still further. We have to not only be present to all our feelings, not only accept they are there, but we must do so without resistance.",
    "That doesn\u2019t mean we condone the crisis or rationalise it. It means if we \u2018resist\u2019 our feelings, or resent them, we miss the opportunity of exploring the range and depth of their potential enabling power. We must welcome the sweep. There is a canvas of reformation the entire world has to currently paint on.",
    "We are riddled with inflation, proxy wars, post-pandemic mismanagement, crony capitalism, educational meltdown, outbreaks of suicide and addiction, mass hunger and more.",
    "So the aim has to be \u2018Presence (to the feelings) without Resistance\u2019. The capacity to be present to everything that is happening without fighting the fact (if it is already in existence), liberates possibility.",
    "We then can at least look to the only liberation often available\u2026a \u201cnext step\u201d however imperfect or halting. Sri Lanka took that with a Constitutional transfer of power last summer, and since then, by rebuilding global economic partnerships and alliances.",
    "It is imperfect, on the human rights front incomplete, in terms of reforming institutions the merest beginning of a vast \u201cwork in progress.\u201d Relative to empowering our youth and managing debt, very early days indeed. But step by step, we have indeed progressed rather than melting down.",
    "The struggle shifts from coming to terms with what has already happened and onto re-inventing the landscape of reality and potentiality.",
    "In less grandiose terms, in years past, as a skier I\u2019ve experienced what happens when I tense up and try to \u2018avoid\u2019 icy patches. Down I go! When I relax into those patches and let them carry me forward, let them teach me how to use them as a conduit, I frequently find myself moving quite elegantly forward.",
    "This extends to mistakes we ourselves make. A fellow skier once commented: \u201cMistakes are also like ice, we have to let them carry us forward.\u201d",
    "Once we include mistakes in our definition of performance, we can admit them faster, not perpetuate them, and then at least \u2018stumble forward\u2019 if we must, rather than backward.",
    "It is hard to accept that the second most prosperous nation in Asia post-Independence, once considered a model of development, has been overtaken not only by Singapore, but Southeast Asia, including the recently ravaged Vietnam, but also to some extent Bangladesh who gave a $ 200 million as a lifeline to Sri Lanka when it was facing a shattering plight.",
    "But \u201cpretending\u201d all is well, if we just borrow some more, and import more, and add no value to our exports, and gather some of the lowest taxes in the region, is part and parcel of how Sri Lanka got here.",
    "In fact, nationally, or frankly personally, in our lust for acting as if we \u2018have it all together\u2019 we forget the uphill glory that attends all types of genuine recovery and growth.",
    "In a very different, but edifying context, the great composer Stravinsky once turned down a bassoon player who was too good at rendering the opening to Stravinsky\u2019s Rites of Spring. That music is seeking to convey the \u2018first crack\u2019 in the icy grip of the Russian winter; it is constructed as a heart-stopping and perilous moment of expression.",
    "This player, while technically perfect, couldn\u2019t convey that exquisite yet aching moment. When hearing of a difficult moment in the violin concerto, Stravinsky said: \u201cI don\u2019t want the sound of someone playing this passage; I want the sound of someone trying to play it!\u201d",
    "Leadership is like that. Leadership is frequently the \u2018sound\u2019, and \u2018sight\u2019 and \u2018feeling\u2019 of someone trying to play it \u2013 seeking to live it, yearning and stretching to better fulfil their potential for contribution.",
    "Our current government has been \u201ctrying\u201d to play the grand concerto of recovery. And one must give credit, as the IMF and other liquidity lifelines come in. But let us remember, they are the \u201cbeginning.\u201d And we must taper what they give us, to development and national capacities that look after the poorest and most vulnerable and truly contribute to building up the productive potential of the nation \u2013 or else we are perpetuating the calamity.",
    "Another compounding complication is we often treat our \u2018assumptions\u2019, our \u2018projections\u2019, and our \u2018conclusions\u2019 as reality. Therefore, we potentially ignore the multi-faceted tapestry that \u2018reality\u2019 so often actually is.",
    "We went deranged relative to \u201covernight\u201d organic fertilisers. Now we claim we will have the lowest interest rates in the world, which is ridiculous with our only increasing debt. Then we wish to be the \u201cgreenest\u201d economy, though we can hardly assert that divorced from the technology available, the emerging profit pools, and the viability of this.",
    "We need to back away from platitudinous posturing and let realities be our compass. Green is compelling morally, but it must practically prove its economic viability. After all, in Europe, the \u201calmost banned\u201d internal combustion engine, is now back with a vengeance. The Germans insisted, rationally so.",
    "In fact, throughout our lives, we must be able to flow with seeming disasters and not \u201cassume\u201d we know what they indicate. A persistent rain we face on a trip can sour our journey while being a Godsend for the local crops. A forest fire may injure an ecosystem, only to later allow it to renew itself with vigour. A tempestuous argument with a spouse can create \u2018space\u2019 for fresh feelings that can both excite and re-energise our relationship. A flight delay can have us late for a meeting, while allowing us to find and spend time with a book that sparks a breakthrough for us in some facet of our lives.",
    "And a national \u201cbreakdown\u201d can become a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in terms of escaping the stranglehold of inefficient, ineffective and unaffordable \u201cgovernment\u201d that is bloated, bureaucratic and a deterrent to development.",
    "Ergo, we often have to restrain ourselves from investing our rush to judgment with too much credence. The student goes to his Rabbi. The Rabbi instructs him that when you get good news, thank God; when you get bad news, thank God. The student thanks the Rabbi. But then mulling over the instruction, he asks how he is to separate out \u2018good\u2019 news from \u2018bad\u2019 news.",
    "Smiling with delight, the Rabbi says, \u201cYou are wise my son. So, just to be safe, always thank the Lord.\u201d",
    "We can state this in slightly less exalted language for today\u2019s leader: \u201cLook at everything with the eyes of possibility, grateful at least for the opportunity to do something with it.\u201d But get to that moment as directly as possible, without shadowboxing with defensiveness and rampant rationalising.",
    "A colleague describes a therapeutic session with a family. The father continued to complain that his son had built a \u2018wall\u2019 around himself. The son said nothing. \u201cSee?\u201d the father said. And on he went to rant.",
    "Facing reality means distinguishing between \u2018what is\u2019 and our own conclusions, beliefs and assumptions. This father had characterised his son\u2019s silence or diffidence as him having \u2018constructed a wall\u2019. You can almost sense the wall being erected in the passage above! As the son didn\u2019t respond, the \u2018wall\u2019 was confirmed in the father\u2019s mind.",
    "The son\u2019s reality may have been that his father was an overbearing, domineering taskmaster. And the more the father rants, the more true this becomes in the young man\u2019s perception.",
    "Imagine if the father had decided to \u2018dismantle\u2019 the wall in his perception and had simply noted \u2018what is\u2019: \u201cMy son is being silent, and I\u2019m frustrated that he won\u2019t communicate with me.\u201d",
    "Imagine if the son not being viewed in a diminished way, simply observed: \u201cDad wants to communicate, I\u2019m not sure I know what to say, or how to say it.\u201d",
    "And what if both of them had said that to each other? Imagine the richness of a conversation that began with a real sharing of \u2018what is\u2019 for each of them, the emotional realities above. We can almost sense the importance of the \u2018bridges\u2019 that could be built.",
    "An even greater danger is that as we keep reconfirming our own untested assumptions about the \u2018obstacle\u2019, \u2018the problem\u2019, we then tend to pick those perceptions that are either easier on our ego or which conform to our prejudices, or which allow us to scapegoat select others.",
    "The mind being like a heat-seeking missile, the more we look at the world with this bias, the more \u2018evidence\u2019 we will locate for our perception of choice. This is also why we notice a flood of Honda Civics on the highway soon after we buy ours or a bumper crop of young infants the week after we\u2019ve wheeled our own out of the hospital. \u2018Seek and ye shall find\u2019 is as perceptual a truth as it is purported to be a spiritual one.",
    "If we fall into this trap, we run the risk of either creating strategies that don\u2019t address what is really needed, or else we begin to emotionally confirm a conclusion that the problem is more intractable than it really is.",
    "In fact, as we openly sift the evidence, and allow \u201cwhat is\u201d in dynamic alliance with \u201cpossibility\u201d to begin to turn the tumblers of our mind and heart, we also must also change our frame of what constitutes progress.",
    "The Japanese demonstrated \u201cnation building\u201d after having two cities devastated by nuclear weapons, after being humiliated, occupied, and more. And they became the world\u2019s second largest economy, still the third today, and a greenhouse for brands and innovation, unparalleled in Asia.",
    "Ho Chi Minh warned the Vietnamese not to \u201chate\u201d the Americans though they had to defeat them, as he said, \u201cone day their dollars will rebuild our economy.\u201d And this after all they unjustly suffered. So, you don\u2019t heap more injustice upon yourself!",
    "When recently grappling with these insights as a theatre lover and patron, I realised they apply culturally as well. You can join the crowd bemoaning the inevitable decline of audiences for serious theatre, or you can celebrate the sold-out performances of Bernard Shaw\u2019s Man and Superman at the National Theatre in London and the critical and popular acclaim for the audacious Doll\u2019s House Part Two in New York in the recent past and join those conversations instead.",
    "You could engage with others at these shows and emerge renewed and hopeful that your own artistic crusade might be able to find patrons, enthusiasts and mavens, that perhaps under our pop cultural veneer, the same human passions and dreams and hungers, still abound.",
    "If demoralised by what you perceive as the decline in classical music interest, you could join the throng of thousands that converge upon Mozart\u2019s lovingly preserved Baroque hometown of Salzburg, and then re-enter the world fully revitalised by the alternate reality of classical music interest that this most prestigious of European musical festivals conveys. And then\u2026you have the option of helping to enrol others in a more makeshift community for musical activists in Kandy or Brisbane or wherever \u2013 friends who rejoice in promoting, celebrating and immersing in classical music.",
    "Select the context you want to immerse in and begin from. Choose the stimulus you prefer to have your faculties challenged by and ignited by.",
    "This is the season of Easter, there is the cross, but also rebirth. Resurrection abounds! This is the New Year period, possibilities proliferate!",
    "So, once we accept reality, and our feelings, as leaders we can then create fresh milestones that take us towards an enhanced, enriched and more spiriting reality. We realise that all real leaders work with their collaborators and stakeholders as constructive co-conspirators to create the framework for life and reality to unfold in a fresh direction.",
    "Martin Luther King intoned for all of us: \u201cI have a dream!\u201d When we don\u2019t first face and interrogate reality, we corrupt this to, \u201cI have a pipedream\u2026a wishful fantasy at best.\u201d",
    "Equally, when we don\u2019t accept our accountability for co-creating what can be by engaging perceptions and feelings and frameworks (ours and those of others), we mutate this into, \u201cI have a nightmare.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s our collective paintbrushes and canvas though. Whatever we help paint as potential \u2013 respectful of current reality but not constrained by it indefinitely \u2013 that\u2019s the context we provide for our colleagues, our organisation and ourselves to build performance from.",
    "Great business leaders have one thing in common with those visionary humanitarians that we revere. Both have the ability to be abundantly present to the way things are both in times of uplifting beauty and revitalising joy, and also during periods of immense challenge and debilitating frustration.",
    "Both understand that we have to face, embrace, and then transcend what we experience and find ourselves facing. To be alchemists, we may have to be \u2018chemists\u2019 first.",
    "Such leaders and such visionaries can look at the full range of both our challenges and our potential, and never position themselves in any way that presents a barrier to creativity or to hope.",
    "This is why we must allow our sadness, sorrow or anger to be expressed to some extent too. We may otherwise solve the problem, but duck the lesson, thereby setting ourselves up for a future repetition of the problem.\u00a0 M. Scott Peck once said: \u201cThe truth will set you free, but first it will make you madder than hell!\u201d So be it! As long as we then enable and generate, on the wings of that outburst, enough humility for true perception, enough courage for genuine willingness, enough audacity to move tangibly forward.",
    "Leadership is ultimately about growth and transformation with ourselves, our dreams, our aspirations, and also our fears and anxieties, as kindling. But we cannot transform, nationally or personally, what we don\u2019t first accept.",
    "We learn to lead in an enlightened way then by first coming to not only \u2018accept\u2019 but even to imaginatively appreciate \u2018what is\u2019. What \u2018can be\u2019 then shimmers all around us.",
    "Who \u201cowns\u201d the finish line? Well, there are infinite \u201cfinishes\u201d. Sri Lanka ended a brutal, 30 year plus civil war. Possibility abounded.",
    "And then it unravelled, and the country has now come back from a terrifying abyss. Again, once more, possibility abounds.",
    "The US instituted the Marshal Plan and turned past enemies, Germany and Japan, into the closest of Allies. It \u201cwon\u201d the Cold War, bringing about an \u201cend\u201d to that history. The US defined and \u201cowned\u201d those finish lines.",
    "And then, it had shameful episodes in Vietnam and later Iraq, and recently in COVID mismanagement and indemnifying blatant fraud artists like Pfizer and puffing up bankrupt entities like Moderna to distribute untested \u201cremedies\u201d that now don\u2019t work except to multiply adverse effects. A former President has been indicted, and the current President\u2019s family has uncertain standing relative to brokering influence. New \u201cfinish lines\u201d desperately beckon.",
    "India is shining bright, \u201cInvest India\u201d as a one stop portal has created more FDI flow in 15 months than almost the entire history of FDI flowing into India to that date. Start-ups are being nurtured, digitisation is becoming core. Sri Lanka is following suit (we congratulate the intent), the potential \u201cengines\u201d being Port City Commission and the BOI. New \u201cfinish\u201d lines, which actually always are the start of a fresh journey, with new markers, are being invited.",
    "So hope, possibility, potential, dreams, vision, collaboration, faith, leading to fresh commitments and consistent action flowing from them, these help pave the \u201cinterim\u201d finish lines life proffers. And then we start over! That\u2019s the glory of life.",
