    "If the Transport Ministry failed to stop the Random Emission Tests on the private commuter buses by flying squads, we would bring the country to a standstill without any prior notice one day,\u201d Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne told media yesterday.",
    "\u201cA discussion is scheduled to be held with the Transport Ministry Secretary and the CPC next week. If the discussion is not fruitful, we have to refrain from operating buses around the country,\u201d he said.",
    "Addressing the media Wijeratne said that the auto diesel fuel distributed around the country contains a higher sulfur density, which is 500 ppm (Parts Per Million), and that causes higher emissions.",
    "\u201cEmission tests are being conducted on buses all of a sudden on the road by the flying squads of the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) with the assistance of the Police,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBut such tests are not conducted on the State run SLTB buses,\u201d he charged.",
    "\"Several bus owners have complained to me about such incidents being reported from several areas in the country,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWijeratne pointed out that it was compulsory to obtain the Emission Test report before obtaining the Revenue Licenses and the Vehicle Fitness Certificate to obtain a Route Permit.",
    "\"Consequently, I have informed the DMT Commissioner-General and the Transport Ministry Secretariat, not to conduct this unfair programme,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe sulfur density of the auto diesel imported to the country is 500 ppm. But the diesel sulfur densities in other countries are 0.25 ppm. When buses run on auto diesel with a higher sulfur density, more emission is possible and cannot be controlled. All our buses have Euro 4 engines. Therefore, we must use Super Diesel.\u201d",
    "\u201cUnfortunately, there are no emission tests for Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses. SLTB buses do not get involved with random emission tests. If this practice continued, the LPBOA would stop operating our buses in the country for a day without notice and bring the country to a standstill,\u201d he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
