    "Sri Lanka Tourism Alliance (SLTA) said yesterday its destination consumer marketing campaign had reached new heights.",
    "It launched a mini Destination Consumer Marketing campaign \u201cFall in Love Again\u201d in October 2022. With consumers being the decision makers, travel trade marketing alone is inadequate to quickly rebuild demand, following negative news and consumer apprehension about shortages and safety.",
    "The campaign covered multiple platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Google Display advertisements. The campaign targeted key markets including India, Germany, Spain, UK, France and the US to communicate the return to normalcy for tourists.",
    "\u201cResults have been exceptional; the Alliance\u2019s goal was to reach 1 million potential tourists but we reached almost 6 million with an impressive 31.5 million impressions. If only global consumer marketing could be done at country level, positioning Sri Lanka as it truly deserves, the impact on bookings and rates across the spectrum of accommodation would be spectacular,\u201d said SLTA Chair Malik Fernando.",
    "The Tourism Alliance said it is committed to working tirelessly to promote Sri Lanka; it recognises the importance of building trust and desirability for the destination among travellers. The Destination Marketing campaign is one of many initiatives the SLTA has planned.",
    "The Destination Marketing Campaign is part of the Tourism Resilience Project funded by the European Union (EU) with additional support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)."
