    "The Lanka Democratic Movement (LDM) strongly condemns the recent attack on social media activist Piyath Nikeshala by a group led by the Deputy Mayor of Kaduwela. We call on the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into this incident and bring those responsible to justice.",
    "It is deeply concerning that such attacks on activists and journalists are becoming increasingly common in Sri Lanka. We urge the Government to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of those who speak out against injustices and to protect the freedom of expression.",
    "The incident demonstrates the political thuggery prevalent in the country and raises serious questions about the safety of activists and journalists. The Deputy Mayor of Kaduwela, who is known to be a close associate of the Rajapaksa family, must be held accountable for this heinous act. We urge President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Government to take immediate action and ensure that justice is served. The Lanka Democratic Movement is closely watching the stance taken by the President on this incident and calls on him to demonstrate his commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting the freedom of expression in Sri Lanka.",
    "We stand in solidarity with Nikeshala and his family during this difficult time and hope for his speedy recovery."
