    "Accuses Ranil, Rajapaksa and Premadasa factions of attempting to maintain a tight grip on country\u2019s power",
    "Says party will work to force Govt. to hold polls and oust current rulers",
    "Following a period of silence regarding Local Government elections, the National People\u2019s Party (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake announced on Saturday the party will renew its fight for Local Government polls on 8 June.",
    "\u201cOn 9 June three months will have elapsed since the original date the elections were to be held. We will launch our fight to coincide with the day,\u201d he said.",
    "According to Dissanayake, there was great public interest in the elections which were scheduled to be held on 9 March. \u201cThe people wanted to use this vote to change the disastrous path the country was on and to oust the rulers who have destroyed the country,\u201d he claimed.",
    "The NPP leader accused the Ranil, Rajapaksa, and Premadasa factions of attempting to maintain a tight grip on the country\u2019s power. \u201cThey will not allow the power to change hands to a people\u2019s movement,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey will do the unthinkable to hold on to power and come together to prevent the NPP from coming into power,\u201d he added.",
    "Therefore Dissanayake said the NPP will re-launch its struggle to ensure Local Government polls are held. \u201cFrom 9 March to 9 June they had three months to hold the elections. On 8 June we will commence our fight to force the Government to hold the polls and oust them. We cannot let them destroy this country going further,\u201d he said.",
    "Accordingly, the NPP\u2019s Local Government candidates will protest in front of the Election Commission on the day while a series of demonstrations will also be held in Hambantota, Anuradhapura, Gampaha and Colombo.",
    "\u201cThe rulers of this country have brought every possible form of destruction on the people. The recently released Central Bank report said 68% of the population has reduced their food consumption, skipping meals or consuming unappetising food to fill their stomachs. It also noted that 40% of patients have stopped taking medication and 40% have also cut down on their education-related expenses. 500 000 have lost their jobs. Professionals are leaving the country. 104 000 unskilled workers left the country last year,\u201d Dissanayake pointed out.",
    "\u201cA majority are considering leaving the country today. The NPP is struggling to convert the country to one that is liveable. We take upon ourselves the responsibility to create a better society. Only the NPP can take the necessary steps to rebuild the country,\u201d he added.",
    "Dissanayake said nominations for the Presidential election will have to be called in August 2023. \u201cBefore this, we must force the Government to hold Local Government polls. We cannot fight for this in isolation. Everyone including entrepreneurs, engineers, fishermen and workers must work together in the next four years to rebuild the country,\u201d he said."
