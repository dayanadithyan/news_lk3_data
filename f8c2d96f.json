    "Eran Wickramaratne has made an accusation against the former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in an article on Daily FT (24 April 2023). His claim can be syllogistically written as follows:",
    "(1) There is a mastermind behind the Easter Sunday Attack (ESA)",
    "(3) Gotabaya Rajapaksa benefitted from the ESA (because he won the 2019 election)",
    "(4) Therefore Gotabaya Rajapaksa is the mastermind behind the ESA\u00a0Now let us logically analyse Eran\u2019s claim.",
    "Firstly, the premise of there being a \u201cmastermind\u201d other than the actual Islamist terrorists who planned, resourced and carried-out themselves the suicide attack is preposterous. It is merely an \u201copinion\u201d that has been put forward by some individuals much later. Neither Eran nor other proponents of this theory have presented any evidence for their claim. It is possible that this type of mental projection stems from one\u2019s personal belief in a \u201cgod behind everything\u201d psychosis. Therefore we could debunk Eran\u2019s assertion at its first premise itself. Nevertheless, let\u2019s grant this fallacy for the purpose of this analysis and move forward.",
    "In the second premise, Eran says that this \u201cmastermind\u201d \u201cbenefited\u201d from the ESA. Anybody with rational thinking can see that it is a circular definition i.e. \u201cthe mastermind is the beneficiary, therefore the beneficiary is the mastermind.\u201d An analogy would be something like saying \u201cBorn-agains are the forgiven, therefore the forgiven are the born-agains.\u201d Neither subject is defined independently. Therefore Eran\u2019s claim can be easily debunked at this stage as well. But let\u2019s move forward.",
    "Let\u2019s ask Eran\u2019s own question, \u201cWho benefited from the ESA?\u201d Note that Eran\u2019s way of looking at the \u201cbenefit\u201d is \u2013 \u201cwho won the presidential election\u201d. As we can see, it is a gross politicisation of the matter. Without any justification, he immediately equates his \u201cbenefit\u201d to the \u201cwinning of an election\u201d. Now that gives us an insight into Eran\u2019s own way of looking at human tragedy. For a self-anointed man of god, I would\u2019ve thought that he would not be quick to see \u201cpolitical benefit\u201d in every god-damn thing. For all we know the \u201cbenefit\u201d could be anything to anybody For example, from the Jihadist perspective, the clear \u201cbeneficiary\u201d here is the suicide bomber who now enjoys the company of whatever number of virgins in Islamic heaven\u2026 But let\u2019s assume that it is in fact political and that it is about \u201cwinning elections\u201d.",
    "According to Eran\u2019s third claim, Gotabaya Rajapaksa benefited from the ESA only because he won the 2019 presidential election. Eran\u2019s point is that the Catholics and Christians who would not have voted for Gotabaya otherwise, voted for him because of ESA. Let\u2019s cut to the chase and see the actual results in the very electorates where the Easter attacks took place. Because if Eran\u2019s claim is true, then the clearest and the largest \u201cbenefit\u201d ought to come from those electorates.",
    "The above results issued by the Elections Commission clearly show that if at all there was a \u201cbenefit\u201d in terms of electoral votes, it has only been to Sajith Premadasa and NOT Gotabaya Rajapaksa. In fact, Negombo has voted the least for Gotabaya when compared to other electorates in Gampaha. The clear \u201cWinner\u201d here is Sajith Premadasa. I mean if the people of the very electorates didn\u2019t vote for Gotabaya Rajapaksa because of the ESA, then there is no reason to believe that anybody else would.",
    "Therefore, it seems like Eran Wickramaratne\u2019s accusation is really aimed towards Sajith Premadasa. Because I doubt that a former banker with an academic background in economics would make such an irresponsible and false claim without having studied these numbers in great detail. I\u2019m sure that he expected this kind of analysis which would bring the facts to light.",
    "But where does this leave us? Firstly, Eran\u2019s accusation is thus debunked. I have proven with facts that his entire assertion is baseless and irrational. But what this also shows is that the Catholic and Christian vote has not been affected by the Easter Sunday attack. When it came to picking a president, they stuck to their traditional political silos.",
    "However, it is rather disappointing to see elderly religious men like Malcolm and Eran would degrade the Catholics and the Christians suggesting that they are intellectually deprived to vote in a national election based on a suicide attack. I mean who would deprecate and denigrate their own followers with such malicious intent? Are they thinking that the Catholics and Christians are actual \u201csheep\u201d who just act out of fear? Is that the capacity of their mental faculty? Or is Eran suggesting that the Catholics and Christians acted out of vengeance against the Muslims?",
    "All Eran doing here is spreading conspiracy theories all the while insulting the Catholic and Christian community. So much for the Eisenhower principles\u2026 what a way to promote modern political culture\u2026 And by his own logic, one could ask, could it be somebody within the Yahapalana government that concocted this attack in the first place? Eran too was a powerful minister in the then Yahapalana government which failed to act on the many warnings. The father of the Islamist terrorists was a national-list member of the JVP, which was also a part of the Yahapalana hodgepodge.",
    "By Eran\u2019s own logic, could the attack be to gain the sympathy of the people who had already lost faith in the Yahapalana government? After all, the people\u2019s choice was \u201cdemocratically\u201d shown in the 2018 Local Government elections (unlike the \u201cundemocratic\u201d terrorist Aragalaya). There was no need for the SLPP to attack anybody to win the coming elections. The attacks could very well have been to upset that trend. If anybody wanted a \u201cpolitical attack\u201d, then it was none-other than the former UNPers who formed the SJB. Could it be to prevent any Muslims from voting for Gotabaya Rajapaksa? After all, the majority of Muslim electorates also voted for Sajith Premadasa. In Eran\u2019s theory, all roads ultimately lead to Sajith Premadasa as the \u201cmastermind\u201d of the Easter Sunday attack. After all, he did manage to establish his party at the expense of the UNP and win the opposition leadership. Was this all done to destroy Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s leadership?",
    "Finally, let me advise the elderly MP to uphold basic moral values and not to make repugnant use of the blood of your own people to humiliate them even more, all just to gain some political \u201cbenefit\u201d for yourself. May the Dharma Guide Your Way!"
