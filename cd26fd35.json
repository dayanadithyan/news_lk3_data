    "A large number of people who came to their workplaces in Colombo had to put in a lot of effort to get back home, as a number of trains were cancelled today due to the protest by the locomotive operators' union. People are seen waiting for train at the Fort, Maradana, Dematagoda, Slave island Kollupitiya and other suburban railway stations with some hope. Due to the strike, the trains were run using minimum facilities that they have due to the absence of locomotive drivers. Pix by Pradeep Pathirana"
