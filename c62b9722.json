  "original_body_lines": [
    "\"I will reveal all the details of those who do not allow the full implementation of the digitalizing programme of the transport service and the introduction of the new automated system to issue bus tickets\", Cabinet spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.",
    "He assured the people that he would implement a digital system to operate a cashless bus service within three months.",
    "Addressing the weekly Cabinet meeting, he said he will reveal to Parliament the details of those who are not implementing the services or those who are responsible for not allowing the implementation of the system.",
    "Accordingly, the ministry is planning to implement a QR code system or a travel card system to rectify the issues faced when providing change in cash for bus fares.",
    "Most countries do not use money physically to buy tickets. These countries use the card systems to buy tickets. In these countries buses are operated only by drivers and there are no conductors.",
    "An expression of interest (EOI) was called to fully implement the digitalisation of the transport sector. A total of twelve companies have come forward to implement the programme.",
    "\"I will raise this issue in parliament and reveal all the details of the people who do not want this programme to be implemented. It is sad to see the people who clamour to be well educated but still use physical money to buy bus tickets without using the latest technologies,\" Minister Gunawardana said.
