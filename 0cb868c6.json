    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Board of Investment is looking at getting clearances from other agencies for prospective investors so that they can quickly set up their businesses, Investment Promotion State Minister Dilum Amunugama has said.",
    "\u201cIt is evident that the modus operandi in obtaining necessary approvals for investment projects causes significant hindrances to investors, which has a considerable bearing on the willingness and confidence of the investors to continue their business,\u201d Amunugama was quoted as saying in a statement.",
    "The BOI will get more powers to get clearances from other agencies, he said.",
    "\u201cIn this context, attention has been drawn to leveraging a business model called the plug-and-play model where all clearances and other prerequisites will be in place before the project is awarded to any investor,\u201d Amunugama said.",
    "\u201cHere, the business firms are not required to focus on the basic requirements for setting up a business as everything is arranged by the relevant authority, which would be the BOI.\u201d"
