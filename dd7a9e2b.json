    "Kotaro Katsuki, the Acting Ambassador for Japan in Sri Lanka said in Colombo on May 26 that the Japanese Embassy would follow through the bilateral economic cooperation and business discussions President Ranil Wickremesinghe had during his visit to Japan last week.",
    "\u201cPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed the 28th Nikkei Future of Asia Conference held in Tokyo. During this visit, President Wickremesinghe held bilateral discussions with Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Minister of Finance Suzuki Shunichi, Minister of Foreign Affairs Hayashi Yoshimasa and Minister for Digital Transformation Taro Kono. President Wickremesinghe also exchanged views with the business community at economic events, which we believe will lead to stronger bilateral relations and we will be following through the action items of these business and economic events,\u201d he said.",
    "The Ambassador made these remarks while delivering the keynote speech as Chief Guest at the ceremonial opening of the \u2018Build SL\u2019 Housing and Construction International Exhibition 2023, organised by the Chamber of Construction Industry of Sri Lanka.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe during his visit to Japan last week engaged in a pivotal business roundtable on \u2018Sri Lanka\u2019s Economic Revival and Opportunities for Japanese Enterprise,\u2019 where he presented the nation\u2019s commitment to stabilising and liberalising the economy while earnestly inviting new Japanese ventures.",
    "The Acting Ambassador further speaking at the Build SL launch ceremony said,\u201d It is my great pleasure to be invited to the Build SL Housing & Construction Expo 2023 of Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka. I congratulate Sri Lanka on obtaining the approval of the IMF Executive Board on March 20th for its Extended Fund Facility. This came after a lot of work done by the Sri Lankan authorities and recognition from the international community on the reforms that have been carried out such as fiscal reform. We welcome this major step towards the revitalization of the Sri Lankan economy. The \u2018Build SL\u2019 exhibition comes at a very timely moment, which brings together companies in the construction industry with great potential to stimulate economic growth of this country.\u201d",
    "\u201cLast year, Japan and Sri Lanka celebrated the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations established in 1952, and the construction of the Inginimitiya Irrigation Dam began in 1978 as the first Official Development Assistance (ODA) project.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn the 80s, development projects were carried out at the Colombo Port. In the 90s, Baseline Road improvement and Japan-Sri Lanka Friendship Bridge expansion projects were implemented. In the 2000s, the Colombo International Airport improvement project and the construction of the Southern Expressway, the first expressway in Sri Lanka, and Colombo Outer Circular Highway as well as local road improvement and development projects added to the list. In the 2010s, consultations for Phase 2 of the Bandaranaike International Airport Improvement Project began, as well as major bridges construction project of the national road network and the landslide disaster protection project of the national road.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a great honour to see some of the Japan\u2019s iconic ODA projects adorning Sri Lanka\u2019s currency notes in circulation blending with other distinct national symbols.\u201d",
    "\u201cAfter my arrival in Sri Lanka in August 2021, the Golden Gate Kalyani Bridge, was completed in November of that year, This Bridge has become a landmark in the metropolis of Colombo and has contributed significantly to easing traffic congestion on surrounding roads, and is the first ever extradosed engineering design in Sri Lanka. We are delighted to have been able to transfer Japanese state of the art technology to Sri Lanka through this project.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Japanese Embassy building in Gregory\u2019s Road is currently undergoing refurbishing. In all of these projects, Sri Lankan construction companies have been good partners of Japanese companies in its implementation and the construction industry has made a significant contribution to the country\u2019s development. However, we are aware that the entire industry has been severely affected by the current economic crisis, which has led to the suspension of public works projects.\u201d",
    "\u201cAllow me to touch upon some contributions by Japan in response to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka. In order to support Sri Lanka, the Government of Japan has provided up to approximately 93 million USD worth of inundated grant assistance to Sri Lanka since 2022.\u201d",
    "\u201cSri Lanka has been going through difficult times due to a series of adversities such as the Easter Sunday terror attacks in 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 and the ongoing economic and social crisis. However, now is a great opportunity to recover from this situation. To that end, based on the IMF agreement, we would be delighted to see Sri Lanka assiduously work on a series of reforms such as rooting out corruption and reforming state-owned enterprises.\u201d",
    "\u201cMoreover, in order to make the economy more export-oriented and competitive as mentioned in the 2023 budget, it should entail further strengthening of the manufacturing industry across the board and promotion of the export industry by connecting it to the global supply chain. In considering future assistance to Sri Lanka, Japan would like to support Sri Lanka\u2019s effort to make its economy more resilient.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn addition, it is essential to attract foreign investment in order to achieve sustainable and stable economic growth by way of improving the investment environment. We hope that transparency, efficiency and consistency will be enhanced through the reforms, which are taking place.\u201d",
    "\u201cNow, I would like to catch up on future-oriented initiatives spearheaded by Japan that will lead to further development of both Japanese and Sri Lankan companies and collaboration between our respective companies.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe first initiative is related to climate change and decarbonisation. In October 2022, our two countries signed an agreement on a Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM). With the collaboration between Japanese and Sri Lankan companies and the support from the Japanese government, this Joint Crediting Mechanism will allow for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by harnessing decarbonisation and renewable energy technologies to Sri Lanka. With this program, it is hoped that Japanese companies will find it more attractive to invest in the field of renewable energies or decarbonization projects in Sri Lanka with their innovative technologies and solutions.\u201d",
    "\u201cJapan is going to hold Expo 2025 in Osaka in April 2025. This event will present another great opportunity to attract attention and investment from Japan to Sri Lanka, in the field of trade, investment and tourism. The Sri Lankan government has already expressed its intention to participate in this event. I hope that both the private and public sectors of Sri Lanka will jointly make the most out of this Expo 2025 to promote the attractiveness of Sri Lanka to the world. I hope that these initiatives will bring about new business opportunities for both Sri Lankan and Japanese businesses.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn the future, the development of the construction industry in Sri Lanka will become increasingly important for the country to overcome the current economic crisis and achieve sustainable development. Japan will continue to be involved in the resumption of ODA projects, including the Bandaranaike International Airport expansion project, which is currently suspended due to the situation in this country and in order to move forward, it\u2019s important for the Sri Lankan Government to work on restructuring its debt and to improve the economic and financial situation in a transparent manner working closely with the IMF, Paris Club and other entities.\u201d",
    "The Acting Japanese Ambassador concluded his remarks by expressing Japan\u2019s determination to continue to stand by Sri Lanka as its partner, and to support Sri Lanka to reach its full potential towards building a strong and vibrant economy.",
