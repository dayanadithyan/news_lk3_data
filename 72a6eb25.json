  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition party the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has issued letters of demand to the owners of the MV X-Press Pearl containership seeking compensation for the worst maritime disaster in the country\u2019s history.",
    "SJB and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa told parliament on Thursday May 11 that the party filed legal action against a number of shipping companies associated with the ship in a bid to assist the Sri Lankan government\u2019s efforts to file a damages claim.",
    "A preliminary letter of demand (LoD) has been issued by the SJB to EUSRO (Pvt) Ltd, followed by LoDs to Sea Consortium (Pvt) Ltd, X-Press Feeders (Pvt) Ltd, Sea Consortium Lanka Ltd, London Steam Ship Owners Mutual Insurance Association Ltd, GAC Shipping Ltd and one other company.",
    "\u201cThese shipping companies seem to think there are groups in this country that can be bought. There is no one in our country who can be bought.",
    "\u201cI think this will be a strength to our efforts to obtain 6.4 billion [US dollars],\u201d said Premadasa, speaking during the second day of a parliament debate on the X-Press Pearl disaster and the compensation owed to Sri Lanka, which has become a matter of controversy, particularly in light of an allegation by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe that a Sri Lankan official has taken a colossal bribe to sabotage any litigation.",
    "The opposition has accused the government of coming up with excuses for not actively pursue the damages claim after the government claimed on Wednesday that debating the issue in parliament would disrupt legal proceedings that were already underway.",
    "According to Minister Rajapakshe, the government has filed a claim in Singapore but will also fight the case in the UK after insurers and owners went to Admiralty Courts seeking to limit compensation to 19.2 million sterling pounds.",
    "Sri Lanka filed a case in Singapore on April 25, seeking damages, which was to be heard in June but has been brought forward to early May. Sri Lanka\u2019s lawyers will seek more time, Rajapsakshe said.",
    "An expert committee appointed on the matter has estimated the total damage to 6.4 billion US dollars.",
    "Sri Lanka has sought 22.1 million US dollars in damages for the marine environment and 273.014 million US dollars for fishermen, Rajapasksa told parliament.",
    "India has sought 495.3 million Indian rupees from Sri Lanka as the cost for firefighting operations, which was 1941.5 million in Sri Lankan rupees.",
    "Sri Lanka has hired Dentons Rodyk and Davidson LLP legal firm in Singapre and Sparke Helmore of Australia to argue its case.",
    "The owners of the vessel and its insurers have gone to an Admiralty Court in the UK seeking to cap damages to the ship and the marine and coastal environment at 19.2 million sterling pounds, Rajapakshe said.",
    "King\u2019s Counsel Peter MacDonald from DAC Beachcroft firm has been hired to represent Sri Lanka in seeking a removal of the cap on damages, he said. (Colombo/May11/2023)"
