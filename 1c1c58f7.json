    "The Mass Media Ministry and the ITN have initiated formal inquiries into the allegations leveled by a popular female news caster of the government owned electronic media establishment against a senior official on the instructions of the Mass Media Minister Dr. Bandula Gunawardana.",
    "Commenting on the resignations made by the lady news caster, Ishara Devendra of the ITN TV channel following the alleged sexual harassment by a senior (journalist) official, Minister Bandula Gunawardana said he has ordered internal and ministry level inquiries on the matter despite there was no complaint other than explaining her alleged harassment on the social media.",
    "\u201cI have not received any complaint in this regard. The Mass Media ministry Secretary or the ITN management has not received a complaint either. But based on the allegations that have been leveled by this lady news reader, I have asked the Mass Media Ministry Secretary and the Chairman of ITN to initiate inquiries and give me a report.",
    "The female news reader has posted a blog on social media highlighting the intimidation including sexual advances she had to face from the senior TV journalist who has a dubious record of conduct and also involved in many a court case against him. The social media post has gone viral and comments have been posted as to why there is still no justice done on her by the authorities.",
    "Ms. Devendra in her social media post that has gone viral has said that she was compelled to resigned from ITN as she could not stand the alleged lewd advances made by the senior journalist and also to protect her name and self-respect",
    "She lamented that no action has been taken against the senior TV man by ITN management despite her grievances.",
    "Responding to the media at a news briefing, Minister Dr. Gunawardana said she must lodge a formal complaint with the police or the ITN management to make the inquiries easier and added the ITN would take the maximum possible action against the alleged perpetrator if found guilty.(Sandun A Jayasekera)"
