    "They said train services, including office trains, would be delayed. Most of the ticket counters were closed, and no tickets were issued to passengers.",

    "The union claimed that the appointed person was involved in many activities that have caused losses to the railway service. The relevant authorities do not check people's backgrounds and past records when appointing them to higher posts, instead of giving the opportunity to the youth.",
