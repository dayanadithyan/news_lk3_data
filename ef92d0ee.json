The program is 100% free of charge and does not ask for equity in the participant's business.",
    "Applicants selected to be part of AccelerateHer will get capacity funding of up to Rs. 1.5 million, curated workshops focused on strategy, operations, business development, product design, tech, growth, PR, brand, and talent to address the knowledge gap, access to a global network of mentors, investors, and female founder networks, and a strong alumni network and lifetime relationships.",
    "AccelerateHer Program Manager Ruvanara Tillekeratne said: \u201cWe are delighted to be partnering with the US Department of State on this initiative. AccelerateHer is a fantastic opportunity for female entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka to gain the skills, knowledge, and networks they need to take their businesses to the next level. We need more women in leadership positions in Sri Lanka, and entrepreneurship is a powerful way to achieve this. By supporting female entrepreneurs, we can help to create a more diverse, equitable, and prosperous society.\u201d",
    "The program duration is from April to July 2023, with a flexible schedule to accommodate the needs of the participants.",
    "According to the Sri Lanka Development Update published by the World Bank in April 2021, women entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka face a number of challenges, including limited access to finance, lack of business skills, and social norms that discourage women from starting businesses.",
    "AccelerateHer aims to address this imbalance by providing female entrepreneurs with the tools, resources, and networks they need to succeed. Applications are open to all female entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka who are looking to scale their businesses.",
    "Applications for AccelerateHer are open now and close on 31 March 2023. To register or for more information, visit www.accelerateher.asia or follow @accelerateherlk on Instagram."
