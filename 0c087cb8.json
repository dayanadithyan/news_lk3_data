    "Hytera, a leading global provider of professional communications technologies and solutions, is proud to announce the successful deployment of a new backup satellite station for Dialog TV, Sri Lanka\u2019s No.1 satellite Pay TV service provider. The project was fulfilled in 2022 by Hytera and its subsidiary specialized in Satellite Communications (SatCom), Norsat International Inc. The new station enhances the resilience and capacity of Dialog TV\u2019s existing system and ensures continuity of service in the event of damage due to natural disasters.",
    "Dialog TV provides coverage over the entirety of Sri Lanka through the Intelsat 38 Ku-band satellite. As the business expanded, it opted for a backup solution to support its existing satellite station and to strengthen the network\u2019s disaster tolerance.",
    "Hytera and Norsat provided an end-to-end satellite earth station solution that includes the installation, integration, and setup of satellite antennas, a transmission and receiving system, a new network management system (NMS), and a carrier monitoring system (CMS). The NMS makes routine work easier and simpler for on-duty staff, as equipment status, parameter monitoring and configuration, and remote control of the devices can be viewed and accomplished via a single interface. The CMS monitors the carrier spectrum status of satellite signals in real-time and ensures stable signal transmission and receiving.",
    "\u201cWe are excited to have been able to work with Dialog TV on this important project,\u201d said Kevin Sun, Sales Director for Hytera South Asia, \u201cOur ability to seamlessly integrate our new equipment and software with Dialog TV\u2019s existing systems has helped to ensure a stable and reliable service for their millions of customers across Sri Lanka.\u201d",
