    "\u201cI have always believed that the most fundamental concept in leadership is the \u2018law of the lid\u2019. This essentially means that an organisation is only as good as its leader. With this in mind, I have always worked hard to integrate a sustainable business model that thrives on the empowered individuals that make up the workforce. These individuals enable the business to overcome an uneasy, volatile business environment, and thrive amidst the many challenging macroeconomic conditions. We keep close to our heart the understanding that customers will always seek out a brand that they can trust; one that they can truly rely on; one that will always strive to add value and ensure excellence in customer service, built on the tenet of securing customer satisfaction. This is what drives us to success as we embark on the next steps of our corporate journey,\u201d Dr. Pieries said."
