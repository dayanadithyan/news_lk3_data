    "Says the party will take legal action against Treasury Secretary if he does not release funds for polls",
    "Condemns his actions with deep disgust and calls his behaviour undemocratic and against electoral tradition",
    "Reminds the State official he is bound to support the holding of elections according to the Constitution",
    "The newly formed coalition, the Freedom People\u2019s Alliance has written to Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana and said his refusal to provide the necessary funds to the Election Commission of Sri Lanka for the upcoming Local Government elections is undemocratic and against electoral tradition.",
    "The party said it condemns his actions with deep disgust as they have brought the electoral process now to a grinding halt. The party also noted that it appears the Treasury Secretary is being deliberately used by another person or persons to postpone the elections.",
    "The party highlighted that the Treasury Secretary is bound by Article 104 of the Constitution to support the holding of elections and therefore he is bound to release the funds allocated through the budget of 2023.",
    "In the letter signed by the party General Secretary Thilanga Sumathipala, it told Siriwardana they strongly believe he is in violation of the Constitution by not providing the EC with the funds it needs.",
    "\u201cWe also believe you have participated in the violation of the human rights accorded to candidates who have paid in their deposits with the intention of contesting at the elections,\u201d it added. The party said if Siriwardana fails to take the facts presented into consideration and act accordingly, it will file legal action against him and the 35 MPs of the party will also voice their dissent against him in Parliament."
