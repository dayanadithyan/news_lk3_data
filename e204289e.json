    "Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella proposed to introduce the option of paid-ward facilities in state hospitals for locals and foreigners.\u00a0A large number of government employees are covered under the National Insurance Trust Fund for state workers and pensioners, (the \"Agrahara\" medical insurance scheme). Although free medical facilities are provided under this insurance, they are unable to use these benefits, so most state employees and those with the \"Agrahara\" medical insurance go to private hospitals instead.",
    "Cabinet approval was sought to introduce 'paid wards' at state hospitals for those with medical insurance and Sri Lankans and foreign nationals willing to pay for medical facilities.",
