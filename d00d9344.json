    "After carrying out the slaying, the suspected gunmen shouted Hindu religious chants.",
    "Fearing the possibility of violent unrest in the wake of the killings, the Uttar Pradesh government barred gatherings of more than four people across the entire state.",

    "Police in Uttar Pradesh have killed more than 180 suspected criminals during encounters over past six years.",
    "The head of the opposition Samajwadi Party, said the slaying of his ex-party member while in police custody demonstrated the failure of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party to bring law and order to Uttar Pradesh.",
    "\u201cWhen someone can be killed in firing openly amidst the security cordon of the police, then what about the safety of the general public,\u201d Samajwadi\u2019s Akhilesh Yadav said in a tweet.",
    "Before losing an election in 2014, Ahmed had been a lawmaker with Samajwadi, and later the regional Apna Dal party."
