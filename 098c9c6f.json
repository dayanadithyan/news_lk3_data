    "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Wednesday said it has approved Sri Lanka\u2019s eligibility to access concessional financing.",
    "The availability of concessional assistance, offered at low interest rates, broadens Sri Lanka\u2019s options to bridge its urgent development financing needs to restore economic stability and deliver essential services, particularly to the poor and vulnerable, the Philippines\u200e-based regional development bank said in a press release.",
    "Eligibility for concessional resources among the ADB\u2019s developing member countries is based on gross national income per capita and creditworthiness.",
    "ADB explained that its decision was considered based on a request from the Sri Lanka government in view of the severe and unprecedented economic crisis that has reversed hard-won development gains.",
    "\u201cADB is committed to further enhancing its support for the people of Sri Lanka as the country responds to this deep crisis that has severely undermined their livelihoods and well-being,\u201d said ADB Director General for South Asia, Kenichi Yokoyama. \u201cThe availability of concessional assistance will help Sri Lanka to lay the foundation for economic recovery and sustained, inclusive growth.\u201d",
    "Thus, Sri Lanka is now eligible for ADB support including concessional and market-based financing, technical assistance, policy advice, and knowledge solutions that together comprise a comprehensive suite of options to address the crisis.",
    "The ADB notes that access to concessional financing will also ease debt servicing pressures through more favourable lending terms."
