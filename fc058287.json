    "\u201cCriminalisation of LGBTQ+ sexuality is unjust and undermines equal opportunities for enjoyment of personhood, intimate relationships, participation in family and community life, access to services and employment - as well as creates vulnerability to discrimination and harm,\u201d they noted. The petitioners also highlighted that decriminalisation of homosexuality is an important step towards addressing homophobic discrimination and harm in Sri Lanka, and as such will benefit the mental health and psychosocial well-being of LGBTQ+ persons.",

The intervening petitioners in their petitions said that if the proposed bill is enacted by Parliament that it will remedy a long-standing injustice against the LGBTQ+ community in Sri Lanka.
