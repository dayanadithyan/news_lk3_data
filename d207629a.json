    "Instructions have been given to Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) to continue fuel deliveries on Saturday and Sunday this week, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said today.",
    "The decision was taken to supply sufficient stocks to all fuel stations due to the current artificial shortage, he added.",
    "The Minister also said the CPC and CPSTL have not been operating on Sundays and public holidays during the last four months to reduce expenses on overtime.",
    "Fuel stations not placing their orders from last Saturday anticipating a price reduction, not maintaining minimum stocks, immediate increase in demand by consumers after the price revision and the quota increase has created shortages in fuel stations, the minister stated.
