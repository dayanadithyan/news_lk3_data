    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings has downgraded Co-operative Insurance Company Plc from BBB (lka) to BB (lka) and place the firm on rating watch negative, following recent regulatory action.",
    "The Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka had suspended its license to carry out business.",
    "\u201cThe multiple-notch downgrade reflects our \u2018Least Favourable\u2019 corporate governance ranking for CICPLC following the recent restrictions on the insurer\u2019s business activities after the regulator found governance shortcoming,\u201d Fitch said.",
    "\u201cOur assessment of CICPLC\u2019s governance structure and corporate transparency is now weaker, and we believe that this development may affect the insurer\u2019s franchise and competitive positioning, which may then result in a weaker business profile.\u201d",
    "Fitch Downgrades Co-operative Insurance\u2019s National IFS to \u2018BB(lka)\u2019; Maintains Watch Negative",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 21 Apr 2023: Fitch Ratings has downgraded Co-operative Insurance Company PLC\u2019s (CICPLC) National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating to \u2018BB(lka)\u2019 from BBB(lka)\u2019 and maintained the Rating Watch Negative (RWN). The downgrade follows the recent restrictions imposed by the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL) limiting CICPLC\u2019s ability to carry out insurance",
    "The multiple-notch downgrade reflects our \u2018Least Favourable\u2019 corporate governance ranking for CICPLC following the recent restrictions on the insurer\u2019s business activities after the regulator found governance shortcomings. Our assessment of CICPLC\u2019s governance structure and corporate transparency is now weaker, and we believe that this development may affect the insurer\u2019s franchise and competitive positioning, which may then result in a weaker business profile.",
    "On 11 April 2023, the IRCSL suspended CICPLC\u2019s registration to carry out insurance business as the insurer failed to maintain the composition of the board of directors in accordance with the company\u2019s articles of association. CICPLC\u2019s announcement says the suspension will in force until 2 May 2023, during which it will not be able to acquire or renew business. The company says that it will be able to continue servicing its existing customers.",
    "Trading of CICPLC\u2019s shares on the Colombo Stock Exchange was suspended on 18 April 2023 as the company failed to comply with the listing rules that require the chairman or one member of the audit committee to be a member of a professional accounting body.",
    "The RWN reflects the uncertainty regarding the resolution of the governance issues and restrictions as well as the potential impact on the CICPLC\u2019s franchise and business volume. The RWN also continues to reflect the potential for the insurer\u2019s creditworthiness to deteriorate relative to other entities on the Sri Lankan National Rating scale amid high investment and liquidity risks, pressure on its regulatory capital position and a weaker financial performance outlook. The heightened investment risks and earnings pressure amid the weak operating environment could affect the insurer\u2019s regulatory capital profile.",
    "We expect to resolve the RWN once we have more clarity on the resolution of CICPLC\u2019s corporate governance shortcomings as well as when the impact of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis on CICPLC\u2019s credit profile becomes more apparent. This may take longer than six months.",

    "\u2013 Fitch\u2019s perception that CICPLC\u2019s corporate governance practices have deteriorated, including a weaker governance structure and financial transparency limitations",
    "\u2013 Weakening in CICPLC\u2019s company profile, for instance, due to a weaker franchise, operating scale, business risk profile",
    "\u2013 Inability to access foreign- or local-currency assets to meet the insurer\u2019s liabilities, including any restrictions by the government",
    "\u2013 Rising investment and asset risks, including a downgrade of the ratings of financial institutions or the sovereign",
    "\u2013 Deterioration in the risk-based capitalisation ratio to below 190% for a sustained period (9M22: 204%).",
