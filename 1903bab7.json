    "Chief Guest Nobel Peace Prize winner Prof. Mohan Munasinghe being presented the first copy of the book by General Paranagama",
    "Sri Lanka Armoured Core Reconnaissance Regiment Commanding Officer Major General Swarna Bothota being presented with the book by the author",
    "From Trooper to Major General without favouritism or political patronage",
    "\u201cAs an officer and a gentleman par excellence Major General Tilak Paranagama rose in the ranks from Trooper to Major General without relying on favouritism or political patronage based on his own talents, exemplary skills and performance,\u201d said Prof. Mohan Munasinghe, the Chief Guest at the launch of General Paranagama\u2019s autobiography titled \u2018DESTINY \u2013 My life in the Army\u2019 successfully held at Rock House Camp, Colombo 15 recently.",
    "The only Sri Lankan Nobel Peace Prize winner (2007) Prof. Munasinghe said, \u201cIt is a privilege to speak on a highly distinguished retired senior officer of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces who commands the respect of both military officers and servicemen.\u201d",
    "Prof. Munasinghe who had associated with the General for over two decades went on to describe him as a good friend, a fine human being and a caring family man.",
    "\u201cHis memoirs being launched today is a unique testament to his dedication to the Armed forces and unstinting loyalty to our nation,\u201d he added.",
    "Highlighting on a few of the high points of his career in the book, Prof. Munasinghe revealed that the General\u2019s superiors thought so highly of him that he became the first officer appointed to command a regiment while holding only the rank of Colonel.",
    "\u201cAfter completing a US course General Paranagama received the highest praise from a US General as \u201ca brilliant student with no weaknesses\u201d. In 2007 the President of Sri Lanka conferred him with the national honour of Deshe Keerthi for his services to the nation.",
    "Prof. Munasinghe acknowledging the hardships that is endured by our armed forces, being away from the comfort of a loving wife and family and facing stress while carrying out patriotic duties, recounted a few of many such occasions that General Paranagama faced.",
    "\u201cWithin two days of resuming duties as the officer responsible for security in Colombo after an arduous heart bypass abroad, General Paranagama had to deal with the assassinations of Lalith Athulathmudali and subsequently President Premadasa,\u201d he revealed.",
    "Prof. Munasinghe said, \u201cThe country needs many more, especially young ones, of the calibre of General Paranagama with bravery, strength, integrity, hard work, commitment, dedication and willingness to do the difficult tasks.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou deserve our renewed praise and gratitude for setting such a fine example to young officers,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cEven I, a mere civilian, know that the Armed Core modelled on traditional Cavalry Regiments is an elite unit in the military. You have truly lived up to your motto \u2018Wither the Fates call\u2019.\u201d",
    "The Guest of Honour at the event, former Governor Western Province J.C. Logesweran who also spoke, said he has known the author of the, book, General Paranagama for 30 years, from the time he was serving as a Civil Administrator in Vavuniya when Major General Paranagama was also serving there.",
    "Speaking of the book he described it as one that is \u201ceasy to read, clear, lucid and some of the most important events of his Army life so well packed into just 100 pages\u201d. \u201cThe simple style in which it\u2019s written is an example others can follow,\u201d he added.",
    "Within two days of resuming duties as the officer responsible for security in Colombo after an arduous heart bypass abroad, General Paranagama had to deal with the assassinations of Lalith Athulathmudali and subsequently President Premadasa",
    "\u201cIn the book he has mentioned a number of people I had the privilege of associating with; General Attygala, General Cyril Ranatunge and the then Brigadier and later General, Denzil Kobbekaduwe who was General Paranagama\u2019s predecessor in Vavuniya when I served in Vavuniya as a Civil Administrator,\u201d he revealed.",
    "\u201cIn that period those people at the time knew exactly the role that they should play and the role that the Civil Administrator should play. The line was clearly marked and there was a narrow strip which nobody crossed. It was remarkable working with them,\u201d he informed.",
    "Making a poignant point, the former Governor stated, \u201cThere is something very important I have wanted to say as a Civil Administrator for a long time \u2013 during the times these high ranking Army officers, Kobbekaduwe, Paranagama, Jayewardena and Kyngsley were there, there was no instance where people were arrested and were found to have disappeared.\u201d",
    "\u201cThere were no instances like that. Nothing like that,\u201d he emphasised. \u201cThat was not a problem. When somebody was taken into custody, it was accounted for. Absolute discipline was maintained. People respected and looked up to the Army at that time. It was a great pleasure for me to work at that time,\u201d he recounted.",
    "\u201cI was a Government Agent for nine years. Before that I functioned there in several other capacities,\u201d he asserted.",
    "Raising another very important point, former Governor Logesweran said that there is what is called in Sinhala as \u201cKeelam\u201d that creates all sorts of unnecessary issues and problems for Officers.",
    "\u201cBy chance I came across an interesting book by an English anthropologist titled \u2018Watching the English\u2019. In the book she says how the Englishman behaves and what is to be expected of him. In one instance she speaks about how the English people are very fond of their soldiers. One important thing is that they are disallowed to resort to undercutting people. They call it crass.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf a soldier is found to be doing that, he would be given a thorough beating. He would, for example, have stitches the following day. Then he goes limping to where superior officers are and when they ask him what happened, he would say that he walked through a glass door. The superior officers tell him, if you say so, it must be so. The habit of standing by your people and not undercutting them is characteristic of an English soldier. This is what struck me, in her book,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cGeneral Paranagama speaks also of disappointments, meeting his \u2018nemesis\u2019 a word we refer to as a Greek God who takes revenge and retributive justice. When I read through I found he was justified in using the word and it is praiseworthy how he has, in his characteristically decent style, written this part as well.\u201d",
    "Former Governor J.C. Logesweran strongly recommended to everyone to not merely read the book, but follow the General\u2019s example of writing your own memoirs.",
    "\u201cHis book gives not merely his personal odyssey of his life in the Army, but also the social political background of that time that he served. General Paranagama has led the way for others on this as well,\u201d he said concluding his speech.",
    "Major Ranjan Senanayaka in his speech described himself as a brother in arms of General Paranagama and traced their association way back to 27 May 1957 when General Paranagama walked into the Ridiyagama Camp.",
    "\u201cI remember him as recruit Trooper Paranagama with his backpack, at which time I had just returned after my training in the UK, and was put in charge of the training of new recruits,\u201d he recalled with much affection.",
    "Proud of their association of 66 years, Major Senanayaka said that he does not regard the event as a ceremony but a celebration of the life of General Paranagama who he admires.",
    "\u201cHe was an excellent soldier. Whatever training he went into, he was an excellent product,\u201d he added. \u201cAlthough my life in the Armed Core was short, we have remained friends to-date. I had the privilege of being an attesting witness at his marriage, which I remember with love,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cGeneral Paranagama got promotions that he was entitled to. I do know he was devoted, determined, honest, and one who worked hard, wherever he went.\u201d",
    "Major Senanayaka questioned: What more honour can one ask for when a Brigadier of the US Army says that he would like to have him in the US Army? That last line written on a course report by a US Brigadier leapt out at me,\u201d he said. What more honour can our little island nation get from a high ranking military officer of the world\u2019s powerful of nations,\u201d said Major Senanayaka, moved visibly with pride.",
    "\u201cIf you ask me the value of this book, I would say, it\u2019s a simple history of a man almost from a village school who walked through the ranks to be a Major General. I really admire this gentleman. I encourage all young officers to read the book and use it as a manual,\u201d he advised the officers that packed the hall. \u201cMajor General is a fine example for young officers to emulate,\u201d he added.",
    "The book launch which was a well-organised full evening\u2019s program, was conducted to military precision. The speeches of the outstanding three personalities and the author himself thanking the military for putting the book launch together got the evening\u2019s program to a grand start.",
    "A cultural and musical item by the regimental cultural troupe added much splendour to the evening. The organising of the entire program was spearheaded by Colonel Commandant Major General Swarna Bothota and his staff.",
    "The book is not for sale. Each invitee was given a complimentary copy. It can be requested from the Regiment and as per the choice of the author, any donations are welcome, only made directly to the Army towards the welfare of the Sri Lanka Armoured Core First Renaissance Regiment."
