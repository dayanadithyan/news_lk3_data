    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s democracy now resembles Ugandan dictator Idi Amin\u2019s administration, according to the main opposition party the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB).",
    "SJB legislator Harshana Rajakaruna told reporters on Friday June 02 that the \u201cwhole country\u201d is being governed as a dictatorship with no word on local government or provincial council elections.",
    "\u201cThere are no provincial council (PC) polls today. PC polls are not even being discussed. [Provincial] governors friendly to the [central] government appointed to the provinces.",
    "\u201cOne person runs the whole province. There is no talk of local government (LG) polls either,\u201d he said, accusing the government of ignoring a court verdict on the matter.",
    "The MP was also critical of a proposed Broadcast Authority Act which the SJB and other opposition groups say will deal a death blow to media freedom in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cToday we have Idi Amin\u2019s democracy in this country,\u201d said Rajakaruna.",
    "\u201cThere is freedom of speech, but I cannot guarantee freedom after speech,\u201d the MP said, citing a quote infamously attributed to the former military dictator of Uganda who had to flee his country and live in exile in Saudi Arabia.",
    "Amin, aside from being a ruthless dictator accused of showing scant regard for human life, also followed a destructive economic policy that his critics say devastated the African nation\u2019s economy. Sri Lanka, which is just recovering from a major macroeconomic shock, has made considerable progress over the past year, with inflation projected to come down to single-digit level sooner than anticipated with the currency also appreciating at a reasonably fast pace.",
    "The present Sri Lankan administration, however, has been widely questioned by credible organisations both local and international for allegedly curbing anti-government protests, though comparisons to a military dictatorship have yet to be made by any quarter besides the SJB.",
    "The Broadcast Authority act, if passed, will violate human rights and the country\u2019s constitution, said Rajakaruna.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s why this broadcast regulation act is being brought. It clearly says only broadcast what the government wants,\u201d he claimed.",
    "While the MP\u2019s claims of an Idi Amin-style dictatorship may be vastly exaggerated, opposition MPs and others have expressed concern over provisions in the proposed Broadcast Authority Act.",
    "Opposition Tamil National Alliance (TNA) legislator and lawyer M A Sumanthiran told reporters on Wednesday May 31 that the bill on the establishment of this statutory body, if enacted, could violate several fundamental rights including the people\u2019s right to information.",
    "\u201cEveryone knows that there have been many attempts in recent times to impose constraints on people\u2019s right to information. This authority will decide which information is true and whether it can be broadcast,\u201d he said.",
    "The proposed act will also empower the authority to cancel broadcast licenses of those who already hold them, said Sumanthiran."
