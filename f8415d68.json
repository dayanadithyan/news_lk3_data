    "Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne yesterday warned that the Transport Minister must resign from his post if he was unable to investigate the price reduction of bus spare parts and service rates as a result of the depreciation of US Dollars against the Sri Lankan Rupee.",
    "Wijeratne said the Minister could do it by appointing a special committee.",
    "He told the media that if Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardane, was unable to appoint a separate committee or take a decision in consultation with the National Transport Commission (NTC), he should resign and must appoint another person to look after the issues.",
    "\u201cThere is a possibility of reducing bus fares in April after the revision of fuel prices on April 1,\u201d he said.",
    "It was reported that the Power and Energy Ministry is considering large drop in fuel prices, that people were skeptical about the claim.",
    "\"If fuel prices are reduced, we could also pass on that benefit to people by reducing bus fares,\" he said.",
    "He said that the depreciation of the USD would directly affect the prices of spare parts. The annual bus fare revision will take place on June 1 every year.",
    "\"But if the fuel prices fell by April 1, we could reduce the bus fares for the people,\" Wijeratne said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
