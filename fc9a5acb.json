    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013A popular street food site in Kimbulawala, near Sri Lanka\u2019s parliament complex, will not be removed but a system will be put in place so that it\u2019s run without causing hindrance to anyone, Urban Development and Housing Minister Prasanna Ranatuga said.",
    "Responding to concerns raised by opposition MPs in parliament about attempts to remove the street food stalls, which attract hundreds of people daily, Ranatunga told parliament on Tuesday February 21 that a discussion on the matter would be held that afternoon.",
    "\u201cThere are street food vendors in many countries. But there are systems in place. In Bangkok, for example, the vendors operate up to a certain time and they clean up once they\u2019re done for the day.",
    "\u201cWe only wish to implement such a system. There is no plan to remove what is a very successful venture,\u201d he said.",
    "However, traders in Kimbulawala said they had received letters on Sunday February 19 ordering them to vacate the premises by Friday February 24.",
    "\u201cWe came here during the pandemic. We\u2019re good businessmen. Some 30 families depend on us,\u201d one of the traders said speaking to reporters on Monday.",
    "There are 33 street food stalls in operation at Kimbulawala, according to traders.",
    "\u201cWe have no idea what will happen to us if we\u2019re evicted from here. We propose that let us continue here until the economy has improved, even at a fee,\u201d the trader said.",
    "Officials of the Road Development Authority (RDA) and police officers had visited the site Sunday and distributed the letters, claiming the instructions had been issued by Trade Minister Bandula Gunawardena.",
    "Opposition MP Harsha de Silva raised the issue in parliament.",
    "Minister Gunawardena responding to de Silva said some 3,000 locations are in the process of being identified as suitable for such operations and have ample room for both pedestrians and vehicular traffic to move without being obstructed.",
    "The minister said the Urban Development Authority (UDA) has received complaints about stalls being run without approval.",
    "Minister Ranatunga said businesses that operate across the road from the street food vendors have also complained that they find it difficult to run their businesses as a result. There have also been complaints about hygiene, he claimed.",
    "\u201cThere will be a meeting at the UDA at 2.30pm today where a mechanism for their operations will be discussed,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Feb21/2023)"
