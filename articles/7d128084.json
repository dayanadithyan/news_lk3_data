    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s first ever semi transparent solar PV powered agrivoltaic pilot project was commissioned in Hanthana, Kandy on Thursday, the Minister of Power and Energy said.",
    "\u201cThe pilot project will assist The Ministry of Plantation Industries, Ministry of Power and Energy, CEB, Tea Small Holders Development Authority and Sustainable Energy Authority to study the development of renewable energy in tea plantations in the country,\u201d Kanchana Wijesekera said on X (twitter).",
    "A photovoltaic (PV) cell is a non-mechanical device that converts sunlight directly into electricity. Sri Lanka\u2019s current energy sector development strategy seeks to increase energy generated from renewables such as wind and solar.",
    "Critics have pointed out that Sri Lanka is paying higher rates to renewable power developers than neighboring India. Wijesekera has said this was due to several reasons including a risk premium after a sovereign default.",
    "\u201cWhen investors are looking at the country they also account for the risk in the country,\u201d Minister Wijesekera said previously. \u201cWe call it the risk premium. There can be a risk insurance. Even Asian Development Bank and the IMF also evaluates before giving. (Colombo/Mar1/2024)"
