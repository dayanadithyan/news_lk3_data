  "original_body_lines": [
    "Senior officials of South Korea and the United States held an emergency phone call over a possible impending visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to North Korea, Seoul\u2019s foreign ministry said on Friday (June 14).",
    "South Korea\u2019s vice foreign minister, Kim Hong-kyun, in the phone call with US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, said that Putin\u2019s visit should not result in deeper military co-operation between Pyongyang and Moscow in violation of UN Security Council resolutions, the ministry said.",
    "Echoing Kim\u2019s concerns, Campbell pledged continued co-operation to tackle potential regional instability and challenges caused by the trip.",
    "\u201cWhile closely monitoring related developments, the two sides agreed to resolutely respond through airtight co-operation to North Korea\u2019s provocations against South Korea and actions that escalate tensions in the region,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.",
    "On Wednesday, a senior official at Seoul\u2019s presidential office said Putin was expected to visit North Korea \u201cin the coming days\u201d. Russia\u2019s Vedomosti newspaper on Monday reported Putin would visit North Korea and Vietnam in the coming weeks.",
    "Civilian aircraft have been cleared from Pyongyang\u2019s airport and there are signs of preparations for a possible parade in the capital\u2019s Kim Il-sung Square, NK PRO, a Seoul-based website, reported this week, citing commercial satellite imagery.",
    "When Sergei Shoigu, then Russia\u2019s defence minister, visited Pyongyang last year to jumpstart the two countries\u2019 warming ties, he accompanied Kim to a parade and saluted as North Korea\u2019s banned nuclear-tipped missiles rolled by.",
    "Speaking at the Stimson Centre think tank in Washington on Wednesday, Campbell said the United States has a very good understanding of what North Korea has provided Russia, which he said has had \u201ca substantial impact on the battlefield\u201d.",
    "Less clear, he said, is what Russia has provided North Korea.",
    "\u201cHard currency? Is it energy? Is it capabilities that allow them to advance their nuclear or missile products? We don\u2019t know. But we\u2019re concerned by that and watching carefully,\u201d he said."
