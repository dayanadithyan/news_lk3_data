  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former President Maithripala Sirisena alleges that the Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has not distributed any of the funds or financial aid received to assist the victims of the Easter Sunday terror attacks.",
    "Speaking to the media in Polonnaruwa today (20), the former President claimed that most of the court cases against him were filed under the influence of Cardinal Ranjith.",
    "\u201cI have set a Guinness World Record with over four hundred court cases against me. These cases were filed as instructed by the Cardinal\u2026one case for the deceased, another for the injured\u2026asking to pay compensation\u201d, Sirisena charged.",
    "\u201cDuring my tenure as the President, I clearly compensated each and every one.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat happened to the funds received by the Cardinal from Catholic organisations, other countries of the world, top Sri Lankan businessmen and several other parties following the Easter attacks?\u2026 It is good if the Cardinal submits a list of individuals who received this money, and about what happened to this money. Not a single cent of those funds has been given to the victims.\u201d",
    "\u201cEven though I paid money from the government when I was president, now I have been sued to pay compensation on my own. That is the situation right now\u201d, he added."
