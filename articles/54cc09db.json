  "original_body_lines": [
    "Member of Parliament Rohini Kumari Kaviratne alleges that the government has appointed Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe as the Acting Attorney General, overlooking Senior Additional Solicitor General Ayesha Jinasena, despite her seniority and eligibility for the role, due to gender bias.",
    "Furthermore, Kaviratne criticized the government, pointing out that it has been two weeks since the \u2018Women Empowerment Act\u2019 was passed in Parliament. She added that while the government introduces various acts to present a progressive image to the international community, their actions in recognizing and promoting women in positions of power have fallen short.",
    "\u201cI need to know on which basis that woman was overlooked and another person was appointed to act in the office\u201d, she questioned in parliament."
