    "TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran opines AKD\u2019s statement in Jaffna was not racist",
    "Says AKD has, in fact, taken great care to eradicate racism in Sri Lanka",
    "Stresses he and others are committed to bringing about changes the entire country desires, alongside AKD",
    "Calls on AKD and others to be part of a change in which people from different areas and who speak other languages will have equal access to people in power",
    "AKD extends gratitude to Sumanthiran for countering Wickremesinghe\u2019s allegations against him",
    "Calls on President Ranil Wickremesinghe to now apologise to citizens for attempting to incite racism",
    "Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A. Sumanthiran came to National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s defence yesterday after President Ranil Wickremesinghe demanded the NPP leader apologise to Northern Tamils over a \u201cthreatening\u201d statement made by him recently.",
    "Despite already pledging his party\u2019s support to Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader Sajith Premadasa, Sumanthiran dismissed Wickremesinghe\u2019s claims of racism against Dissanayake.",
    "The controversy emerged after some persons and groups interpreted a recent statement by Dissanayake in Jaffna as threatening. In his appeal to the Northern residents, Dissanayake urged them not to oppose the change sought by the South, warning that failing to support these changes could lead to them being labelled as opponents of the transformation.",
    "Addressing the media, Sumanthiran defended NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s recent statement in Jaffna, asserting that it was not racist. \u201cI don\u2019t think Comrade Anura Kumara said these words with a view to express any racist feeling. I know him well. He is not such a person. In fact, he has taken great care to eradicate racism in this country,\u201d Sumanthiran opined.",
    "Sumanthiran said he and others are committed to bringing about changes the entire country desires, alongside Anura Kumara Dissanayake. \u201cWe are with Comrade Anura Kumara in that enterprise and we will be fully with him. We will be participants in eradicating corruption. There is no question about that,\u201d he said.",
    "He also said Dissanayake, along with others, should also be part of a change in which people from different areas and who speak other languages will have equal access to people in power.",
    "Sumanthiran\u2019s comments came after Wickremesinghe called on Dissanayake for \u201cthreatening\u201d the people in the North. Speaking at a rally in Udupitti, Jaffna, President Wickremesinghe criticised Dissanayake\u2019s comments, accusing him of using coercion to pressure the Northern population. Following Sumanthiran\u2019s statement to the media, Dissanayake called on Wickremesinghe to apologise to the public.",
    "Speaking at the Inter Company Employees\u2019 Union (ICEU) 25th Anniversary Convention in Colombo yesterday, Dissanayake criticised his opponents, accusing them of basing their campaign on lies, mudslinging, spreading misinformation, and insulting others. He accused Ranil Wickremesinghe of attempting to exploit racism in a troubling manner during the campaign. \u201cI must express my gratitude that I don\u2019t need to respond to Ranil myself; MP Sumanthiran has already given him the best response,\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake added that Wickremesinghe\u2019s attempts to incite racial tensions in the North have been effectively countered by Sumanthiran, a leader who represents the interests of the Northern people."
