  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Vehicle Importers\u2019 Association has raised doubts regarding the government\u2019s repeated claims of easing existing restrictions and allowing vehicle imports.",
    "President of the Sri Lanka Vehicle Importers\u2019 Association Prasad Manage highlighted the uncertainty and potential impacts on the vehicle prices once imports are permitted.",
    "\u201cWe have been waiting for four years to import vehicles. They say it will happen soon, but no specific date is given. The Central Bank Governor said the restrictions can be relaxed gradually. Vehicles are assembled locally, but none have been exported as of yet. The government imposes taxes of around 200% when we import vehicles,\u201d Manage alleged.",
    "He added that discussions with State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya indicated that buses and lorries would be prioritized in allowing vehicle imports, followed by three-wheelers and motorcycles, with cars and vans being considered last.",
    "\u201cWe suspect that the promise of vehicle imports is a ploy. It seems intended to facilitate the MP and ministers\u2019 requests for vehicles, as they have asked the Speaker for new vehicles,\u201d Manage noted.",
    "\u201cCurrent vehicle prices are driven by demand and supply. Even if imports recommence, significant price reductions are unlikely. In fact, there\u2019s a concern that prices might increase in the interim,\u201d he added."
