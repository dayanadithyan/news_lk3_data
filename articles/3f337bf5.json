    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Pho Vietnam, Sri Lanka\u2019s pioneer Vietnamese restaurant has launched Banh Mi, a fusion sandwich, which has gained worldwide acclaim, as the South Asian nation recovers from a currency crisis with a specialist chef flown down to train local staff.",
    "The restaurant has gone through tough times over the past five years with the Coronavirus pandemic which was immediately followed by an economic crisis.",

    "\u201cThere are more tourists and also expats. That is why I decided to launch this now.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s economy has expanded 4.5 percent in the December quarter, after turning positive in the third quarter, ending the slide as the currency stabilized and appreciated amid deflationary monetary policy, giving a stable foundation for businesses to operate and people to live.",
    "B\u00e1nh m\u00ec or banh mi is a short baguette with thin, crisp crust and a soft, airy texture. It dates back to French rule in Vietnam but the shape and texture has been modified to be very lightweight.",

    "\u201cA key challenge is to get the baguette exactly right. The special baguette is made with wheat flour, yeast and water. The secret is in the technique.\u201d",
    "Chef Nguyen Hoang Phu, who came down to Sri Lanka has trained two staff members of Pho Vietnam in baking. Pho is also a famous north Vietnamese soup.",
    "Now 47 years old, Chef Phu has been making Banh Mi from the age 17 when he went to Ho Chi Minh City, the main metropolis in the South of Vietnam, to learn the art.",
    "Later he ran his own bakery, Bep Nha Dieu An, near HCMC. He has also won awards for his work at culinary festivals in Vietnam.",
    "\u201cI want to spread Vietnamese Banh Mi all over Sri Lanka and internationally,\u201d Chef Phu says.",
    "He has helped set up a bakery named \u201cPho and banh mi\u201d in Nagoya, Japa \u201cBanh mi\u201d in Osaka, Japan, as well as \u201cBanh mi Thuy\u201d in Taiwan.",
    "A typical Banh Mi has slices of Vietnamese ham (ch\u1ea3 l\u1ee5a), coriander leaf (cilantro), cucumber, pickled carrots, pickled daikon and red chili combined with elements from French cuisine such as p\u00e2t\u00e9, and mayonnaise."
