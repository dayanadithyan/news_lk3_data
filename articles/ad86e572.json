    "Dogs will soon be able to experience their own \u201cfurst\u201d class flight with the launch of the world\u2019s first jet charter company specifically designed for man\u2019s best friend on 23rd\u00a0 May.",
    "BARK, the dog toy company that coordinates the popular treat subscription BarkBox, is partnering with a jet charter service to take away the challenges of long-distance traveling with dogs, according to a press release. BARK Air, as the company calls it, offers the \u201cwhite glove experience typical of a human\u2019s first-class experience and redirected all that pampering to pooches.\u201d",
    "Taking dogs on airplanes is, typically, a stressful endeavor with different airlines having different policies for pet travel. For example, American Airlines allows small dogs in a carrier to be placed under the seat in front, but larger dogs are put in the cargo space, which has been found to be stressful for the pet. For United Airlines, pets can fly in the cabin if there\u2019s enough space, but they must fit in a carrier under the seat in front.",
    "\u201cWe are excited to take the insights we\u2019ve learned over years to create an experience that is truly dog-first, which is drastically different from just accepting dogs \u2013 from the ground to the skies,\u201d said Matt Meeker, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer at BARK, in a statement.",
    "However, you\u2019ll need to pay a hefty fee for the dog-friendly flight. For now, a ticket for just one dog and one human will run you at least $6,000 one way.",
    "The first BARK Air flights will take off on May 23, and so far, there are only two flight routes available, both from New York\u2019s Westchester County Airport. From New York to London\u2019s Stansted Airport, it\u2019ll cost $8,000 one-way and to Los Angeles\u2019s Van Nuys Airport will cost $6,000 one-way.",
    "Not only does BARK Air allow dogs, it also focuses on the furry friends by treating them like VIPs, the press release said. BARK Air passengers can skip TSA checkpoints and screenings and instead experience a simple check-in process where they can meet the other dogs on the flight and the humans are served a meal cooked by on-site chefs.",
    "When boarding, a BARK Air concierge is on-hand to ensure the dogs are socializing and adjusting to the environment well.",
    "Each flight will undergo \u201cDogs Fly First\u201d flight prep that includes \u201ccalming pheromones, music, and colors that pups prefer.\u201d To make the flying experience easier and more enjoyable, dogs have access to various aids such as calming treats, noise-canceling ear muffs, and calming jackets.",
    "During takeoff and descent, dogs are given a beverage of their choice to help their ears adjust to cabin pressurization. Of course, there will be plenty of treats on the flight.",
