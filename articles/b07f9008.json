Over the next few months, Uber will promote Sri Lanka as a tourist destination to its rider base in India which accounts for one of the largest tourist inflow into the country. The partnership aims to help revive tourism in Sri Lanka which has been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent economic crisis.",
    "Later this month, the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau will organize roadshows in select Indian cities to encourage tourists to visit Sri Lanka. As part of the partnership, Uber will use its platform to promote Sri Lankan tourist spots and food delicacies to its wide customer base across India. Tourists will be provided special promo codes that will give them easy access to safe and convenient transportation options with Uber, and easy food and grocery delivery through Uber Eats. The Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau will also run a contest for Indian citizens, co-promoted by Uber, where 5 winners will stand a chance to win an all-expenses paid holiday in Sri Lanka for 3 nights and 4 days.",
