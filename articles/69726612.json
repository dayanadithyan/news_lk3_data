    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 There is no bad feeling between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), but the president and the ruling party are of two different political positions, SLPP leader Mahinda Rajapaksa said.",
    "The former president told reporters Monday July 01 night at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Colombo that the candidate the SLPP opts to back at the upcoming presidential election will have to be someone who can work with the party.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re democratic. We do something after discussing it with everyone,\u201d he said.",
    "Rajapksa had just returned from Beijing, having concluded an \u201cofficial\u201d four-day visit. In Beijing, he attended the 70th anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence where he was greeted by Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
    "Asked by reporters if there was bad feeling between the SLPP and President Wickremesinghe, Rajapaksa said: \u201cThere is no reason for bad feeling. Politically we\u2019re of two different views.\u201d",
    "Rajapaksa recently spoke against the Wickremesinghe administration\u2019s moves to restructure state-owned enterprises, claiming that a majority of his party are opposed to the \u201csale of national assets\u201d, even as ministers representing the party continue to express support for ongoing reforms.",
    "A number of prominent SLPP members including Power & Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry and MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage were seen at a political rally held in Matara on Sunday June 30 ostensibly as part of President Wickremesinghe\u2019s election campaign, though he has yet to officially announce his candidature.",
    "Asked for comment on the presidential election to be held between September 17 and October 18, Rajapaksa said: \u201cWe will put a candidate and see. Wait a little. The party hasn\u2019t made a decision yet.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt is someone who can work with us that we can give it to. It must come from the people. Leaders come from the people,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNo, not yet. Let\u2019s see. Thee is still time,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jul02/2024)"
