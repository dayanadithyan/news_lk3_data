    "Kurunegala, June 2 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that corrupt and rowdy politicians who backed away after the 'Aragalaya' have started to raise their heads again, NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today that if the true aspirations of the Aragalaya are to be fulfilled, a government which maintains the true objective of the people's uprising should be established.",
    "Speaking at the NPP youth rally in Kurunegala, he said the National People's Power (NPP) is the only political force and the government which could uphold the true aspirations of the people's uprising in 2022.",
    "He said politicians have not learnt any lessons from the Argalaya and said that instead they are humiliating the people's uprising, claiming it an uprising of drug addicts.",
    "Dissanayake said the people, especially the youth took to the streets for common aspirations without allegiance to any political force and added that however, they had aspirations for a good political situation.",
    "\"People expected a disciplined and lawful country free of fraud and corruption. They took to the streets for a common social objective. The rulers did not realise that. They humiliated it and said drug addicts and prostitutes engaged in the Aragalaya. These rulers never learnt a lesson even from such a massive uprising,\" he said.",
    "He said the politicians were marching along the same old path even after the Aragalaya where they have started to supress the people using their power and have started to sell state property."
