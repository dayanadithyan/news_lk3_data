    "In a compelling narrative, Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry announced on Monday that the country\u2019s economy, emerging from a severe crisis, is demonstrating remarkable resilience and improvement.",
    "Speaking on CNA\u2019s Asia First program in Singapore, Sabry highlighted key indicators of economic recovery, including a surge in tourism and a strengthening of the rupee.",
    "Sabry elaborated that the completion of significant restructuring efforts, both locally and with international bondholders, has nearly restored the country\u2019s debt sustainability.",
    "He said this progress is expected to reopen access to international markets for concessionary loans, which are crucial for economic revitalisation.",
    "\u201cOur focus now is on fostering growth to improve living standards and income levels,\u201d the Foreign Minister stated.",
    "He underscored the importance of attracting investments across various sectors to stimulate economic growth.",
    "\u201cWe managed to avert a deeper crisis and have achieved stability, but growth has not yet taken off. Our challenge now is to spur growth, requiring substantial investment, particularly in key sectors,\u201d he reflected on the recent economic turmoil.",
    "Regarding China\u2019s involvement, Sabry mentioned that Sri Lanka owes around $ 8 billion of its $ 33 billion external debt to China.",
    "He praised China\u2019s cooperative stance in the restructuring process, alongside other key bilateral creditors like Japan, India and France.",
    "Chinese investments, he added, are vital for revitalising Sri Lanka\u2019s economy.",
    "Sabry also outlined a multi-faceted strategy for sustainable and inclusive growth. This includes combating corruption, enhancing service efficiency, bridging the digital divide, and investing in renewable energy, port development and positioning Sri Lanka as a maritime and air traffic hub.",
    "The Foreign Minister also pointed to significant economic milestones achieved recently. \u201cSri Lanka has transitioned from a double-digit recession to a 5.3% growth rate. Tourist numbers are rising, the Sri Lankan rupee has appreciated by 20-25%, and our reserves are increasing. For the first time in six years, we have a primary account balance,\u201d he explained.",
    "However, Sabry acknowledged that the benefits of these improvements have not yet translated into increased income for the populace, given the high inflation rates. \u201cOur immediate goal is to raise incomes and salaries, which is our focus for the next 6-18 months,\u201d he pointed out.",
    "He said to protect the most vulnerable; the Government has rolled out the Aswesuma social protection program, providing direct cash transfers to around 2 million families living below the poverty line.",
    "Sabry asserted that these measures are aimed at ensuring the economy\u2019s stability and preventing a recurrence of the severe economic conditions experienced two years ago."
