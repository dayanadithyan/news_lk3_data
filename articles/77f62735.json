    "The review process kicked off on Thursday (March 07) with an opening meeting with President Wickremesinghe during which Mr. Breuer said the IMF program is exhibiting promising signs of efficacy, translating into tangible outcomes owing to the Sri Lankan authorities\u2019 commitment to the program and its implementation.",
