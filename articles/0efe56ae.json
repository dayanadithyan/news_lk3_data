    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A court decision blocked an attempt to give freehold rights to people 20 years ago, Sri Lanka\u2019s President Ranil Wickremesinghe said, at a ceremony where 662 people in the Badulla District were given deeds.",
    "\u201cThe \u201cUrumaya\u201d Program was implemented in this country in 2002 and 2003 but was halted by a court decision.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe government took the land from the people to build the Kotmale Reservoir and the Theldeniya Reservoir, relocating those affected to these areas,\u201d Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by his media division.",
    "When he tried to do this in 2002-03, the court said a referendum was needed to do so.",
    "\u201cThis necessitated a new law to provide these lands under the Land Development Ordinance. I presented the draft law, but the Supreme Court ruled that a referendum was necessary to pass such legislation.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf we had the opportunity to implement that program back then, we could have confirmed freehold land rights for the people 20 years ago. However, foreign investors were later given free land instead.",
    "\u201cIf it was possible to allocate government land to the Shangri-La Hotel under the Land Ordinance, why can\u2019t I, as the President, grant land rights to 2 million people?\u201d (Colombo/Jul15/2024)"
