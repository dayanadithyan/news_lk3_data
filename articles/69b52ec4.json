    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka former president Maithripala Sirisena has given a statement to the Criminal Investigations Department on a claim he made that he had information on who was behind the 2019 Easter bombings.",
    "Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) general secretary Sarathi Dushmantha confirmed reporters gathered outside the CID premises Monday March 25 morning that Sirisena was inside making a statement.",
    "\u201cHe will make his statement. Any action going forward will depend on the statement. I don\u2019t believe there is any problem. He has no need to hide anything. He has come directly to the CID to make his statement,\u201d said Dushmantha.",
    "\u201cAs a country, I think that\u2019s what everyone expects,\u201d he said.",
    "Dushmantha said Sirisena has \u201c200 percent support\u201d from the SLFP, the party Sirisena leads.",
    "Asked why Sirisena waited three weeks to reveal to the public that he had information on the mastermind behind the attack, Dushmantha said: \u201cHe will talk about that in his statement. We don\u2019t know about it.\u201d",
    "Responding to comments that Sirisena\u2019s controversial remark was an election stunt, the SLFP secretary said: \u201cSociety can express various opinions, but what the country needs is the truth, and he stands for that, and he will cover all that in his statement.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said at an event that Sirisena, who was once his president in the Yahapalana government in which Premadasa was a cabinet minister, must reveal what he claims to know.",
    "\u201cHe said he knows the truth about the attack and who did it. All 22 million, myself included, are waiting with bated breath to find out who masterminded this gruesome terrorist attack,\u201d said Premadasa.",
    "\u201cWe ask him not to hesitate and reveal this truth for the sake of the people who lost their lives,\u201d he said.",
    "Premadasa added that a future government headed by him will open a fresh investigation into the Easter bombings, with the participation of \u201clocal and international stakeholders\u201d. (Colombo/Mar25/2024)"
