    "Yes, golden words, indeed, from Chandral Fonseka, leader of the group Kings, who celebrated his 69th birthday on Saturday, 30th March.",
    "Says Chandral: \u201cI am 69 and still very much active in the music field. I have no enemies in this world but only friends.",
    "In three Facebook accounts, I have 15,000 friends. Most of them are interacting with me often. I have 4000 contacts on my mobile. I always respond to their posts or calls.",
    "\u201cI have always played music with better musicians than me and gained a lot of insight from them before becoming a leader myself.",
    "I have learned to give due respect to people where it is due. I have learned to live a righteous life in a corrupted world. I love to do good, but prefer to do the right thing always.",
    "I am learning new things daily. I apply Biblical insight to my daily life. 69 years is long and my happy moments are greater than the sad times.",
    "\u201cI have never pulled a musician out of another band when there is a vacancy in my band and always taken someone who is free.",
    "I believe perfect ear is a blessing. I have more friends than money in this world. I count all these as God\u2019s grace.",
    "\u201cThank you all for sending me greetings and may your day also be a blessed one.\u201d",
    "Kings, with Chandral, are seen regularly at various functions, and they have regularly weekly dates at the Hilton, as well.",
