    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka must restructure its debt to come out of its financial crisis, former MP Sunil Handunneththi said, adding that a future National People\u2019s Power (NPP) government will not decline to pay off debts incurred by previous governments.",
    "Speaking at an event on Monday June 10, Handunneththi said NPP representatives that met International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials had asked for time to resolve a number of issues faced by the public.",
    "\u201cWe met IMF officials. What we told them clearly was to first allow us to solve our country\u2019s people\u2019s problems first. That\u2019s a reasonable request. If we\u2019re ready to form a government that does not waste, their first attention has to come to us.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re not saying we won\u2019t repay the debt. We won\u2019t say we cannot pay [presidents Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s, Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s or Gotabaya Rajayakasa\u2019s] debt. As a country we\u2019re bound to pay it. But give us a fair amount of time,\u201d he said.",
    "Handunneththi, who plays a senior advisory role in the NPP\u2019s economic council, also said that it would take some time to fix the economy.",
    "\u201cIt will take some time to fix the economy. To come out of this crisis, we really must go for a debt restructuring,\u201d he said.",
    "The former MP caused some controversy earlier this year when he made a remark casually dismissing Sri Lanka\u2019s obligations to its international sovereign bond (ISB) holders. A video went viral online showing Handunneththi, who is also the ex-chair of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), insisting that creditors a risk when investing in an ISB.",
    "\u201cHow did we get stuck in ISBs? Everyone who puts in money for ISBs do so taking the risk involved. They calculate the interest with the risk included. They have already taken the risk from the interest. If we say we\u2019re not paying the ISB debt, they\u2019ll say \u2018it\u2019s okay, machang\u2019, because the risk is contained in the interest,\u201d Handunneththi said in the video.",
    "\u201cISBs are for investing in risky economies. The maturity periods and interests are calculated after a risk analysis. That\u2019s what we have to say to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) too. \u2018Give us the loan if you wish to. We will pay it back, but give us a fair amount of time to pay back. We don\u2019t want conditions,\u201d he added. (Colombo/Jun11/2024)"
