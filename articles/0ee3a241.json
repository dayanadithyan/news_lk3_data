    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Proposed Internet Law Threatens Upcoming Elections; Government Body Could Impose Sweeping Censorship, Prosecute Offenders",
    "A repressive new internet law that Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe is trying to rush through parliament\u00a0this week would create broad and vague new speech-related offenses punishable by lengthy prison terms. The law would seriously threaten the right to freedom of expression as Sri Lanka prepares for parliamentary and presidential elections later this year.",
    "The proposed law, the\u00a0Online Safety Bill, purportedly provides protections against online harassment, abuse, and fraud. Instead, it is mostly\u00a0concerned with\u00a0creating a new \u201cOnline Safety Commission,\u201d appointed by the president, that can decide what online speech is \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201charmful,\u201d remove content, restrict and prohibit internet access, and prosecute individuals and organizations.",
    "Commission-appointed \u201cexperts\u201d would be empowered to enter and search suspects\u2019 premises. Offenses under the law carry hefty fines and prison sentences up to five years.\u00a0The United Nations\u00a0human rights office said the law \u201ccould potentially criminalize nearly all forms of legitimate expression, creating an environment that has a chilling effect on freedom of expression.\u201d",
    "The Asia Internet Coalition, an industry body including tech giants such as Google, Apple, and Meta, has\u00a0called the bill\u00a0a \u201cdraconian system to stifle dissent\u201d and\u00a0warned\u00a0it \u201ccould undermine the potential growth of Sri Lanka\u2019s digital economy.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka is still reeling from an economic crisis partly caused by\u00a0misgovernment\u00a0and failures of accountability. In 2022, months-long protests demanding reform toppled the prime minister and president. Since coming to power that year, President Wickremesinghe has moved to stifle dissent.",
    "Other repressive legislation before parliament includes a new broadcasting law, which the UN experts say could be used to \u201csuppress dissenting voices,\u201d and a counterterrorism law that \u201cgrants wide powers\u00a0to the police \u2013 and to the military \u2013 to stop, question and search, and to arrest and detain people, with inadequate judicial oversight.\u201d",
    "According to the International Monetary Fund, which is supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, restrictions on civil society, including the \u201cbroad application of counter-terrorism rules,\u201d already limit \u201coversight and monitoring of government actions,\u201d contributing to \u201csevere governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s repressive laws have facilitated widespread human rights violations for decades and contributed to economic and political crises. Passing the Online Safety Bill would be a disastrous setback."
