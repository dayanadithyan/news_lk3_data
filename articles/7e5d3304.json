    "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said on Sunday that Ukraine had stationed more than 120,000 troops at its border with Belarus and Minsk had deployed nearly a third of its armed forces along the entire border, the Belta state news agency reported.",
    "Lukashenko, a staunch ally of Vladimir Putin, was speaking against the backdrop of a Ukrainian incursion into Russia that began on Aug. 6 when thousands of Kyiv\u2019s troops smashed through Russia\u2019s western border in a major embarrassment for Putin\u2019s top military brass.",
    "\u201cSeeing their aggressive policy, we have introduced there and placed in certain points - in case of war, they would be defence - our military along the entire border,\u201d Belta cited Lukashenko as saying in an interview with Russian state television.",
    "Andriy Demchenko, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian border service, told Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda on Sunday that the situation on the border with Belarus remained unchanged.",
    "\u201cAs we can see, Lukashenko\u2019s rhetoric does not change either, constantly escalating the situation with regularity to please the terrorist country,\u201d Demchenko said.",
    "\u201cWe are not seeing any increase in the number of equipment or personnel of Belarusian units near our border.\u201d",
    "Lukashenko did not say exactly how many troops Minsk deployed along the border. Belarus\u2019 professional army has about 48,000 troops and around 12,000 state border troops, according to the 2022 International Institute for Strategic Studies\u2019 Military Balance.",
    "Belarusian Defence Minister Viktor Khrenin said on Friday there was a high probability of an armed provocation from neighbouring Ukraine and that the situation at their shared border \u201cremains tense\u201d.",
    "Lukashenko said the Belarusian-Ukrainian border was mined \u201cas never before\u201d and that Ukrainian troops would incur huge losses if they tried to cross it."
