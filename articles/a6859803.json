    "Roshan Williams, who was recently awarded the prestigious Master Printer Status in Digital Printing by the Ingrin Printing and Graphics Academy, met with High Commissioner for New Zealand David Pine, in Sri Lanka, with Ingrin Academy CEO and Managing Director Ananda Wickramaratne.",
    "Williams\u2019 wife, Deepa Samarasinghe, was also present. Their meeting was a proud moment as Pine admired the Ingrin Academy\u2019s qualifications, noting that the New Zealand Qualifications Authority has recognised its Higher Diploma in Printing and Graphics as equivalent to the National Diploma in Print Industry Management Level 5 on the NZ Register of Quality Assured Qualifications, a testament to its global recognition."
