    "Colombo, Feb. 29 (Daily Mirror)- A\u00a0 Fundamental Rights petition filed by Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran challenging the Speaker's act of certifying the Online Safety Bill has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.",
    "The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justices Priyantha Jayawardena, Shiran Goonaratne and Achala Wengappuli refused to grant leave to proceed with the petition taking into account the preliminary objections raised by Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnam.",
    "The Attorney General raised objections citing that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to intervene into the legislative matters following the Speaker's certification to a bill passed by Parliament.",
    "In his petition, Sumanthiran is seeking a declaration that the Speaker\u2019s certification of the Online Safety Act is not valid in law. The petitioner is further seeking a declaration that the fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) and 14 of the Constitution to the petitioner and the citizens have been infringed by the Attorney General by failing to advise the Speaker and Parliament that the committee stage amendments did not make the Online Safety Bill compliant with the Supreme Court\u2019s determination.",
    "The petitioner has cited Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana and the Attorney General as respondents."
