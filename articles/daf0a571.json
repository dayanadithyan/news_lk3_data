    "Presidential candidate of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake states that the NPP is attempting to build a rich country.",
    "Addressing a public rally held in Balangoda, the NPP leader also explained how the country will be developed under an NPP government.",
    "\u201cThe country has collapsed completely. But, we guarantee that we will start to develop this country step by step after the 21st of September\u201d, Dissanayake said.",
    "\u201cHow do we do that? First of all, the nexus between the politician and the citizen should be strengthened.\u00a0 Firstly we will inspire a political reformation to earn the trust of the voters who didn\u2019t vote in our favour. We will set that example.\u201d",
    "\u201cFor a long time, we were governed by governments that were built upon families, relations and friends. However, under an NPP-led government, we will only give positions to those who are qualified for the job. We will not consider political connections or family relationships\u201d, he added.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t we need a country like that? Now, we are attempting to build a rich country - a wonderful life\u201d, the NPP\u2019s presidential candidate said."
