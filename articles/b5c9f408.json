  "original_body_lines": [
    "Meta\u2019s social media platforms Instagram, Facebook and Threads were down for many users on Tuesday.",
    "Facebook and Threads seem to be particularly impacted. Neither app was loading as of 10 a.m. ET, when reports of the outage started to surface on DownDetector.com. Instagram feeds aren\u2019t refreshing for some users, while others are still able to access the app.",
    "The service disruption follows a major outage in 2021, when Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp were down for more than six hours. At the time, Facebook, now Meta, said the outage was caused by \u201cconfiguration changes on backbone routers.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re aware people are having trouble accessing our services. We are working on this now,\u201d Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a post on the social media site X."
