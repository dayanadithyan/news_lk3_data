    "Colombo, May 19 (National World) - A TV star pawnbroker has been hand-picked to sell one of the world\u2019s most impressive gemstones that has been valued at almost \u00a3250 million. The 683lb cluster is owned by a Sri Lankan gem dealer who wants to cash in his asset to fund his financial security and lifestyle.",
    "James Constantinou, who became a hit on the Channel 4 series \u2018Posh Pawn\u2019, will be brokering the giant sapphire, known as the Queen of Asia, to his high profile global connections.",
    "\u201cI deal with a lot of rare and luxurious goods, but this might be my greatest endeavour yet,\u2019 said Constantinou, who runs Prestige Pawnbrokers, which has eight branches around the country. \u201cIt is an investment opportunity for the seller and prospective buyers will include collectors of rare and exotic stones or institutions that want to display it in museums or galleries. It has certainly caused a stir as it is not every day you get such a massive gemstone coming onto the open market.\u201d",
    "The sapphire was unearthed in a gem pit in Sri Lanka three years ago in a region that is rich in mineral resources and precious stones. It was declared as one of the rarest in the world after tests were carried out by the Sri Lankan National Gem and Jewellery Authority.",
    "The rough cut sapphire, owned by Navin Amitha Gamage, caused massive excitement when it was discovered in Ratnapura, 80Kms from the capital Colombo, which is dubbed the City of Gems."
