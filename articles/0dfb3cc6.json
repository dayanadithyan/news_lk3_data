    "A seven member delegation led by the Thai Chamber of Commerce and the Board of Trade of Thailand Chairman Sanan Angubolgul met with the Ceylon Chamber Chairman Duminda Hulangamuwa, along with senior representatives of the Chamber yesterday, culminating in the renewing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to further enhance trade, investment and tourism between Sri Lanka and Thailand.",
    "The MOU was signed in the presence of Ambassador designated to Thailand Wijayanthi Edirisinghe, and Sri Lanka \u2013 Greater Mekong Business Council of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce President S.M.D. Suriyakumara.",
    "This event marks a renewal of a historic partnership, as the Ceylon Chamber\u2019s first MoU was originally established with the Board of Trade of Thailand in 1988. Angubolgul expressed his enthusiasm about the renewed collaboration, emphasising leveraging the Ceylon Chamber\u2019s position as the leading business Chamber in Sri Lanka, to foster bilateral trade ties. He expressed keenness to explore opportunities in several sectors including agriculture, food and investment especially in the area of religious tourism, SPA and restaurants in which he sees high growth potential for Sri Lanka and Thailand.",
    "Hulangamuwa echoed these sentiments, noting that facilitating greater exchange of ideas, technology, and commerce between the two countries is imperative, especially following the recent signing of the Sri Lanka \u2013 Thailand Free Trade Agreement. He underscored the Ceylon Chamber\u2019s commitment to creating a conducive environment for businesses from both countries to thrive and expand their operations."
