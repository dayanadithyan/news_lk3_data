  "original_body_lines": [
    "(East Asia Forum) Nearly two years after announcing a debt default in the middle of a severe social and political crisis, the Sri Lankan economy is showing the first signs of recovery. Year-on-year inflation dropped sharply to a low of 1.5 per cent in October 2023 from its peak of 70 per cent a year earlier. Interest rates are edging down accordingly and the highly volatile currency is now fluctuating within an acceptable range.",
    "After the longest and deepest stretch of negative growth \u2014 lasting seven consecutive quarters \u2014 the economy finally returned to positive growth of 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023. While the\u00a0modest recovery\u00a0may appear underwhelming, it still marks an important milestone for a country that suffered such a harsh economic setback.",
    "The architect of this semi-recovery, Sri Lanka\u2019s President Ranil Wickremesinghe, is yet to declare his intentions as Sri Lanka heads into the all-important presidential elections in 2024, where voters will decide who will lead the country for the next five years.",
    "With the country\u2019s\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0apportioning responsibility for the crisis to the previous government led by former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in a ruling handed down in November 2023, attention is turning to sustaining the recovery and deciding who can be best trusted to manage it. If polling numbers are to be believed, the front runner is from a Marxist-Leninist party \u2014 the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna \u2014 which secured a mere 3.2 per cent of the popular vote in 2019.",
    "The turnabout largely reflects popular disgruntlement with the\u00a0day-to-day struggles\u00a0of falling real incomes and lost livelihoods. While tax increases, market-based pricing on fuel, a shake-up of the welfare system and a clampdown on spending under the terms of Sri Lanka\u2019s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are repairing the country\u2019s public finances, the average citizen has suffered deeply.",
    "Unlike in the past, where successive IMF programs were used to paper over problems and leave the job of overhauling the economy half done, this time around there is a critical need to convince Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign creditors of its commitment to staying on course.",
    "A concern is the economy\u2019s continued high exposure to external shocks as external\u00a0debt restructuring\u00a0negotiations drag on. In October 2023, there was marked progress as Sri Lanka reached a\u00a0preliminary agreement\u00a0with China\u2019s Exim Bank and secured the agreement of other\u00a0large bilateral creditors\u00a0like Japan and India. Sri Lanka has yet to reach an understanding with the country\u2019s bondholders. An October 2023 proposal by bondholders for GDP-linked bonds was turned down by the Sri Lankan authorities. Without a final restructuring agreement, dollar infusions from bilateral donors, development partners and private investors remain a trickle rather than a flow.",
    "It is also not helping that export earnings are falling. By October 2023, earnings had shrunk by over 10 per cent on the back of higher domestic production costs and sluggish global demand. While earnings from tourism and worker remittances are improving, the fact that vast numbers of Sri Lankans are leaving the country in search of better prospects is also of serious concern. With weak household spending and less than two months of foreign reserve import cover to deal with a volatile global economy, Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery path is far from smooth.",
    "While the tax burden is deeply unpopular, Sri Lankans will have to live with higher taxes, a public spending squeeze and a drop in living standards regardless of the promises politicians make before the 2024 elections.",
    "Sri Lanka received the second tranche under the EFF agreement in December 2023. Delivering on the EFF commitments is crucial to tapping further budgetary assistance from multilateral financial institutions and retaining the goodwill of Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign creditors. With hardly any room for policy manoeuvring on the macroeconomic front until the economy is on a surer footing, what the elections may disrupt is the more challenging regulatory reforms that could accelerate the recovery in lost output.",
    "Ranil Wickremesinghe is pursuing reforms to transform the land and labour markets, overhaul state owned enterprises and modernise the education system. Relaxing labour laws, expanding the private sector\u2019s role in delivering tertiary education, selling government stakes in state owned enterprises or entering into regional trade agreements run up against vested interests. These initiatives will slow down in the run up to the election and whether they get picked up thereafter will depend on the electoral outcome. The strategy for now appears to be to ring-fence as much of the reform agenda as possible through legislation.",
    "The crucial 2024 elections will do much to decide Sri Lanka\u2019s future. The focus is not only on the economy but also on the need for stronger institutions and governance mechanisms. Weaknesses in governance are largely faulted for triggering the economic crisis. All these issues may make voter behaviour more unpredictable and tempt presidential aspirants to make unrealistic promises in the hope of attracting votes.",
    "These claims and counter-claims will add to the uncertainties, but the grim reality for any eventual winner is that there is a gruelling recovery path ahead and any policy disruption will only make it that much more difficult.",
