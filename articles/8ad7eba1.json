    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Opposition leader has asked the government to give public sector jobs to 50,000 unemployed graduates, despite the country having a bloated state service sector, and an ongoing strike today by public servants demanding salary increases.",
    "Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said he had seen unemployed graduates striking on the road side during a visit to the North and East.",
    "\u201cWill they be given appointments? What is their future? Why are they not hired for essential vacancies based on their qualifications, they are asking,\u201d he said in parliament.",
    "\u201cIn the North and East the requests made by them I am tabling. From the government side what is the governments plan? The unemployed graduates in my estimation is close to 50,000. There is such a number.",
    "\u201cThey have got the light from our free education, and will they go straight to the unemployed line, is what I am asking?",
    "Premadasa said there were around 22,000 development officers also waiting from 2020 who had helped in teaching during Coronavirus.",
    "\u201cActually they were engaged in the teaching service,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did an excellent service during the Coroanvirus crisis. They have a request that if they were good enough to work during the Coronavirus crisis, why isn\u2019t there a definite stable program for them.",
    "\u201cSo I am requesting that they be given a proper status within the education system. When will justice be done for them?",
    "\u201cJust because they are graduates, they can\u2019t be made teachers,\u201d Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said in reply. \u201cIt is unfair by them and even more unfair on the student.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s teacher service charter specifies that recruits have to sit for a competitive exam and obtain a specific pass mark, and that their qualification match the subject, the minister said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m a law graduate, but I can\u2019t become a teacher because law is not in the school curriculum.\u201d",
    "Related Sri Lanka opposition leader asks for jobs for unemployed graduates, more salaries",
    "\u201cThe opposition leaders question was on unemployed graduates, with a focus on the North and the East,\u201d Premajayantha said.",
    "\u201cThere were mainly two occasions when large numbers of graduates were employed. During the time of President Mahinda Rajapaksa 40,000 unemployed graduates were recruited in one instance and placed in various state agencies.",
    "Then during the time of  President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 52,000 unemployed graduates were recruited and after labelling them Development Officers, they were placed in state institutions.",
    "\u201cMany were in provincial level. Some were in national schools to train as teachers.\u201d",
    "There was a cabinet paper submitted by then Minister G L Peiris to recruit them and sit an exam,  Premajayantha said.",
    "But there was no process in the teachers service in sitting and exam after recruitment, he said. He submitted a cabinet paper for a competitive exam which would then be followed by an IQ test for placements in relevant subjects. Almost all of the 22,000 had applied.",
    "Then a group of graduates had gone to court. They had requested that since they were put for training not to have an exam. The second was to recruit them regardless of their age limit, up to the age of 45.",
    "But the according to the teachers\u2019 service a graduate could be recruited only up to 35 years.",
    "He said most teacher recruits refused to go out of Colombo, to schools in places like Anuradhapura.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka requires a public sector workforce of 1 million to function efficiently. That is what the administration services commission says. But successive governments have ignored this,\u201d Minister of Employment Manusha Nanayakkara said.",
    "\u201cFrom the opposition now we are being asked whether government jobs are will be given to unemployed graduates. We are asking whether in your policies or when you come to power you will give jobs to every unemployed graduate without regard to cadre?,\u201d Nanayakkara challenged.",
    "As there was no immediate answer forthcoming, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera insisted that the question be answered since government ministers give answers.",
    "\u201cIt was a very simple question that was asked,\u201d Wijesekera said. \u201cHe is asking whether they are going to be absorbed into the state service or not.",
    "\u201cThe questions was whether he will hire everyone into the public service and create a bigger burden. If you are waiting to come to power how are you pay the salaries to the people who will be added to the public service?",
    "Premadasa said the the government alone cannot solve the problem of unemployed graduates.",
    "(Colombo/Jul9/2024 \u2013 Updated with more quotes and details of additional 22,000 graduates recruited as development officers, and questions raised by government ministers on how the opposition planned to pay for additional graduates hired into the public service)"
