    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Opposition leader has asked the government to give public sector jobs to 50,000 unemployed graduates, despite the country having a bloated state service sector, and an ongoing strike today by public servants demanding salary increases.",
    "\u201cWe have around 50,000 unemployed graduates in the country. Is the government going to give them appointments, I would like to know, or send them to the jobless queue?\u201d Sajith Premadasa said in parliament on Tuesday.",
    "Premadasa said there was a teacher shortage of 40,000 vacancies.",
    "\u201cJust because they are graduates, they can\u2019t be made teachers,\u201d Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said in reply. \u201cIt is unfair by them and even more unfair on the student.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s teacher service charter specifies that recruits have to sit for a competitive exam and obtain a specific pass mark, and that their qualification match the subject, the minister said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m a law graduate, but I can\u2019t become a teacher because law is not in the school curriculum.\u201d",
    "40,000 unemployed graduates were recruited by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. 52,000 unemployed graduates were recruited as development officers by his brother President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Some of these were later appointed as teachers, Premajayantha said.",
    "He said most teacher recruits refused to go out of Colombo, to schools in places like Anuradhapura.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka requires a public sector workforce of 1 million to function efficiently. That is what the administration services commission says. But successive governments have ignored this,\u201d Minister of Employment Manusha Nanayakkara said. (Colombo/Jul9/2024)"
