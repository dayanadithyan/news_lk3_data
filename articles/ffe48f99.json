    "The Meteorology Department has issued a heat Index Advisory for Saturday (March 09) for five districts in the country.",
    "Accordingly, the heat index, the temperature felt on the human body, is expected to reach \u2018Caution Level\u2019 in parts of Ratnapura, Anuradhapura, Mannar, Vavuniya and Mullaitivu districts tomorrow.",
    "As per the advisory, under this level of temperature, fatigue is possible with prolonged exposure and activity, while continuing activity could result in heat cramps.",
    "Thus, members of the public have been advised to stay hydrated, take breaks in the shade as often as possible and limit strenuous outdoor activities. They were also requested to check up on the elderly and the sick, never leave children unattended inside vehicles and to wear lightweight and white or light-coloured clothing.",
    "The Heat Index Forecast is calculated by using relative humidity and maximum temperature and this is the condition that is felt on your body. This is not the forecast of maximum temperature. It is generated by the Department of Meteorology for the next day period and prepared by using global numerical weather prediction model data."
