    "Avissawella, Jan 20 (Daily Mirror) - statement made by the Opposition Leader about changing the agreement by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with Sri Lanka is a mere slogan, Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.",
    "He said the Opposition Leader had made a statement that he will change the agreement with the IMF under his government.",
    "Therefore, everyone should act responsibly at this time, the Minister said at a meeting in Avissawella today.",
    "\"At a time when the country was in trouble, the agreement made with the financial fund did good and not bad for the country and the economy,\" he said.",
