    "The Group achieved a steady Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 575.8 million in the first quarter of 2024/25, which was a significant turnaround from the loss recorded in the previous year.",
    "The Group\u2019s tourism sector recorded an EBITDA of Rs. 1.7 billion, followed by the Group\u2019s maritime, freight and logistics sector which recorded an EBITDA of Rs. 1.2 billion. The Group\u2019s strategic investments sector demonstrated a stable performance during the quarter whilst the Group\u2019s services sector was slightly hampered by multiple factors.",
    "The Sri Lankan hotels segment and majority of the overseas hotels saw an improvement in occupancy levels which is encouraging. However, the Sri Lankan rupee appreciation during April 2024 had a subdued impact on the Group\u2019s destination management segment. The slight dip in freight rates and the impact of the exchange rate affected the performance of the maritime, freight and logistics sector. The stronger operational performance of the Group\u2019s hydro power companies and the waste to energy power plant together with the recovery of long outstanding dues from the sole off-taker made a positive impact on the Group\u2019s strategic investment sector.",
