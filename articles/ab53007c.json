    "Led by Hayleys PLC Chairman and Chief Executive Mohan Pandithage, 13 sectors within the Hayleys Group of Companies united to sponsor these surgeries.

    "Pandithage, who visited the hospital and interacted with patients\u2019 post-surgery, said, \u201cAs a purpose-led business striving to make lives better, social responsibility is a part of our Group\u2019s core values. Senior citizens have made remarkable contributions to society throughout their lifetimes. By supporting the Helpage \u2018Give the Gift of Sight\u2019 initiative, we look to empower the elderly in a meaningful way, helping them regain their sight so that they may continue to lead fulfilling lives.\u201d",
    "HelpAge Sri Lanka Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge conveyed gratitude to Hayleys for their sponsorship. \u201cGiven the challenges faced by over 500,000 elderly individuals in Sri Lanka, where the risk of losing sight is heightened due to financial and mobility obstacles, donor support in this endeavour is crucial,\u201d he emphasised.",
    "\u201cHayleys has set a commendable example for corporate compassion, illuminating the path for other companies to make a meaningful impact by partnering to support crucial causes.\u201d",
    "Over the festive season of December 2023, Managing Directors of Hayleys Group Companies, HR leaders and volunteers visited the HelpAge Eye Hospital to interact with patients and inquire about their well-being. Essential items such as dry rations, meals, and diverse products made by the companies were distributed to patients and their custodians traveling from all parts of the country."
