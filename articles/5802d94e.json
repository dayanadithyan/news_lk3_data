    "Meanwhile, Secretary to the Ministry of Finance Mahinda Siriwardana noted that establishing a trade national single window system is crucial as Sri Lanka recovers from an unprecedented economic crisis.",
    "The recent workshop was aimed at enhancing participants\u2019 understanding of how the single window system works and its benefits and also encouraged collaboration and sustainability in Sri Lanka\u2019s TNSWS implementation.",
    "Through the United States Agency for International Development, the United States is facilitating the implementation of Sri Lanka\u2019s Trade National Single Window System or TNSWS.",
    "Aimed at modernising the country\u2019s trade facilitation infrastructure, the TNSWS will streamline the collection of information required for trade, leading to increased transparency and efficiency, reduced costs, and more potential revenue.",
