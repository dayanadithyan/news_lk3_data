    "March 11- (CNN) John Cena bared it all at the Oscars on Sunday while presenting the award for best costume design.",
    "The actor appeared on stage during the telecast to present the award for best costume design hilariously appearing to wear nothing at all.",
    "No really, Cena appeared on the stage at the year\u2019s most prestigious event in Hollywood\u2026 almost entirely naked.",
    "The show\u2019s host Jimmy Kimmel set up the bit by sharing a little bit of Oscars history, nodding to the 1974 Academy Awards when a streaker ran across the stage. Kimmel jokingly said, \u201cCan you imagine if a nude man ran across the stage today? Wouldn\u2019t that be crazy?\u201d",
    "From the corner of the stage, Cena peeked his head out and told Kimmel he didn\u2019t want to \u201cdo the streaker bit anymore.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s an elegant event. Honestly, you should feel ashamed right now for suggesting such a tasteless idea,\u201d Cena complained. \u201cThe male body is not a joke!\u201d",
    "Kimmel argued that Cena, who is also a famed WWE wrestler, wrestles in the nude. \u201cDude, I don\u2019t wrestle naked,\u201d Cena said. \u201cI wrestle in jorts!\u201d",
    "\u201cJorts are worse than naked!\u201d Kimmel said as the audience laughed.",
    "At this point, Cena \u2013 carrying an oversized winner\u2019s envelope over his private parts \u2013 walked to the center of the stage as the audience\u2019s jaws dropped to the floor.",
    "\u201cCostumes, they are so important. Maybe the most important thing there is,\u201d he said while presenting the award.",
    "With an assist from Kimmel, who later wrapped Cena in a curtain leaving him much less exposed, they announced Holly Waddington as the best costume design Oscar winner for \u201cPoor Things.\u201d",
    "While Cena appeared to have been naked on stage, a source with knowledge tells CNN that he \u201cwas covered in the groin and butt crack area \u2013 and the envelope was velcroed to him.\u201d",
    "The reason for the safety measures around Cena\u2019s private parts? The show had to make sure there were no FCC violations, CNN understands.",
    "Maybe now Oscar-winner Waddington can whip up something that Cena can wear to the afterparty."
