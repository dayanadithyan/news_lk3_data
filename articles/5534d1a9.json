  "original_body_lines": [
    "Turkish legislators on Tuesday endorsed Sweden\u2019s membership in NATO, lifting a major hurdle on the previously nonaligned country\u2019s entry into the military alliance.",
    "Lawmakers ratified Sweden\u2019s accession protocol 287 to 55, with ruling party members saying the Nordic country\u2019s tougher stance on Kurdish militants was key to winning approval. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also previously has linked the ratification to Turkey\u2019s desire to buy fighter jets from the U.S.",
    "The ratification comes into effect after its publication in the Official Gazette, which was expected to be swift.",
    "Hungary then becomes the only NATO ally not to have ratified Sweden\u2019s accession.",
    "\u201cToday we are one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO,\u201d Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. In Washington, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan welcomed the news, saying having Sweden in the alliance will make it \u201csafer and stronger.\u201d",
    "NATO-member Turkey had been delaying Sweden\u2019s membership for more than a year, accusing the country of being too lenient toward groups that Ankara regards as security threats. It sought concessions from Stockholm, including moves to counter militants.",
    "Turkey also had been angered by a series of demonstrations by supporters of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, in Sweden as well as Quran-burning protests that roiled Muslim countries.",
    "Sweden in the past was a \u201ccenter in Europe\u201d for the PKK, Fuat Oktay, a senior legislator in Erdogan\u2019s governing party and the head of the foreign affairs committee, told parliament.",
    "But since then, Sweden has amended its anti-terrorism laws, curbed the PKK\u2019s financial activities, convicted a terrorism suspect and extradited another, and lifted restrictions on arms sales to Turkey, Oktay said.",
    "\u201cPKK-affiliated circles no longer find a comfortable room for maneuver in Sweden as they did in the past,\u201d Oktay said, explaining why the ruling party was now supporting Stockholm\u2019s bid.",
    "Sweden pledged deeper cooperation with Turkey on counterterrorism, as well as support for Turkey\u2019s ambition to revive its EU membership bid.",
    "Last month, parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee gave its consent to Sweden\u2019s bid in the first stage of the legislative process, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sent its accession protocol to lawmakers for approval.",
    "Turkey\u2019s main opposition party also supported Sweden\u2019s membership in the alliance but a center-right party and the country\u2019s pro-Kurdish party were among parties that opposed it.",
    "\u201cSweden\u2019s steps concerning its extradition of wanted criminals or the fight against terrorism have remained limited and insufficient,\u201d Musavat Dervisoglu, a legislator from the Good Party told parliament.",
    "Erdogan has linked ratification of Sweden\u2019s NATO membership to the U.S. Congress\u2019 approval of a Turkish request to purchase 40 new F-16 fighter jets and kits to modernize Turkey\u2019s existing fleet. He has also urged Canada and other NATO allies to lift arms embargoes on Turkey.",
    "Koray Aydin, another Good Party legislator, had urged parliament to hold out on ratifying Sweden\u2019s accession until the F-16 sales and the modernization kits were approved in Washington, saying Turkey would lose an important bargaining chip.",
    "U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration never formally tied the sale of the F-16s to Turkey\u2019s ratification of Sweden\u2019s NATO membership. However, numerous influential members of Congress had said they would not support the sale unless and until Turkey signed off on Sweden\u2019s accession to the alliance.",
    "U.S. administration officials say they expect relatively quick action on the F-16 sale after the ratification.",
    "Sullivan, the U.S. national security advisor, said after Tuesday\u2019s vote that Sweden\u2019s accession to the alliance has been a priority for Biden.",
    "\u201cSweden is a strong, capable defense partner. Sweden joining NATO is in the national security interests of the United States, and will make the Alliance safer and stronger,\u201d he said.",
    "Sweden and Finland abandoned their traditional positions of military nonalignment to seek protection under NATO\u2019s security umbrella, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Finland joined the alliance in April, becoming NATO\u2019s 31st member, after Turkey\u2019s parliament ratified the Nordic country\u2019s bid.",
    "Hungary has also stalled Sweden\u2019s bid, alleging that Swedish politicians have told \u201cblatant lies\u201d about the condition of Hungary\u2019s democracy. Hungary has said it would not be the last to approve accession, although it was not clear when the Hungarian parliament intends to hold a vote.",
    "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n announced Tuesday that he sent a letter to his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson, inviting him to Budapest to discuss Sweden\u2019s entry into NATO.",
    "NATO requires the unanimous approval of all existing members to expand, and Turkey and Hungary were the only countries that have been holding out, frustrating other NATO allies who had been pressing for Sweden and Finland\u2019s swift accession."
