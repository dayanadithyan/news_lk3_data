    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne has condemned State Minister of Plantation Industries Lohan Ratwatte for his recent comments against rival National People\u2019s Party (NPP) leader Anura Kumar Dissanayake.",
    "Addressing a rally in Kandy over the weekend, Ratwatte had said he will not allow Dissanayake to take over as Sri Lanka\u2019s next leader.",
    "\u201cHas Anura Dissanayake constructed even a small gutter for the people? We won\u2019t allow him to become President of this country as long as I am around in politics,\u201d he had said.",
    "In response Wickramaratne taking to social media platform X yesterday said such statements have dangerous undertones considering Sri Lanka\u2019s history of election interference and violence.",
    "\u201cWhile I disagree with the policies of NPP and believe that Sajith is the election frontrunner, no politician has the right to allow or not allow a candidate to be elected,\u201d Wickramaratne said.",
    "Ratwatte also criticised SJB leader Sajith Premadasa during the rally, claiming that Premadasa judged a man\u2019s height and suggested he was only fit for a security job.",
    "\u201cI voted for Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament to elect him as President with considerable hesitation, but I will now endorse him without any doubt,\u201d he added."
