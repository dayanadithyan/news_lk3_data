    "Parliament, Jan. 24 (Daily Mirror)- Refuting reports that there was a gold-plated camel in his daughter's house, former President Maithripala Sirisena told Parliament that only a personal gift given by the Emir of Qatar was kept at the said residence.",
    "\u201cThe official gift I received from the Emir of Qatar is kept in the museum at Polonnaruwa. Some of my staff members including security personnel received wrist watches worth more than Rupees one million from the Emir. I also got a personal gift and I kept it at my daughter\u2019s house,\u201d MP Sirisena said.",
    "\u201c A person who reads newspapers reports on a national TV station commented on the media reports of the robbery at my daughter\u2019s residence in an unfounded manner and questioned as to why I kept the official gift which I have received at my daughter\u2019s residence,\u201d he said.",
    "He said robbers had only taken some food stuff from his daughter\u2019s house although it was sensationalized by the media,",
    "\u201cBoth social media and mainstream media act in an uncivilized manner. Therefore there is a dire need to regulate all media. However the laws introduced through the Online Safety Bill is too draconian and has to be amended,\u201d he also said."
