    "Commenting on the initiative, Tharindu Wijerathne \u2013 General Manager, National Sales at HUTCH Sri Lanka said, \u201cPoson Poya Day marks the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.

With such significance, this period is also a time to reflect on fundamental Buddhist values such as kindness, generosity, and easing others\u2019 difficulties.",
    "\u201cAs a result, we realized that HUTCH could contribute by making the pilgrimage experience easier and possible to more people in the country. We are incredibly humbled to have been able to provide this valuable service to thousands of pilgrims, under HUTCH Praja Sathkara.\u201d",
