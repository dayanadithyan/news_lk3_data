  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Election Commission says it has no legal authorization\u00a0to resolve the internal rifts of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).",
    "Members of the election body convened a meeting on Thursday (18) to study the documents submitted by the factions within the SLFP with regard to the recent changes made to the party positions and the certain decisions.",
    "When the SLFP\u2019s politburo met on 08 April, the party\u2019s Vice Chairman MP Nimal Siripala de Silva was appointed the new Acting President, and MP Duminda Dissanayake was selected as the General Secretary.",
    "The documents pertaining to these new appointments were handed over to the Election Commission by MP Dissanayake while the party\u2019s Acting General Secretary Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala filed objections challenging them.",
    "When the Election Commission met on Thursday, the submitted materials were extensively reviewed by the members, who were of the view that the party\u2019s infighting should be resolved through the courts, as the election body has no authorization to do so under the existing legal scope and procedures.",
    "Pointing out that it can neither intervene nor take action regarding internal crises of any political party, the election body members noted that they could only decide on accepting the nominations to SLFP candidates if the party\u2019s infighting is dragged out until the announcement of the elections."
