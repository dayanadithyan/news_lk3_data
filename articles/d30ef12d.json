  "original_body_lines": [
    "The United Nations on Sunday urged Sri Lanka to bridge its \u201caccountability deficit\u201d and ensure justice as the country commemorated the 279 victims of its worst-ever attack against civilians five years ago.",
    "The UN\u2019s top envoy to the country, Marc-Andre Franche, told a remembrance service in Colombo that there should be a \u201cthorough and transparent investigation\u201d to uncover those behind the Easter carnage in 2019.",
    "Islamist bombers hit three churches and three hotels in the island\u2019s deadliest suicide attack aimed at civilians, but grieving families say they are still waiting for justice.",
    "Among the dead were 45 foreigners, including tourists visiting the island a decade after the end of a brutal ethnic conflict that had claimed more than 100,000 lives since 1972.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka suffers from a continuing accountability deficit, be it for alleged war crimes, more recent human rights violations, corruption or abuse of power, which must be addressed if the country is to move forward,\u201d Franche said.",
    "He noted that victims were still seeking justice despite the country\u2019s Supreme Court holding the then president Maithripala Sirisena and his top officials responsible for failing to prevent the attack.",
    "\u201cDelivering justice for victims of these attacks should be part of addressing the systemic challenge,\u201d Franche said.",
    "He said the UN Human Rights office has also called on Colombo to publish the complete findings of previous inquiries into the Easter Sunday bombings and to establish an independent investigation."
