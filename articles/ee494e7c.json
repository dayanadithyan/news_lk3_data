    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe said last week that Sri Lanka and the International Monetary Fund has been discussing giving income tax relief by widening tax slabs.",
    "\u201cThe Treasury began negotiating such an amendment with the IMF as far back as September 2023,\u201d Siriwardana told a public forum this week.",
    "\u201cIt was not possible to implement such a proposal previously given the fact that revenue was falling short of targets.",
    "\u201cHowever, with the improvement in revenue performance this year, it has become possible to negotiate an adjustment to the PIT (Personal Income Tax) structure which provides some relief to the tax payers in the middle bands, whilst ensuring there isn\u2019t an excessive gain for the highest income earners.",
    "\u201cThe proposed adjustment to the PIT is estimated to cost around 0.08% of GDP and compensating revenue measures have already been discussed with the IMF, such that revenue targets are not compromised.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka has been going to the IMF repeatedly from the mid-1960s, when the US Fed began activist monetary policy cycles triggering global inflation, leading to the collapse of the Bretton Woods syten Woods in 1971 and so-called Great Inflation.",

    "Until A S Jayawardene became Central Bank Governor in 1995 who did not believe in inflation, Sri Lanka had been without IMF programs for more than a year only from 1985 to 1988, over three decades.",
    "From 1995 to 2009, there was one standby program in 2001 which and an EFF/ECF was struck in 2003, to sequence reforms when there was no monetary instability and deflationary policy was in place.",
    "Peacetime monetary instability and inflationism returned with a vengeance after the war under aggressively where a narrow or single policy rate was enforced through inflationary open market operations without a clean floating exchange regime.",
    "Stabilization crises after rate cuts, invariably involve ad hoc tax hikes, as slowing growth reduces tax revenes.",
    "The aggressive call money rate targeting led to twin stabilization crises within the same program, busting growth, while monetary debasement and debt accelerated.",
