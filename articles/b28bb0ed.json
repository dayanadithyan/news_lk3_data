    "Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe said the applications can be submitted online or through the Divisional Secretariats for a period of one month.",
    "Speaking to Ada Derana, the lawmaker said the government intends to increase the total number of \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 beneficiaries, which now stands close to 2 million, to as many as 2.4 million people.",
    "The government expects to spend Rs. 205 billion on the provision of welfare this year, he added.",
    "Meanwhile, the monthly allowances paid to disabled persons, kidney patients and elderly citizens are to be retrospectively increased from January 2024.",

The existing \u2018vulnerable\u2019 and \u2018transitional\u2019 social groups are planned to be amalgamated in the future. Subsequently, a total of 800,000 families will be considered \u2018vulnerable\u2019 and an allowance of Rs. 5,000 will be paid to them. The \u2018transitional\u2019 social group now receives only Rs. 2,500."
