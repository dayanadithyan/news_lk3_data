    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings said it had affirmed its national long-term rating at \u2018BB(lka) on Sri Lanka-based UB Finance PLC (UBF), but revised the outlook to negative from stable, due to a weak financial profile.",
    "\u201cFitch views UBF\u2019s risk appetite as high while its financial profile is weak, characterised by poor asset quality, weak earnings, thin capital buffers and significant deposit concentration,\u201d the rating agency said.",
    "UBF has a small franchise, with market share of less than 1% by assets as of end-2023.",
    "UBF\u2019s rating is sensitive to changes in UB\u2019s credit profile, Fitch said, adding \u201cWe are likely to revise the Outlook to Stable if the parent bank\u2019s Outlook is revised to Stable.\u201d",
    "Fitch Revises UB Finance\u2019s Outlook to Negative; Affirms Rating at\u2019BB(lka)\u2019",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 09 Sep 2024: Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlook on Sri Lanka-based UB Finance PLC (UBF) to Negative from Stable and affirmed its National Long-Term Rating at \u2018BB(lka)\u2019.",
    "Outlook Revision Driven by Parent: The revision in UBF \u2018s Outlook stems from similar action on its parent, Union Bank of Colombo PLC (UB; BBB-(lka)/Negative), on 29 August 2024. For details, see our commentary, Fitch Revises Outlook on Union Bank to Negative; Affirms National Rating at \u2018BBB-(lka)\u2019.",
    "Shareholder Support Drives Rating: The rating continues to factor in our expectation of shareholder support for UBF, as UB remains the largest shareholder (89.9%), UB\u2019s record of support, including a capital infusion in June 2024, UB\u2019s involvement in UBF \u2018s strategic decisions through board representation, as well as common branding.",
    "Limited Importance to Group: We rate UBF two notches below its parent\u2019s rating given its limited importance to the UB group. UBF\u2019s main products, leasing and gold lending, accounted for 5.4% of the group\u2019s gross loans while UBF\u2019s entire loan portfolio was just 10% of group gross loans at end-June 2024. Furthermore, synergies are limited between the bank and UBF, given minimal overlap between UB\u2019s and UBF\u2019s target customer profiles.",
    "UBF\u2019s weak and inconsistent profitability record also limits its importance to the group.",
    "Materially Weak Standalone Profile: We believe UBF\u2019s intrinsic financial strength is weaker than its support-driven rating. UBF has a small franchise, with market share of less than 1% by assets as of end-2023. Fitch views UBF\u2019s risk appetite as high while its financial profile is weak, characterised by poor asset quality, weak earnings, thin capital buffers and significant deposit concentration.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "UBF\u2019s rating is sensitive to changes in UB\u2019s credit profile, as reflected in UB\u2019s National LongTerm Rating as well as Fitch\u2019s opinion of UB\u2019s ability and propensity to extend timely extraordinary support. These could include:",
    "\u2013 a material increase in UBF\u2019s size relative to the parent that makes extraordinary support more onerous for the parent;",
    "\u2013 a meaningful reduction in the parent\u2019s ownership, control or influence that could weaken its propensity to support UBF;",
    "\u2013 prolonged weak performance of UBF that we believe will weaken the parent\u2019s propensity to support the subsidiary;",
    "\u2013 a notable decline in UBF\u2019s capital buffers, indicating reduced timeliness in financial support for growth or to meet regulatory norms;",
    "\u2013 insufficient or delayed support from UB relative to UBF\u2019s needs, which hinders UBF\u2019s ability to meet its obligations in a timely manner.",
    "These developments could significantly reduce shareholder support prospects and, if severe, may lead to a multi-notch downgrade.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "There is limited scope for upward rating action, given the Negative Outlook. We are likely to revise the Outlook to Stable if the parent bank\u2019s Outlook is revised to Stable.",
    "An upgrade would most likely result from a positive rating action on UB\u2019s National Long Term Rating, which would reflect its strengthened ability to support UBF.",
    "A significant increase in UBF\u2019s strategic importance to UB and closer integration with UB across broader functional areas may lead to positive rating action. However, we do not expect such a change in the near term.",
