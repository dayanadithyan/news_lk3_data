    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Former President and leader of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Mahinda Rajapaksa has seemingly upped the ante on his anti-privatisation rhetoric, claiming that a majority of his party are opposed to the \u201csale of national assets\u201d, even as ministers representing the party continue to defend ongoing reforms.",
    "Rajapaksa told reporters on Thursday May 16 following a meeting at the SLPP headquarters in Colombo that 99 percent of the party share his views on the matter.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s not just me, the majority of our party, 99 percent, are of this view,\u201d he said, asked for comment on a recent statement he made declaring his opposition to Sri Lanka\u2019s ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed efforts to restructure a number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).",
    "Meanwhile, at a protest in Colombo against proposed new electricity act saw trade union leaders refer to Power & Energy Minister and prominent SLPP member Kanchana Wijesekara as \u2018Kanchana Wickremesinghe\u2019, indicating that the protestors thought of the minister as being fully on board the president\u2019s reform agenda.",
    "On Wednesday, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe, also of the SLPP, said Sri Lanka\u2019s economy would take another 15 years to recover if the government were to deviate from its ongoing policy trajectory, which includes what the SLPP euphemistically refers to as a \u201csale of national assets\u201d.",
    "Former president Rajapaksa said that the SLPP is in the government, the party reserves the right to freely express its views.",
    "\u201cOur independence has not been compromised just because we\u2019re in the government. We are prepared to express our views at any time,\u201d he said.",
    "Asked if the SLPP was prepared to walk out if the Wickremesinghe administration continued to implement policies the party disapproved of, Rajapaksa said: \u201cWe\u2019re ready for anything for the country.\u201d",
    "Commenting on elections, he said the SLPP is ready for either a presidential election or a parliamentary one.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re ready for anything. If it\u2019s a presidential election, we\u2019re ready for that; if it is a parliamentary election, we\u2019re ready for that too. This is not an issue for us.\u201d",
    "Asked to comment on a remark by President Wickremesinghe that calls from some quarters for a parliamentary election first are an attempt to disrupt the stock market for personal gain, Rajapaksa said: \u201cWhat nonsense? We don\u2019t accept that.\u201d"
