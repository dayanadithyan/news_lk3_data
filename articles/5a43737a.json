    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Employees of the State Pensions Department ask questions not within their remit, and make the rules up as they go, a government legislator has said.",
    "\u201cIn some instances, the Department of Pensions asks questions that they do not have the legal right to ask, and therefore people do not get their pensions,\u201d Chairman of the Sectoral Monitoring Committee for an Open and Responsible Government and Member of Parliament, Jagath Kumara Sumitraarachchi, said at a press briefing on Friday (16).",
    "Sumitraarachchi alleged that certain employees of the department take the law into their own hands adding that there have been instances where government employees make up laws and slash pensions.",
    "\u201cIn one instance, there was a husband and a wife who had not lived together, so the department had given a letter saying a pension could not be approved.\u201d",
    "\u201cPublic officials must not operate based on personal preferences,\u201d Sumitraarachchi criticized the unethical professional conduct.",
    "While many government officials diligently serve the public, he said, there were instances where certain individuals lack effectiveness and accountability in their roles.",
    "To enhance performance, diversity and transparency must be fostered within the public service, Sumitraarachchi said.",
    "To address this concern, \u201cwe\u2019ve organized a special workshop scheduled for the 19th, targeting officials engaged with the public, to equip them with the essential skills for delivering efficient and empathetic service to the people.\u201d (Colombo/Feb19/2024)"
