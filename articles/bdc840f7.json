    "The\u00a0 Advocata Institute held a\u00a0 press briefing titled \u201cUnlocking Economic Potential: Why Debt Restructuring Alone Won\u2019t Suffice Without SOE Reforms\u201d on the 17th of July,2024\u00a0 at the BMICH.",
    "The event brought together key speakers Shihar Aneez (Senior Financial Journalist), Rehana Thowfeek (Research Consultant to Advocata Institute), and Dhananath Fernando (CEO of Advocata Institute) to address the critical need for transparency and reforms in Sri Lanka\u2019s State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).",
    "The speakers collectively warned that without continued SOE reforms, Sri Lanka risks perpetuating its economic challenges and will likely need to return to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) repeatedly. They urged that the government should not be involved in business operations and highlighted the potential misuse of SOEs for electoral purposes if reforms are delayed due to upcoming elections.\u00a0\u201cIf SOE reforms are not continued, Sri Lanka will have to go back to the IMF over and over. Government should not be doing business, \u201cthey said.",
    "\u201cWe are in a vicious cycle where the government has absorbed loans in order to witness profits in SOEs without addressing the need to reconstruct the current SOE-based model itself,\u201d they said.",
