    "UNP\u2019s Ravi Karunanayake criticises party General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara\u2019s proposal to postpone elections, revealing a split within UNP regarding election timing",
    "Ruling party firmly rejects the idea of postponing elections, emphasising the importance of democratic principles and the people\u2019s right to vote",
    "Opposition parties, including SJB and NPP vehemently oppose Range Bandara\u2019s proposal, asserting their commitment to safeguarding democracy and electoral process",
    "Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardena confirms President has instructed allocation of necessary funds to conduct elections, reaffirming commitment to holding elections as scheduled",
    "United National Party (UNP) Colombo District organiser Ravi Karunanayake yesterday criticised party General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara\u2019s proposal to postpone both Parliamentary and presidential polls for two years, highlighting a significant division within the UNP regarding the timing of the elections.",
    "Speaking at a press conference, Ravi Karunanayake asserted that President Ranil Wickremesinghe is a leader who upholds democratic principles, despite the differing statements made by others.",
    "\u201cHis political journey is one where democracy is protected and upheld through the people\u2019s mandate,\u201d Karunanayake said.",
    "The UNP stalwart\u2019s comments followed a press conference earlier in the day where Range Bandara suggested bringing a proposal to Parliament to postpone both Parliamentary and Presidential elections. Bandara also mentioned that a referendum could be held to gain public approval for the proposal. However, Range Bandara\u2019s proposal drew criticism from all quarters, including his own political party, the Government and the opposition.",
    "Karunanayake acknowledged the varying views on the subject and urged individuals to avoid making a mockery of the situation. \u201cInstead, we must work to protect the trust of the people. An election will definitely be held. Ranil Wickremesinghe will be our candidate, and he will emerge victorious to set this country on the correct path,\u201d he asserted.",
    "\u201cWhile others may express various opinions, Wickremesinghe\u2019s approach prioritises maintaining the trust of the people and not taking any other path,\u201d he emphasised.",
    "However Range Bandara justified his proposal by highlighting President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s successes in garnering support from the international community, addressing economic challenges faced by the people, implementing relief measures, streamlining administration, and improving education in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cTherefore, this is not the time for a Parliamentary or Presidential election. It is appropriate for everyone in Parliament, especially opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, to bring forward this proposal. We believe Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his group should also endorse this initiative. If they cannot commit to a full five-year term, they should at least consider extending the President\u2019s tenure by another two years. Additionally, we propose extending the Parliament\u2019s tenure by two years,\u201d he said. He urged both Government and opposition MPs to come together to ensure the passing of this proposal.",
    "He maintained this was not an attempt to curtail the people\u2019s right to vote or democracy in Sri Lanka.",
    "Taking to X (formerly Twitter) to respond to Range Bandara\u2019s statement, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) National organiser Namal Rajapaksa said postponing elections is not healthy for a democracy.",
    "\u201cExtending the terms of the President and Parliament undermines the fundamental principles of a democratic society. Stability should come through the will of the people, not by delaying their voice,\u201d he said.",
    "SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariywasam expressed similar sentiments and said the SLPP has never been accused of violating the people\u2019s democratic rights. \u201cWe will never agree to support the postponement of any scheduled election,\u201d he said.",
    "According to Kariyawasam, the SLPP strongly believes that elections should proceed as scheduled, allowing people to vote for their preferred leaders.",
    "Speaking for the opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) National Organiser Tissa Attanayake also slammed the proposal and said the SJB rejects it outright.",
    "\u201cWe cannot allow anyone to take away the people\u2019s right to vote. It is clear the UNP has already accepted they will be defeated at the upcoming polls. The constitution does not allow for the postponement of polls either. We will join hands with other parties to defeat any move to delay elections,\u201d he said.",
    "National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Executive Council member Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa remarked that Range Bandara, through his comments, has essentially acknowledged that the UNP anticipates defeat in upcoming elections. \u201cThe people of this country have not given Range Bandara any right to conspire in this manner,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A. Sumanthiran condemned Range Bandara\u2019s statement, asserting that the opposition will not permit such a proposal to materialise. He said it was a blatant attempt by the President to extend his tenure. \u201cThe people will not allow anyone to violate the country\u2019s democracy,\u201d he said.",
    "Cabinet Spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena in response to questions posed by the media said the President had given instructions last week to provide the necessary funds to hold the elections. \u201cLast week he informed the Cabinet that elections will go ahead as scheduled and stipulated by the constitution,\u201d he said."
