    "Parliament, May 14 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that the Uma Oya multipurpose development project was granted to Sri Lanka by the Iranian government because of the huge recognition for former president Mahinda Rajapaksa those days, Parliamentarian Rauf Hakeem said today the current government is looking to take the credit for it.",
    "He told Parliament that the Iranian President came to Sri Lanka on the invitation of the Foreign Minister.",
    "\u201cThe Uma Oya project was initiated during former President Mahinda Rajapaksa government. He enjoyed huge recognition by the Iranian government those days. That is why the project was granted to Sri Lanka. You are trying to score now,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya was bragging recently during a debate in Parliament about the achievement of the President claiming that Sri Lanka got the Iranian President to visit here and Sri Lanka was able to send a naval force to the Red Sea.",
    "\u201cThe State Minister of Foreign Affairs was bragging about the achievement of the President two days ago during the parliamentary debate. He was saying Sri Lanka has balanced the Israelis and the Palestinians. We got the Iranian President to come here and we also sent our naval force to the Red Sea. What a shame! You claimed the other day that this is one of the biggest achievements in our foreign policy. What is your President doing? He is rocking the cradle and pinching the baby. We have become virtual slaves to the US,\u201d Hakeem said.",
    "State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya said he regrets the attitude of MP Hakeem and that Hakeem was extremely jealous of the foreign policy that Sri Lanka has taken and links that all the countries maintain with the President."
