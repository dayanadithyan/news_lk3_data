  "original_body_lines": [
    "Current media coverage in Sri Lanka is heavily focused on the forthcoming Presidential elections. Though officially not announced yet, it seems a foregone conclusion that the presidential poll would take place later this year. Several potential candidates ranging from incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe to   media magnate Dilith Jayaweera are tipped to be in the presidential fray.",
    "Adding to this fluid state of affairs are recent attempts  by vested interests to field a \u201cHindu\u201d as a common presidential candidate in the 2024 election. Even as people were becoming aware of efforts by interested parties to nominate a  Hindu  presidential candidate, the head of a  Hindu organization in Northern Sri Lanka issued a public statement calling for a common  candidate to contest the forthcoming presidential poll on behalf of all Hindus in the Island.  Furthermore Hindus were asked to vote for Mano Ganesan MP as the presidential candidate.",
    "Kanapathipillai Sachithananthan the founder- leader of the \u201cSiva Senai\u201d (Army of Siva) movement in Sri Lanka issued a statement that was published in the   Tamil newspaper \u201cEelanaadu\u201d of 5 April 2024. Sachithanathdan is known as \u201cMaravanpulavu\u201d Sachithananthan  and \u201cMaravanpulavu Sachi\u201d on account of his native village in Jaffna \u2013Maravanpulavu in the Thenmaratchy division of the peninsula.An Indian magazine once referred to Sachithananthan as a \u201cHindutvavaadhi\u201d(Votary of Hindutva).",
    "Sachithananthan in his statement said that the Hindu religion in Sri Lanka was under grave threat. He alleged that extremists belonging to the Buddhist, Christian and Islamic religions  were attempting  through various means to reduce the number  of Hindus in Sri Lanka. Compared to these three religions, Hindus had little political power in the country,he said.",
    "The \u201cSiva Senai\u201dleader pointed out in his statement that three  big elections were expected in due course in Sri Lanka. He called upon the Hindus to voice their support  strongly for candidates with deep-rooted Hindu backgrounds in these elections",
    "Sachithananthan also stated that if a common Hindu candidate contested the presidential election, 20 Lakhs of Hindus living in the North, East, West, South and Central parts of Sri Lanka would vote for that person. The Siva Senai leader called upon Hindus to nominate Mano Ganesan as the common Hindu candidate and vote for him at the Presidential poll.",
    "As is well known,  Colombo district Parliamentarian , Mano Ganesan is the leader of the Tamil Progressive Alliance(TPA) .  The TPA formed in 2015  obtained six MP seats at both the 2015 and 2020 Parliamentary polls. The TPA is therefore the largest political configuration representing the Hill Country Tamils (Malaiyagath Thamizhar) of Sri Lanka.. Against that backdrop it seemed highly improbable that Mano Ganesan would opt to be the common Hindu Presidential candidate.",
    "This writer contacted Mano Ganesan over this matter and found that the TPA leader was unwilling to be the envisaged Hindu presidential candidate. Referring to Sachithananthan\u2019s statement, Mano Ganesan observed \u201dThat is only his (Sachithananthan) view\u201d. Mano Ganesan also quipped that he was not even a Hindu because he was an atheist.",
    "Though Mano Ganesan will not be the Hindu presidential candidate the efforts of \u201cHindutva\u201d supporters like the Siva Senai leader  are not likely to cease soon. Their attempts will persist. Given the current situation where ancient sites of Saivaite worship are being culturally appropriated and Buddhist Vihares are being constructed in 100% Hindu areas, there is rising Hindu resentment. As such mobilising Hindus to vote for a Hindu presidential candidate appears to be  possible.",
    "Among potential Hindu contenders for the presidency is  the Hindu Yogi Velan Swamigal the head of the  religious institution \u201cSivaguru Aatheenam\u201din Nallur Jaffna. Velan Swamigal is a Katubedde educated Engineer who turned spiritual and donned Saffron.  After a stint with the Swamy Chinmaya mission,Velan Swamy  set up the Sivaguru Aatheenam on his own.",
    "Velan Swamy has participated in several political protest demonstrations and has even been arrested and released on bail. He is therefore a \u201cpolitical Swamy\u201d and is very likely to be the Hindu presidential candidate. Besides he is said to have the backing of \u201cHindutva\u201d elements in India. Hindutva types have been infiltrating the Hindus of Sri Lanka in recent times. It must be understood that being a Hindu and being a \u201cHindutva\u201d  adherent are not the same though some tend to mix up  both  through ignorance or for their own benefit.",
    "According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics and International Relations, \u201cHindutva\u201d meaning \u201cHinduness\u201d refers to the ideology of Hindu nationalists, stressing the common culture of the inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent.",
    "The Dictionary of Human Geography, says \u201cHindutva encapsulates the cultural justification of Hindu nationalism, a \u201cHinduness\u201d allegedly shared by all Hindus.",
    "A Political and Economic Dictionary of South Asia notes \u201cOne of the main purposes behind the concept of Hindutva was to construct a collective identity to support the cause of \u2018Hindu-unity\u201d.",
    "\u201cHindutva\u201dis the core ideology of India\u2019s  Rashtriya   Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in particular and the \u201cSangh Parivar\u201d (Sangh family) in general. The Sangh Parivar is an umbrella of Hindutva groups led by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing  organisation based in India, It was founded in 1925. RSS is at the center of the Sangh, which sets the priorities and tactics for promoting Hindu nationalist ideals and goals to consolidate the Hindu society and achieve their goal of a \u201cHindu Rashtra\u201d( Hindu nation)",
    "The Sangh Parivar includes RSS affiliates like Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Bajrang Dal, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and a host of other entities. Some of them are small organizations,cults or political parties.",
    "The  RSS has around  600,000  activist members and over 57,000 branches or sakhas, including a trade union wing (Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh), women\u2019s wing (Rashtriya Sevika Samiti), student wing (Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad), and economic wing (Swadeshi Jagaran Manch).The Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) may be in the seat of power as the ruling party in New Delhi but it is directed and supervised by the RSS.  It is estimated that 75% of the ministers in the ruling BJP Govt  are members of the RSS, including the  Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.",
    "A matter of rising concern is the creeping \u201cHindutvaization\u201d of Hinduism in Sri Lanka.Sri Lankan Tamil society is pre-dominantly Hindu.  Jaffna Tamil Hindus are mainly Saivaite. Though staunchly Saivaite, Tamil Hindu society  has been basically tolerant and accommodative. Moreover political problems in Sri Lanka has made Tamils view themselves as Tamils and not as Hindus or Christians. They were victimised not because they were Hindus or Christians but due to the fact that they were Tamils.",
    "It should be noted that the anti-colonialist nationalist revivals of the Sinhala and Tamil people had certain similarities and differences. A moot point was that of religion. Revivalism initiated by Anagarika Dharmapala and Arumuga Navalar was religion oriented and revolved around the Buddhist and Hindu religions respectively.",
    "The continuation of this revivalist process in the post Independence period however saw a major difference.Sinhala political discourse continued in the same vein with Sinhala Buddhist nationalism becoming the dominant ideology among the Sinhala people.",
    "In the case of the Tamil people who saw themselves as the victims of Sinhala Buddhist nationalism the reaction was different. Their response was basically linguistic and not religious. When Tamil nationalism arose in defiance of Sinhala nationalism it became more secular. It was not a Tamil Hindu nationalism.",
    "There are many reasons for this but two significant causes contributing to this were the political leader SJV Chelvanayakam and Rev Fr Thaninayakam the Tamil Catholic Scholar. Father Thaninayakam spearheaded a Tamil cultural revival by promoting a world wide interest in Tamil studies. This made  Tamils  proud of their glorious heritage.",
    "Chelvanayakam led the Tamil political movement against the imposition of Sinhala. His presence as the great helmsman of the Tamil ship saw him charter a course of secular Tamil nationalism centered around language. The assertion of linguistic nationalism was successful enough not only to embrace Tamil Hindus and Christians but also include the Muslims too at a particular period under the concept of \u201cTamil Speaking People \u201d. This however  did not work out because  the  Tamil speaking Muslims in Sri Lanka have opted for an ethno-religious identity as opposed to an ethno-linguistic identity.",
    "Hindu-Christian unity under a common Tamil identity however has prevailed. Even the Tamil militant organizations including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) were essentially secular. However this unity has come under some strain in the post-war years. There are three main reasons for this.",
    "The first is the irritation and concern caused by the activities of  evangelical churches. While the older established mainstream Churches have reached a stable \u201cLive and let live\u201d understanding with  the Hindus in Tamil areas and do not attempt  to convert Hindus to Christianity, the new Evangelical Churches and groups engage in  intensive proselytization. Many of these \u201cNew\u201dChristians do not merely tread on, but trample \u201chindu\u201dtoes with the fanatical zeal and fervour of the converted. This is a major irritant affecting Hindu-Christian relations in many Tamil areas.",
    "The second is the rise of pro \u2013 hindu politicians and media institutions.  There are quite a number of Christians both Catholic and Protestant involved in Tamil politics. These include past and present MPs as well as former Provincial council members and ex -Local authority representatives. What is happening now are covert and overt attempts by some Hindu politicians to derive political mileage by raising the religious cry against potential Christian  political rivals. Since the majority of Tamil voters are hindu, such  anti-Christian sentiments are expected to succeed.",
    "Moreover the secular nature of Tamil politics too has begun eroding. There was a time when only the \u201cThamil Thaai Vaazthu\u201d(Praising  the Tamil Mother) was observed at the commencement of Tamil political meetings. Nowadays this is not always   followed and some events begin with Hindu religious  observances.",
    "A leader of a political party attends political meetings with \u201cViboodhi\u201d(holy ash)daubed on his forehead and begins his talk by chanting Sanskrit verses.. There is nothing wrong in wearing Holy ash or  chanting  Sanskrit Manthras but what  must be noted here is that these practices were not followed at political meetings in the past.",
    "What is more of a concern is the blatant anti-christian sentiments being displayed openly. A former Tamil Parliamentarian who dresses frequently in Saffron  like the BJP Chief minister of Uttar Pradesh ,Yogi Adityanath, is viciously anti-Christian in some of his pronouncements  to all-Hindu audiences. He also adopts the disgusting habit of spitting out loudly  (Kaarith Thuppu)when he sees a Christian priest in Cassock. Another Tamil newspaper has in recent times been propagating the viewpoint that Tamil Hindus should protest against injustices as Hindus and not as Tamils.",
    "The third reason for waning Hindu-Christian unity is the  RSS -BJP factor. The end of the war in 2009 and the advent of the Narendra Modi-led BJP Govt in 2014 has led to a situation where a large number of ultra-right Hindu activists visit the Tamil majority areas of Sri Lanka especially the North. These people belong to various  small organizations and political parties of the Sangh Parivar. These frequent visits and interaction with Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus have contributed greatly towards deteriorating Hindu-Christian relations in the North.",
    "Among these  frequent Sangh Parivar visitors is the infamous founder leader of the Hindu Makkal Katchi(Hindu peoples Party) of Tamil Nadu Arjun Sampath. This well-known Muslim hater and Christian baiter is a native of Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu and was once detained in  prison for anti_Muslim violence and for assaulting a Hindu legislator visiting Muslim victims in Hospital. Without realising the implications, President Wickremesinghe\u2019s chief of staff Sagala Ratnayake met with Arjun Sampath once. Sampath used the pix to show off that he was very influential with the Colombo Govt.",
    "Another aspect of the BJP-RSS impact  in Sri Lankan Tamil politics is the bogus propaganda about a \u201cHindu Tamil Eelam\u201d. The dream of a separate Tamil state for the Tamils has ended with the defeat of the LTTE. However there has been a tendency recently  to spread a false news  that New Delhi was amenable to the creation of  a  Tamil state if it was  a Hindu nation state. The original  Tamil Eelam demand was for a Secular  state. But now it is being said that the RSS-BJP govt would help establish a \u201cHindu Tamil Eelam\u201d,only.",
    "No responsible person in India has ever mentioned a Hindu Eelam ,  but many low-level operatives of the Sangh Parivar and  several deluded vocal warriors of the Tamil Diaspora  subscribe to the \u201cHindu Tamil Eelam\u201d project. These include Sri Lankan Tamil nationalist poet Kathamuthu Sivanandan alias \u201cKasi Anandan\u201d who has been resident in Chennai for over three decades.   The term \u201cHindu Tamil Eelam\u201dby definition excludes Christians and could be a source of Hindu-Christian friction.",
    "People like  the Siva Senai leader Sachithananthan are among those who exploit this Hindu-Christian divide and widen the chasm further. Sachithananthan once referred to TNA Wanni district MP nd TELO leader Selvam Adaikkalanathan as a \u201cSoathuk Katholikkan\u201d( rice Catholic). Some call Christians  rice Christians  derogatorily  on the basis that their ancestors  embraced Christianity for a \u201cplate of rice\u201d",
    "On another occasion , Sachithananthan expressed opposition to the composition of a delegation representing the Tamil national Alliance(TNA) at a meeting with a visiting foreign dignitary. The five-member TNA delegation comprised R. Sampanthan, Maavai\u201dSenathirajah,  Selvam Adaikkalanathan, D. Siddharthan and MA Sumanthiran",
    "The Siva Senai  leader objected to the composition  in a statement. Sachithananth an said that 84 % of the Tamils in Sri Lanka were Hindus. Yet the TNA Delegation had only 60% Hindus. Satchi objected to 16 % Christians being given 40% of the representation. What he was alluding to was that  of Adaikkalanathan being a Catho;ic and Sumanthiran, a Protestant Christian",
    "Sachithananthan and his Siva Senai often claim credit for stopping Christian revival meetings  being conducted in Jaffna and Batticaloa.. The tactic employed is simple but crudely effectve.  Leaflets  vehemently protesting against  such meetings  are published and distributed. Veiled threats are issued. Then these leaflets are taken to the Police. A case is made out that there may be a breach of peace if the Christian meetings are held. The Police is \u201cpersuaded\u201d  to withdraw permission for the meetings at short notice.So meetings are cancelled.",
    "Another of Siva Senai\u2019s antics is to protest against the appointment of Tamil Christians to high Government posts in Jaffna. It is argued that pre-dominantly \u201cHindu\u201dJaffna should have only Hindus in high Govt positions. The Siva Senai has won some and lost some of these campaigns. Yet  Sachi and his Senai do not protest against Sinhala Buddhists being appointed to top Govt posts in Jaffna.",
    "Siva Senai leader Sachithananthan  and those of his ilk  are seemingly successful in the short term in their anti-Christian action. But in the long term their actions are succeeding in weakening Tamil nationalism by driving the Hindu-Christian wedge in between. In that sense Sachithananthan is accomplishing what the historic enemies of Tamil nationalism have been unable to do in the past- Divide Tamils!. The sad irony in this is that Sachi himself was nurtured in the nursery of Tamil nationalism and regards himself as Tamil nationalist still.",
    "Who is this self-styled saviour of Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus? Kanapathipillai Sachithananthan known as \u201cMaravanpulvuSachi\u201d or \u201cMaravanpulavu Sachithananthan\u201d was born in 1941 and educated at Jaffna Hindu College. Satchi obtained a Bachelors degree in Zoology and a Masters degree in Marine Biology from Madras University.",
    "He worked in Colombo as a researcher at the Fisheries Department for several years. After being a victim of racist violence in 1977, he relocated to Jaffna and served as a lecturer at the University of Jaffna. During this time he got elected to the Central Committee of the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK)  then a component of the  Tamil United Liberation Front(TULF).  Sachi had been an ardent political disciple of Christian Tamil leader SJV Chelvanayakam from his student days.",
    "In 1979 Sachithananthan obtained a Consultant/adviser post at the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and worked in 23 countries for many years. After his FAO stint Sachithananthan took up residence in the Tamil Nadu capital of Chennai where he established a publishing enterprise called \u201cKaanthalagham\u201d. He also engaged in electronic commerce selling books through the website known as \u201cThamilNool\u201d. While in India he was arrested and detained for several months for allegedly aiding the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) by supplying medicine.",
    "Sachi moved to Sri Lanka after the war ended in 2009 and set up \u201cKaanthalagham\u201d in Jaffna. He also aspired to be the chief minister of the Northern Province. After C. V. Wigneswaran was made chief minister.It was then that Sachithananthan got estranged from the ITAK.  It is believed that he one-time Tamil nationalist turned into a Hindu chauvinist after this. Incidentally there are many who opine that Sachithananthan would have made a far better Chief minister than Wigneswaran.",
    "Sachithananthan formed an organisation called the \u201cSiva Senai\u201d (Sivas army) in 2016. It was modelled on the \u201cShiv Sena\u201d (Sivaji\u2019s army) founded in Maharashtra State by cartoonist Bal Thackeray. Incidentally, Thackeray started the Shiv Sena to drive out Tamils, Malayalees and Telugus from Bombay now known as Mumbai. This did not deter Sachi.",
    "The Siva Senai staged demonstrations against cattle slaughter and selling of beef in the North. It also issued leaflets and pamphlets under counterfeit titles (to avoid being prosecuted) against Christians and Muslims. The call was for Hindus to boycott Muslim businesses and to refrain from voting for Christian candidates. There was also a call for the expulsion of Muslims and Christians from Jaffna described as \u201cSiva Bhoomi\u201d (Lord Shiva\u2019s earth).",
    "At the 2020 Parliamentary elections, Sachithananthan floated a party called the \u201cSaivath Thamizh Thesiyak Katchi\u201d (Saivaite Tamil nationalist party) and contested in the Wanni District as an independent group. The group targeted Hindu votes by attacking Christians and Muslims. The group was trounced at the hustings.",
    "It appears now that the never say die \u201cMaravanpulavu\u201d Sachithanathdan is embarking on another political mission of a religious dimension by mooting and promoting the idea of a common Hindu presidential candidate. If he is successful in finding a Hindu candidate on time, it would add colour and spice to the  much anticipated 2024  Presidential election. The advent of a Common Hindu Presidential Candidate  will however further weaken Lankan Tamil Nationalism(ENDS)",
