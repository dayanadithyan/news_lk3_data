    "Addressing the United National Party\u2019s (UNP) May Day rally held in Colombo, Wickremesinghe revealed that he will table in the parliament a law which is inclusive of the agreements that the government has reached with the IMF. Thus, he requested all the parties to support in passing the law in order to continue to safeguard the current stable situation that the country has acquired.",
    "\u201cI will table in the parliament a law which is inclusive of the agreements we\u2019ve reached with the IMF. I request everyone to support me in that\u201d, the President said.",
    "Furthermore, the Head of the State mentioned that his request is not only to safeguard the stability that the country has acquired, but also to transform the country\u2019s economy into an export-oriented economy.",
    "Commenting further Wickremesinghe said: \u201cWe should modernize the economy of the villages in order to eliminate poverty. We have already commenced that programme.\u00a0 I will create a strong export-oriented economy and bring forward a proper method of creating a better future for the youth of this country.\u201d",
    "\u201cSo I request the SJB and the JVP not to remain in the traditional politics but to join hands to safeguard the economy and to create a better future for the youth of this country\u201d, he added.",

    "\u201cAt one point the Opposition Leader was attacked in the Galle Face Green and chased away [during a rally]. Today, we have given him the space at Chatham Street. Isn\u2019t this democracy?\u201d he inquired.",
    "Meanwhile, President Wickremesinghe expressed his gratitude to every political party which supported in strengthening the country\u2019s economy.",
    "\u201cI express my gratitude to each and every party who supported me in building up the country to this state again. Members from the SLPP, a group from the SLFP [Sri Lanka Freedom Party], Douglas Devananda, the CWC and several others joined hands with me\u201d, the President said.",
    "\u201cWe reached this point in a harder way. Now we have to decide whether to continue this situation or to go back to the 2022.\u201d",
    "\u201cI invite the other parties, the SJB, the JVP not to oppose this, but to reach an agreement with the government to safeguard this situation for the people.\u201d"
