    "The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ), led by former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in a statement has reminded the Election Comission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) of its duty to call for timely elections.",
    "\u201cAs per the powers granted by the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the Election Commission is required to hold the Presidential election in 2024. An official announcement for the election must be issued as soon as the ECSL is empowered to call for elections to ensure a fair process,\u201d Jayasuriya said yesterday.",
    "Jayasuriya said the request is being made as Sri Lanka approaches the time to elect a President, noting that contradictory statements and unethical proposals are being disseminated in society.",
    "\u201cDue to such conflicting opinions and unnecessary debates, the country\u2019s economy may face challenges. Different attitudes arising between international commercial and financial institutions could create conditions harmful to the country\u2019s well-being,\u201d he said.",
    "He added that the unnecessary debates in Parliament, as well as actions taken by certain individuals through various petitions before the Supreme Court, are creating unrest in society.",
    "\u201cWe strongly believe that the immediate implementation of the responsibilities and functions assigned to the Election Commission within its constitutional powers is essential, considering the potential impact of such an environment on society in general.\u201d he said."
