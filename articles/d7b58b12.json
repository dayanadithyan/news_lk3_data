    "The Supreme Court has heard the petition challenging the decisions and recommendations made against the current President\u2019s Secretary Saman Ekanayake by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) appointed by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to investigate alleged incidents of political victimisation.",
    "A group of individuals including the then-Prime Minister\u2019s Secretary and current Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake had filed the petition requesting to invalidate the decisions and recommendations made against him by the PCoI headed by retired Supreme Court Judge Upali Abeyratne.",
    "The petition was taken up for hearing before a three-member Supreme Court judge bench comprising Vijith Malalgoda, Achala Vengappuli and Arjuna Obeysekara, Ada Derana reporter said.",
    "Appearing for Saman Ekanayake, President\u2019s Counsel Upul Kumarapperuma stated before the courts that the commission had accused his client of illegally utilizing state funds to the tune of Rs. 33 million for the \u201cAnti-Corruption Committee Secretariat\u201d, which the PCoI referred to as a non-governmental organization that had not been established by law.",
    "He pointed out that accordingly, the relevant commission had recommended that Ekanayake\u2019s civil rights be revoked and criminal charges be filed against him over misappropriation of government funds.",
    "Furthermore, the President\u2019s Counsel mentioned that the Anti-corruption Committee Secretariat in question is not a non-governmental organization, but an institution which was legally established under the Cabinet approval, and stated that Ekanayake has performed his tasks as the Prime Minister\u2019s Secretary in full compliance with the law.",
    "Later, the Supreme Court has adjourned the hearing of the petition, according to Ada Derana reporter."
