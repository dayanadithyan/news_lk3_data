    "Significant growth in Wood Coatings of 15% and Paint Brushes of 47%",
    "JAT Holdings PLC \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s market leader in wood coatings, paint brushes, and rollers \u2013 recently released its financials for Q1 of FY 2025, noting strong growth in both its top- and bottom-line. Accordingly, Revenues rose by 3% to Rs. 2.2 billion compared with the same period in the previous year, driven by noticeable growth in the wood coatings and paint brushes categories. Profit After Tax (PAT) also demonstrated significant growth, expanding by 77% YoY for the quarter under review to record Rs. 124 million, up from Rs. 70 million in the same quarter of the previous year.",
    "These achievements were driven by steady and growing sales, supported by efficiencies arising from JAT\u2019s acrylic binder and alkyd resin plants coming online earlier in 2024. The Group expects these efficiencies to further support growth and profitability in the coming quarters, with it now producing binders for wood coatings and wall paint emulsions inhouse. This, together with further strengthening of its R&D, Marketing and Bangladesh operations, is expected to have significant positive outcomes for the Group\u2019s balance sheet and financial performance indicators through FY 2024/25.",
