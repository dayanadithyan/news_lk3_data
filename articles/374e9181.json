Approximately five hundred thousand school children are expected to benefit from fortified rice lunches over an eight-month period,\u201d the statement said.",
    "Speaking at the event, Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and the Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka said nurturing a healthy future generation was essential.

    "The nutrition programme\u2019s roots date back to 2003 with the intervention of the World Food Programme. The ongoing efforts align with President Wickremesinghe\u2019s vision for a poverty-free and healthier Sri Lanka, said Ratnayake.",

    "\u201cOriginating in four districts, the programme broadened its scope to six districts following the tsunami in 2004. Supported by various ministries and organisations, the initiative has evolved to encompass a wider geographical area, reflecting its continued impact and success.",

In response, a stabilisation programme was initiated, spearheaded by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, with a primary focus on addressing poverty,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Feb02/2024)"
