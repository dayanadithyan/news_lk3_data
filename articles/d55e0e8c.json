    "Reaffirming its dedication to gender equality and digital empowerment, Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka\u2019s #1 connectivity provider, renewed its pledge to the\u00a0GSMA\u2019s Connected Women\u00a0\u00a0Commitment Initiative. This commitment underscores Dialog\u2019s dedication to eradicating digital divides and empowering Sri Lankan women through enhanced access to mobile internet and mobile money services.",
    "The initiative is a response to the alarming gender gap in mobile phone ownership and usage in low- and middle-income households, which hinders women\u2019s participation in the digital world. Dialog joined forces with the\u00a0GSMA\u2019s Connected Women Programme in 2018 with an aim to address these barriers, recognizing that empowering women with digital tools not only promotes gender equality but also opens up significant growth avenues for industries.",
    "\u201cDialog Axiata is committed to fostering inclusivity and sustainability in Sri Lanka\u2019s digital landscape,\u201d stated Supun Weerasinghe, Group Chief Executive of Dialog Axiata PLC. \u201cOur renewed commitment to the\u00a0GSMA\u00a0Connected Women Programme is a testament to our belief in the transformative power of connectivity. By empowering women, we not only advance their digital and financial inclusion but also catalyse broader socio-economic benefits, driving progress towards a more equitable society.\u201d",
    "Commenting, Claire Sibthorpe, Head of Digital Inclusion at GSMA said, \u201cThrough the signing of the GSMAConnected Women Commitment, Dialog Axiata is demonstrating their dedication towards building a more inclusive society. Connecting women not only empowers them but also enriches communities, drives economic growth, and paves the way for a more equitable future. We applaud Dialog Axiata for their leadership and commitment to narrowing the gender gap in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
