  "original_body_lines": [
    "Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian won Iran\u2019s runoff presidential election Saturday, besting hard-liner Saeed Jalili by promising to reach out to the West and ease enforcement on the country\u2019s mandatory headscarf law after years of sanctions and protests squeezing the Islamic Republic.",
    "Pezeshkian promised no radical changes to Iran\u2019s Shiite theocracy in his campaign and long has held Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the final arbiter of all matters of state in the country. But even Pezeshkian\u2019s modest aims will be challenged by an Iranian government still largely held by hard-liners, the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, and Western fears over Tehran enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels.",
    "A vote count offered by authorities put Pezeshkian as the winner with 16.3 million votes to Jalili\u2019s 13.5 million in Friday\u2019s election. Overall, Iran\u2019s Interior Ministry said 30 million people voted in an election held without internationally recognized monitors.",
    "Supporters of Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon and longtime lawmaker, entered the streets of Tehran and other cities before dawn to celebrate as his lead grew over Jalili, a hard-line former nuclear negotiator.",
    "\u201cDear people of Iran, the elections are over and this is just the beginning of our cooperation,\u201d Pezeshkian wrote on the social platform X, still banned in Iran. \u201cThe difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, empathy and trust. I extend my hand to you and I swear on my honor that I will not leave you alone on this path. Do not leave me alone.\u201d",
    "Pezeshkian\u2019s win still sees Iran at a delicate moment, with tensions high in the Mideast over the Israel-Hamas war, Iran\u2019s advancing nuclear program, and a looming election in the United States that could put any chance of a detente between Tehran and Washington at risk. Pezeshkian\u2019s victory also wasn\u2019t a rout of Jalili, meaning he\u2019ll have to carefully navigate Iran\u2019s internal politics as the doctor has never held a sensitive, high-level security post.",
    "The first round of voting June 28 saw the lowest turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iranian officials have long pointed to turnout as a sign of support for the country\u2019s Shiite theocracy, which has been under strain after years of sanctions crushing Iran\u2019s economy, mass demonstrations and intense crackdowns on all dissent.",
    "Government officials up to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei predicted a higher participation rate as voting got underway, with state television airing images of modest lines at some polling centers across the country.",
    "However, online videos purported to show some polls empty while a survey of several dozen sites in the capital, Tehran, saw light traffic amid a heavy security presence on the streets.",
    "Authorities put the turnout in Friday\u2019s election at 49.6%, still historically low for an Iranian presidential election. They counted 607,575 voided votes in the contest \u2014 which often are a sign of protest by those who feel obligated to cast a ballot but reject both candidates.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything from him \u2014 I am happy that the vote put the brake on hard-liners,\u201d said bank employee Fatemeh Babaei, who voted for Pezeshkian. \u201cI hope Pezeshkian can return administration to a way in which all people can feel there is a tomorrow.\u201d",
    "Taher Khalili, a Kurdish-origin Iranian who runs a small tailor shop in Tehran, offered another reason to be hopeful while handing out candy to passersby.",
    "\u201cIn the end, someone from my hometown and the west of Iran came to power,\u201d Khalili said. \u201cI hope he will make economy better for small businesses.\u201d",
    "Pezeshkian, who speaks Azeri, Farsi and Kurdish, campaigned on outreach to Iran\u2019s many ethnicities. He represents the first Iranian president from western Iran in decades \u2014 something people hope will aid the county as those in the West are considered more tolerant because of the ethnic and religious diversity in their area.",
    "The election came amid heightened regional tensions. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region \u2014 such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels \u2014 are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.",
    "Iran is also enriching uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build several nuclear weapons, should it choose to do so. And while Khamenei remains the final decision-maker on matters of state, whichever man ends up winning the presidency could bend the country\u2019s foreign policy toward either confrontation or collaboration with the West.",
    "The campaign also repeatedly touched on what would happen if former President Donald Trump, who unilaterally withdrew America from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, won the November election. Iran has held indirect talks with President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, though there\u2019s been no clear movement back toward constraining Tehran\u2019s nuclear program for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
    "Though identifying with reformists and relative moderates within Iran\u2019s theocracy during the campaign, Pezeshkian at the same time honored Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, on one occasion wearing its uniform to parliament. He repeatedly criticized the United States and praised the Guard for shooting down an American drone in 2019, saying it \u201cdelivered a strong punch in the mouth of the Americans and proved to them that our country will not surrender.\u201d",
    "More than 61 million Iranians over the age of 18 were eligible to vote, with about 18 million of them between 18 and 30. Voting was to end at 6 p.m. but was extended until midnight to boost participation.",
    "The late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a May helicopter crash, was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor as supreme leader.",
    "Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab."
