    "Promises to create comprehensive plan to offer crucial support to entrepreneurs and businesses, aiming to drive growth and development",
    "Says NPP\u2019s plan will also involve assisting local entrepreneurs in expanding their businesses internationally",
    "Claims all Governments set up previously in SL have only looked after wellbeing of their own",
    "Urges people to come together to form Govt. that truly cares for its people",
    "National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Presidential Candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake has committed to fostering economic democracy for businesses in Sri Lanka. He announced that the NPP will create a comprehensive plan to offer crucial support to entrepreneurs and businesses, aiming to drive growth and development in their sectors.",
    "Speaking at a rally in Minuwangoda on Tuesday, Dissanayake highlighted that businesses frequently feel pressured to bribe ministers in order to acquire land for their operations. \u201cMinisters perceive accepting bribes as their right, while those offering the bribes believe it is their duty. However, providing land to businesses is a fundamental responsibility of the Government,\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake pledged to develop a plan to allocate land plots to businesses without expecting any compensation or bribes in return. He emphasised that fulfilling this duty should be a straightforward responsibility of the Government.",
    "The NPP Presidential hopeful said the party\u2019s plan will also involve assisting local entrepreneurs in expanding their businesses internationally. He noted that Africa is emerging as a significant market and announced that an NPP-led Government will establish trade ambassador offices in these countries to support this effort.",
    "Dissanayake explained, \u201cWhat services can we offer these countries? We can provide production opportunities for industrialists by identifying marketable products. To achieve wealth, industrialists should establish industries, hoteliers should build hotels, and contractors should seek out contracts. Economic opportunities should be created based on our country\u2019s existing resources.\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake emphasised that supporting industrialists and entrepreneurs boost the economy. \u201cAs they build the economy and generate income, a fair portion of that income is collected as taxes. Growth in the external economy brings more money into the treasury, which can then be invested in education. Education, in turn, develops skilled managers with effective management abilities,\u201d he said. He explained that as these managers develop factories and increase income, this revenue can be invested in education, health, and transportation. \u201cThis cycle of growth and investment can lead to substantial economic improvement, enabling the country to become wealthy over time,\u201d he noted.",
    "Dissanayake noted that as the economy grows, the resulting revenue flows to the Government, which then invests in developing services and providing assistance to those in need. He highlighted that in some European countries, families with disabled children receive support, such as a salary for the mother. Additionally, some countries provide stipends to young people who have completed their education until they secure employment. He emphasised that nations around the world prioritise caring for their people.",
    "\u201cHowever we have established Governments to take care of their own families. It\u2019s time to form, for the first time in Sri Lanka, a Government that truly cares for the people and enriches the country. Let\u2019s make it happen.\u201d he urged."
