    "\u201cI heard the explosion clearly in the western Mazzeh area, and I saw a large cloud of smoke,\u201d one resident told AFP, requesting anonymity over security concerns. \u201cThe sound was similar to a missile explosion, and minutes later I heard the sound of ambulances.\u201d",

    "The strike was a \u201cdesperate attempt to spread instability in region\u201d, said Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani in remarks reported by state media. \u201cIran...reserves its right to respond to the organised terrorism of the fake Zionist regime at the appropriate time and place.\u201d",
