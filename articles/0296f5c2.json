    "A group of asylum seekers on an isolated British island territory have told UN investigators they feel unsafe and forgotten, as they reported sexual assaults and harassment of children, as well as self-harm and suicide attempts.",
    "Inspectors from the UN\u2019s refugee agency visited Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, to check on their welfare.",
    "A draft report says that conditions there amounted to arbitrary detention.",
    "The Foreign Office said the island was not suitable for migrants to live on.",
    "Other than the migrant camp, the island is used as a UK-US military base. Thousands of troops are stationed there, usually on a one-year deployment, along with a smaller number of military contractors. For all allegations of sexual assault and harassment, the alleged perpetrators were other asylum seekers.",
    "Civilian visitors are not allowed - and the island has officially had no resident population since the early 1970s when the UK relocated all the people living there so it could develop the base.",
    "The 61 people currently in the island camp are mostly Sri Lankan Tamils and the first of them landed on Diego Garcia in October 2021 after their boat ran into trouble while trying to sail to Canada, according to migrants and officials.",
    "Their subsequent asylum claims were the first ever to be launched on British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) - an area described as being \u201cconstitutionally distinct and separate from the UK\u201d, and where the UK government argues that the refugee convention does not apply.",
    "In its response to the UN report on the asylum seekers, a Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \u201cBIOT is not a suitable location for migrants, which is why we have been working tirelessly to process the migrants\u2019 claims for protection and to find a suitable third country for those whose claims are upheld.",
    "\u201cAt all times, the welfare and safety of migrants on BIOT has been our top priority.\u201d",
    "UNHCR - the UN Refugee Agency - says the visit by its inspectors in late November marked the first time an \u201cexternal party\u201d had gained access to the island to monitor conditions there since the asylum seekers\u2019 arrival. The draft report it produced following its visit was released to the BBC by the supreme court of BIOT.",
    "During its visit, UNHCR representatives heard several allegations of sexual assault and harassment, with alleged victims including young children. In all instances, the alleged perpetrators were other asylum seekers, the report says.",
    "It adds that there was likely to be an \u201cunder-reporting\u201d of sexual violence because of shame and stigma, and a view among asylum seekers that there would not be an effective response.",
    "\u201cIt was clear from speaking to asylum seekers, both the general population and those who had made allegations, that they did not see anything to be gained by reporting, both in terms of justice and safety, including due to the fact that alleged perpetrators of sexual assault remain living in the camp alongside alleged victims,\u201d the report says.",
    "A decision made last July to designate family tents and single male tents was a \u201cpositive step\u201d but \u201cunlikely to be sufficient as a prevention mechanism\u201d, it notes, adding that there was \u201clittle evidence of other preventive measures\u201d.",
    "In the UN report, the asylum seekers on the island, which is hundreds of miles away from any other population, describe being bitten by rats in a fenced-off camp and say that they are only permitted to leave it under security escort, even if they just want to walk to the beach.",
    "That has led to feelings of despair and incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts, the UN\u2019s draft report - one of the first detailed insights into conditions on the island - says.",
    "The group of asylum seekers, which includes 16 children, said they felt bored, depressed, and hopeless. Some said they felt \u201cforgotten\u201d, while one woman said: \u201cMany of us think about ending our lives.\u201d",
    "Some of the children told the inspectors they had witnessed violence and self-harm, and made multiple references to suicide during the UN visit, the draft report says.",
    "Some of them recalled a time when a security dog came to visit the camp and they watched it through the security fence.",
    "\u201cThe children said that it made them sad that the dog was able to be outside the fence and they were not,\u201d the report says.",
    "The asylum seekers do not have access to the internet and have never met their lawyers in person. Until now, details of the conditions they are being held in have been scarce - recounted mainly in court hearings in the UK.",
    "A process has been established to determine if the group should be sent back to Sri Lanka or to a \u201csafe third country\u201d.",
    "The BBC last year established contact with multiple asylum seekers on the island, who described conditions there as hellish.",
    "UNHCR says it considers that the 61 Tamils on Diego Garcia are \u201csubject to deprivation of liberty\u201d.",
    "\u201cThey reside in a closed place with no possibility to leave at will, which amounts to detention under international law,\u201d it explains.",
    "In its report, the UN agency says the conditions on the island \u201cfail to provide the necessary standards of privacy, safety and dignity\u201d.",
    "The draft report says asylum seekers are held in a fenced area of approximately 100m by 140m, and are barred from leaving unless with a security escort. Most of the children have never left the camp other than infrequent visits to the beach under security escort, the report says.",
    "The children showed UN representatives pictures they had drawn depicting the wired fence surrounding the camp and said their lives generally consisted of eating meals with their families, walking to the education tent for classes and then returning to their own tent.",
    "\u201cLiving here is like living in hell,\u201d a mother is quoted as saying. \u201cChildren go to bed late and in [the] night do not sleep because they do not feel at peace. And that is because the children feel that we as parents are not at peace.\u201d",
    "The asylum seekers are given three meals a day, and do not have the option to cook their own food. UNHCR observers found the meals to be varied and nutritional, but asylum seekers complained that the meals were sometimes not culturally appropriate, and that they had no say in what they ate.",
    "The UN report describes a deterioration in mental health in the camp, and observers saw signs of clinical depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
    "The draft report says that while children in the camp appeared \u201cplayful and responsive\u201d there were \u201cworrying signs that living in an enclosed environment, in close proximity to adults who were suffering from poor mental health was having an impact on their emotional health\u201d.",
    "\u201cChildren have witnessed violence and self-harm. They are aware that many of the adults, including in some cases their own parents, have tried to end their lives.\u201d",
    "During the UN\u2019s visit, one teenage girl asked a UNHCR representative: \u2018\u201cDo you think that if I kill myself, my brother and parents could go to another country where they would have a better life?\u201d",
    "Asylum seekers, including children, told the UN \u201cthey often feel their suffering is without end, and frequently consider the idea of purposely inflicting bodily harm or ending their life\u201d.",
    "Medical services on the island reported 21 incidents of self-harm between May and October 2023.",
    "\u201cI feel I am alive on the outside but dead from inside. My body hurts me, and if the pains will further increase, I may have to hurt myself to end this all,\u201d one man said.",
    "Several people have been transferred to Rwanda - a 3,000-mile flight away - for medical care following self-harm and suicide attempts.",
    "Those who have had their claims for international protection approved are still waiting for a third country - where they can have a new life - to be identified.",
    "UNHCR frequently heard concerns that asylum seekers felt they had been \u201cforgotten\u201d on the island and had \u201cno way to speak up about their current conditions or perceived injustices\u201d.",
    "The UN report acknowledges that the sudden arrival of asylum seekers on Diego Garcia presented \u201cenormous challenges\u201d and says \u201cimportant efforts were pursued to ensure that those who wished to make international protection claims were able to do so\u201d and that services such as medical care were made available. But, it says, the \u201cexisting situation is not tenable\u201d.",
    "Its draft report calls for the asylum seekers to be \u201curgently relocated\u201d, for final decisions on international protection to be expedited, and solutions secured for those whose claims are approved.",
    "It also calls for the UK government to conduct \u201ccontingency planning\u201d for possible future arrivals on the island, and for an independent mechanism to be established to monitor the treatment of asylum seekers.",
    "One of the group\u2019s lawyers, Tessa Gregory, from London firm Leigh Day, said she was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about their wellbeing, describing conditions on the island as \u201cappalling\u201d.",
    "Lawyers had been denied access to visit their clients on the island, she added.",
    "The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, of which Diego Garcia is part, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965 and went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the base.",
    "Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, maintains the islands are its own and the UN\u2019s\u2019 highest court has ruled that the UK\u2019s administration of the territory is \u201cunlawful\u201d and must end. UNHCR says its visit to the island does not constitute recognition of BIOT."
