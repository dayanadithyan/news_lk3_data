  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka violated all 16 of its past agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and if the current agreement is also not honoured, the situation could get macabre, according to Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardena.",
    "\u201cThe previous 16 agreements with the IMF were all violated. It was after violating the agreements that the country went bankrupt. If we violate the agreement again even after bankruptcy, the country will not last. Besides killing each other, there will be no alternative,\u201d Gunawardena said speaking to reporters.",
    "\u201cSo no matter how much we don\u2019t like it, the government of Sri Lanka must take the country on the path of debt restructuring and in accordance with the IMF pact,\u201d he said.",
    "Opposition parties in Sri Lanka this week boycotted a meeting called by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to discuss the IMF programme ahead of its second review by the international lender.",
    "The only opposition member to attend the meeting was Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian M A Sumanthiran.",
    "Sumanthiran said the government has agreed to provide copies of the Technical Assistance Reports compiled by the IMF to opposition party leaders on request.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition parties have not been overwhelmingly supportive of the IMF programme, the country\u2019s 17th so far. Leftists outfits such as the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) have historically taken an anti-IMF stance but recently met a group of representatives of the international lender.",
    "The SJB, which is more inclined to share President Wickremesinghe\u2019s liberal outlook, too has been critical, with its leader claiming that he would renegotiate the deal under terms more preferable to Sri Lanka.",
    "State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said the opposition could\u2019ve shared their concerns on the IMF programme and openly proposed any alternatives if they had attended the discussion.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m very surprised. It was for a very important economic discussion that the president invited. He asked party leaders to come and bring whoever they like, which meant that the leaders\u2019 economic advisors could\u2019ve also come,\u201d Siyambalapitiya said speaking to reporters outside the Presidential Secretariat on Monday March 11.",
    "\u201cThey could\u2019ve shared their concerns with the whole gathering and said \u2018not this tax, have this instead\u2019, or anything at all,\u201d he added. (Colombo/Mar13/2024)"
