    "In his Vesak Day message, President Ranil Wickremesinghe called upon the nation to embody the Buddha\u2019s teachings of enlightenment, unity, and compassion during these challenging times.",
    "He emphasized that, at this crucial moment, Sri Lankans should cultivate the same great zeal for enlightenment that the Buddha exemplified, and be willing to sacrifice today for a better tomorrow.",
    "\u201cThe Vesak festival is a profoundly sacred day for Buddhists worldwide, commemorating the Buddha\u2019s birth, enlightenment, and passing. Buddhists in Sri Lanka, along with their brethren around the globe, celebrate Vesak with deep devotion. They spend this period engaging in religious observances and venerating the Buddha with fervent devotion.",
    "At this challenging moment, we as a nation should cultivate the same great zeal for enlightenment that Buddha exemplified, inspired by his sermon, \u201cMaththasukha parichchaga- pass\u00e9 che vipulan sukhan\u201d \u2013 to sacrifice today for a better tomorrow.",
    "We must remember the advice of Lord Buddha, \u201cSabbattha Sammanaso,\u201d to treat everyone equally and ensure we put it into practice as a country. This is the greatest offering we can present to the Buddha on this Vesak day. Regardless of race, religion, caste, or political affiliation, we must all unite to heal and rebuild our country. The principles of Lichchavi Raja Dharmaya will guide us in this endeavour.",
    "Let us keep in mind that the primary aim of the Vesak festival is to foster spiritual growth and character development in a world rapidly advancing physically. I wish everyone a blessed Vesak festival.\u201d"
