  "original_body_lines": [
    "India\u2019s prime minister begins a two-day visit to Russia on Monday, his first since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine, a war that has complicated the relationship between the longtime allies and pushed Russia closer to India\u2019s rival China.",
    "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit will include a meeting with President Vladimir Putin, whom he last saw in Russia in 2019, in the far eastern port of Vladivostok. The two leaders also met in person in September 2022 in Uzbekistan, at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization bloc.",
    "Russia has had strong ties with India since the Cold War, and New Delhi\u2019s importance as a key trading partner for Moscow has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that shut most Western markets off to Russian exports.",
    "Under Modi\u2019s leadership, India has avoided condemning Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine while emphasizing the need for a peaceful settlement.",
    "The partnership between Moscow and New Delhi has become fraught, however, since Russia started developing closer ties with India\u2019s main rival, China, because of the hostilities in Ukraine.",
    "Modi notably stayed away last week from the most recent summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, in Kazakhstan.",
    "Chietigj Bajpaee, senior South Asia research fellow at the U.K.-based Chatham House, said India is becoming increasingly estranged from forums in which Russia and China play a prominent role.",
    "\u201cThis is evident in India\u2019s relatively low key presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization last year, and now the decision by Modi not to attend this year\u2019s summit,\u201d Bajpaee said.",
    "A confrontation in June 2020 along the disputed China-India border dramatically altered their already touchy relationship as the rival troops fought with rocks, clubs and fists. At least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers were killed. Tensions have since persisted despite talks.",
    "Those tensions have seeped into how New Delhi looks at Moscow.",
    "\u201cRussia\u2019s relations with China have been a matter of some concern for India in the context of Chinese increased assertiveness in the region,\u201d D. Bala Venkatesh Verma, a former Indian ambassador to Russia, told The Associated Press.",
    "But Modi also will seek to continue close relations with Russia, an important trading partner and major defense supplier for India.",
    "Since Western sanctions blocked Russian oil exports after the start of the Ukraine war, India has become a key buyer of Russian oil. It now gets more than 40% of its oil imports from Russia, according to analysts.",
    "India is also strongly dependent on Russia for military supplies, but with Moscow\u2019s supply line hit by the fighting in Ukraine, India has been diversifying its defense procurements, buying more from the U.S., Israel, France and Italy.",
    "\u201cDefense cooperation will clearly be a priority area,\u201d Bajpaee said, adding that 60% of India\u2019s military equipment and systems is \u201cstill of Russian origin.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some delay in the deliveries of spare parts ... following the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe both countries are due to conclude a military logistics agreement, which would pave the way for more defense exchanges.\u201d",
    "India has adopted a neutral stance, neither condemning nor condoning Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, and has called for negotiations to end the fighting. That in turn has bolstered Putin\u2019s efforts to counter what he calls the West\u2019s domination of global affairs.",
    "Facing an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court for actions over the war in Ukraine, Putin\u2019s foreign travel has been relatively sparse in recent years, so Modi\u2019s trip could help the Russian leader boost his image.",
    "\u201cWe kind of see Putin going on a nostalgia trip \u2014 you know, he was in Vietnam, he was in North Korea,\u201d said Theresa Fallon, an analyst at the Center for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies. \u201cIn my view, he\u2019s trying to demonstrate that he\u2019s not a vassal to China, that he has options, that Russia is still a great power.\u201d",
    "Alexander Gabuev, head of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said that Putin\u2019s interactions on the world stage show he \u201cis far from isolated\u201d and that Russia is not a country to be discounted.",
    "Trade development also will figure strongly in the talks, particularly intentions to develop a maritime corridor between India\u2019s major port of Chennai and Vladivostok, the gateway to Russia\u2019s Far East.",
    "India-Russia trade has seen a sharp increase, touching close to $65 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, due to strong energy cooperation, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told reporters Friday.",
    "Imports from Russia touched $60 billion and exports from India $4 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, Kwatra said. India\u2019s financial year runs from April to March.",
    "He said India was trying to correct the trade imbalance with Russia by increasing its exports. India\u2019s top exports to Russia include drugs and pharmaceutical products, telecom instruments, iron and steel, marine products and machinery.",
    "Its top imports from Russia include crude oil and petroleum products, coal and coke, pearls, precious and semi-precious stones, fertilizer, vegetable oil, gold and silver."
