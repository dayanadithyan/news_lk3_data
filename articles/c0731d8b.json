    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake will dissolve parliament immediately upon his election and temporarily send all \u201ccrooks\u201d home until the public makes it permanent at a general election in one and a half months, the leftist leader said.",
    "\u201cHand the country over to the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) on September 21. We\u2019ll start to change things one by one,\u201d Dissanayake said speaking at an election rally in Thambuththegama on Monday September 09.",
    "\u201cResults will come on the 22nd. We won\u2019t waste an hour. We will swear in instantly and immediately dissolve parliament.",
    "\u201cWe won\u2019t allow these thieves, criminals and frauds to spend another day in parliament,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI will send them home temporarily. At the general election, you vote for permanently sending them home. We\u2019ll give you a head start,\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake said the next parliament won\u2019t have \u201cfrauds and corrupt people\u201d and will instead be filled with honest, disciplined and \u201creal\u201d people with subject expertise.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re certain that more than 150 of the current MPs will go home,\u201d he added.",
    "Dissanayake then went onto list out what voters can expect from an NPP government. He said rather than consolidate power the way successive governments have done, the NPP will begin to \u201clet go\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe first cabinet decision will be to cancel MPs\u2019 pensions.",
    "\u201cMPs get vehicle permits which are sold for 20, 30 million rupees. Remember, they don\u2019t buy a vehicle with that permit. They take a vehicle from the government for their use and sell the permit. The NPP government will stop issuing permits to MPs, which is a bribe,\u201d he said.",
    "The NPP government\u2019s cabinet will be selected scientifically and comprise no more than 25 ministers, according to Dissanayake.",
    "\u201cToday they create multiple ministries. Remember that agriculture, land, irrigation and animal husbandry is one ministry. Don\u2019t you want such a government?",
    "\u201cThere is no such thing as state ministers. You know people like Semasinghe? There is no such thing. That will all be stopped.\u201d",
    "The NPP will not provide housing to ministers, said Dissanayake.",
    "\u201cThere will be no motorcades of seven, eight vehicles to travel behind ministers. Maximum one or two. Isn\u2019t that good? Let\u2019s begin.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re not coming to grab it all. We\u2019re coming to let go. For this country, public officials must let go a lot of things,\u201d he said.",
    "Pensions of former presidents will also be cancelled, said Dissanayake, in addition the MPs\u2019.",
    "\u201cThe government will take back houses given to former presidents. Mahinda Rajapaksa has three grown sons. They\u2019ll take care of him. Why stay in the government house?",
    "\u201cThis poor country cannot bear the cost of maintaining these MPs and ministers. But they care nothing about this,\u201d he said.",
    "The leftist leader also criticised President Ranil Wickremesinghe for having an ambulance as part of his motorcade, which is standard protocol for presidents.",
    "\u201cWhen Wickremesinghe is on the road there\u2019s an ambulance behind him. There are no ambulances for hospitals. The same is true for Mahinda Rajapaksa and Dinesh Gunawardena. There\u2019s an ambulance parked outside their house at night when they sleep. All of these ambulances will be distributed to hospitals that need them,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Sep10/2024)"
