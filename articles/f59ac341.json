    "During a media briefing yesterday, Hettiarachchi urged the Government, led by the President, to refrain from introducing any amendments that would necessitate a referendum at this time.Referring to President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s recent statement to Local Government representatives about postponing the Local Government elections to focus on rebuilding the country, Hettiarachchi questioned the Government\u2019s priorities. \u201cIf the economic crisis is ongoing, why is the Government attempting to introduce an amendment that would require a referendum costing Rs. 10 billion?\u201d he asked.",
    "He also said it is unacceptable for the Government to propose amendments leading to a referendum when the Local Government elections have been postponed due to a lack of funds. \u201cThis demonstrates that, even amidst an economic crisis, the rulers are continuing to spend the country\u2019s money on a project aimed at retaining power,\u201d he accused.",
