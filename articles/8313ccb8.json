    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 President Ranil Wickremesinghe was responsible for his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s exit since he could\u2019ve contained the Aragalaya protests and resolved the crisis while remaining Prime Minister if he wanted to, opposition MP Ashok Abeysinghe said.",
    "Responding to questions raised by a YouTube channel on Thursday March 07, Abeysinghe said Rajapaksa\u2019s recent \u201ctell-all\u201d book about an alleged conspiracy to oust him should\u2019ve made references to what the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) claimed was Wickermesinghe\u2019s decisive role in the former president\u2019s unceremonious departure.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t comment on the book without reading it. We would like if it had mentioned\u2026 because one person who took the lead in ousting him was Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe. If he wanted to, Mr Wickremesinghe could\u2019ve resolved this issue without sending Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa away. But the moment he became prime minister, Mr Wickremesinghe said he would fully support and provide all facilities to the Aragalaya and then told him to go out through the backdoor and became president,\u201d said Abeysinghe.",
    "\u201cIdeally this must be included in the book. And he must know it too, who was behind this,\u201d he added.",
    "The MP said those responsible for Sri Lanka\u2019s unprecedented financial crisis cannot just get away with it by writing a book.",
    "\u201cThe Supreme Court has given a verdict on who is responsible for putting this country in this situation,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cTheir conscience knows this. I think the book maybe has that. But I reiterate that it was Mr Wickremesinghe who was instrumental in his departure,\u201d he added.",
    "Abeysinghe said he does not believe Rajapaksa will get back into active politics.",
    "On his last day in Sri Lanka before resigning from the presidency, Abeysinghe claimed, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe could\u2019ve told Rajapaksa to temporarily relocate to a military base in Trincomalee the way former PM Mahinda Rajapaksa had done until the new PM resolved the crisis.",
    "\u201cThe way he now disperses people\u2019s protests, he could\u2019ve dispersed the Aragalaya protestors too. If he had done that, Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa would still be president. I believe Mr Rajapaksa knows that Mr Wickremesinghe is responsible for his exit,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Mar08/2024)"
