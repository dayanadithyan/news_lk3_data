    "Joining the \u2018Derana 360\u2019 programme, Dr. Amarasuriya explained their party\u2019s stance regarding the LGBTQ+ community.",
    "\u201cWe have been advocating for this community for a while. They are also a part of this society. Gender identities are diverse, including those of the same-sex community. From the beginning, we are of the stance that individuals should not be discriminated based on their gender\u201d, she said.",
    "\u201cSpecifically, these same-sex relationships have been criminalized in our penal code. This is not a law which was originated in our country; it was introduced during the Victorian era by the British. Therefore, we believe it should be amended,\u201d Dr. Amarasuriya expressed.",

    "\u201c\u2026Only the sexual relationships with animals are a crime\u2026So, the NPP will back this during its third reading,\u201d she assured."
