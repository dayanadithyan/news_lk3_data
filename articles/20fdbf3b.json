    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry says that the western countries have shown their \u2018double standards\u2019 by \u2018turning a blind eye\u2019 to the crisis in Gaza and that, serious amendments must be made to the international laws on how the United Nations functions in order to protect international democracy.",
    "Joining Ada Derana\u2019s current affairs programme, \u2018At Hydepark\u2019, the Minister stated that Sri Lanka is of the view that the Israel-Palestine war must come to an end immediately and both countries must exist as per the borders announced in 1965.",
