    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s President Ranil Wickremesinghe handed in his nomination papers for the September 21 election at the Election Commission today, opting to contest under a symbol of a domestic cooking gas cylinder.",
    "\u201cToday, I officially announce my candidacy for President of Sri Lanka, and to continue my duties to you, the Sri Lankan people,\u201d Wickremesinghe tweeted, after changing his twitter handle from RW_UNP to @RW_SRILANKA.",
    "Wickremesinghe is the leader of the United National Party, but is contesting as an independent candidate.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is on a journey. Since 2022, we have worked hard together to recover from our past challenges, but there is still more to be done.",
    "\u201cMy commitment to you and our country is unwavering. Together, we will continue to build a prosperous future, but that can only be done with stability.\u201d",
    "His choice of symbol is interesting, as a spate of explosions and fires attributed to liquid petroleum (LP) gas cylinders or related accessories caused a panic in 2021.",
    "At the time the Court of Appeal ordered the country\u2019s cooking gas companies to recall LP gas cylinders in the market and replace them free of charge with cylinders approved by the Sri Lanka Standards Institute.",
    "In 2022, a forex crisis led to severe shortages including of the gas used in cooking. People had to line up for days for refills of the cylinder. (Colombo/Aug15/2024)"
