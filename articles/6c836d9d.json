    "Kala Pola, Sri Lanka\u2019s annual open-air art fair, is set to mark its 31st anniversary on 18th February 2024. Celebrating over three decades of fostering the livelihoods of Sri Lankan artists, Kala Pola takes inspiration from the world-famous outdoor art fairs in Montmartre, Paris, and the Turl Street Art Festival in Oxford and has evolved as an eagerly awaited event of the art and culture calendar of Sri Lanka.",
    "The George Keyt Foundation (GKF) conceptualised and launched Kala Pola in 1993, and since 1994 it has enjoyed the sustained patronage of the John Keells Group, as part of its corporate social responsibility. This uncurated visual art fair aims to consistently elevate the visitor experience, expanding its reach to include more artists and attract a broader audience of both local and international art enthusiasts, consequently generating increased participation and income for the artists. The event\u2019s success also stems from its networking and learning opportunities, with Kala Pola being an event at which artists from different levels of seniority and regions of Sri Lanka converge, fostering an environment of collaboration.",
    "Malaka Talwatte, the Chairperson of the George Keyt Foundation stated, \u201cThe GKF\u2019s core objective has always been to catalyse \u2018Opportunity for Art\u2019, particularly for local artists, and Kala Pola is a flagship endeavour in this respect. We are grateful to the John Keells Group for their continued partnership over the past three decades which has enabled Kala Pola to sustain and evolve. Kala Pola is now a major tourist attraction having established itself as one of Colombo\u2019s iconic events.\u201d",
    "Nadija Tambiah, President Legal, Secretarial, and Corporate Social Responsibility at John Keells Group, emphasised, \u201cOver its three-decade journey, Kala Pola has steadfastly provided an uncurated, dynamic platform for Sri Lankan artists, forming an integral part of John Keells Group\u2019s commitment to fostering Sri Lanka\u2019s Arts & Culture. The Group also strives to highlight the economic potential of the country\u2019s creative economy while supporting the development of an ecosystem that nurtures creativity. We also hope that by providing platforms for storytelling and expression we can contribute towards a shared understanding of our nation\u2019s history and thereby enhance our social cohesion.\u201d",
