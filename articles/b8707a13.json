    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s recent rupee appreciation is due to higher foreign currency inflows compared to the outflows, but there is a possibility for depreciation in the latter part of this year, central bank officials said.",
    "The rupee currency has seen an appreciation in the recent months and traded around 300 rupees per U.S. dollar this week compared to 320 rupee in January this year.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is also the island nation\u2019s Finance Minister, had expected the rupee to appreciate to around 270 per US dollar by June this year.",
    "\u201cThe main reason is we have more inflows,\u201d D. S. T. Wanaguru, Director, at the Central Bank\u2019s International Operations Department told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo on Friday (16).",
    "\u201cThe market has more foreign currency liquidity than the outflows. That has facilitated the central bank to purchase more foreign currency from the market.\u201d",
    "The rupee appreciated 12.1 percent against the US dollar last year and 8.1 percent so far this year with the central bank has been on the buying side, she said.",
    "However, the central bank\u2019s inflation projection showed it has included possible rupee depreciation as a risk for inflation to reverse its slowing trend.",
    "\u201cThese are the possible risks. It is not certain. The risk assessment is such that we are considering all possible scenarios on the upside as well as the downside. So on the upside is one major possibility is depreciation,\u201d S. Jegajeevan, director at the Central Bank\u2019s Economic Research Department told reporters.",
    "\u201cCurrently the exchange rate is decided by the market forces; the demand and supply. So we are talking about some vehicle import relaxation and all. So we may be having some higher import level.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn that case if we are not getting enough inflows, there could be possibilities of some depreciation,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cWe have to assume that. We are not certain that there will be a depreciation, but this is a possibility.\u201d (Colombo/August 16/2024)"
