    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s Attorney General has cleared a draft bill on Gender Socialisation Equality and will now be gazetted, the government said.",
    "The Government Information Department said on Tuesday March 12 that the cabinet of ministers has approved a proposal by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to publish the bill in the government gazette to be tabled in parliament for its approval.",
    "Wickremesinghe has made the proposal in his capacity as Minister of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment.",
    "The bill, first approved by the cabinet in September 2023, is one of two proposed pieces of legislation that seek to minimise a gender imbalance in socialisation.",
    "Gender socialisation is the process of teaching individuals, young and old, how to behave according to gender roles. Gender roles are socially constructed ideas of what it means to be one\u2019s assigned gender.",
    "In September 2023, the cabinet also granted approval to establish an independent commission under the title of the National Women\u2019s Commission to make recommendations to parliament through the subject minister in mediating in issues related to providing leadership for women\u2019s rights as well as ensuring equality of gender socialisation. This second bill is titled Women\u2019s Empowerment Bill.",
    "President Wickremesinghe alluded to the two bills in a speech he made at an event celebrating International Women\u2019s Day 2024 held in Colombo on March 08.",
    "\u201cIt is imperative that women\u2019s rights go beyond mere rhetoric; therefore, it is crucial to enact appropriate legislation, a task that has been neglected for far too long,\u201d Wickremesinghe said.",
    "\u201cIn celebrating International Women\u2019s Day, the usual practice in our country is to hold a ceremony, discuss women\u2019s rights and return home. This routine occurs every year. However, this time, we have decided to implement concrete actions to amplify women\u2019s voices,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cPlans are also underway to establish a Gender Equality Council with ministerial powers and to set up a gender centre, equipped to address issues at the ministerial level.",
    "\u201cWith the implementation of these initiatives, we will establish two robust institutions dedicated to advancing women\u2019s rights,\u201d said Wickremesinghe. (Colombo/Mar12/2024)"
