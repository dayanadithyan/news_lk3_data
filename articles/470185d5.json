    "After breaking away, Karuna had indicated that he would abide by the ceasefire and wanted a separate memorandum of understanding. This was vehemently opposed by the mainstream LTTE",
    "Moreover the LTTE had invested politically in the grouping of Tamil parties known as the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), The Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) Leader Douglas Devananda used to mock the TNA as\u00a0 an acronym for \u201cTiger nominated agents\u201d",
    "In the first article published last week (\u201cCol\u201d Karuna\u2019s Eastern Tiger revolt against LTTE 20 years ago) the background and reasons for the Eastern Tiger revolt were discussed in detail.",
    "In this second article, the course of events leading to the eruption of the intra-tiger fratricidal conflict in the aftermath of \u201cCol\u201dKaruna\u2019s rebellion will be recounted, relying on some of my earlier writings.",
    "All hell was expected to break loose after \u201cCol\u201dKaruna the Eastern regional commander of the LTTE raised the banner of revolt against the Wanni-based tiger hierarchy on March 3, 2004.",
    "However, the LTTE leadership displayed\u00a0 \u00a0restraint in the initial period. Instead of launching a powerful military offensive against the renegade Tiger chieftain, the LTTE began overtly soft-pedaling the issue while engaging covertly in activities aimed at undermining Karuna.",
    "LTTE political wing head\u00a0 Suppiah\u00a0 Paramu Tamilchelvan announced on March 6, 2004 at a press conference in Kilinochchi that\u00a0 tiger supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran had\u00a0 explicitly instructed his cadre to refrain from any military action to resolve the situation. Assuring the world at large that the Tigers would defuse the crisis very quickly, Tamilchelvan also stated that there would be no bloodshed.",
    "Interestingly, Tamilchelvan had earlier dismissed the Karuna affair as a minor matter and ridiculed Karuna as a single individual without any support. The glib pronouncements of Tamilchelvan, or for that matter any Tiger leader, were viewed sceptically, given the LTTE\u2019s track record of deception and acting in bad faith.",
    "A complex set of factors contributed to the circumscribing of the LTTE\u00a0 and the maintenance of an uneasy peace in March 2004. As stated earlier there was a Norway facilitated peace process on. A ceasefire was in progress with a Scandinavian monitoring mission supervising it. After breaking away, Karuna had indicated that he would abide by the ceasefire and wanted a separate memorandum of understanding. This was vehemently opposed by the mainstream LTTE. Thus the LTTE was wary of upsetting the fragile situation by engaging in violence prematurely and incurring blame.",
    "Another factor was the uneasy political co-habitation that prevailed between the Sri Lanka Freedom Party( SLFP) President Chandrika Kumaratunga and the Govt\u00a0 of United National\u00a0 Party (UNP) Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. It was under great strain at the time of the Karuna revolt. President Kumaratunga unilaterally dissolved Parliament on February 7, 2004 and scheduled elections for April 2. As such prudence decreed that the LTTE should be cautious until elections were held.",
    "Moreover the LTTE had invested politically in the grouping of Tamil parties known as the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), The Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) Leader Douglas Devananda used to mock the TNA as\u00a0 an acronym for \u201cTiger nominated agents\u201d. The LTTE was banking on the TNA getting over 20 seats in the poll. Of these around 4 to 6 MPs would be from the Eastern districts of Amparai and\u00a0 Batticaloa. Hence the LTTE did not want to unleash full scale violence in the East until elections were over.",
    "A further reason for the LTTE\u2019s\u00a0 initial reticence was\u00a0 the need to assess the military situation. The LTTE hierarchy needed time to take stock of the situation. How many tiger cadres could be estimated as Karuna loyalists and how many would remain faithful to Prabhakaran?\u00a0 In which parts of the East was Karuna strong or weak? What were the military fortifications and preparations being done by Karuna and the rebel tigers to safeguard territory in the face of a military onslaught by the LTTE? What kind of strategy should be adopted to prevent the inevitable confrontation\u00a0 deteriorating into a clash\u00a0 on regional lines of North versus East? The LTTE commanded by Prabhakaran delayed making decisive moves until a proper military assessment was made.",
    "When the\u00a0 eastern tiger revolt was proclaimed the\u00a0 prevalent military balance between Karuna\u2019s rebels\u00a0 and the mainstream LTTE was\u00a0 delicately intricate\u00a0 \u00a0and precariously fluid. In recent times, the Eastern component comprising Batticaloa and Amparai had become almost indispensable to the LTTE. The cadre strength of the LTTE was about 25,000 then. Of these, around 7,000 were either seniors whose fighting days were over, or injured and maimed fighters who could not engage in active combat. This left\u00a0 about 18,000 fighters, both men and women.",
    "About 7,500 of the fighters were\u00a0 from Batticaloa and Amparai districts. The region had become the provider of the largest segment of Tiger cadre in recent years. More than 2,000 cadres were recruited or conscripted from the Eastern region after the\u00a0 2002 ceasefire came into force. The rest of the North-East could swell their numbers by only 500 to 600 after\u00a0 the ceasefire.",
    "Moreover, not all of the 7,500 cadre from the East were\u00a0 in their native region. An estimated 1,800 of the Eastern cadre were in the North before the crisis erupted. Since then another 200 Eastern cadre\u00a0 left Karuna and crossed over to the Wanni. Of the 1,800 Eastern cadres, 600 were\u00a0 being maintained as a distinct entity. They\u00a0 comprised\u00a0 the first division of the Jeyanthan brigade, commanded then\u00a0 by Jeyathan. These men were deployed on the Northern border along the Kilaly-Eluthumadduvaal-Nagar Lovil axis in the Jaffna peninsula. They manned the security lines and sentry posts to the south of Muhamaalai in the Jaffna peninsula.",
    "After the Karuna rebellion the Eastern brigade became suspect. Its members were relieved of their duties, deprived of arms and kept under mass house arrest. They were screened and debriefed by\u00a0 Intelligence chief\u00a0 Pottu Amman and other Eastern Tiger leaders loyal to Prabhakaran, such as Ramesh, Ram, Praba and Ramanan.",
    "In addition to these\u00a0 there were 400 Eastern cadres serving as bodyguards to important Tiger leaders. Prabhakaran himself had 75 Easterners in his trusted bodyguard unit of 200. Another 800 Easterners were serving in various departments and sections of the LTTE in the North. The Sea Tigers, the intelligence wing, the economic unit, the revenue unit, the medical corps, the artillery unit, the political sections of men and women, the communications corps, the leopard commando unit and even the administrative bodies in the North were manned by Easterners in sizable numbers. The majority of Sea Tigers and members of the Black Tiger suicide squad were\u00a0 also from the East.",
    "There were 32 departments-cum-fighting formations in the LTTE then. Of these none was headed by Easterners, but all relied heavily on recruits from the region. Three key figures from the East serving in the North then were Puthiyavan of the LTTE administrative secretariat, Nalan of the medical corps and Roshan of the communications wing. Except for a select few, most of these men were initially suspect . After being debriefed and screened. Easterners whose loyalty was proven\u00a0 and who were\u00a0 willing to fight Karuna were\u00a0 \u00a0formed\u00a0 into special units to combat the eastern warlord.",
    "It could be seen therefore that the Karuna engineered LTTE split was\u00a0 both horizontal and vertical. Militarily and politically, Prabhakaran was unwilling to deploy northern cadre to fight Karuna in the East. He preferred\u00a0 to send in Eastern cadre for the job because they knew the terrain and the political fallout would have been\u00a0 less risky. The phenomenon of Northern fighters battling and killing Eastern cadre could alienate the entire East from the North.",
    "Thus Senior Batticaloa leaders who defected to Kilinochchi after Karuna\u2019s rebellion were\u00a0 appointed \u201clegitimate\u201d Eastern Tiger leaders by Prabhakaran. Ramesh\u00a0 replaced Karuna and was made the special commander for b Amparai and Batticaloa.\u00a0 Ram\u00a0 was made the military commander and Praba the deputy military commander. Ramanan was appointed military intelligence chief and Kausalyan appointed as the political commissar.",
    "With the\u00a0 defections of some of his senior deputies, Karuna too\u00a0 re-shuffled\u00a0 his senior officials. Rabat\u00a0 was appointed the senior military commander. Jim Kelly\u00a0 Thatha and Visu were appointed deputy military chief and political commissar respectively. Thurai became\u00a0 the new administrative head and Nilavini the women\u2019s brigade commander. Premini was appointed the women\u2019s political wing head.Bawa was\u00a0 the new Amparai district head.",
    "Of the 7,500 Eastern cadres, 5,700 were in Batticaloa and Amparai at the time of the split while 1.800 were in the Wanni. Karuna had two divisions of the Jeyanthan brigade under his command. He also had\u00a0 the Visalagan and Vinothan men\u2019s brigades, the Anbarasi and Mathana women\u2019s brigades, and the Johnson artillery unit under his command. Eastern officer cadre who passed out from the Balendra officers training college were beholden to Karuna.",
    "\u201cCol\u201d Karuna also had an impressive arsenal of heavy artillery. Initially these big guns were moved into the East to pound the Batticaloa town camp, the Veechukalmunai-Pudoor complex, and the Vavunatheevu and Kallady camps if war broke out. Now they wee mounted to the south of Trincomalee in anticipation of a Tiger strike.",
    "It was\u00a0 well-known that LTTE supremo Prabhakaran was depending\u00a0 on Sornam, the senior commander from Trincomalee, to lead the invasion into Batticaloa when the time was\u00a0 ripe. Sornam\u00a0 was\u00a0 camped\u00a0 along the northern banks of the Verugal River in Trincomalee district. The crocodile-infested river demarcates Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts. Karuna\u00a0 deployed about 800 cadres in the Maavadichenai sector to prevent an invasion across Verugal. The defenders were\u00a0 commanded by Karuna\u2019s brother Sivanesathurai alias\u00a0 Reggie. The\u00a0 120 mm and 122 mm\u00a0 long-range artillery\u00a0 was also placed south of Verugal Rivers as\u00a0 a deterrent.",
    "In addition, Karuna\u2019s cadre also patrolled\u00a0 the shores along Vaaharai, Kaluwankerny, Panichankerny and other\u00a0 coastal areas anticipating a sea-borne invasion. The three Eastern Tiger coastal camps of Vaaharai, Paalchenai and Challaitheevu were also under Karuna\u2019s control. Key highways and trunk roads coming into the district were also monitored\u00a0 and suspect vehicles and passengers checked. Key roads in the interior were also",
    "Karuna feared infiltration by Intelligence Chief\u00a0 Pottu Amman\u2019s men. Large-scale invasion through clandestine routes were also anticipated. All three routes of the famous \u201cBeirut trail\u201d linking the North and the East via jungles were\u00a0 also watched. Apparently, Karuna hoped then to keep Batticaloa \u201csealed\u201d as long as possible.",
    "Karuna also\u00a0 expelled several people closely connected to the LTTE. He\u00a0 closed down LTTE run\u00a0 courts, police stations, tax offices, intelligence offices and administrative units. The Northern Tamils manning them were\u00a0 sent away. In the process, several Jaffna academics and students in the Batticaloa Eastern University also had to go away. Several Jaffna traders and a few professionals were also intimidated and chased\u00a0 away. Many others left Batticaloa\u00a0 out of fear. Karuna justified this\u00a0 forced exit as a \u201cpressure tactic\u201d to influence the LTTE in the Wanni. However, such moves\u00a0 created a rift between the Northern and Eastern Tamils in the east then",
    "Meanwhile the mainstream LTTE used every counter-propaganda tactic to vilify and discredit Karuna. Among the charges levelled against him were corruption, misappropriation of funds, illicit sexual liaisons with senior women Tiger leaders, internal killings and torture, sending wife and children safely to Malaysia, involvement with an external force, conspiring with the Colombo government, selling out Tamil nationalism, being a cat\u2019s paw of those seeking to break up North-East unity and so on.",
    "The LTTE game plan seemed\u00a0 to be that of waiting and undermining Karuna through this type of propaganda. If more and more Eastern\u00a0 cadre believed this propaganda and got\u00a0 alienated from Karuna, his position would be weakened. The Eastern people too would turn against him. Under such circumstances, it would be easier to destroy Karuna\u00a0 and also contain a regional backlash.",
    "Realising\u00a0 the\u00a0 dangers of the LTTE campaign against him, Karuna began\u00a0 acting accordingly to counter it. Although Karuna had\u00a0 received the sympathy of the international, Sinhala and English media, the Tamil press in Colombo\u00a0 and Jaffna was\u00a0 hostile. Tamil newspapers were generally supportive of the mainstream LTTE and published the anti-Karuna propaganda dished out by the LTTE.",
    "Enraged Karuna supporters\u00a0 burnt copies of the Virakesari, Thinakkural and Sudar Oli and \u201cbanned\u201d these newspapers in Batticaloa. Karuna used the four-page Tamil daily \u201cThamil Alai\u201d to propagate his point of view in Batticaloa and Amparai. Karuna\u2019s idea was to prevent information unfavourable to him from being provided to the people of Batticaloa and promote his own line. This was\u00a0 not an easy task given the reach of radio, television and electronic mail. Yet Karuna persisted in trying to embargo information then.",
    "General elections were held on April 2, 2004 and a new Parliament including 22 TNA members was\u00a0 elected. It was now obvious that the long awaited Tiger vs. Tiger confrontation in the East would occur soon. When would D-day dawn on the eastern horizon was the multi-million-rupee question.",
    "It came exactly a week after elections on April 9. Few people would have thought that the LTTE would pick April 9, 2004 to begin the attack, as it was Good Friday. The possibility of the LTTE launching an attack on Good Friday and hurting Christian sentiments seemed improbable. But the LTTE obviously ignored this and used the element of surprise to its advantage.",
    "The\u00a0 LTTE\u2019s \u201cGood Friday\u201d attack resulted in much bloodshed and great loss of life. Hundreds\u00a0 of Eastern Tamil youths were brutally massacred in the fratricidal war. Karuna\u2019s eastern rebellion was crushed.\u00a0 These matters will be related in detail in a forthcoming article."
