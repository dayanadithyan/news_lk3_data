    "Colombo, May 18 (DailyMirror) - People living in low-lying areas along the river basins of Kala Oya, Deduru Oya, Maha Oya, Attanagalu Oya, Kelani Ganga, Kalu Ganga, Gin Ganga, Nilwala Ganga, Bentara Ganga, Kirama Oya and Uruboku Oya are requested to be vigilent over possible floods with the continuous rain during the next few days, the Irrigation Department said.",
    "Irrigation (Hydrology) Director Eng. S.P.C. Sugeeshwara Bandara said no such flood situations have been reported from the above-mentioned areas for now.",
    "He mentioned that 75 percent of the water capacity is currently available in general in irrigation reservoirs. But some reservoirs have increased their water capacities by up to 85 percent.",
    "Therefore, there are high possibilities of opening the spillgates of these reservoirs in the catchment areas with higher rainfall in the next few days.",
    "Currently, the spill gates of the Rajanganaya Reservoir in the Anuradhapura District and the Angamuwa Reservoir have been opened. Four spill gates in the Rajanganaya Reservoir release 4,000 cubic inches of water per second. Two spill gates of the Angamuwa Reservoir have been opened, and they release a water capacity of at least 2,000 cubic inches per second.",
    "Several medium-sized reservoirs were reported to be spilling over, he said."
