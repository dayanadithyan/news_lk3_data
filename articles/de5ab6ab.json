    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Matale district MP Rohini Kumari Wijerathna yesterday accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of ordering a police crackdown on former supporters who had dedicated 26 years of hard work for him.",
    "\u201cOn 30 January, those who endured beatings for 26 years in support of Ranil Wickremesinghe gathered in Colombo. Ranil Wickremesinghe employed Tiran Alles\u2019s police and army to launch an attack on them. This day will be remembered as a historic moment for supporters of the United National Party,\u201d she remarked.",
    "Referring to the police crackdown on the SJB protest held on 30 January, Wijerathna condemned the attack, emphasising that people have the right to engage in peaceful protests and express dissent. She also noted that the police even fired tear gas at children who had gathered at the public library for a chess tournament on the day. \u201cWe have never witnessed a government, a Minister overseeing the Police, or a President who sanctioned attacks on children before,\u201d she said.",
    "Addressing a press conference in Colombo, the MP accused the current government of trying to stifle the voices of the people and affirmed that the SJB will persist with its protest campaign nationwide alongside oppressed citizens.",
    "The MP also seized the opportunity to allege that the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Permuna (JVP) is collaborating with the government. She questioned why the JVP has not taken to the streets against the government. \u201cRanil Wickremesinghe only deploys tear gas and water cannons against the SJB. These measures are not directed towards the \u2018red elephants.\u2019 We condemn the suppression targeted solely at the SJB,\u201d she expressed.",
    "She claimed the JVP has failed to raise the issues faced by the country\u2019s people in parliament and the people will respond in kind at the upcoming polls.",
    "\u201cWe will persist with our protest campaign across the country until this government is ousted,\u201d she declared.",
    "Speaking at the press conference, SJB MP S. M. Marikkar said the people have the right to oppose the Government\u2019s efforts to curtail their freedoms through the introduction of suppressive laws. \u201cThe opposition also has the right to lead any campaign against the Government when it makes anti-people policies,\u201d he noted.",
    "He also emphasised that the Government should not hold the SJB responsible for the damage caused by depicting Sri Lanka as a place where peaceful protests are not tolerated. \u201cThe international community will recognise the absence of democratic rights in the country. Do not attribute this to the SJB,\u201d he urged.",
    "He denounced the tear gas attacks on the public library and the Vihara Maha Devi Park, both public spaces, stating that it reflects the Government\u2019s inhumanity and cruelty.",
    "Meanwhile, also expressing his views, SJB Senior Vice President Sujeewa Senasinghe accused Wickremesinghe of destroying the UNP within three decades for his selfish needs. \u201cFor 30 years, there was no fostering of new leaders within the UNP. He destroyed the party and then finally joined the Rajapaksas. We will never strike deals with him,\u201d he asserted.",
    "He too accused the JVP of striking a deal with the Government and claimed only the SJB has not struck a deal with any party or group. \u201cOur only deal is with the people,\u201d he claimed. He urged the people to not look for a saviour within the JVP in order to punish wrong doers."
