    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A speaker\u2019s endorsement is required for bills passed by parliament to ensure that it is \u2018duly passed\u2019 opposition legislator M A Sumanthiran said in a debate on a no confidence motion against Speaker Mahinda Abeywardana.",
    "The opposition said several clauses in a so-called online safety bill (now Act) to police social media were against the constitution, as the bill did not incorporate the changes required by the Supreme Court.",
    "\u201cThis is the first time that a Supreme Court determination on a bill has  been blatantly violated by parliament,\u201d Sumanthiran said.",
    "There is no post-enactment judicial review of passed laws in Sri Lanka. There has been growing concerns that ruling governments are slipping through unconstitutional clauses in to laws in the so-called \u2018committee stage\u2019.",
    "Sumanthiran said he went to court against the online safety bill and court did not give leave to proceed as the speaker had already endorsed it.",
    "In two days time the government will vote against this, which will prove that the majority is wrong, he said. (Colombo/Mar19/2024)"
