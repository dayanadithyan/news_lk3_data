    "NPP Presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake expresses belief elections will not be free and fair but says party is determined to represent people in democratic manner",
    "Accuses some media organisations of promoting their preferred candidates ahead of elections",
    "Says those who continue to speak of 88/89 are not doing so with genuine intent but as an excuse to not support NPP",
    "On possible threats to his life, Dissanayake says such concerns being raised is proof SL indicates lack of democratic environment",
    "National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake has said while his party has employed a systematic and robust approach to election propaganda and public awareness, other parties have exploited the political culture of crossovers to advance their agendas.",
    "\u201cThey have become pioneers of an ugly political culture, where they previously disparaged each other from opposing platforms but now come together to praise one another. The NPP does not represent such a corrupt form of politics,\u201d he said.",
    "Addressing a press conference yesterday Dissanayake emphasised that the NPP\u2019s goal is to transform the political culture of crossovers. \u201cOur political approach is not about creating breaking news every time someone changes sides,\u201d he said, highlighting the role of the media in reshaping Sri Lanka\u2019s political landscape.",
    "\u201cWe have entered this election campaign with a comprehensive program that addresses all the key aspects of our political journey so far,\u201d he added. Dissanayake also expressed confidence that the NPP will emerge victorious in the upcoming election.",
    "When asked by the media about the possibility of the elections being free and fair, Dissanayake pointed out that President Ranil Wickremesinghe is already using his position, public funds, and other resources for election propaganda. \u201cEven the Opposition leader is utilising the office of the Opposition leader for campaign activities. It is evident how they are exploiting public funds and property,\u201d he said.",
    "He also emphasised that the media has a crucial role in ensuring fair coverage for all political movements. \u201cHowever, some media organisations are using their networks to promote their preferred candidates. False and absurd accusations are also being made against other political groups perceived as threats to these chosen candidates. This situation presents a significant obstacle to a free and fair election,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cIn general, we do not believe the election campaign will be fair. We are participating in the election process by preparing to represent the people\u2019s opinions in a democratic manner,\u201d he said.",
    "Addressing concerns about potential threats to his life, Dissanayake stated that the NPP is not worried.",
    "\u201cAny political movement has the democratic right to contest fair elections. If there are concerns about threats to my safety, it indicates a lack of a democratic environment. If there is a perception that any candidate could be harmed during this election campaign, shouldn\u2019t we work to eliminate such politics? Everyone should have the opportunity to express their opinions fairly and stand for election,\u201d he said.",
    "Regarding questions about the 1988/89 JVP insurrection and the new wave of opinions on the matter, Dissanayake responded that the party has addressed these issues and expressed its regret many times. He suggested that these opinions are not being raised with genuine intent but are instead used as an excuse to avoid supporting the NPP.",
    "\u201cFor 30 years since 1994, we have stayed committed to the democratic process without resorting to violence. Many of our comrades were killed during this period. The criminals who murdered two people at a meeting attended by our comrade Nalinda have been released by the courts. It is no longer acceptable for such groups to point fingers at us,\u201d he said"
