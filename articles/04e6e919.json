  "original_body_lines": [
    "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that new details on the Katchatheevu island issue \u201chave unmasked DMK\u2019s (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) double standards totally\u201d. His remarks came a day after he attacked the Congress over its decision to hand over the strategic island to Sri Lanka in the 1970s.",
    "In a post on X, the Prime Minister said, \u201cRhetoric aside, DMK has done NOTHING to safeguard Tamil Nadu\u2019s interests. New details emerging on #Katchatheevu have UNMASKED the DMK\u2019s double standards totally.\u201d",
    "\u201cCongress and DMK are family units. They only care that their own sons and daughters rise. They don\u2019t care for anyone else. Their callousness on Katchatheevu has harmed the interests of our poor fishermen and fisherwomen in particular,\u201d he added.",
    "Katchatheevu island is where fishermen from Tamil Nadu go to fish. But they are detained by the Sri Lankan Navy as soon as they cross the International Maritime Border Line (IMBL) to reach the island.",
    "On Sunday, Prime Minister Modi not only attacked the Congress for handing over the island to Sri Lanka but also accused the party of \u201cweakening\u201d the country\u2019s integrity and interests.",
    "His remarks came in response to a Right To Information (RTI) report which revealed how the Congress government led by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi handed over Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka in 1974.",
    "\u201cEye-opening and startling! New facts reveal how Congress callously gave away Katchatheevu. This has angered every Indian and reaffirmed in people\u2019s minds - we can\u2019t ever trust Congress! Weakening India\u2019s unity, integrity and interests has been Congress\u2019 way of working for 75 years and counting,\u201d he tweeted citing a media report.",
    "Also on Monday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also criticised the DMK and Congress on the Katchatheevu island row, saying the two parties \u201chave approached this matter as though they have no responsibility for it\u201d.",
    "While addressing a press conference in Delhi, Jaishankar said, \u201cIn the last 20 years, 6,184 Indian fishermen have been detained by Sri Lanka and 1,175 Indian fishing vessels have been seized, detained or apprehended. This is the background of the issue that we are discussing\u201d.",
    "\u201cIn the last five years, the Katchatheevu issue and the fisherman\u2019s issue have been repeatedly raised by various parties in Parliament. It has come up in parliament questions, debates and in the consultative committee. The then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu has written to me numerous times. And my record shows that to the current Chief Minister, I have replied 21 times on this issue. This is not an issue which has suddenly surfaced. This is a live issue,\u201d he added.",
    "He said that although the matter has been \u201cthe subject of correspondence between the union government and the state government... every political party in Tamil Nadu has taken a position on this.",
    "\u201cTwo parties, the Congress and the DMK, have approached this matter as though they have no responsibility for it. As though the situation is for today\u2019s Central government to resolve, there is no history to this,\u201d Jaishankar added.",
    "The External Affairs Minister further claimed that \u201cwe know who did this, what we don\u2019t know is who hid it. We believe that the public has the right to know how this situation came up\u201d.",
    "\u201cThis issue has been hidden too long from the gaze of the public. The fishermen are still being detained today, boats are still being apprehended, and the issue is still being raised in Parliament. It is being raised in Parliament by two parties who did it,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWhenever there was an arrest, how do you think they were released? It is very good to give statements from Chennai, but the people who do the work are us.\u201d",
    "The Prime Minister\u2019s remarks on Sunday led to criticism from both the Congress and DMK.",
    "While Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge asked if the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre took any steps to resolve the issue and take back the island, the DMK said the BJP was busy playing blame games with the Opposition and alleged it was \u201cafraid\u201d to campaign on its achievements."
