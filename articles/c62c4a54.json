    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s presidential election will be held in 2024 regardless of legal challenges, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "The President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) quoted Wickremesinghe as saying that parliamentary elections and provincial councils will follow the presidential poll.",
    "He made this remark at the funeral of former opposition leader and leader of the Tami National Alliance (TNA) R Sampanthan in Trincomalee on Sunday July 07.",
    "\u201cIt is declared necessary to hold provincial council elections. However, we have discussed and decided to hold the presidential election first. Regardless of any legal challenges, the presidential election will be held this year. Following that, parliamentary elections will be conducted, and then provincial council elections will be held,\u201d the PMD quoted the president as saying.",
    "Last week, Wickremesinghe said he believes the president\u2019s term is five years, expressing his support for holding the presidential election in 2024 and disavowing a case filed in the Supreme Court seeking a verdict stating that a president\u2019s term is six years.",
    "\u201cIt has come to my attention that Chamindra Dayan Lenawa has filed an application in the Supreme Court, arguing that Article 30(2) should not be considered amended by Section 3 of the 19th Amendment. He requests the Court to declare that the President\u2019s term is six years and to issue an interim order stopping the Election Commission from conducting the Presidential Election in 2024 until a decision is made. Lenawa did not consult me or my lawyers before filing,\u201d Wickremesinghe said in a tweet Thursday July 04 afternoon.",
    "\u201cI firmly believe that the President\u2019s term is five years, and I support the Election Commission\u2019s steps to hold the Presidential Election in 2024,\u201d he said.",
    "Lenawa, an entrepreneur, submitted the petition to the Supreme Court requesting an interpretation of the tenure of the incumbent president according to Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution.",
    "According to media reports, the petitioner has sought a clarification on the exact duration of the president\u2019s term and an interim order to delay the upcoming presidential election until said interpretation is issued. (Colombo/Jul08/2024)"
