    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Ratnapura District MP Thalatha Athukorala has informed parliament that she will be resigning from her position as a Member of Parliament.",
    "She made the announcement while delivering a statement in Parliament today (21).",
    "Thalatha Athukorala, the sister of the late United National Party (UNP) politician Gamini Athukorala, first entered Parliament in 2004.",
    "She has been re-elected in subsequent general elections in 2010, 2015, and 2020 from the Ratnapura District.",
    "In the 2020 general election, she secured her seat in Parliament as a member of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) with 45,105 votes from the Ratnapura District.",
    "Delivering her special statement in parliament today, Athukorala said the following:",
    "\u201cThis is a very emotional moment for me. On one side, our \u2018mother party\u2019 - the United National Party has split into two. Both the leader and former deputy leader of that party have become political enemies. Both are vying to become president. At a time when everyone is trying to unite, I cannot wholeheartedly agree with the decision for our camp to divide and contest separately.\u201d",
    "\u201cI believe that the decision for the two leaders to separate and contest is a selfish political decision taken without thinking about the future of the country.\u00a0 History will prove that in the near future. If I continue to remain silent about it, I will also become an indirect contributor to that sin.\u201d",
    "\u201cI will never stop my political journey and I will say that with pride and courage at this moment.\u00a0 I have no regrets of leaving my position as an MP. Today, I am facing that crucial moment and this is the first time I am informing this to the parliament.\u201d",
    "\u201cI do not wish for the party to split even though I won as a candidate of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, I still continue to think whether the decision we took back then without thinking about the future was the correct decision.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe thought of whether I contributed to the division of our great party makes me feel sadder than the happiness of the MP position I gained.\u201d"
