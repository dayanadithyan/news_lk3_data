    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka may end the practice of supermarkets giving free shopping bags, as part of efforts to contain plastic use according to deliberations at a parliamentary committee following a supreme court decision.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s courts many years ago barred supermarkets from charging for plastic bags from customers after activists went to court.",
    "However a Supreme Court ruled in March this year to overturn that.",
    "The parliament Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development said it could not reverse the gazette issued under the Consumer Affairs Authority Act until it had received a copy of the ruling.",
    "The committee said the ruling might prompt shoppers to bring their own bags, which would lead to a reduction in polythene waste.",
    "It may only apply to supermarkets and not to smaller merchants, however. (Colombo/May18/2024)"
