    "\u201cWe will establish the Sri Lanka Institute of Strategic Studies, which will offer military tactics education to those in the armed services, retirees, and civilians,\u201d Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by his media division.",
    "\u201cInterested individuals can participate in these programs. This initiative will coincide with the on-going restructuring of the security force.\u201d The President was speaking at the inauguration of the headquarters complex of the Sri Lanka Ex-Servicemen\u2019s Association, \u2018Home of Veterans,\u2019 in Battaramulla.",
    "The president said it was undeniable that retirees bore the brunt of the challenges during the recent \u2018difficult period\u2019. \u201cWe need to explore what concessions can be offered to each sector.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve also directed our attention towards those who are retiring from service. It\u2019s crucial for them to explore avenues for creating new sources of income. Regrettably, some have opted to seek opportunities in Russia due to the lack of opportunities domestically.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s imperative that individuals, according to their capabilities, are provided opportunities to earn a sustainable income, whether within the country or abroad.\u201d Wickremesinghe said the Ministry of Defence and the Ranaviru Seva Authority would collaborate on proposing a special program to address this.",
    "Sri Lanka needs to focus on the future of the armed forces and national security, the President said. \u201cA separate advisory committee has been appointed to develop the necessary security program through 2030.\u201d",
    "\u201cBy 2030, we must be prepared to address emerging national security challenges. The responsibilities of the Tri-forces should be clearly defined and the country\u2019s resources should be utilized according to a well-structured plan.",
    "\u201cThe establishment of the National Security Council, as highlighted in the Easter Sunday commission, is essential and will be legalized along with the appointment of the Armed Forces Committee.",
    "\u201cWhile we currently face economic difficulties, we are confident in our ability to recover within the next two years.",
    "\u201cOur retiring military personnel possess unique skills and talents. As the country\u2019s economy continues to develop, it\u2019s essential to offer them new avenues for growth. Today, we have the chance to foster economic development thanks to the sacrifices made by the war heroes of the past.",
    "\u201cJust as in times of war, where swift strategic action is imperative to achieve victory, we must adopt a similar approach in revitalizing our economy.",
    "\u201cJust as in times of war, where prolonging conflict is deemed detrimental and strategic resolution (Shock treatment) is imperative, we must apply similar principles to both warfare and economic development.",
    "\u201cThe economic growth resulting from these initiatives holds promise for enhancing people\u2019s income. I extend my gratitude to all retirees for their steadfast efforts and wish the Ex-Servicemen a prosperous future.\u201d (Colombo/May22/2024)"
