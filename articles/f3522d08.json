    "Sri Lanka\u2019s President Ranil Wickremesinghe has expressed admiration for India\u2019s digital achievements, citing it as a model worth emulating. Speaking at a conference on Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in Colombo, President Wickremesinghe emphasised the need for collaboration with India, highlighting the potential to save years in development by adopting India\u2019s digital strategies.",
    "\u201cIn implementing it, we needed help, and the best place we could get was India. I spoke with PM Modi when I was in India last year, and as part of our integration, we said, we would like to go with India, you have done so much,\u201d stated President Wickremesinghe, underlining the significance of seeking guidance from India\u2019s experience.",
    "Acknowledging India\u2019s historical contribution, he added, \u201cAnother reason I took India, is it is the country that discovered zero. Where would the world be had India not discovered zero.\u201d Wickremesinghe expressed his intention to mirror India\u2019s digital advancements, tailored to suit Sri Lanka\u2019s needs. \u201cLet us piggyback your experience. It will save us a few years, maybe 4-5 years in development,\u201d he affirmed.",
    "President Wickremesinghe outlined his vision for Sri Lanka\u2019s digital future, emphasising the importance of digital public infrastructure. \u201cWe want to go ahead, I want to implement, I hope we have the support. We have to make the change, we have to join the 21st century. Just as India has done, we have to go ahead and do the same,\u201d he declared.",
    "Highlighting specific initiatives, Wickremesinghe mentioned the introduction of Artificial Intelligence in schools and the establishment of an institutional framework for a digital economy. He also expressed gratitude for India\u2019s assistance in the opening of an IIT branch in Sri Lanka, which will be the third foreign campus of IIT after Tanzania and the UAE.",
    "Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Santosh Jha, underscored the collaborative efforts between the two nations in advancing digital infrastructure.",
    "He referenced to India\u2019s support to the Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity Project (SL-UDI), akin to India\u2019s Aadhaar, as a symbol of this partnership. \u201cBoth leaders agreed to leverage India\u2019s DPI in accordance with Sri Lanka\u2019s requirements and priorities, towards efficient delivery of citizen-centric services,\u201d explained Jha.",
    "Jha further emphasised India\u2019s commitment to supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s digital transformation, noting the inclusion of DPI in bilateral joint statements and vision documents. The conference was organised by the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka\u2019s Ministry of Technology."
