    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s claim that he alone took on the responsibility of stabilising the economy is valid, according to opposition MP Patali Champika Ranawaka who said the president now faces the challenge of restructuring external debt by June.",
    "\u201c[President Wickremesinghe] said \u2018I have a bigger responsibility than holding elections. I have the responsibility of restructuring the country\u2019s debt and stabilising the economy\u2019. Now he has a challenge facing him. Domestic debt was restructured last year. He now has the challenge of restructuring external debt before June,\u201d Ranawaka said speaking at an event on Sunday March 31.",
    "\u201cIf he said local government elections would not be held because the economy has to be stabilised, he now has to restructure the debt before June. His responsibility i restructuring external debt by June and stabilising the country. That\u2019s why he said \u201cI took on this responsibility, no one else did\u201d. All true. We expect him to fulfill his next obligation,\u201d he said.",
    "The opposition MP said that whoever wins Sri Lanka\u2019s next presidential election will definitely dissolve parliament and hold parliamentary elections no sooner than he or she is elected.",
    "\u201cIf there is a president in October, there will be an election in November,\u201d he said.",
    "Ranawaka made similar remarks previous week, when he said President Wickremesinghe must decide between sending the Rajapaksas back to parliament and restructuring debt by June to stabilise the country for the next decade.",
    "Speaking to reporters, Ranawaka said Basil Rajapaksa, the ideologue of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), is well aware that his party cannot come into power through the presidential due to be held between September 17 and October 17 this year.",
    "\u201cBasil knows the Rajapaksas can\u2019t come into power again through this election, so he\u2019s trying to see if they can somehow hold a general election before that and enter parliament,\u201d said Ranawaka.",
    "\u201cThe president must decide what\u2019s important, whether to send five Rajapaksas to parliament or to speak to our creditors and restructure our external debt by June and stabilise the country for the next decade,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Apr01/2024)"
