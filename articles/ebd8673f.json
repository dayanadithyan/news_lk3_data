    "LOLC Divi Saviya has successfully completed Phase 03 of its education initiative, impacting 4,100 schools across Sri Lanka. This milestone achievement extends the program\u2019s reach to 40% of the entire school system endorsing LOLC\u2019s commitment to supporting the educational needs of students nationwide.",
    "Reflecting on the journey so far, Kapila Jayawardena, Group Managing Director/CEO of LOLC Holdings PLC, remarked, \u201cThis program was launched at a critical time when Sri Lankan families were grappling with the aftermath of an economic crisis and the pandemic, which created immense economic and social challenges. Many parents, struggling with rising costs, could no longer afford essential school supplies, forcing difficult decisions within households. In some cases, families with multiple children could only send one child to school due to financial constraints. As school attendance rates plummeted, small schools in rural villages faced the threat of closure due to declining student numbers and a lack of resources.\u201d",
    "Jayawardena continued, \u201cDuring this time of great need, LOLC  Divi Saviya emerged as a crucial support system for the education sector. The initiative provided a lifeline to countless families and students. Divi Saviya strengthened the educational landscape by enhancing student attendance, sparking renewed interest in studies, and alleviating the financial burden on parents. For many children, the program restored a sense of normalcy and pride. Students no longer felt the disparity of using inadequate materials or being left behind, as all their peers had access to the same high-quality books and tools. This sense of equality fostered a more inclusive and engaging classroom environment. The initiative has reinstated faith in education and created a lasting positive ripple effect for many in the years to come.\u201d",
    "Earlier this year, the Ministry of Education honoured LOLC with national recognition, marking the first time a private sector entity has received such acknowledgment in the educational arena. LOLC is immensely proud to be part of this transformative journey and is humbled to be a Sri Lankan company dedicated to supporting the next generation, ensuring that every child has the opportunity to thrive in their studies.",
