    "(Reuters) - The United States topped the medals table at the Paris Olympics with 40 golds after the final title was decided on Sunday, finishing above China only by virtue of their 44 silvers.",
    "China, who were the last team apart from the U.S. to top the standings when they did it on home soil at the 2008 Beijing Games, also won 40 golds but managed only 27 silvers.",
    "The U.S. women\u2019s basketball team secured their country\u2019s pre-eminence by edging host nation France in a breathless finish to win the final gold of the Games. The U.S. also won most total medals with 126 to China\u2019s 91.",
    "France won 16 golds to finish fifth on the table and their total tally of 64 medals was their best for more than a century."
