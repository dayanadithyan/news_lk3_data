    "The Presidential Candidate of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP), Anura Kumara Dissanayake says that steps will be taken under his government to expand the country\u2019s economy.",
    "Dissanayake made these comments while addressing a public rally held in the Mahaiyawa area of Kandy.",
    "He further added that the country\u2019s economy is currently constrained and lacking in growth.",
    "He also stated that they are committed to expanding the economy and developing a society that works in all its assigned areas, including significant improvements in education.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s the country... do you not want a country like that? That is what we are leading,\u201d he said, adding that it is not something an \u2018immature\u2019 individual like Sajith Premadasa can accomplish.",
    "Dissanayake also accused Premadasa of making promises about what he will give people wherever he goes.",
    "\u201cIf someone like him were in your village, would you elect them to the local council? No, right? Ranil Wickramasinghe always makes fun of him. Think about this... postal voting took place on 4, 5 and 6. On (September) 03, they say that salaries will be increased. Isn\u2019t that a mockery?\u201d he questioned.",
    "The NPP leader further said that after attending a rally in Yapahuwa, Sajith had made promises about distributing Muriate of Potash (Bandi Pohora) fertilizer for free after the SJB\u2019s victory in September.",
    "However, with the Yala harvest season now already over, it is considered too late for \u2018Bandi Pohora\u2019, which is actually required in February. \u201cHe will be at home by then.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe are ready to take over the country...to recover the country,\u201d he said."
