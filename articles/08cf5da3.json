    "The official also defended Riyadh\u2019s response, saying: \u201cThe state did not fail, but there was a misjudgment on the part of people who did not appreciate the risks.\u201d",
    "The Saudi health minister, Fahd Al-Jalajel, on Sunday described management of the Hajj this year as \u201csuccessful,\u201d SPA reported.",

    "For the past several years, the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.",
    "The timing of the Hajj moves forward about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year, it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.",
    "A 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for Hajj pilgrims will exceed the \u201cextreme danger threshold\u201d from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \u201cwith increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses.\u201d",
    "Hajj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals by lottery.",
