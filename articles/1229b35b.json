    "Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella has been remanded until 15 February on the orders of Maligakanda Magistrate\u2019s Court.",
    "The current Environment Minister was produced before the court this morning (Feb.03).",
    "The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested the lawmaker on Friday (Feb.02) in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). He had made an appearance before the CID on Friday morning, complying with a court order issued yesterday and was grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested.",
    "On 01 February, the Maligakanda Magistrate ordered the former health minister to record a statement with the CID on Friday as he had failed to do so on Wednesday. Further, a foreign travel ban was also imposed on him.",
    "Pressure has been mounting from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, calling for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker.",
    "In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests.",
    "The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India and imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having a hand in this fraudulent activity and communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. It was also found that funds amounting to Rs. 130 million were misappropriated through the unlawful procurement of 22,500 vials of IVIG.",
    "Seven suspects including former Secretary to the Ministry of Health Janaka Chandragupta were later arrested in connection with the scam, but the fifth accused in the case was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministry\u2019s Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, are now in custody on remand.",
    "After the human immunoglobulin scandal came to light, Rambukwella was stripped of health ministerial portfolio and was appointed as the Environment Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle in October. Dr. Ramesh Pathirana was appointed as the Health Minister in addition to his current portfolio as Minister of Industries."
