    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings said it was confirming an A-(lka) rating on Sri Lanka\u2019s National Development Bank Plc with a Stable outlook, amid an improvement in operating environment, indicated by headline macroeconomic indicators.",
    "Fitch said it expects Sri Lanka\u2019s stabilising macroeconomic environment to support NDB\u2019s ability to generate and defend business volumes, but its business profile remains constrained by risks in the domestic operating environment which are still elevated.",
    "\u201cWe expect NDB to benefit from the resumption in lending, albeit modest, thereby leading to an uptick in the share of net loans in total assets (end-1Q24: 57.5%), similar to peers.\u201d",
    "NDB\u2019s risk profil remains tied to the credit and market risk of the sovereign, through its substantial exposure via the defaulted foreign-currency-denominated sovereign bonds (end-2023: 6.5% of assets) and a further 25.6% of assets in rupee-denominated treasury securities, the rating agency said.",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 22 Jul 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based National Development Bank PLC (NDB) National Long-Term Rating at \u2018A-(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed NDB\u2019s Sri Lankan rupeedenominated proposed and outstanding subordinated debt at \u2018BBB(EXP)(lka)\u2019 and \u2018BBB(lka)\u2019, respectively.",
    "Intrinsic Profile Drives Rating: NDB\u2019s National Long-Term Rating reflects its own financial strength, which is highly influenced by its exposure to the sovereign\u2019s weak credit profile (Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): RD; LongTerm Local-Currency IDR: CCC-) and the ongoing sovereign debt restructuring, which had been putting pressure on NDB\u2019s credit profile. The rating also reflects NDB\u2019s modest domestic franchise as Sri Lanka\u2019s sixth-largest commercial bank.",
    "Stabilising OE: Sri Lankan banks\u2019 operating environment (OE) continues to show signs of stabilisation, as evident in sustained improvements in reported headline macroeconomic indicators, supporting the recovery in banks\u2019 operational flexibility.",
    "Further improvement to the banks\u2019 OE remains contingent on successful execution of the sovereign\u2019s external debt-restructuring exercise alongside the restoration of the sovereign\u2019s creditworthiness, given the strong link between sovereign financial health and banks\u2019 operating conditions.",
    "Economic Recovery Spurs Lending: Fitch expects Sri Lanka\u2019s stabilising macroeconomic environment to support NDB\u2019s ability to generate and defend business volumes, but its business profile remains constrained by risks in the domestic OE which are still elevated. We expect NDB to benefit from the resumption in lending, albeit modest, thereby leading to an uptick in the share of net loans in total assets (end-1Q24: 57.5%), similar to peers.",
    "Exposure to Sovereign Risks: NDB\u2019s risk profile, similar to peers, remains tied to the credit and market risk of the sovereign, through its substantial exposure via the defaulted foreign-currency-denominated sovereign bonds (end-2023: 6.5% of assets) and a further 25.6% of assets in rupee-denominated treasury securities. These exposures make the bank vulnerable to the sovereign\u2019s repayment capacity and liquidity position. NDB has the",
    "third-highest exposure to sovereign bonds, as a share of total assets, among local banks.",
    "Asset Quality in Focus: NDB\u2019s impaired (stage 3) loans ratio of nearly 17% at end-1Q24 (2023: 16.6%) is one of the highest among the large Fitch-rated Sri Lankan banks. Fitch expects this ratio to decrease in the near- to medium-term alongside focused recoveries, buttressed by the improvement in borrower repayment capacity and Fitch\u2019s anticipated expansion in the bank\u2019s loan book. Asset quality is burdened further by its large exposure",
    "Risks to Profitability Abate: We believe downside risks to NDB\u2019s profitability have largely eased, even in the event of incremental credit costs from the restructuring of sovereign bonds if this results in the need for moderately higher provisions than already assumed. NDB\u2019s core profitability metric \u2013 operating profit/risk-weighted assets \u2013 dipped to 1.8% in 1Q24 (2023: 2.3%). However, we expect this to improve in the medium term on account of a lower credit-cost burden relative to prior years which could outweigh the pressure on net interest margins.",
    "Sovereign Risk Pressures Capital: The bank\u2019s regulatory common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio improved to 12.5% by end-1Q24 but remains one of the lowest among the large Fitch-rated Sri Lankan banks. Capital buffers remain under pressure, particularly from sovereign risks, given the bank\u2019s exposure to defaulted sovereign bonds and the rupee-denominated government securities, in addition to capital-impairment risks on its loan book.",
    "Funding and Liquidity Risks Ease: The foreign- and local-currency funding and liquidity stresses are less severe relative to the height of the crisis period, due to more favourable external sector flows and the bank\u2019s focus on liquidity preservation. We believe these developments have reduced the risk of bank failure. However, NDB\u2019s funding and liquidity profile \u2013 particularly in foreign currency \u2013 remains susceptible to sudden changes in creditor sentiment driven by adverse changes to the sovereign\u2019s credit profile, similar to peers.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "The bank\u2019s National Rating is sensitive to a change in its creditworthiness relative to other Sri Lankan issuers.",
    "A deterioration in NDB\u2019s key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers would also lead to increased pressure on the rating, which is driven by its intrinsic financial strength.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "Positive rating action on the sovereign may lead to an upgrade in the rating. A sustained improvement in its key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers, could also lead to an upgrade.",
    "OTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: KEY RATING DRIVERS SUBORDINATED DEBT",
    "NDB\u2019s Sri Lankan rupee-denominated outstanding and proposed subordinated debt is rated two notches below the National Long-Term Rating anchor. This reflects Fitch\u2019s baseline notching for loss severity for this type of debt, and our expectations of poor recoveries. There is no additional notching for non-performance risks, as the notes do not incorporate going-concern loss-absorption features.",
    "The subordinated debt ratings will move in tandem with the bank\u2019s National Long-Term Rating.",
