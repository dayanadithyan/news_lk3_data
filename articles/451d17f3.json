    "Accordingly, the approval is to be granted for \u201cStarlink\u201d to provide satellite-based internet services in Sri Lanka, following a formal public consultation process, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) said.",
    "The details of the public consultation will be published tomorrow (07), according to the PMD.",
    "Sri Lanka fast-tracked the approval process after Musk met with President Ranil Wickremesinghe last month in Indonesia on the sidelines of the 10th World Water Forum.",
    "Musk and Wickremesinghe had discussed ways to expand internet connectivity in rural Sri Lanka and potential collaboration on renewable energy.",

    "Starlink can provide internet access to virtually any location on Earth with a constellation of LEO satellites that can be re-positioned at any point, and according to experts, reliable internet access is possible, whether the user operates in the Congo, the Arctic, or on an oil rig located hundreds of miles offshore.",
    "So far, Starlink has more than 02 million active customers and is available on all seven continents and in over 60 countries."
