    "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa levelled accusations against President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday, alleging that the appointment of Senior DIG Deshabandu Tennekoon as the Inspector General of Police was done in violation of the Constitution and without the necessary approval from the Constitutional Council.",
    "Contrary to reports suggesting that the Constitutional Council had sanctioned Tennekoon\u2019s appointment, Premadasa dismissed the assertions.",
    "Taking to X (formerly Twitter) Premadasa said the Constitutional Council has not duly approved Tennekoon\u2019s nomination as the IGP.",
    "Premadasa said that during the Constitutional Council\u2019s deliberations, four votes were cast in favour of Tennekoon, while two votes were against, and two members abstained. He highlighted that for the Constitutional Council to reach a conclusive decision, at least five votes are necessary. Premadasa further noted that the Speaker is not entitled to vote unless it\u2019s to break a tie.",
    "\u201c4/2 is not a tie! The Constitution is being blatantly violated for the second time. Shame on you, speaker!\u201d Premadasa said."
