    "In a temporary leadership shift within the Tamil National People\u2019s Front (TNPF), General Secretary Selvarajah Kajendran has assumed the leadership and administrative responsibilities of the political party headed by MP Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam. According to sources, this move follows the departure of Ponnambalam, who is currently undergoing medical treatment abroad.",
    "Due to a health concern, Ponnambalam has been unable to attend Parliamentary sessions in recent times. Consequently, he recently requested and was granted a three-month leave from parliamentary duties, starting 2 July, as proposed by chief Opposition whip Lakshman Kiriella.",
    "A party spokesperson said that while Ponnambalam is receiving treatment in Australia, the party\u2019s political activities will continue undisturbed under the temporary leadership of Kajendran.",
    "In recent times, the party has called on the country\u2019s Tamil community to boycott the upcoming Presidential polls. The TNPF has urged Tamils to abstain from voting until their aspirations are addressed.",
    "In a statement on 5 June, Ponnambalam claimed the Sri Lankan Government views the Tamil homeland as hostile.",
    "\u201cThey continue with Buddhisation, militarisation, and structural genocide in our homeland. As long as they maintain majority control, they will treat Tamils not as citizens, but as adversaries,\u201d he said.",
    "The TNPF emphasised that boycotting the election would send a strong message to the Government, demonstrating that the Tamils reject participation under current conditions.",
    "The TNPF outlined two possible paths for resolving the island\u2019s ethnic conflict: either suppressing the Tamils and forcing them to abandon their pursuit of a political solution, or honestly addressing the situation and offering a permanent political resolution."
