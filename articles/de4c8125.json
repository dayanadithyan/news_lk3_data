    "Presidential aspirant Wickremesinghe\u2019s recent appeal to Sri Lankans to vote for the Gas Cylinder symbol, with the ominous warning that failure to do so will result in long queues for essentials, reflects a troubling mindset.",
    "This statement, which seems to equate the temporary resolution of gas shortages with his qualification to lead the nation, is out of touch and a poor Marcom strategy. It suggests that Wickremesinghe and his advisors believe that merely avoiding crises is enough to secure the presidency, ignoring the deeper, more pressing needs of the country.",
    "Wickremesinghe\u2019s approach is similar to his previous attempts to appeal to the masses with shallow gestures, such as his infamous offer of chewing gum to farmers, a tone-deaf proposal that highlighted his disconnection from the realities of rural life.",
    "Just as farmers chew betel not out of poverty but tradition, Sri Lankans are not beggars grateful for scraps of normalcy. They deserve a leader who understands their aspirations and struggles.",
    "Many leaders have had their time\u2014decades in fact\u2014to prove their leadership capabilities. Yet, the country finds itself in a state of political and economic uncertainty that these veterans are ill-equipped to navigate. It\u2019s difficult to see how these political veterans could move the country forward with the same old faces rallying around .",
    "At some point, every leader must recognize when it\u2019s time to step aside and let a new generation take over. This isn\u2019t just about age; it\u2019s about the need for fresh perspectives and new ideas in a nation yearning for transformation.",
    "Today, it\u2019s not uncommon to see political meetings filled with people who have been paid to attend or lured by empty promises.",
    "Wickramasinghe probably knows, as does the rest of the country, that the real contest lies between Sajith and Anura, both of whom have yet to be given a fair chance at governing. Wickremesinghe\u2019s candidacy appears designed to siphon votes from Sajith, which seems unfair as both these candidates are committed to fighting corruption, at least on paper \u2014something Wickramasinghe is unable to guarantee in his campaign preceded by action during his tenure.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that Wickremesinghe has never won a Presidential election outright. In previous races, he fielded other candidates, and when Sajith faced the formidable campaign against Gotabaya Rajapaksa, it was against the backdrop of an unpopular atmosphere left behind by Maithripala/Wickremesinghe Government.",
    "Sri Lanka was brought to this point by a series of events that could have been managed better by any competent leader. The chaos under Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s administration, aggravated by poor advice from so called \u2018 indispensable officials and non-experts\u2019, left the country reeling.",
    "While Wickremesinghe may well claim credit for restoring some semblance of normalcy, the reality is that the country would have eventually stabilized to where it is now regardless of who was in charge as officials have done quite a lot of work.",
    "VFS fiasco was bad enough. The situation is dire, and even basic rights, like obtaining a passport to seek employment abroad\u2014a crucial source of foreign exchange for Sri Lanka\u2014are being denied due to administrative failures.",
    "Information Department says the arrears of pawn advances expanded by a staggering 172 percent from Rs.210 billion in 2019 to Rs.571 billion in March this year, driven by the economic crisis.",
    "As the country looks to the future, it\u2019s clear that whoever comes to power will bring new hope, but massive challenges lie ahead, requiring significant sacrifices from all quarters. The masses will accept this if the leaders set the example\u2014not with leaders for instance, who require long entourage or choppers when traveling at a time the main theme of the election is \u2018 fighting corruption\u2019 more than\u00a0 \u2018 Salary Increases\u2019.",
    "Many question why Wickremesinghe could not attempt at least a symbolic cleanup within the system, or a single action of rejecting support expressed from Rajapaksa defectors to contest elections without relying on traditional political rhetoric.",
