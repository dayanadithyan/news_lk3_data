    "(CNN) - The world\u2019s oceans have now experienced an entire year of unprecedented heat, with a new temperature record broken every day, new data shows.",
    "Global ocean surface temperatures started breaking daily records in mid-March last year, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the University of Maine\u2019s Climate Reanalyzer, fueling concerns for marine life and extreme weather across the planet.",
    "\u201cThe amplitude by which previous sea surface temperature records were beaten in 2023, and now again in 2024, is remarkable,\u201d said Joel Hirschi, associate head of marine systems modeling at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK.",
    "Global average ocean temperatures in 2023 were 0.25 degrees Celsius warmer than the previous year, said Gregory C. Johnson, a NOAA oceanographer. That rise is \u201cis equivalent to about two decades\u2019 worth of warming in a single year,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cSo it is quite large, quite significant, and a bit surprising.\u201d",
    "Scientists have said ocean heat is being supercharged by human-caused global warming, boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate pattern marked by higher-than-average ocean temperatures."
