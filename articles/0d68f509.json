    "Speaking to the media in Anuradhapura, Deshapriya emphasized that delaying the election was wrong, and the court\u2019s acknowledgment of this fact is an important step toward justice.",
    "Furthermore, Deshapriya said he believes that the Local Government Election will be held after the 2024 presidential election.",
    "He also noted, \u201cThis decision is not surprising, as the Supreme Court has consistently ruled that postponing or failing to hold elections violates the rights of the people. I see this as justice finally being served, albeit delayed.\u201d",
