    "Held recently at the Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa, the issuer forum titled \u201cRedefining the Trajectory of Your Business\u201d, provided guidance on exploring effective capital-raising avenues, specifically through listing on the Empower and Diri Savi Boards, which offer dedicated listing platforms for SMEs, focusing on sectors like agribusinesses, livestock, energy generation, ICT, and tourism-related ventures. Industry experts, investment advisors, CSE representatives, and representatives of USAID\u2019s CATALYZE Sri Lanka Private Sector Development Activity led panel discussions and interactive sessions.",
    "\u201cUSAID\u2019s goal for SMEs is to unlock opportunities for growth, innovation, and sustainability, paving the way for economic development that benefits everyone,\u201d said Dennis Wesner, deputy director of USAID\u2019s office of Economic Growth. \u201cForums like this are important for educating SMEs about the available capital resources.\u201d",
    "Addressing the gathering, Rajeeva Bandaranaike, CEO of CSE, said, \u201cThe decision to pursue a listing on the stock exchange marks a significant milestone in the life of any company. Going public is not just about raising capital or enhancing liquidity\u2014it\u2019s about unlocking potential, fuelling innovation, and creating value for shareholders, employees, and society at large. It will be a transformative path which starts with a fundamental shift in mindsets.\u201d",
    "Conducting a session on \u2018Capital Mobilization through the CSE\u2019, Niroshan De Silva, Assistant Vice President of Research, Capital Alliance Limited, stated, \u201cSri Lankan SMEs are the backbone of our economy, but many face challenges in accessing growth capital. Listing on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) provides a unique opportunity to address this very need. By going public, SMEs can tap into new sources of capital, allowing for significant expansion and innovation.\u201d",
    "He went on to say, \u201cThe CSE also facilitates price discovery, providing a fair market value for existing investors. Additionally, the listing process fosters good corporate governance practices, building trust and transparency for all stakeholders. In short, a vibrant SME sector on the CSE will benefit not only the businesses themselves, but also the Sri Lankan capital market by fostering innovation, diversification, and a culture of strong corporate governance.\u201d",
