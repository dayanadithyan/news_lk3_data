    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is trying to help citizens said to be working for mercenary companies linked to Russia and Ukraine, through diplomatic and non-diplomatic means, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Sabry said.",
    "\u201cWe are trying to see what we can do where ever possible,\u201d Sabry told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe can deal with the government of any other country.",
    "\u201cWe are being asked to deal with a mercenary group which is not a formal government. It\u2019s a very difficult task.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Foreign Ministry does not have data on the number of Sri Lankans fighting as mercenaries for Russia or Ukraine.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Minister Sabry told reporters. \u201cNone of them go through formal or official channels. They don\u2019t register themselves either with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment or with the foreign ministry consular division or the Sri Lankan embassy.",
    "Al-Jazeera news reported in March that at least two Sri Lankan ex-soldiers have been killed fighting for Russia and three fighting for Ukraine.",
    "Some have claimed that they were hired for auxiliary services, but were then sent to the frontline.",
    "Opposition legislator Dayasiri Jayasekera told parliament last month that he had information that ex-Sri Lanka soldiers were hired though India-based recruiters.",
    "Mercenaries can earn high salaries in foreign exchange at a time when Sri Lanka is going through an economic crisis after trying to boost inflation and growth through aggressive macro-economic policy (rate cuts and tax cuts).",
    "Minister Sabry said in his view they had \u201cdone a huge blunder and a mistake\u201d by becoming mercenaries.",
    "\u201cBut they are Sri Lankan citizens,\u201d Sabry said. \u201cWe have a responsibility as a state to see the maximum we can do.\u201d (Colombo/May8/2024)"
