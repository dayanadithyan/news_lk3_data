    "Consolidating its efforts to empower farmers and ensure the nation\u2019s food security, Sri Lanka\u2019s leading private sector bank, HNB PLC, launched a comprehensive support system under the HNB Leasing Govi Saviya campaign.",
    "\u201cWe are thrilled to launch the \u2018HNB Leasing Govi Saviya\u2019 initiative alongside our partners, reaffirming our commitment to every Sri Lankan, from the individual farmer to the large corporations. With nearly half of our nation\u2019s land dedicated to agriculture yet contributing only 6.5% to the GDP, it\u2019s evident that there\u2019s a vast opportunity for growth.",
    "Many farmers rely on ancient practices with no access to modernization and financial resources. HNB Leasing Govi Saviya aims to bridge this gap and address any challenges they may face with targeted support backed by innovative financial solutions.\u00a0Our collaboration with microfinance officers and leading agricultural companies is crucial as it allows us to understand and meet unique needs.",
    "It allows us the opportunity to offer a comprehensive toolkit for enhancing productivity and ensuring food security. We understand that agriculture plays a pivotal role in our economy and the well-being of our people. This initiative marks a significant step towards establishing a sustainable and thriving agri sector,\u201d HNB DGM \u2013 Wholesale Banking Group, Damith Pallewatte.",
