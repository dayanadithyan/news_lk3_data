    "Leading shipping industry groups have called for action to halt Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea after the sinking of a second ship.",
    "The organisations condemned the incidents as a violation of freedom of navigation and said in a joint statement on Wednesday that they target \u201cinnocent seafarers\u201d.",
    "\u201cThis is an unacceptable situation, and these attacks must stop now,\u201d read the statement from groups including the World Shipping Council, European Community Shipowners\u2019 Associations and Asian Shipowners\u2019 Association.",
    "\u201cWe call for States with influence in the region to safeguard our innocent seafarers and for the swift de-escalation of the situation in the Red Sea.\u201d",
    "Yemen\u2019s Houthi armed group has been launching attacks on shipping lanes in the region since November in what it says is an effort to support Palestinians and pressure Israel to end its war on Gaza.",
    "In response, the United States and its allies have attacked Houthi targets in Yemen since January.",
    "The Houthis, however, have pledged to continue targeting ships if Israel continues to press its war on Gaza. More than 37,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza since October 7, according to Palestinian authorities.",

    "While most of the attacks have not resulted in deaths, an assault on a Barbados-flagged ship killed three sailors in March.",
    "Another attack on a Ukrainian-owned vessel last week set the ship ablaze and severely injured\u00a0 one crew member.",
