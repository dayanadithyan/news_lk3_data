    "The impact of the far-right riots seen across the UK could be felt for \u201cmonths and years to come\u201d, as the UK\u2019s Justice Secretary warned. Far-right violence broke out in towns and cities across the UK in the wake of a stabbing attack that left three girls dead in Southport on Monday 29 July. False rumours were circulated online claiming the suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker who arrived in the UK by boat. This was found to be an outright lie ,which brought together the two tropes driving the modern far right: Islamophobic claims that Muslim men pose a threat to women and girls and manufactured outrage over \u201cfighting age men\u201d arriving in the UK on small boats to live off the taxpayer. Instead, the culprit was a British-born teenager Axel Rudakubana of Rwandan heritage and was since charged with murder and attempted murder. It was the Muslims, Britain\u2019s largest religious minority who were singled out for attack by nativist rioters. This was evidenced by the decision to immediately target mosques. The British government took action to quell the riots and to bring key culprits to book, although belated. But the damage was done.",
    "While the false claims about the Southport killings were specific to that incident, the disinformation being shared was built on years of far-right influencers engaged in rhetorical violence against primarily Muslim migrant people.\u00a0When it was revealed that the individual charged with the Southport murders was a British born teenager, the far-right narrative shifted to maintain its Islamophobic focus. Far right outfit EDL\u2019s co-founder and convicted criminal Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon)\u00a0and others shared disinformation about Muslim men stabbing people in Stoke-on-Trent, giving a new inciting reason for the riots, despite Staffordshire Police confirming there have been no such stabbings. The claim that white Britain is under attack by Muslim men is then used to incite the far-right\u2019s ultimate goal: a genocidal civil war, otherwise known as Day X. Fellow agitator Laurence Fox also tweeted saying \u201cit\u2019s war\u201d and \u201cfor decades British girls have been raped by immigrant barbarians.\u201d That one\u2019s\u00a0been viewed more than 3 million times.",
    "The horrific deaths of the three children had nothing to do with the terrorising of asylum-seeking people and children in hotels, the destruction of black and brown people\u2019s businesses, or the attacks on mosques. The street violence that has gripped much of England and Northern Ireland since 30 July instead tells a story of who the modern far right are, how they organise, what they believe, and the coalition of hard-right politicians, commentators and influencers who have empowered this hateful movement to inflict widespread violence against families fleeing fear.",
    "Following the Southport riot, Reform UK MP Nigel Farage put out a video where he claimed the violence was a reaction to \u201cfear, discomfort, to unease \u2026 I am worried, not just about the events in Southport, but about societal decline that is happening in our country \u2026 this prime minister does not have a clue \u2026 we need to start getting tough \u2026 Because what you\u2019ve seen on the streets of Hartlepool, of London, of Southport, is nothing to what could happen over the next few weeks.\u201d In his video, Farage hints to the far-right trope of Western decline \u2013 an offshoot of the Great Replacement theory. He argues that the government is failing to protect its people. More importantly, he suggests that if the government fails to get \u201ca clue\u201d, it will get worse. The violence, fear and disorder will increase. This is part of the modern far right\u2019s strategy: if the state cannot protect us from inevitable violence, it says, the far-right strongman can.\u00a0The desired outcome of this violence is to create insecurity, fear and anxiety in the general population, which in turn leads to a collapse in faith in democracy and society.",
    "Ironically, in 2021, an infamous government-backed report, the Sewell Commission, claimed that the UK was \u201ca model for other White-majority countries\u201d on issues of race equality. Much to the consternation of many anti-racists, the report found that there was scant evidence of institutional racism in the UK. Only three years later, the credibility of this Report has been called into\u00a0 question ,with the \u201cmodel\u201d country gaining international attention as far-right thugs began intimidating, harassing and attacking people of colour. The UK today is anything but a beacon of equality, with the scapegoating of migrants and people seeking asylum gaining full sponsorship by mainstream political elites and the media ,which pursued hostile environment immigration policies over decades to distract from economic and political failings.",
    "Views on immigration and asylum also influenced many of the rioters, who,\u00a0according to the Hope not Hate advocacy group, at times used the slogan \u201cstop the boats\u201d \u2014 which was adopted by the former Conservative government as it attempted to thwart small boat migration crossings in the Channel. However, angry, Islamophobic resentment that had long brewed across the U.K. came to the surface. According to\u00a0U.K. government data from 2023, no religious group has faced more hate crimes linked to faith than Britain\u2019s Muslims. In the year ending March 2023, more than 4 in 10 of all recorded religious hate crime offenses were targeted against Muslims. Today, Muslims and immigrants, particularly asylum seekers from the Middle East, are two sides of the same problem for the British far right. But this conflation of the two groups has not occurred in a vacuum. Much of the far-right rhetoric about Muslims and migrants has been replicated by at least some mainstream politicians. Just look at the similarities between the language used in the ongoing riots and the rhetoric used by politicians.",
    "In this context, media coverage of the race riots in the UK in its usual double standards approach, need to be criticised\u00a0for focusing on the actions of \u2018protestors\u2019 and \u2018demonstrators\u2019 in British towns and cities rather than labelling them as rioters. The violence on the streets were misrepresented by some sections of the biased Media as representing legitimate frustrations about the\u00a0\u201cdumping of millions of migrants from alien cultures\u201d and\u00a0\u201cuncontrolled, mass immigration\u201d. In fact in one of the talk shows Good Morning Britain, when Zarah Sultana MP, a Muslim politician went on\u00a0 to talk about the Islamaphobic nature of these riots, she was treatment by presenters shabbily and was\u00a0widely criticised\u00a0as patronising, and belittling. It was disgusting that amid much profound anxiety, tension and pain faced by the communities of colour, every effort was being made by certain political and media elites to diminish, and sometimes demonise their concerns.",
    "Politicians have shied away from calling it Islamophobia, instead describing the violence as \u201cfar-right thuggery\u201d and \u201canti-immigration protests\u201d. Islamophobia and anti-immigration sentiment have been par for the course for\u00a0the British far right since the turn of the century. In his\u00a0response to the unrest, Keir Starmer told Muslims: \u201cI will take every step possible to keep you safe.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhatever the apparent motivation \u2026 we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities.\u201d Surely, the \u201capparent motivation\u201d is Islamophobia?",
    "As the police cracked down on the rioters, accusations of \u2018two-tier policing\u2019 \u2013 the false claim that thugs were being harshly treated because they were white \u2013 also began to take hold. In reality, it is ethnic minorities who are subject to racial disparities in the criminal justice system, some are victimised, and due to substantial cuts in legal aid, a number have no assurance of effective redress from authorities. Their playbook is to provoke black and brown communities into violence, which would be captured on film and manipulated as propaganda to falsely suggest that multiculturalism is failing.These images would inevitably make their way onto mainstream TV news, radio discussions, and newspaper columns, twisting the narrative to portray the aggressors as victims.\u00a0\u00a0Elon Musk too himself has fanned the flames by insinuating that the UK is on the verge of civil war.",
    "Is this just the end of the beginning? How can UK end the divisive political rhetoric that fuels intolerance? Is the UK government showing serious concern to address this issue? In this context, as anxieties among Muslim communities grow, it is really sad that the recently elected Labour government too (like its Tory predecessor) shows reluctance to meet with the largest body representing British Muslims and holds credibility among them, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). There appears to be plans afoot to support the creation of a new Muslim group provisionally called the Muslim Leadership Council to act as the primary point of engagement between the government and Muslim communities. \u00a0In doing so, the new government is set to repeat the same mistakes as the previous Labour government in creating bodies that fail to truly represent British Muslims, leading to further distrust.",
    "In the context of increasing Islamophobia and threats from the far-right, the Government needs to engage directly with Muslim communities and their representatives rather than creating a friendly vehicle for themselves. Perhaps both the previous Labour and\u00a0Conservative\u00a0governments heavily funded, and had close ties to, Quilliam Foundation, which was most distrusted by Muslim communities. In fact, Labour\u2019s position on Gaza not only cost the party major seats to independents and slashed their majority in many constituencies but has highlighted the disconnect between the party and Muslim communities.",
    "The vilification of Muslims and their communities has become\u00a0normalised\u00a0by both Labour and Conservative parties, as well as Ukip and Reform UK. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi spoke of Islamophobia having passed the\u00a0\u201cdinner table test\u201d, where ordinary people would say things about Muslims in company with others that they would never say about other minority communities. This is partly the legacy of the Brexit Leave campaign\u2019s\u00a0toxic rhetoric\u00a0on popular views about immigration that continued right up to the recent general election. Over the years, large sections of the public have become receptive to and accepting of Islamophobia (including far-right messages), and of the demonisation of migrants. Politicians of all stripes have enabled this by avoiding explicitly discussing Islamophobia.",
    "In his\u00a0response to the unrest, PM Starmer told Muslims: \u201cI will take every step possible to keep you safe.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhatever the apparent motivation \u2026 we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities.\u201d Surely, the \u201capparent motivation\u201d is Islamophobia? But, Starmer choosing not to use the \u201cI-word\u201d is far from surprising. Acknowledging that Islamophobia exists would mean having to do something about it. And as we know, this has never happened. The consequences of refusing to address (or even acknowledge) Islamophobia are now playing out in towns and cities across the country. The longer politicians pretend that Islamophobia doesn\u2019t exist, the worse the problem will get, and the more permission the far right will feel they have to get away with violence.",
    "As the HRW says, \u2018The new Labour government inherits a country divided, in which the far right is a real and present danger. But to focus solely on the violent disorder is to treat the symptom of a much broader problem. To tackle the threat posed by the far right, the government needs not only to hold to account those spewing dehumanizing rhetoric and address ongoing structural racism and Islamophobia, but also begin to address the many and varied structural issues, including rising inequality and poverty, that are ripe for cynical exploitation to push a xenophobic agenda\u2019.",
    "The \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 effect of far-right discourse on key issues such as immigration in global politics, particularly by \u2018mainstream\u2019 centre right parties has important implications for the future of liberal democracy in global politics. Centre-right parties may have opened up a \u2018Pandora\u2019s box\u2019 and brought the ideology of the far right into the political mainstream. This is a worrying trend that arguably serves to legitimise populist radical right parties by bringing their discourse into the mainstream and therefore making it publicly acceptable amongst voters. Apart from the UK, other recent examples of this \u2018mainstreaming effect\u2019 can be found in Hungary, Poland, the US and Brazil where democratic institutions have been eroded.",
    "Violent Far-Right Movements aren\u2019t however just a \u2018Western Problem\u2019. The stark rise of far-right violent extremism has correlated with a rise in populist narratives and challenges to pluralist democracies in many states, including the Global South for example India and even Sri Lanka. Histories of tension with minorities and colonial pasts have often been exploited for political gain and parties in power have had to reckon with established religious political parties in order to secure majority rule, thus risking the institutionalization of exclusionary ethno-nationalist religious narratives.\u00a0It is time for the UN and other international institutions, including those dealing with terrorism and violent extremism, to recognize the global nature of the far-right threat and meaningfully address terrorism \u201cin all its forms and manifestations,\u201d translating that rhetoric so often used in resolutions and meetings into meaningful action."
