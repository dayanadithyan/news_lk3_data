    "Three of the four MPs of the All-Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) have expressed their support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the next month\u2019s election.",
    "They are MP for Digamadulla District Attorney at Law S.M.M. Muszhaaraff, MP for Puttalam District Ali Sabri Rahim and Anuradhapura District MP Ishaq Rahuman who came from SJB ticket.",
    "Muszhaaraff said: \u201cAlthough ACMC leader and MP Rishad Bathiudeen has stated his support for Sajith Premadasa, the Muslim community is backing President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The leader of our party claimed that their decision was based on consultations with people across the country. We, however, dispute this claim.\u201d",
    "The MP also stated that President Ranil Wickremesinghe will have the support of the Muslim community, regardless of the decisions made by party leaders.",
    "The MP also noted that Sajith Premadasa failed to conduct a proper investigation into Rishad Bathiudeen while he was in prison, treating him as if he was a member of a different party."
