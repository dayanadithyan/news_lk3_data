    "The Kaduwela District Court yesterday issued an enjoining order prohibiting any individual or group from obstructing the newly appointed Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Chairperson Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa, and Acting Secretary Keerthi Udawatta, from performing their duties within the party.",
    "Judge Dulani Wickramasooriya of the Kaduwela District Court issued these enjoining orders during a case brought forward by SLFP Executive Committee members Isuru Abeywardena and Sumith Wijayamuni de Soysa, who named 20 Executive Committee members as respondents.",
    "Furthermore, the enjoining order extends to preventing any individual or group from obstructing the party\u2019s politburo in carrying out their responsibilities. Additionally, the court, through the order, directed all SLFP members to refrain from initiating any further legal action apart from the ongoing litigation. The case was filed by counsels led by Ikram Mohammed PC, seeking the enjoining order. Further examination of this matter is scheduled for 27 May.",
    "The SLFP\u2019s pro-Sirisena faction appointed Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as Chairperson at a special SLFP Executive Committee meeting held in Kotte over the weekend.",
    "However, the pro-CBK faction including party office bearers Duminda Dissanayake, Mahinda Amaraweera and Lasantha Alagiyawanna have refused to accept the appointment."
