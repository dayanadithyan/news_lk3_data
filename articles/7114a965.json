    "Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa says that postponing elections is not healthy for any democracy.",
    "The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) National Organiser stated that extending the terms of the President and the Parliament undermines the fundamental principles of a democratic society.",
    "\u201cStability should come through the will of the people, not by delaying their voice,\u201d he said in a post on \u2018X\u2019 (formerly Twitter).",
    "Rajapaksa\u2019s comments come likely in response to a statement made by the General Secretary of the United National Party (UNP) Palitha Range Bandara, proposing for the postponement of the two upcoming elections by two years.",
    "Speaking at a press conference in Colombo today (28), he proposed that the Presidential Election and the General Election be postponed for 2 years, through a proposal to be tabled in Parliament and that a referendum could be called if necessary.",
    "\u201cNow we have to save the country from this bankruptcy and rebuild the country\u2019s economy,\u201d Range Bandara said.",
    "He stated that Sri Lanka has an agreement in place with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and if the said agreement is violated the country will regress back to how it was two years back.",
    "\u201cSo, do we want to knowingly go back to that point and get ruined? Or else do we reach a common agreement and postpone both these elections for two years?\u201d",
    "\u201cThe President is not greedy to stay on. We are the ones asking,\u201d he said, adding that funds should not be wasted by going for a general election at this time.",
    "\u201cPostpone them both for two years. These issues can be resolved within those two years and afterwards elections can be held,\u201d Range Bandara added."
