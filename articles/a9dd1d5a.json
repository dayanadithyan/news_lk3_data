    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s government will present two bills to Parliament to empower women during the initial phase of economic recovery, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.",
    "Women face challenges in safeguarding their families amidst the economic crisis, Wickremesinghe said. \u201cI witnessed first-hand the dire plight of women, many heading households amidst scarcity.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe was speaking at the unveiling of three \u201cAnti-Violence Global Gestures\u201d handprints against sexual violence targeting women and girls in public spaces, organized by Dhammika Perera\u2019s DP Education at the Nelum Pokuna Theater in Colombo on Friday.",
    "\u201cThis endeavour holds promise in empowering women against the scourge of violence they face, particularly exacerbated by economic crises,\u201d Wickremesinghe said. \u201cLegislation against such violence is being introduced in parliament.\u201d",
    "The Women\u2019s Empowerment Bill and the Gender Equality Bill will enact a national policy on gender parity and women\u2019s empowerment, he said. Both bills are slated for passage in June.",
    "\u201cMr Dhammika Perera has initiated a transformative movement,\u201d Wickremesinghe said. \u201cWhile addressing violence against women, today\u2019s event introduced techniques for prevention.",
    "\u201cI anticipate significant publicity for this initiative, given the presence of both capitalists and philanthropists in our nation. Philanthropists, individuals who amass wealth and engage in social endeavours, exemplify this spirit. Mr. Dhammika Perera stands as a prime example through his altruistic actions.\u201d",
    "There are also discussions \u201cto augment female representation in local government elections following the presidential and general elections. It is our aspiration to ensure at least a 25% representation of women in parliamentary seats and to bolster their presence in provincial councils.\u201d (Colombo/May11/2024)"
