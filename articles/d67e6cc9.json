  "original_body_lines": [
    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) has expressed strong concerns regarding the recently enacted Online Safety Act (OSA) in Sri Lanka.",
    "The CPA criticizes the \"secrecy\" surrounding the drafting process and the \"rushed manner\" of passage, raising questions about the government's intentions and potential disregard for constitutional principles.",
    "They question the government's motives for pushing through a law with significant implications for freedom of expression and the rule of law.",
    "The statement underlines the government's failure to fully comply with the Supreme Court's amendments concerning the Bill.",
    "CPA says that concerns arise about the constitutionality of the OSA due to this selective implementation of the Court's decisions, and that this sets a dangerous precedent for the separation of powers and weakens the rule of law.",
    "In a statement, CPA raises concerns about the broad powers vested in the Online Safety Commission, the vagueness of key terms like \"malicious\" and \"wantonly,\" and the limited role of independent experts.",
    "CPA urges the Government to review the process and substance of the OSA, take immediate steps to repeal the OSA and introduce a law that genuinely addresses the concerns of online safety.",
    "Further, CPA calls on the Government to have a transparent and inclusive law-making process that provides time for stakeholder consultations and review."
