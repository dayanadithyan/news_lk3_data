  "original_body_lines": [
    "Singapore\u2019s transport minister has resigned from his post after being charged with 27 offences in a corruption probe that has also ensnared a billionaire hotel tycoon.",
    "S. Iswaran was arrested in July of 2023 and released on bail in connection with a rare top-level graft investigation in the city-state. Iswaran, 61, said he would plead not guilty to the charges filed by the powerful Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau when he appeared in court on Thursday.",
    "Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong revealed shortly after Thursday\u2019s hearing that Iswaran had submitted his resignation from the government, parliament and ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) on January 16 after being given formal notice of the charges against him.",
    "Iswaran has also pledged to return the money received as part of his salary and allowances since his arrest, Lee said. \u201cI reject the allegations in the charges and will now focus on clearing my name,\u201d Iswaran wrote in his resignation letter, which was published on the website of the prime minister\u2019s office.",
    "Most of the charges against Iswaran relate to corruption, but he also faces one charge of obstruction of justice. Among other accusations, he is alleged to have accepted tickets to high-profile sporting events and stage shows from hotel tycoon Ong Beng Seng, one of Singapore\u2019s richest people.",
    "Ong, the managing director of Hotel Properties Limited, was arrested the same day as Iswaran in 2023 and also released on bail. Ong is credited with helping bring the Formula One Grand Prix to Singapore in 2008.",
    "\u201cThe Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers (AGC) will take a decision in respect of the investigations against Mr Ong and others, after the case against Mr S Iswaran has been completed,\u201d the AGC said in a statement Thursday.",
    "The graft investigation has gripped Singapore, a global financial hub reputed to be among the least corrupt countries in the world. Cabinet ministers are paid salaries comparable to the top earners in the private sector to deter corruption.",
    "Iswaran\u2019s corruption case was the \u201cmost politically significant\u201d in Singapore\u2019s history, said Eugene Tan, an associate professor of law at Singapore Management University, describing it as a \u201cbody blow\u201d for the PAP.",
    "\u201cBut I think the fair-minded observer will look at Singapore\u2019s track record, will look at how this case has been dealt with so far, and will not come to the view that this strong anti-corruption stance is just mere talk,\u201d he said.\u00a0 The alleged offences date back as far as 2015.",
    "Questions remain over why they were not discovered sooner, and \u201cwhether the degree of transparency and public reporting by senior officials in the Singapore system is sufficient\u201d, said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore.",
    "\u201cThey also raise questions about whether high pay is sufficient in discouraging corruption \u2014 people could always want more,\u201d he added. Lee has previously admitted that his long-ruling PAP had \u201ctaken a hit\u201d after a spate of political scandals.",
    "In addition to Iswaran\u2019s arrest last year, two PAP legislators resigned because of an affair. Before that, two heavyweight cabinet members were investigated for allegedly getting favours in their rental of sprawling colonial-era bungalows, but were subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing.",
    "Lee has faced criticism over an alleged lack of transparency in how the government handled the scandals, as well as questions over whether the standards set by the party\u2019s founding leaders have been eroded.",
    "The scandals come as the party \u2014 which has ruled uninterrupted for 64 years \u2014 bounced back from its worst ever election results in 2020, when its share of the popular vote fell and the opposition gained more seats."
