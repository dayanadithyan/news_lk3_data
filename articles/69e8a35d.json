    "The Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) has officially reached a final decision to endorse Sajith Premadasa, the presidential candidate of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), at the upcoming presidential election.",
    "The announcement came after a party meeting held this morning (16) in Vavuniya, where the party\u2019s central committee made the final decision.",
    "Meanwhile, leader of the ITAK Mavai Senathirajah, who earlier extended his support for incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, confirmed the party\u2019s support for Premadasa, as per the decision reached by the party\u2019s central committee following a thorough discussion and deliberation.",
    "However, not all within the party are in agreement, as Jaffna District Member of Parliament, S. Shritharan, has expressed his strong dissent against the party\u2019s decision.",
    "Speaking to the media, Shritharan urged the party\u2019s supporters to back the Tamil common candidate P. Ariyanethiran, who he believes represents the true aspirations of the Tamil people.",
    "He criticized the lack of commitment from Sinhalese presidential candidates to address Tamil people\u2019s concerns and emphasized the need for a leader who genuinely advocates for Tamil interests.",
    "The ITAK is considered as the main political party of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA)."
