    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The Central Bank said that it was considering legal action against registered limited liability companies that were using personal bank accounts to conduct business for the purpose of tax evasion.",
    "The Central Bank issued a warning against the misuse of personal accounts for \u2018illegal activities\u2019, last week (15).",
    "\u201cThe reason for that was that we received complaints from banks that clients who had registered a business were conducting transactions not through the account established for that purpose, but through their personal accounts. This could most probably be for tax evasion purposes,\u201d Enoka Mohotty Director of the FIU said.",
    "\u201cWe have written to the Finance Ministry, and are in discussions with the Inland Revenue Department and the Registrar of Companies on what possible legal action can be taken,\u201d Mohotty said in reply to question by a journalist at the central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Review No. 01 of 2024, held on Tuesday (23).",
    "CB Governor Nandala Weerasinghe added that they were trying to close loopholes and enable a more transparent business environment, and also prevent money laundering.",
    "\u201cWe know a lot of businesses don\u2019t even give a VAT invoice. They show the business account to the IRD, so their true turnover is not evident,\u201d Weerasinghe said. (Colombo/Jan23/2024)"
