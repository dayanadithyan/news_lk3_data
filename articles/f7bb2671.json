    "Eksath Lanka Podujana Peramuna Presidential candidate Janaka Ratnayake has urged Sri Lankans to make a rational decision at the polls on 21 September, asking them to vote with their minds rather than their hearts. In his address to the nation, Ratnayake emphasised his vision of rebuilding the country, rescuing it from its current economic challenges, and securing a better future for the children of Sri Lanka.",
    "He recalled his time as the Chairperson of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), where he consistently advocated for the underprivileged. He alleged that his removal from this position was orchestrated by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Presidential candidate Namal Rajapaksa, and National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake working together.",
    "However, despite these accusations all NPP MPs led by Dissanayake voted against the motion to remove him when it was brought to Parliament on 24 May 2023."
