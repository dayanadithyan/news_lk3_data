  "original_body_lines": [
    "SJB\u2019s Sujeewa Senasinghe accuses President Ranil Wickremesinghe of resorting to political tricks and manipulations to delay polls",
    "Claims Palitha Range Bandara\u2019s proposal to delay elections is strategic manoeuvre orchestrated by Wickremesinghe",
    "Assures SJB will vigorously oppose any attempts to delay Presidential Election",
    "Dismisses rumours of potential collaboration between SJB and UNP ahead of polls",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Head of Presidential Election Operations Sujeewa Senasinghe asserted yesterday that the party would firmly resist any attempts by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to manipulate the electoral process.",
    "Speaking at a press briefing in Colombo, Senasinghe accused Wickremesinghe of relying heavily on political manoeuvres and deceptive tactics throughout his three-decade-long political career.",
    "He criticised the President for his alleged inability to engage in politics without resorting to such strategies, particularly highlighting Wickremesinghe\u2019s recent collaboration with United National Party Secretary Palitha Range Bandara.",
    "Senasinghe interpreted Range Bandara\u2019s recent proposal as a ploy by President Wickremesinghe to assess the feasibility of postponing the elections. He emphasised that as the election draws near, Wickremesinghe\u2019s reliance on political tricks would likely backfire. Senasinghe said the SJB would not allow any delays to the Presidential Election, asserting that Wickremesinghe\u2019s motivations stem from his recognition of his dwindling public support and a desire to secure an alternative path to Parliament.",
    "\u201cThe Presidential Election must be held. A large number of people are currently waiting to join the Samagi People\u2019s Force. Accordingly, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya is committed to winning all upcoming elections and bringing positive change to the country,\u201d he said.",
    "Asserting the necessity of holding the Presidential Election as scheduled, Senasinghe expressed confidence in the Samagi Jana Balawegaya\u2019s ability to attract widespread support, emphasising their commitment to bringing about positive change in the country.",
    "Furthermore, Senasinghe dispelled rumours of potential collaboration between the SJB and the UNP before the elections, affirming their party\u2019s independent stance. He emphasised that the SJB refuses to align with a faltering political entity, highlighting their skilled leadership and the potential to lead Sri Lanka towards progress by rooting out corruption and fraud.",
    "However, Senasinghe warned of ongoing efforts aimed at undermining the strength of the united people\u2019s force, signalling a need for vigilance and unity within the SJB."
