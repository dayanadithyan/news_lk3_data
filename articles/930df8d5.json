    "Samurdhi, Sri Lanka\u2019s largest welfare programme until the Aswesuma scheme, had some 1.7 million beneficiaries, but critics say that, while it is necessary, a not insignificant number of the beneficiaries are people who don\u2019t meet the criteria and are added to the list through political influence.",
    "Sri Lanka started Aswesuma, its new consolidated welfare payments scheme, after a large number of people were tipped into poverty when the rupee collapsed from the most aggressive macro-economic policy (rate cuts and tax cuts) employed by the country\u2019s economic bureaucrats since a money printing central bank was set up.(Colombo/May28/2024)"
