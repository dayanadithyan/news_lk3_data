    "\u201cThe new system is expected to be rolled out within three months,\u201d CMC Deputy Director Traffic and Road Design Eng. Manjula Kularathna said.",
    "He also said that the CMC plans to employ one contractor for one designated zone, instead of the current system, where a contractor and an administrator are assigned to each road.",
    "Kularathna also noted that under the current system, a parking ticket cannot be reused within the same zone for short-term parking whereas the new system is expected to enhance the convenience of the drivers by allowing them to park the vehicles in two or three places within an hour in the respective zone using the same parking ticket.",
    "He said the new system will see features of advanced technologies to enhance vehicle parking services within the Colombo city limits."
