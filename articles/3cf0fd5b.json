  "original_body_lines": [
    "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has suspended public duties to \u201cstop and reflect\u201d on whether to remain in the job, after a court opened a preliminary inquiry into his wife.",
    "In a statement, the Spanish leader said he urgently needed to decide \u201cwhether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour\u201d.",
    "The court said it was responding to corruption claims against Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez.",
    "Mr S\u00e1nchez said his wife would defend her honour and work with the judiciary.",
    "The complaint against Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez was raised by anti-corruption campaigners Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), who have taken part in a number of high-profile court cases in recent years and are led by a man linked to the far right.",
    "The Spanish prime minister said he would make a decision on his future before the media on Monday 29 April, after reflecting whether it was worth remaining in office \u201cdespite the mud\u201d that the right and far right were trying to turn politics into.",
    "In a lengthy statement on X, Mr S\u00e1nchez complained of a \u201cstrategy of harassment\u201d over months aimed at weakening him politically and personally targeting his wife.",
    "The court did not give details of the accusations against Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez other than to say it had begun investigating allegations of influence peddling and corruption on 16 April.",
    "However, El Confidencial website said on Wednesday that the inquiry was looking into her links to private companies that had secured government money or public contracts.",
    "In particular, it cited a \u201csponsorship agreement\u201d involving tourism group Globalia and a foundation she ran in 2020 called IE Africa Center. In 2020, Globalia secured a \u20ac475m (\u00a3407m) bailout for its airline Air Europa, as part of a series of government rescue packages for companies during the Covid-19 crisis.",
    "Spain\u2019s conservative Popular Party (PP) demanded explanations in parliament earlier on Wednesday, to which the prime minister said simply that he believed in justice \u201cdespite everything\u201d.",
    "Spanish media said he had left parliament for his Madrid residence visibly upset. Hours later he accused PP leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o of working with far-right party Vox to bring him down.",
    "\u201cI am not naive. I realise they are denouncing Bego\u00f1a, not because she has done anything illegal - they know there is no case - but because she is my wife,\u201d he complained in his statement.",
    "Political allies expressed support for Mr S\u00e1nchez, who has been in power since 2018, but his decision to suspend public duties comes at a tense time for his Socialist party ahead of European Parliament elections in June and elections in the Catalonia region of north-eastern Spain next month.",
    "He was due to take part in a Catalan campaign launch in Barcelona on Thursday.",
    "Pedro S\u00e1nchez leads an awkward coalition that includes two Catalan separatist parties, which were persuaded to join the government in return for an amnesty that covered a banned Catalan referendum on secession in 2017.",
    "Without the support of the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) and Together for Catalonia (JxCat) he would not have been able to stay in power, following an inconclusive election last year.",
    "Opposition parties were outraged by the amnesty, which also means the former Catalan regional leader Carles Puigdemont will stand in next month\u2019s regional vote, seven years after he fled imminent arrest and went into exile in Belgium.",
    "Mr Puigdemont is still facing a terrorism case but believes the amnesty will enable him to return to Spain."
