Rohan De Lanerolle Senior has accomplished what many believed to be impossible \u2013 modernising traditional tea bag machines to be staple-free, a challenge that has eluded engineers for over two decades. This innovation is not just a technical marvel; it redefines the future of the tea industry, the world\u2019s most consumed beverage after water.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhile Sri Lanka is often celebrated for its breathtaking beauty, vibrant tourism, and cricketing excellence, it is moments like this that showcase our potential to lead in Research and Development on a global scale. His sons, who are Rohan and Ishan, Directors of Operations and Marketing, continue to take his legacy forward and are also internationally acclaimed singers under the brand of \u2018The De Lanerolle Brothers\u2019 currently on tour in Australia \u2013 if not, they also would have been physically present in the beautiful city of Johannesburg,\u201d Dhanapala said.",
    "\u201cDe Lanerolle\u2019s legacy speaks volumes. The overwhelming support from Johannesburg has been phenomenal, and this recognition is a proud moment not just for our company, but for all of Sri Lanka. All credit goes to our Chairman, Rohan De Lanerolle, for bringing this honour to our nation,\u201d Dhanapala added."
