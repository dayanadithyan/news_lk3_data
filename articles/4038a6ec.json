    "Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader Udaya Gammanpila has requested official documents from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning the ceding of Katchatheevu Island from India to Sri Lanka. He submitted a Right to Information (RTI) request on 11 April.",
    "Gammanpila said the request was made at an opportune time, as India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has brought up the Katchatheevu issue during the lead-up to India\u2019s general election, which begins on 19 April.",
    "He expressed a desire for the public to have access to the relevant documents, including what he termed historical evidence dating back to the 12th century BC and the exchange of letters between India and Sri Lanka on the subject.",
    "The Katchatheevu issue was raised on Indian political platforms by Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently, who accused the rival Congress party of underhandedly giving the island to Sri Lanka. Modi also criticised the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) for its alleged involvement in the matter.",
    "The controversy originated from an RTI request by Tamil Nadu BJP President K Annamalai, who argued that in the 1970s, Congress Party leader Indira Gandhi, in consultation with Tamil Nadu\u2019s DMK, transferred Katchatheevu Island to Sri Lanka. Indian political observers believe the BJP is highlighting the issue to gain support from voters in Tamil Nadu, where the DMK aligned with the Congress Party continues to have strong backing."
