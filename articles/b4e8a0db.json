    "One of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest paint manufacturers, Asian Paints Causeway, recently launched \u2018ColourNext-2024\u2019 at a grand event held in Colombo.",
    "\u2018ColourNext\u2019 is a comprehensive, annual forecast of design directions in colours, materials, textures, and finishes, compiled by Asian Paints in collaboration with experts from various creative disciplines, including architecture, art, interiors, fashion, sociology, media, and FMCG. \u2018ColourNext\u2019 is celebrated as South Asia\u2019s premier and unique intelligence in colour and material forecasting.",
    "The launch of \u2018ColourNext-2024\u2019 marks the inaugural edition of \u2018ColourNext\u2019 in Sri Lanka. The event hosted an esteemed group of architects and interior designers, alongside notable figures such Asian Paints International Ltd. Regional Head Sireesh Rao, General Manager Sales and Marketing (Sri Lanka) Vaithilingam Kiritharan, Head of Marketing (Sri Lanka) Anuradha Edirisinghe, and the Senior Management of Asian Paints Causeway.",
    "In his keynote address Asian Paints International Ltd. Chief Executive Pragyan Kumar, emphasised the importance of creating visually stunning and culturally resonant spaces. He went on to say: \u201cAsian Paints relentlessly analyses global trends and their local relevance to inspire designs that reflect a holistic understanding of consumers. Renowned experts have put in tremendous efforts to bring the latest \u2018trends\u2019 to the forefront through this report.\u201d Pragyan also added: \u201cOur aim is to push innovation by creating future-ready, functionally and aesthetically pleasing colours and textures that will greatly enhance the lifestyle of general people.\u201d",
    "The forecast report announced the colour of the year as \u2018Terra\u2019, a shade that resonates deeply with Sri Lanka\u2019s natural beauty. From the warm golden hues of sun-kissed beaches to the earthy tones of rugged mountains, Sri Lanka\u2019s natural palette is a feast for the eyes. \u2018Terra\u2019 captures this serenity and warmth, inviting people to bring these hues into their own homes.",
    "In addition to \u2018Terra\u2019, the report revealed four other colour trends: \u2018Soil\u2019, an innovative material fuelling creativity and design experimentation; \u2018Into the Deep\u2019, which embraces the fantastic depths of oceanic marvels; \u2018Retro-futurism\u2019, offering a gaze into the future through the lens of familiar landscapes, attire, and folklore; and \u2018Goblin Mode\u2019, reflecting a liberating detachment from the endless chase for perfection.",
    "The event saw enthusiastic participation from over 125 key architects and interior designers, marking it as a significant milestone for the local fraternity. It was widely commented that this is the first time such a global event of this magnitude has been experienced on Sri Lankan soil. Inspired by the event, architects and interior designers expressed confidence that the newly introduced colour themes would help create even better living spaces for Sri Lankan consumers."
