    "One person was killed and multiple children were among 21 injured after a mass shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl victory rally on Wednesday triggered panic among huge crowds of fans.",
    "Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, which takes patients up to the age of 17, said it was treating 12 people -- 11 of them children, nine for gunshot wounds -- after the shooting, which unfolded just moments after Chiefs players had addressed a vast crowd of cheering supporters gathered nearby.",
    "Police said three people had been taken into custody after the incident, but the motive and circumstances behind the shooting were still under investigation.",

    "After shots rang out, shocked fans scrambled to flee to safety as police worked to clear Union Station in a tragic end to what had been a joyous morning of celebration to salute the NFL champions.",
    "Paul Contreras, who was at the rally with his three daughters, said he tackled and disarmed one of the suspected shooters before the police arrived.",
    "\u201cI got the right angle on him and I hit him from behind. And when I hit him from behind, I either jarred the gun out of his hand or out of his sleeve,\u201d Contreras said on CNN. \u201cI take him down, and I\u2019m putting all my body weight on him. And then another good Samaritan comes over and is helping me.\u201d",
    "Victims were treated lying on the ground before being carried away on stretchers as crowds streamed past.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m angry at what happened today,\u201d Kansas City Police chief Stacey Graves said. \u201cThe people who came to this celebration should expect a safe environment,\u201d the police chief added.",
    "Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas was among VIPs at the event who were sent running for cover after shots rang out.",
    "\u201cThis is a day that a lot of people look forward to. Something they remember for a lifetime. And what they shouldn\u2019t have to remember is the threat of gun violence,\u201d Lucas said.",
    "\u201cWe are truly saddened by the senseless act of violence that occurred outside of Union Station at the conclusion of today\u2019s parade and rally,\u201d the franchise said in a statement.",
    "\u201cPraying for Kansas City,\u201d City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes wrote on social media.",
    "Just moments before the shooting, Mahomes and his teammates had been soaking up the adulation from a sea of red-shirted fans.",

    "In 2019, four people were injured after gunfire broke out near a parade to honor the Toronto Raptors\u2019 NBA Finals victory in Toronto.",
