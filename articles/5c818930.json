    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is in the process of introducing electronic National Identity Card (e-NIC), the Public Security Minister said, after delays in India-funded Unique ID card project amid data privacy concerns.",

    "\u201cIndian one is a separate one altogether which is there for a long time. As per our work, we are going ahead with our ID.\u201d",
    "The Department of Personal Registration which is in charge of issuing NICs comes under the purview of Alles\u2019 Ministry of Public Security. But the Indian project is handled by Ministry of Technology.",
