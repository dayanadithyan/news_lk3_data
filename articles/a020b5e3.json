    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 If Sri Lanka desired a competitive economy, it must embrace competition, Sri Lanka\u2019s President has said, adding that he has faith in the country\u2019s businesses.",
    "\u201cWe must understand how to influence market forces, perhaps even manipulate or direct them,\u201d President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "\u201cI can only envision a market economy where market forces will determine the course. Within that framework, we can establish policy guidelines, outline three or four-year programs, and adapt as needed,\u201d Wickremesinghe said at the International Rotary District Conference 2023/24 of the District 3220 Club for Sri Lanka and Maldives.",
    "\u201cI have faith in Sri Lankan businesses; we can overcome challenges,\u201d he told those at the event held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall on Friday.",
    "If Sri Lanka aims to progress, it must first decide on the economic system it desires, Wickremesinghe said. \u201cDo we want a government-led approach, following a five-year plan? We\u2019ve tried numerous plans in the past, yet remained impoverished. Vietnam, once poorer than us, changed its course after the war.\u201d",
    "Sri Lankans often aspire to emulate countries like Malaysia or Singapore, yet hesitate to make the necessary decisions, he said.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s time to confront our reality. We must decide on the type of economy we want. For me, only one model is viable: a highly competitive, export-oriented economy. Despite lacking the vast markets or mineral wealth of other nations, we\u2019re strategically positioned in the Indian Ocean, regaining significance as an economic hub.",
    "\u201cWe cannot afford to dwell in illusions. Economic stabilization measures undertaken will soon be finalized. Are we continuing with an import-dependent economy, rendering past efforts futile? This is the decision we must all make; there\u2019s no escaping it.",
    "\u201cWhat matters most is our future trajectory. If we desire a competitive economy, we must embrace competition.\u201d",
    "Due to enjoying protection from politicians for decades, many of Sri Lanka\u2019s businesses cannot make export competitive products, critics say.",
    "Economists have increasingly started to point out that Sri Lanka is no longer an \u2018open economy,\u2019 amid high and suddenly changed protectionist border taxes that purportedly protect local industries.",
    "\u201cWe are living at a time when Sri Lanka has reached a crossroads, deciding which path to take. This decision lies in the hands of the people of this country. Are we moving forward? Are we staying stagnant? Or do we wish to regress?\u201d (Colombo/Apr27/2024)"
