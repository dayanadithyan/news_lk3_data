    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The National People\u2019s Power (NPP) cannot be bought by any foreign power or corporation and their recent visit to India does not mean the leftist alliance now supports an investment by India\u2019s Amul or the divestment of Sri Lanka Telecom, according to NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.",
    "Speaking at a women\u2019s rally held in Anuradhapura on Sunday February 11, Dissanayake was emphatic that the NPP\u2019s policies have not changed following his widely publicised visit to India on the invitation of the Indian government.",
    "News of Dissanayake meeting India\u2019s Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and representatives of Tata and the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation of India (Amul) made headlines in Colombo.",
    "The NPP, an alliance led and controlled by the Marxist-Leninist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) that Dissanayake also leads, had been vocal in its opposition to proposed plans to divest shares of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), which at least one Indian firm has expressed interest in, and purported plans to sell Milco, Highland and 31 dairy farms owned by the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) to Amul.",
    "Historically, the JVP has also been critical of what it once called \u201cIndian expansionism\u201d, particularly at the height of the second violent insurrection the party led in Sri Lanka\u2019s south in the late 1980s, which led to thousands of deaths as the then United National Party (UNP) government sought to quell it by any means necessary.",
    "\u201cWe have a strong foreign policy,\u201d said Dissanayake speaking at Sunday\u2019s event.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re small people, but no powerful nation or corporation can buy us. Just because Mahinda was bought, we can\u2019t be bought.",
    "\u201cWe said in India that the world has changed and we have changed along with it. India\u2019s foreign minister said yes, India has also changed with the world.\u201d",
    "The JVP leader scoffed at comments on social media that the party is about to change its tune on Indian investments in the country.",
    "\u201cSome are saying after we went to India that we will support the sale of Telecom or support Amul. No, that will not happen, remember that.",
    "\u201cWe will under nocircumstances mix up our dealing with foreign countries and meeting their leaders with a national economic policy,\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake said the party\u2019s approach to foreign relations is to first formulate a national economic policy and then formulate a foreign policy to secure the international support needed to fortify that economic policy.",
    "Dissanayake also accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of alleged attempts to cancel the presidential election that\u2019s due to be held this year.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s trying various tactics to not have the election. There is definitely going to be a presidential election before October 17 this year.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re forming all sorts of alliances under various names. [Former president] Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge has become a party leader once again in 2024. Why? They\u2019re panicking.",
    "\u201cThis is the Maha season. By the time of the Yala harvest, there will be a new government,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Feb12/2024)"
