    "Colombo, Feb 3 (Daily Mirror) - In a recent meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) emphasized the necessity of addressing key issues before committing to support him in the upcoming presidential election, according to a reliable source.",
    "The meeting, initially planned at the President\u2019s official residence, saw a change of venue to the Presidential Secretariat. SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam objected to the meeting being turned into an all-party gathering without prior notice.",
    "Initially invited to the President\u2019s residence, the SLPP attended the meeting under the impression that it would be an exclusive discussion between the party and the President.",
    "At the outset of the meeting, President Wickremesinghe expressed his intent to gather perspectives on the modalities for contesting the forthcoming presidential election.",
    "However, tensions arose when other party representatives, including some from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Nimal Lanza group, were present.",
    "Reportedly, Kariyawasam expressed frustration over the unexpected inclusion of other party representatives and asserted that his party was not prepared to discuss presidential election matters abruptly. He insisted that there were specific issues to be addressed prior to any election discussions.",
    "Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, representing the SLFP, argued that separate meetings could be conducted due to time constraints. He cited the active engagement of\u00a0opposition parties such as the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the National People\u2019s Power.",
    "In response, Kariyawasam emphasized that the SLPP operates dif\u00adferently from other parties and insisted on a separate meeting with the President. He clarified that the SLPP had not yet decided on supporting any specific candidate."
