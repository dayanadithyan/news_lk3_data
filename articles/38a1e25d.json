    "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange walked free on Wednesday from a court on the U.S. Pacific island territory of Saipan after pleading guilty to violating U.S. espionage law in a deal that allowed him to head straight home to Australia.",
    "His release ends a 14-year legal saga in which Assange spent more than five years in a British high-security jail and seven years in asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in London battling extradition to the U.S., where he faced 18 criminal charges.",
    "During the three-hour hearing, Assange pleaded guilty to one criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified national defence documents but said he had believed the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment, which protects free speech, shielded his activities.",
    "\u201cWorking as a journalist I encouraged my source to provide information that was said to be classified in order to publish that information,\u201d he told the court.",
    "\u201cI believed the First Amendment protected that activity but I accept that it was ... a violation of the espionage statute.\u201d",
    "Chief U.S. District Judge Ramona V. Manglona accepted his guilty plea and released him due to time already served in a British jail.",
    "\u201cWe firmly believe that Mr. Assange never should have been charged under the Espionage Act and engaged in (an) exercise that journalists engage in every day,\u201d his U.S. lawyer, Barry Pollack, told reporters outside the court.",
    "His U.K. and Australian lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, thanked the Australian government for its years of diplomacy in securing Assange\u2019s release."
