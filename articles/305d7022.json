    "Fitch Ratings Lanka recently upgraded Asia Asset Finance PLC\u2019s (AAF) credit rating to A+ (Stable) from A- (Stable). This reaffirms AAF\u2019s position as one of Sri Lanka\u2019s premier licensed finance companies. This upgraded rating underscores the company\u2019s strength, stability and trust, and serves as a testament to its ability to manoeuvre in a dynamic business environment. It also places AAF in an elite group of Sri Lanka\u2019s most trusted financial institutions. This success is further bolstered by the strong support AAF enjoys from its parent company, Muthoot Finance Limited (MFL), a leading Gold Loans provider in India, which provides both technical and financial support to AAF.",
