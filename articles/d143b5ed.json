    "Marking the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking the Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) has issued a pressing call to halt recent efforts to legalise the cultivation of cannabis in Sri Lanka.",
    "Despite the Investment Promotion Ministry and the Indigenous Medicine Section of the Health Ministry actively seeking project proposals for the cultivation of cannabis for export and medicinal purposes; ADIC raised significant concerns about the initiative\u2019s true impact on the country.",
    "In a press release, ADIC noted that while the ministries assert that their primary aim is to achieve economic benefits through cannabis exports, thereby enhancing Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, a comprehensive review by ADIC of financial records from leading cannabis firms worldwide suggests otherwise.",
    "\u201cThese companies have reported significant financial losses due to oversupply, market demand issues, and limited market share, challenging the economic viability claimed by the proponents of cannabis cultivation,\u201d ADIC noted.",
    "Cannabis remains classified as an illegal drug in Sri Lanka, with its possession, cultivation, and sale strictly prohibited by law. Nevertheless, the initiative has been branded under the name \u201cThrailoka Vijaya Patra\u201d, emphasising its medicinal properties.",
    "ADIC warned that this is a guise employed by multinational cannabis businesses and tobacco companies, the latter of which are investing in the global cannabis industry to counteract declining tobacco use.",
    "While the Investment Promotion Ministry and Health Ministry have emphasised that cannabis cultivation will be strictly for export, with no allowance for domestic use, ADIC questioned the practicality of this assurance, given the pervasive issue of illegal drugs in the country.",
    "\u201cPreventing domestic circulation of cannabis remains a challenging task, rendering the export-only assertion dubious,\u201d the organisation noted.",
    "\u201cCountries that have legalised cannabis in various forms have faced numerous unforeseen issues, exacerbating their internal drug problems. Thailand\u2019s recent efforts to reverse its cannabis legalisation decision serve as a cautionary tale. Proponents of cannabis cultivation are exploiting Sri Lanka\u2019s severe economic crisis to advance their agenda, which could further worsen the nation\u2019s socio-economic challenges,\u201d it added.",
    "ADIC also pointed out the rising positive attitude towards cannabis within society, driven by increased promotions.",
    "This trend is leading to a growing tendency among children and youth to initiate cannabis use, which could intensify the drug problem in Sri Lanka. Permitting cannabis cultivation for export could introduce a host of new challenges to Sri Lanka\u2019s existing drug-related issues, ADIC warned. Therefore, the centre called for the immediate cessation of the cannabis cultivation initiative in the country."
