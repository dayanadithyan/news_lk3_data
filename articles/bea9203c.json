    "Chamari Athapaththu smashed the third-highest individual score in women\u2019s ODIs to help Sri Lanka pull off the highest-ever successful run-chase in women\u2019s ODIs.",
    "Chamari Athapaththu was at her brutal best as Sri Lanka stunned South Africa with a record run-chase in Potchefstroom to level the three-match ICC Women\u2019s Championship ODI series and end a highly successful bilateral tour to the Rainbow Nation.",
    "Chasing 302 to win, Athapaththu led Sri Lanka\u2019s fightback with a stunning hundred, and remained unbeaten on 195, the third-highest score in women\u2019s ODIs, as the visitors overhauled the target with 33 balls to spare.",
    "Athapaththu\u2019s innings was also the second highest individual score in a successful run chase in ODI cricket - both men\u2019s and women\u2019s - marginally behind the magnificent 201* Glenn Maxwell put together for Australia against Afghanistan at last year\u2019s ICC Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup.",
    "Earlier, Laura Wolvaardt continued her stellar run in the bilateral series against Sri Lanka with a second ODI hundred in as many matches. The opener smashed an unbeaten 184 to take South Africa to 301 in the third and final ODI of the series.",
    "Wolvaardt\u2019s knock is the highest score by a South African in women\u2019s ODIs and was also the fourth-highest in women\u2019s ODIs for a brief while, going past Athapaththu\u2019s 178* against Australia in 2017.",
    "Wolvaardt, who had made a hundred in the T20I leg of the tour, also smashed a century in the second ODI in Kimberley on Saturday. On Wednesday, she added another ton to her tally with a spectacular knock.",
    "But her brilliance was overshadowed by her opposite number, Athapaththu, who stole the limelight with a stunning hundred to seal the first-ever successful run-chase of over 300 in women\u2019s ODIs.",
    "Australia had held the record for the highest run-chase in women\u2019s ODIs for more than a decade. In 2012, Australia chased down a target of 289 against New Zealand. Last year, they also chased down 283 against India at the Wankhede."
