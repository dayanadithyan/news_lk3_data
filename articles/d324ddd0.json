    "SLFP Dayasiri Jayasekara denies he has been in talks with SJB and says no agreement will be signed on 8 Aug.",
    "Says SLFP has decided to appoint a 10-member committee to determine party\u2019s plans",
    "Stresses party has not decided which candidate to support in upcoming Presidential poll",
    "Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Dayasiri Jayasekara has refuted claims that the party will sign an agreement with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) on 8 August.",
    "At a press conference held yesterday, Jayasekara also dismissed rumours that he had been in talks with the SJB regarding backing SJB leader Sajith Premadasa\u2019s Presidential bid.",
    "Jayasekara was responding to questions posed by media personnel regarding former SLFP Chairperson Maithripala Sirisena\u2019s challenge for Jayasekara to disclose the specifics of an alleged agreement between the SLFP and SJB to support the SJB in the upcoming Presidential election.",
    "According to the SLFP General Secretary, all electoral and district organisers of the party met over the weekend and decided to appoint a 10-member committee to determine the party\u2019s future plans, policies, and programs.",
    "\u201cWe have agreed to discuss the committee\u2019s proposals and then come to a final decision on the SLFP\u2019s way forward. At the moment, we have not decided on whom to support in the upcoming Presidential poll. Protecting the party\u2019s dignity and its members has become a challenge,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI deny any discussion was held with the SJB. I am not a liar. We have never discussed supporting, crossing over, or aligning the SLFP with another party. We are also ready to support any party member who wishes to contest in the upcoming Presidential election,\u201d he added.",
    "He emphasised that the internal crisis within the party must be resolved before anything else. \u201cI cannot make decisions on behalf of the party. There will be no signing of an agreement on 8 August as alleged by Sirisena,\u201d he said.",
    "While Sirisena has extended his support to Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakse\u2019s candidacy under the SLFP ticket, Jayasekara expressed his disapproval, noting that Rajapakse\u2019s SLFP membership is still in question.",
    "\u201cWe have not approved support for Ranil Wickremesinghe, the SJB, or the SLPP. We will see which camp aligns with the SLFP\u2019s policies,\u201d Jayasekara said.",
    "He also urged party organisers and members not to attend meetings convened by Sirisena, emphasising that he is the only office-bearer authorised to convene party meetings at this time."
