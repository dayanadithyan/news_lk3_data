    "The Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Mizukoshi Hideaki has expressed Japan\u2019s support for the current program aimed at rebuilding the Sri Lankan economy.",
    "Drawing parallels between Japan\u2019s historical journey and Sri Lanka\u2019s current economic challenges, the Ambassador highlighted Japan\u2019s resilience and economic resurgence as a model for Sri Lanka.",
    "These remarks were made during his keynote address at a panel discussion on \u201cEconomic Development and Modernization with Lessons from Japan,\u201d chaired by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Granbell Hotel in Colombo on Thursday (March 21), organized by the \u201cGeopolitical Cartographer\u201d.",
    "During his keynote speech titled \u201cJapan\u2019s Modernization and Lessons for Sri Lanka\u2019s Economic Recovery and Governance\u201d, the Ambassador shared insights into Japan\u2019s historical challenges, its adaptation to modern changes, and its journey towards rapid development.",

    "During his address, the Ambassador reflected on the difficult circumstances Japan encountered globally in the aftermath of World War II. He highlighted the pivotal role played by the late former President J.R. Jayewardene, who represented Sri Lanka at the San Francisco Peace Conference. Despite the international community\u2019s widespread condemnation of Japan at that time, President Jayewardene\u2019s statement paved the way for Japan\u2019s eventual reintegration into the international community. The Ambassador expressed gratitude for this significant contribution, which facilitated Japan\u2019s return to the global stage.",

Moreover, he underscored the enduring close relationship between Japan and Sri Lanka, emphasizing the on-going efforts of leaders from both nations to strengthen and enhance bilateral ties.",
    "Additionally, he pointed out that Sri Lanka, currently engaged in economic reforms under an International Monetary Fund program, could draw inspiration from Japan\u2019s experience in overcoming challenges to foster positive transformation within the country. This aligns with Japan\u2019s example of leveraging adversity to drive progress and development.",
    "The Ambassador stressed the significance of nurturing competitive industries akin to those in Japan to propel Sri Lanka\u2019s economic advancement. He underscored the necessity for Sri Lanka to develop comprehensive industrial policies aimed at fostering competitive export sectors while concurrently striving to attain sustainable development objectives.",
    "Ambassador Mizukoshi commended the proactive measures undertaken by the Sri Lankan government in its ongoing anti-corruption initiatives. He expressed Japan\u2019s commitment to steadfastly supporting these efforts, acknowledging the importance of combating corruption for fostering a conducive environment for economic growth and investment.",
    "The Ambassador highlighted Japan\u2019s commitment to aiding Sri Lanka\u2019s anti-corruption endeavours by disclosing that Japan has extended financial aid through the United Nations Development Program to bolster the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption in Sri Lanka.",
    "Furthermore, he underscored Japan\u2019s readiness to provide support via institutions like the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for diverse development initiatives in Sri Lanka.
