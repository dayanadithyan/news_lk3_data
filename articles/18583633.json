    "Lands Minister Harin Fernando says distribution of freehold deeds to 10,000 will begin on 5 Feb.",
    "Underscores new initiative to empower 1 m young minds, transform them into architects of their own destinies",
    "In a major step towards resolving land ownership issues for over two million Sri Lankans, the \u201cUrumaya\u201d program will be officially launched on 5 February in Dambulla, Tourism, Lands and Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Harin Fernando announced.",
    "Speaking to journalists at a briefing held at President Media Centre on Wednesday, he said the program aims to provide permanent land ownership solutions, noting that over 10,000 land licensees currently holding Ran Bhoomi, Jaya Bhoomi, and Swarna Bhoomi licenses will be among the first beneficiaries of this program.",
    "\u201cFebruary 5 will mark the beginning of a new chapter for many Sri Lankans, offering them a brighter future rooted in secure land ownership. This is not just a distribution; it\u2019s a dawn of hope for the entire rural landscape,\u201d he added.",
    "These licenses will be converted into freehold deeds, granting them full ownership of their land. This move is expected to significantly improve the lives and livelihoods of millions currently struggling with land ownership uncertainties.",
    "\u201cThe \u2018Urumaya\u2019 initiative represents a commitment to addressing long-standing land issues and empowering citizens with the security and freedom that comes with land ownership,\u201d he said, outlining the program\u2019s significance as a key step towards building a stable and prosperous Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cUrumaya washes away the tears of many generations, writing a new chapter in empowerment and prosperity,\u201d the Minister said.",
    "Fernando also said the Ministry takes pride in another ground-breaking initiative igniting the entrepreneurial spirit of our youth. \u201cThis ambitious program aims to empower a million young minds, transforming them into the architects of their own destinies. With \u2018Urumaya\u2019 fostering rural revival and this youth-centric project fuelling innovation, Sri Lanka is poised for a golden age. Join us as we rewrite the narrative, one empowered generation and one life-changing deed at a time.\u201d",
    "He said two years ago the country\u2019s condition was similar to a critically ill patient. \u201cJust as a doctor might administer necessary, yet potentially uncomfortable, treatment to heal the patient, the country had undergone similar adjustments under President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s leadership. While not always agreeable, these measures were deemed essential for the nation\u2019s recovery,\u201d he stressed. The Minister asserted that challenges are embraced not for personal glory, but for the sake of the country\u2019s success.",
    "He pointed to his own role in revitalising the tourism industry as a testament to this commitment. The rapid growth witnessed in the sector stands as evidence of the positive outcomes achievable through dedication and perseverance. A significant victory came today with the lifting of the ban on cricket.",
    "\u201cWhen faced with daunting challenges, it is easy for some to shy away. Yet, when Sri Lanka found itself on the brink of collapse, President Wickremesinghe stepped forward. He embraced the responsibility of rebuilding our nation, understanding that inaction would lead to desolation. His courage and commitment prevented our country from becoming a barren wasteland. Today, we are witnessing signs of recovery, a testament to the impact of his leadership,\u201d he lauded the President."
