    "According to a report published in\u00a0The Island\u00a0on 01 June, 2024, the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) has issued a directive to hotels to immediately cease offering discounts on purchasing alcohol products. This directive emphasises that such promotional offers are punishable under current regulations.",
    "NATA Chairman Dr. Alan Ludowyke explained that his organisation had received numerous complaints about hotels, with liquor licences, offering discounts on alcohol products. Those complaints specifically highlight promotions like \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 discounts\u2014alcoholic beverages are sold at reduced prices for a limited time to attract more customers.",
    "To better understand the issue surrounding \u2018Happy Hour\u2019\u2019 promotions, it is essential to consider who the primary consumers of these hotel promotions are. Are they locals or tourists? Most of the patrons are likely to be tourists. The concept and practice of \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 are familiar to tourists, as they are commonly practised in many countries.",
    "The data highlights the significant growth in tourism in Sri Lanka compared to the previous year, noting a substantial increase in foreign arrivals. There has been a remarkable increase in the number of foreign tourists visiting Sri Lanka, with a growth of 261.2% year-on-year in August 2023 compared to August 2022. This indicates a strong recovery, or surge, in international tourism. This growth rate signifies a significant improvement, suggesting that Sri Lanka has become a more attractive destination for foreign tourists, potentially due to better marketing, improved political stability, enhanced infrastructure, or other favourable conditions. There is no reliable published data on the number of local tourists staying in hotels in Sri Lanka.",
    "This suggests a gap in the available tourism data, making it difficult to accurately assess the domestic tourism market. It is assumed that the number of local tourists staying in hotels is much less than foreign tourists. It is estimated to be around 10%. This assumption could be based on anecdotal evidence or observations from industry stakeholders. To get a better understanding of the concept of \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 and how it\u2019s being used, we need to explore the history of the concept, and its origin and practice.",
    "The term \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 has its roots in American naval slang from the 1920s, a period following the conclusion of the First World War. During this time, life on naval ships was often monotonous and gruelling, with sailors enduring long stretches at sea, away from the comforts and diversions of shore life. To mitigate the tedium and boost morale, the Navy introduced designated periods known as \u2018Happy Hours\u2019.",
    "These \u2018Happy Hours\u2019 were intervals during which sailors could participate in various recreational activities, providing them with a much-needed break from their routine duties. The activities included playing cards, engaging in sports, and enjoying music and theatrical performances. This initiative aimed to relieve the sailors from the drudgery and mental strain of their demanding environment, fostering camaraderie and improving overall well-being among the crew.",
    "The concept was so effective that it eventually transcended its military origins, finding its way into civilian life. The term \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 gradually evolved to represent any scheduled period of leisure and relaxation, particularly in the context of social gatherings involving food and drink. Today, while its maritime origins may be largely forgotten, the essence of \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 as a time to unwind and enjoy oneself remains intact, providing a welcome respite from the rigors of daily life.",
    "For many, the 5 o\u2019clock \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 is considered the cornerstone of American working life. This daily ritual, deeply ingrained in the culture, offers a much-needed respite from the stress and demands of the workday. Whether an office worker in a bustling city or a tradesperson in a small town, heading to the bar for \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 symbolises a moment of luxury and relaxation; it is a time to loosen the proverbial tie, unwind, and engage in social interactions over a craft beer, a well-mixed cocktail, or even a glass of wine.",
    "Typically held between 4 pm and 8 pm, \u2018Happy Hours\u2019 have evolved beyond their origins as mere drink specials. They serve a dual purpose: allowing workers to relax and socialise and giving bars and restaurants a chance to boost their sales during what would otherwise be slower weekday shifts. By offering discounted drinks and appetizers, these establishments attract a diverse crowd eager to decompress and enjoy themselves before heading home or continuing their evening plans.",
    "\u2018Happy Hour\u2019 has become more than just a marketing strategy; it is a social institution. For many, it represents a communal experience where colleagues can bond, friendships can be forged, and the day\u2019s stresses can be momentarily forgotten. The ambiance during \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 is typically more laid-back and convivial, contrasting with the more formal or business-like atmosphere that characterises the daytime.",
    "In urban areas, \u2018Happy Hours\u2019 often cater to a wide range of tastes, with many bars and restaurants offering themed nights, live music, and innovative drink menus to attract patrons. This variety ensures something for everyone, whether one prefers a quiet corner in a cozy pub or a vibrant scene in a trendy cocktail bar. The popularity of \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 has also led to the rise of specialised establishments, such as craft beer bars and wine bars, each offering unique experiences tailored to specific preferences.",
    "Beyond individual enjoyment, \u2018Happy Hours\u2019 contribute to the local economy by driving foot traffic and increasing revenue for hospitality businesses. This influx of patrons during off-peak hours helps stabilize income for these establishments, ensuring they can thrive even during slower periods. In many ways, \u2018Happy Hours\u2019 have become a win-win situation: workers get well-deserved relaxation, and businesses benefit from the additional custom. Ultimately, the 5 o\u2019clock \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 embodies a quintessential aspect of American working life, blending relaxation, socialisation, and economic benefit. It highlights the importance of balance between work and leisure, reminding everyone that amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life, there is always time to unwind and get happy before dinnertime commences.",
    "During the same period, the United States was experiencing Prohibition, a largely unsuccessful attempt to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol. Naturally, Americans found ways to circumvent these restrictions, leading them to clandestine speakeasies, where they could enjoy beer or liquor before dinner. The term \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 emerged to describe those illicit gatherings.",
    "Today, frequenting bars for \u2018Happy Hours\u2019 is legal and has become a cherished tradition enjoyed by men and women across the United States. This social ritual spans a variety of venues, from upscale dining restaurants to cozy craft beer pubs, offering a diverse range of cocktails and select craft beers designed to help patrons unwind and ease into the workweek. The appeal of \u2018Happy Hours\u2019 lies not only in the discounted prices but also in the opportunity they provide for socializing and relaxation after a long day.",
    "Patrons\u2019 beverage preferences during \u2018Happy Hours\u2019 reflect a broad spectrum of tastes. According to a 2014 survey, beer emerged as the most popular choice, with 41% of respondents favouring it. Wine followed closely, with 31% of people preferring it, while 28% opted for hard liquor. These preferences highlight the diverse drinking culture that \u2018Happy Hours\u2019 cater to, ensuring there is something for everyone.",
    "In 2022, the craft brewing industry significantly contributed to the US economy, amounting to $72.2 billion. This impressive economic impact underscores the vital role that small and independent American craft brewers play in the nation\u2019s financial health. The influence of craft breweries extends far beyond producing unique and flavourful beers; they are pivotal drivers of state and local economies, fostering job creation and community development.",
    "The nearly 460,000 jobs generated by the craft brewing industry highlight its importance as a source of employment. These jobs span various roles, from brewers and quality control specialists to marketing professionals and sales representatives. Moreover, the industry supports numerous ancillary sectors, including agriculture, distribution, hospitality, and retail. The demand for locally sourced ingredients, such as hops and barley, stimulates agricultural production and benefits farmers. Meanwhile, the need for distribution services creates opportunities for logistics and transportation companies.",
    "Craft breweries also contribute to the vibrancy of their communities by attracting tourists and locals alike to taprooms and brewpubs. These establishments often become social hubs, hosting events, live music, and festivals that draw crowds and generate additional revenue for surrounding businesses. The presence of a successful craft brewery can revitalise a neighbourhood, spurring economic development and increasing property values.",
    "The economic ripple effect of the craft brewing industry is substantial. For every dollar spent on craft beer, a significant portion circulates back into the local economy, supporting other businesses and creating a multiplier effect. This economic activity helps to sustain local suppliers, artisans, and service providers, further embedding craft breweries within the fabric of their communities.",
    "Overall, the craft brewing industry\u2019s $72.2 billion contribution to the US economy in 2022 is a testament to the resilience and innovation of small and independent brewers.
