    "Raising a privilege issue in Parliament, MP Shanakiyan said that the incident occurred at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office at the Parliamentary complex when he went to meet the Prime Minister concerning an issue in Batticaloa.",
    "\u201cMP Rohitha Abeygunardena tried to assault me in the Parliament a short while ago. This happened in the Prime Minister\u2019s office within the Parliament complex. I have raised a privilege issue and am concerned for my safety as he has threatened to assault me outside Parliament as well,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cMP Abeygunawardena stating that I speak against the Government questioned how I can enter their Prime Minister\u2019s Office. He challenged me to walk out to the lift, after I had insisted that the Prime Minister was for the entire country,\u201d Shanakiyan explained.",

    "He said that State Minister Ashoka Priyantha had prevented MP Abeygunawardena from assaulting him, which was also witnessed by the staff at the PM\u2019s Office.",
    "MP Shanakiyan requested the matter to be raised before the Parliament Ethics and Privileges Committee, adding that in the event it is not raised, he will be forced to file a Police complaint as this incident was a threat to his life.",
    "Soon after taking to \u2018X\u2019 the MP noted that he has alerted the Speaker of the House about the incident today. This is not the first time where I have been threatened by SLPP members. The Parliament Privileges Committee has failed to investigate and take action against on previous instances, and it has now reached to a point of assault,\u201d he claimed."
