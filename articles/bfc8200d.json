  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the drafting of necessary legislation based on the recommendations of the K.T. Chitrasiri report to address and resolve the issues faced by Sri Lanka Cricket.",
    "A new constitution has been drafted by the said committee for Sri Lanka Cricket.",
    "Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the joint proposal presented by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Power and Energy, the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment and the Minister of Public Security to instruct the Legal Draftsman for preparation of a bill to formally approve and implement the new constitution.",
    "Known as the \u2018Chitrasiri Committee,\u2019 the panel proposed a structure where the SLC would be governed by an 18-member board of directors.",
    "The government stepped in to overhaul the structure when then sports minister Roshan Ranasinghe dismissed the current SLC administration, replacing it with an interim committee.",
    "Ranasinghe\u2019s decision resulted in Sri Lanka\u2019s ICC membership being suspended, and the SLC lost its right to host the U-19 World Cup, which was subsequently held in South Africa.",
    "The current SLC management election process has faced severe criticism for excessive vote buying aimed at maintaining the status quo at the helm of the organization.",
    "The proposed new law aims to set term limits while altering the voting structure to ensure fairer governance."
