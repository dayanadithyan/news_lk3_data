  "original_body_lines": [
    "Minister and Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara invited the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to a debate on their energy polices, the government\u2019s energy policy and allegations of corruption in the energy sector.",
    "In a post on \u2018X\u2019 (formerly Twitter), Wijesekara pointed out NPP\u2019s presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s recent statement that he will reduce the fuel prices by removing the Rs 50 per liter tax on fuel which was imposed in 2022, to recover the debt taken over by the Treasury.",
    "The Energy Minister, who highlighted that Dissanayake had said the debt has been recovered by now and the said tax could be removed, expressed his displeasure stating, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how they come up with these numbers and claims to mislead the public and the voters.\u201d",
    "Furthermore, Wijesekara wrote: \u201cThe President had to take unpopular but correct decisions to stabilize the economy and the energy sector. Due to those decisions we have an uninterrupted supply of fuel in the country.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Treasury took over Rs. 1,200 billion (USD 3,400 million) worth of CPC\u2019s (Ceylon Petroleum Corporation) debt in 2022 and imposed a Rs. 25 per liter tax initially and increased it in 2023 to Rs. 50 per liter tax to recover the debt by 2029. At the beginning of 2025 the estimated debt remaining will be Rs. 656 Billion. It will take the CPC another 4 years to repay the entire debt that was transferred to the Treasury\u201d, Minister Wijesekara clarified.",
    "Additionally, the minister stated that he \u201cwould like to know how AKD will reduce the Rs. 50 tax and bridge the gap of Rs. 656 billion remaining.\u201d",
    "\u201cIs he going to print money, obtain more loans to repay, increase other taxes or any other way?\u201d, the Minister questioned.",
    "\u201cI extend an invitation to NPP & SJB to debate on their energy polices, the governments energy policy and allegations of corruption in the energy sector\u201d, he added."
