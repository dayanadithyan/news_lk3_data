    "War and funding shortfalls have hampered progress toward the United Nations\u2019 flagship development goals which include action to combat climate change, the organization\u2019s Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Friday.",
    "In 2015, UN member states adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, 17 targets to transform the world by 2030 including by completely ending extreme poverty and eliminating hunger.",
    "But Guterres said Friday that \u201cthe world is getting a failing grade.\u201d",
    "\u201cOur failure to secure peace, to confront climate change, and to boost international finance is undermining development,\u201d he told a briefing in New York, unveiling the latest progress check on the targets.",
    "\u201cWe must accelerate action for the sustainable development goals, and we don\u2019t have a moment to lose \u2014 only 17 percent of the targets (are) on track.\u201d",
    "Efforts to devote money and attention to the goals have been repeatedly set back, including by the Covid-19 pandemic, the wars in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan, worsening climate catastrophes and sharp increases in the cost of living.",
    "While countries were lagging on progress in many areas, there were glimmers of hope in the reduction of new HIV infections, growing Internet access, and the \u201cbooming\u201d use of renewables, Guterres said.",
    "But \u201cthe denial of basic needs for so many is outrageous and inexcusable,\u201d he said.",
    "Guterres said action to bring peace to the major conflicts raging globally coupled with efforts toward a green transition were needed.",
    "\u201cIt means multiplying the lending capacity of multilateral development banks to provide more resources for climate action and sustainable development,\u201d he added."
