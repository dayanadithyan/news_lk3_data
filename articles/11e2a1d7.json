    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee opened wide at 301.50/302.50 to the US dollar Friday, as was quoted even wider at 301/303 to the dollar in early trade, dealers said, as dollar demand resumed following a 715 million dollar purchase of forex by the central bank in March.",
    "Sri Lanka has a deeply flawed non-floating ad hoc soft-peg arrangement found in all defaulting IMF advised countries, with inconsistent policies where external and domestic anchors conflict, critics have pointed out.",
    "In May 2023, after the central bank collected 666 million dollars amid panic sales by market participants when inconsistent peg was allowed to appreciate to 295 to the US dollar from 321 in April, the rupee came under pressure in the following two months.",
    "As the inconsistencies of the deadly flexible exchange rate clash, the rupee is quoted wide, spot trading disappears, moral suasion comes in and the spot next and one week market becomes active.",
    "The central bank then sold some dollars and also allowed the inconsistent peg to 329 eventually over the next few months.",
    "When the currency appreciates in a short time, banks sell down their open positions, with some going negative.",
    "Meanwhile importers also delay covering their bills as the rupee loses its usefulness as a denominator of future value, a basic attribute of a currency before \u2018age of inflation\u2019 central banking.",
    "However, despite inconsistent exchange rate policy, monetary policy has been broadly deflationary on a net basis (the million rupee purchase also injected around 200 billion rupees to the market from foreign assets) over many months.",
    "The Interbank market however is currently also awash in rupees, with part of the money \u2018printed\u2019 by the central bank\u2019s various liquidity tools.",
    "Excess liquidity climbed to 155 billion rupees on April 18, and a 12.10 billion rupee overnight injection was made, despite the rupee weakening over the week.",
    "Separately 107 billion rupees have been injected through term deals to date.",
    "Analysts have urged the central bank not to encourage banks to trade without real deposits, using printed money, if the country wants to maintain external stability and avoid a second default but to have a penalty rate at least one percent higher than ceiling policy rate for its standing facility.",
    "This time President Ranil Wickremesinghe also said the rupee will be brought down to 280 or 270 to the dollar, further firing uncertainty over exchange rate stability and encouraging importer hold offs.",
    "There is however a somewhat \u2018psychological\u2019 295 level that was reached in May 2023 among some market participants.",
    "Various values can be attributed to the note issue of bad money central banks through mathematical or statistical models and completely rejecting economic principles explained by classical economists before \u2018age of inflation\u2019 central banking emerged from the 1920s.",
    "The policy rate was suddenly invented by the Fed without political debate or parliament (congressional) approval in the 1920s and the Great Depression followed within a decade.",
    "\u201cIf President Wickremesinghe is serious about a strong rupee, he will have to bring a law like the Bank Charter Act as Prime Minister Robert Peel to restrain the liquidity operations of the Bank of England and fix the exchange rate,\u201d says EN\u2019s economic columnist Bellwether.",
    "\u201cThis can perhaps not be done as long as the IMF program is in force. The current monetary law which legalizes printing money for growth also cannot be changed without offending the IMF.\u201d (Colombo/Apr19/2024 \u2013 UPDATE II)"
