    "Following information received from a three-wheeler driver via the \u2018119\u2019 police emergency hotline regarding the abduction, Aladeniya Police had acted immediately and reportedly apprehended the suspects along with the van in question within an hour.",
    "According to police, one of the arrested suspects had been involved in a relationship with the teenage girl, despite him already being married. The suspect, a former army soldier from Avissawella, and his friends had hired a van to carry out the abduction, police said.",
    "The relationship had begun after the suspect had visited the girl\u2019s brother, also an army soldier, at his home in Polonnaruwa on multiple occasions. Upon discovering that the suspect was married, the girl had ended the relationship. However, due to continuous threats from the suspect, the girl\u2019s parents had moved her to a house in the Kulugammana area.",
