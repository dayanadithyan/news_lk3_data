    "Sri Lanka\u2019s economic recovery hangs in the balance as politics threatens to derail critical reforms, well known economist Emeritus Prof. Sirimevan Colombage warns.",
    "Speaking at the launch of the book \u2018Reforming Macroeconomic Policies for Stability and Growth: Sri Lanka\u2019s Road to Economic Recovery\u2019 at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, Colombo 07 recently, Emeritus Professor Colombage of the Open University of Sri Lanka stressed the importance of prioritizing sound economic management over political agendas.",
    "According to him, Sri Lanka must focus on reducing the fiscal deficit and encourage foreign investment to achieve long-term economic growth and stability.",
    "Colombage added: \u2018Sri Lanka\u2019s economy must be prepared to service its debt repayments by 2028. With a projected growth rate of three per cent in the medium term, this figure is insufficient to significantly reduce unemployment or poverty.",
    "\u2018It is essential to cut the fiscal deficit to reduce pressure on the domestic capital market and provide financial resources to the private sector, especially in boosting exports. A robust recovery package, is critical to improving the country\u2019s global credit rankings and attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).",
    "\u2018The IMF\u2019s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) is a key component in reviving the economy. It offers Sri Lanka much-needed \u201cbreathing space\u201d to pursue debt restructuring and improve the country\u2019s international image.",
    "\u2018However, I doubt the existence of the political will to maintain the program, especially in light of the upcoming presidential elections.",
    "\u2018Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis stemmed from years of imprudent macroeconomic policies, particularly between 2019 and 2022, when ill-conceived policy decisions deepened existing imbalances.",
    "\u2018The 2019 tax cuts, money printing and fixed exchange rates were major triggers for the crisis, resulting in high inflation, capital outflows and a foreign exchange shortage. As a result, Sri Lanka\u2019s debt now stands at 116% of its GDP, with external debt reaching USD 43.3 billion.",
    "\u2018With the presidential election looming, politically- motivated fiscal policies could jeopardize the country\u2019s recovery. Various candidates have proposed salary hikes and other populist measures, which could undermine fiscal consolidation efforts.",
    "\u2018Such promises may help win votes but will ultimately fuel inflation and deepen the country\u2019s economic woes.",
    "\u2018Sri Lanka has a history of \u201cstop-go\u201d economic reforms, where initiatives are often abandoned midway for political reasons.",
    "\u2018The same fate could befall the current recovery plan. \u201cGood politics is often bad economics.\u201d \u2018",
    "\u2018The Expert Committee on Public Service Salary Disparities recommended an increase in the basic salary of public servants by 24% to over 50% from next January. It is reported that the President has endorsed the proposed salary increase. Other presidential candidates too have followed suit, offering similar or higher salary hikes. This is good politics and bad economics.",
    "\u2018While such a salary hike may be justifiable to compensate for the rise in cost of living, it is questionable whether the so-called Expert Committee considered its adverse effects on government expenditure, fiscal deficit and more importantly on the macroeconomic policy reforms under the IMF-EFF program. The proposed salary hike, if implemented, would be a discretionary decision that is likely to create pro-cyclical effects, aggravating the economic crisis.",
    "\u2018Reduction of the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio from around eight percent at present to five percent in 2025 and to 4.2 by 2028 is a major policy target of the recovery package.",
    "\u2018The proposed salary increase will jeopardise the fiscal consolidation, causing a significant rise in the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio from 2025 onwards.",
    "\u2018In 2023, the public sector salary bill amounted to Rs. 940 billion. A minimum 24% salary increase, as suggested by the Expert Committee, will incur an additional cost of around Rs. 225 billion to the government.\u2019",
