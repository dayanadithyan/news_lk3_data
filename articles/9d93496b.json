    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 A doctors\u2019 professional association has written to President Ranil Wickremesinghe demanding that the government revoke plans to approve the establishment of private medical universities in Sri Lanka.",
    "Secretary of the All Ceylon Medical Officers Association Jayantha Bandara told reporters on Wednesday March 20 that the association would take trade union action against the decision if the government did not revoke it.",
    "Bandara spoke to the reporters outside the Presidential Secretariat having just handed over the letter to an official.",
    "\u201cThe government is again trying to create a major problem in the country,\u201d he said.",
    "Bandara, a medical doctor, claimed that the issue of private medical universities has led to confrontational situations in the country over the recent past and also led to problems in education and health sectors.",
    "\u201cThe government is ready to approve and open several private universities,\u201d he said, asking if it was a priority at the moment.",
    "\u201cThis is clearly not something that\u2019s needed now. Without doing what needs to be done, the government is starting private universities that will destory our country\u2019s education and health,\u201d he said.",
    "Bandara did not elaborate on how private medical universities might destroy either education or health.",
    "He said existing state-run medical faculties including recently opened ones are facing a major crisis, with massive shortages of academic staff and resource constraints, which he said has caused a breakdown in education.",
    "\u201cIn the health service, doctors and medical staff are leaving the country. A major crisis has been created in the health service. What is the government doing in the meantime? They\u2019re trying to create private universities,\u201d said Bandara.",
    "In their letter to the president, the All Ceylon Medical Officers Association demands that the government provide facilities to existing state-run faculties and take measures to curb the departure of lecturers.",
    "\u201cAlso provide solutions to medical and other staff shortages in the health sector,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe first ask that the government revoke this decision immediately. Or we\u2019ll take the maximum action we can take as the All Ceylon Medical Officers Association\u00a0 in due course,\u201d he added. (Colombo/Mar20/2024)"
