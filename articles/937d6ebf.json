    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka plans to recruit and train teachers to educate children with special needs, State Minister of Education Aravindh Kumar has said.",
    "\u201cWe need to have enough teachers for this area,\u201d Kumar said on Friday. \u201cAs of now we\u2019re lacking in this area, and we are on the verge of increasing our teachers in the area of special education.\u201d",
    "\u201cOnce we get enough and more, it will be a common subject in every school.\u201d",
    "Special needs may include learning disabilities or special educational needs such as dyslexia, ADHD or Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, which require extra attention, or students may need to be taught skills to keep up with the syllabi.",
    "The lack of facilities and training for staff has undermined the education of students with special needs.",
    "A UNICEF study conducted in 2016 showed that 23.5 percent of Sri Lankan students living with disabilities are excluded from mainstream education.",
    "\u201cWith regard to Colombo, people are aware of special education needs and the therapies,\u201d Special Education Needs Teacher, Angel Lydia Zechariah, told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cHowever, with those living in poverty, they only take their children to Lady Ridgeway [Hospital] where they have group therapy and not one-on-one therapies.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhen it comes to the other parts of Sri Lanka people often assume a learning disability is a generational curse or possession by the devil.\u201d",
    "Zechariah said that these students face bullying and face limited employment opportunities as few organizations are willing to employ them. (Colombo/July13/2024)"
