  "original_body_lines": [
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member Prof. Charitha Herath has called for Sri Lanka to appoint a leader capable of managing the country\u2019s economy, not merely its debt. Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Herath addressed the current economic situation and the forthcoming political changes.",
    "Herath highlighted that the broad economic crisis has now evolved into a debt crisis. He criticised the prevailing focus on debt management, which he believes has led to a misconception that the ideal Presidential candidate is one who excels in debt management.",
    "\u201cThis is wrong. No matter who is appointed, he must manage debt, but the reason for choosing a new President should not be his ability to manage debt. It should be someone with a broad vision to manage the economy,\u201d Herath asserted.",
    "He warned that economic management has been overshadowed by an excessive focus on debt management.",
    "Herath also noted that July will be a pivotal month for Sri Lankan politics as from 17 July onwards, the Election Commission will be constitutionally empowered to call for a Presidential election. He declared that the President\u2019s \u201cCaucasian Chalk Circle\u201d would end in another 100 days, leading to significant political change.",
    "\u201cIn 100 days, a new President will be appointed. In other words, the Caucasian Chalk Circle being staged by the President will end in 100 days, and there will be political change,\u201d Herath stated.",
    "He referenced the President\u2019s Parliamentary address yesterday, where the President described the new political situation in the country as \u201cdisaster IMF-ism.\u201d Herath pointed out: \u201cthe main word in Sri Lankan politics today is IMF.\u201d"
