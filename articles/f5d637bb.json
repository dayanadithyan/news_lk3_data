    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 President Ranil Wickremesinghe will contest the presidential election from a new alliance, Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said.",
    "\u201cThe president will be nonpartisan. He will contest from a separate alliance,\u201d Fernando told reporters.",
    "\u201cWait a little. It\u2019ll happen,\u201d he said, presumably to a question about why the president still hasn\u2019t officially announced his intention to contest.",
    "Fernando also claimed that most people supporting the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) are those who enthusiastically voted for another party in 2019.",
    "\u201cPeople think they\u2019ll be cleansed of their sins if they attack us and throw their lot in with a new party. But if you look closely, most people supporting the NPP are those who enthusiastically voted in 2019 and have now gone to that side. It\u2019s not the same 3 percent that was there then,\u201d he said.",
    "The minister also had a word of caution for NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake who intends to contest the presidential poll on the NPP ticket.",
    "\u201cHe will also be in for a time taking those sorts to his side,\u201d said Fernando.",
    "NPP member Sunil Handunneththi speaking to reporters said neither President Wickremesinghe nor the likes of MP Harsha de Silva, who is responsible for formulating the economic policy of the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), can save Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about bankruptcy now, who is responsible for that? It was Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Rajpaksas that bankrupted this country. It was under Wickremesinghe that the country went for the highest number of international sovereign bonds (ISBs). There\u2019s no point asking us for our support to solve the country\u2019s problems under his presidency after making even the unborn children of this country indebted,\u201d said Handunneththi.",
    "\u201cWickremesinghe and his administration and groups like Harsha de Silva have all proved that they cannot save this country,\u201d he said.",
    "The NPP currently leads at least one voting intention poll. (Colombo/Mar13/2024)"
