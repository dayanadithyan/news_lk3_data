    "Colombo, March 18 (Daily Mirror)- Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne has resigned from the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) protesting against the appointment of ineligible members to the committee.",
    "\u201cIt is dissatisfying that members who have been appointed to COPE have allegations against their personal conduct, particularly on financial transactions. This also contributes to citizen\u2019s loss of confidence in Parliament,\u201d he said in his letter of resignation which was sent to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana."
