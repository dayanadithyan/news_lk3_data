    "The Best Bank award was presented to Commercial Bank at the FinanceAsia Country Awards gala at the Ritz Carlton in Hong Kong on 27th June. The Bank\u2019s Chief Risk Officer Mr Kapila Hettihamu accepted the award on behalf of the Bank.",
    "Commenting on this latest international honour conferred on the Bank, Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Sanath Manatunge said: \u201cThis recognition underscores the Bank\u2019s strategic agility and excellence in delivering outstanding performance across multiple areas of assessment, despite fluctuating external environmental factors. It also reflects our consistent ability to thrive in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting our strategic foresight and operational integrity. This accolade is a testament to our long-term vision, steadfast dedication, and the trust our stakeholders place in us.\u201d",
    "Other Country Award winners ranked alongside Commercial Bank as the Best Domestic Banks in their respective countries at this year\u2019s FinanceAsia awards were Bank of China (Hong Kong), CTBC (Taiwan), Bank Mandiri (Indonesia), Public Bank (Malaysia), Techcombank (Vietnam), Allied Bank (Pakistan), and City Bank (Bangladesh).",
    "Announcing this year\u2019s winners, FinanceAsia said: \u201cWhile we still see choppy financial markets amid high interest rates, it is worth pausing to recognise leading financial institutions across Asia that have performed well and made waves in these volatile times. The goal posts have not changed: each of Asia\u2019s markets is bound by net zero commitments; and digital transformation continues to drive regulatory discourse and development around emerging sectors and virtual assets. As a result, sustainability and digitisation continue to be underlying themes shaping a new paradigm for deal-making in the region.\u201d",
