    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A planned bill to regulate micro-finance organizations has been challenged in the Supreme Court by traditional community organizations which provide savings and credit, according to a statement.",
    "The proposed bill  is \u201cintrusive and violate the autonomy of community organisations such as Death Donations and Welfare Societies, Sarvodaya Shramadana Societies and Women\u2019s Organisations engaged in community savings and credit providing activities for generations before modern micro-finance began,\u201d they say.",
    "The community based organizations have also complained that larger finance companies which also provide micro-finance and where concerns have been raised about \u201cpredatory lending\u201d, appear to be excluded.",
    "Regulating for the sake of regulating will harm these community-based initiatives and trample on low-income people\u2019s autonomy and traditional rights to organise their credit services, petitioners have said.",
    "They also say that the proposed Bill falls short of protecting microfinance victims as it lacks legal enforcement.",
    "Community-based credit providers, too, have also raised the issue of big finance companies in creating a \u201cdebt deluge by issuing \u2018quick and easy\u2019 loans to low-income women\u201d. (Colombo/Jan24/2024)"
