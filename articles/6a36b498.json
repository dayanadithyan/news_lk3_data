    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka has no intention of introducing new indirect taxes or increasing existing indirect taxes, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said, disputing claims that prices are set to increase again.",
    "\u201cWe do not intend to introduce more indirect taxes going forward. I must be very clear about that. There is no plan to increase percentages of existing indirect taxes either,\u201d Siyambalapitiya said speaking to journalists.",
    "The state minister said the government is looking to expand the direct tax base so as to increase state revenue and facilitate a reduction in indirect taxes and the burden they place on consumers.",
    "\u201cIf anyone says prices are increasing once again due to indirect taxes, I don\u2019t see any truth in that,\u201d he said.",
    "Siyambalapitiiya called the proposed wealth tax, to be introduced in 2025, \u201cvery progressive\u201d.",
    "\u201cThis will see a specific amount of tax levied from people who own more property. But there is clearly no intention of introducing another indirect tax that will increase the price of goods,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYes, there is is a problem. No one will deny this. The people are really struggling to live. But we\u2019re working hard to find solutions to it. I believe there are commendable aspects to those solutions,\u201d he said.",
    "Earlier in January, Siyamabalapitiya said the government intends to shift the balance in direct versus indirect tax, which currently stands at 30 and 40 percent respectively.",
    "\u201cThis adjustment aligns with the conditions of developed countries and promotes social justice. In a population of one million capable taxpayers, only 500,000 individuals are currently fulfilling this obligation. Identifying tax evaders and bringing them into the tax net is crucial to reduce indirect taxes,\u201d he said.",
    "In developed nations, he said, being a taxpayer is acknowledged as a sign of a robust citizen actively contributing to the nation\u2019s stability. Siyambalapitiya expressed his confidence that Sri Lankans will undergo a \u201cpositive shift in attitude, fostering development within the nation\u201d. (Colombo/Jan29/2024)"
