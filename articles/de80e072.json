    "US Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy Elizabeth Allen has raised concerns that several aspects of the freedom of expression are currently under threat globally, including certain concerns in Sri Lanka.",
    "Speaking at an event hosted by the Sri Lanka Press Institute (SLPI) Press Club themed \u2018The Global Media Space and its Impact on Democracy\u2019, Under Secretary Allen stated that several essential freedoms are under threat globally, including in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cGlobally, we\u2019re witnessing serious and escalating challenges to media freedom. The United States stands firmly for the freedom of expression, advocating for press freedom both online and offline, and ensuring the safety of journalists and media workers worldwide.\u00a0 Unfortunately, these essential freedoms are under threat globally, including concerns raised here in Sri Lanka\u201d, she said.",
    "Speaking on the recent passage of the Online Safety Bill in Sri Lanka, the US Under Secretary recalled that the US government \u201cvoiced concerns over its potential effects on freedom of expression, innovation, and privacy\u201d.",
    "\u201cWhen governments intensify efforts to withhold information from the public by restricting internet access and censoring content, we must speak up\u201d, she noted.",
    "While highlighting that although there are several concerns against unfettered freedom of expression, Under Secretary Allen emphasised that \u201cIt\u2019s essential to remember that a free press isn\u2019t an adversary to Sri Lanka; it\u2019s one of its greatest allies, paving the way for a resilient and flourishing society\u201d.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s common to hear arguments against unfettered freedom of expression.\u00a0 Critics claim the media is biased, aiming to embarrass governments and undermine public trust.\u00a0 Others worry that without checks, freedom of expression may fuel the spread of misinformation.\u00a0 Some argue that an unchecked press can incite tension and compromise security.\u00a0 And there\u2019s concern that continuous reports on corruption, violence, and political strife can tarnish a nation\u2019s image, deterring investment and hampering development\u201d, she said in this regard.",
    "Thank you, Kumar, for that warm introduction.\u00a0 It\u2019s fantastic to be here with everyone today, truly.\u00a0 And Ambassador Chung, thank you for your leadership in representing the American people in Sri Lanka.",
    "I\u2019m thrilled to be here today, thanks to the Sri Lanka Press Institute.\u00a0 Your dedication to journalism\u2019s craft is nothing short of inspiring.",
    "Know this: the U.S. Embassy is all in on supporting your incredible work.\u00a0 Sure, we might bump heads over a story now and then, but above all, we\u2019re your biggest fans.\u00a0 We\u2019re all in on programs that hone your skills because we believe in your right to pursue journalism freely and fearlessly.",
    "As I find myself in front of a room of journalists, I want to thank you for protecting the rights and freedoms of journalists here in Sri Lanka and around the world, ensuring all citizens enjoy the right to express their ideas and opinions openly and freely.\u00a0 Even in difficult times, you continue to press forward and ask difficult questions.\u00a0 Your commitment to seeking out the truth and shouting it from the rooftops remains a democratic staple, and I truly appreciate what you do.",
    "It\u2019s only fitting that I begin my remarks this afternoon by telling a story that I think is relevant in light of today\u2019s topic about the media\u2019s role in a democracy.",
    "Over a century ago, American media coined the term \u201cmuckraker\u201d for journalists who delved into societal issues, exposing corruption.",
    "Although the term carried a somewhat negative connotation, labeling these journalists as mere \u201cgossip mongers,\u201d today, we honor them as the pioneers of investigative journalism.",
    "These muckrakers played a pivotal role in ushering in the Progressive Era, a time of significant social and political reform in American history.",
    "Even President Theodore Roosevelt referred to them as \u201cmuckrakers,\u201d criticizing their focus on society\u2019s flaws through figures like Lincoln Steffens, whose work shed light on corruption and spurred a nationwide call for accountability and reform.",
    "Steffens\u2019 book \u2018The Shame of the Cities,\u2019 published in 1904, made him renowned for uncovering corruption within American cities, highlighting the nefarious links between political leaders, businesses, and organized crime.",
    "His fearless journalism raised critical awareness about the urgent need for governmental and corporate accountability.\u00a0 Steffens wasn\u2019t acting as a public relations officer for the government; his role was to uncover the truth; however unpleasant it might be.",
    "Faced with the stark realities Steffens presented, American officials and the public were compelled to confront a pivotal question: \u2018Is this the kind of country we aspire to be?\u2019 The resounding answer was no.",
    "Steffens\u2019 work didn\u2019t just expose wrongdoing; it sparked a nationwide demand for reform and played a crucial role in fostering a dialogue about the essential role of investigative journalism in ensuring power remains accountable.",
    "This story showcases how freedom of the press and freedom of expression are not just fundamental human rights, they are also vital contributors to a country\u2019s development and growth.",
    "This brings me to my main point: how the global media space supports democracy and fosters peaceful, just, and inclusive societies.",
    "In my mind, the correlation is obvious: When a government constricts the rights and freedoms of its citizens, the future and the development of the country will naturally suffer.",
    "Globally, we\u2019re witnessing serious and escalating challenges to media freedom. The United States stands firmly for the freedom of expression, advocating for press freedom both online and offline, and ensuring the safety of journalists and media workers worldwide.\u00a0 Unfortunately, these essential freedoms are under threat globally, including concerns raised here in Sri Lanka.",
    "When governments intensify efforts to withhold information from the public by restricting internet access and censoring content, we must speak up.\u00a0 Notably, when Sri Lanka\u2019s Parliament passed the Online Safety Bill in January, the United States voiced concerns over its potential effects on freedom of expression, innovation, and privacy.",
    "It\u2019s common to hear arguments against unfettered freedom of expression.\u00a0 Critics claim the media is biased, aiming to embarrass governments and undermine public trust.\u00a0 Others worry that without checks, freedom of expression may fuel the spread of misinformation.",
    "Some argue that an unchecked press can incite tension and compromise security.\u00a0 And there\u2019s concern that continuous reports on corruption, violence, and political strife can tarnish a nation\u2019s image, deterring investment and hampering development.",
    "However, the media\u2019s bias should lean towards the public\u2019s interest, acting as a guardian to ensure that leaders fulfill their duties.\u00a0 This principle holds in Sri Lanka, the United States, and globally.",
    "The challenge of negative press, often labeled as \u201cfake news\u201d or \u201cbiased journalism,\u201d is not new.\u00a0 For generations, governments and the media have navigated a complex, sometimes adversarial relationship.\u00a0 This dynamic isn\u2019t unique to any one nation; in the United States, for instance, presidents from both major political parties have experienced their share of friction with the press.",
    "This tension, a hallmark of democratic societies, plays a crucial role in fostering transparency and encouraging effective governance.\u00a0 It\u2019s a familiar scene: politicians and journalists engage in heated exchanges, especially when leaders feel their actions are misrepresented, leading to accusations of inaccuracies and biased reporting.",
    "The press\u2019s duty is to deliver facts as they stand, shedding light on the government\u2019s achievements as well as spotlighting areas where policies or programs fall short.\u00a0 This transparency not only informs the public but also strengthens the nation as it encourages constructive action and improvement.",
    "And suppressing voices only complicates matters further.\u00a0 Attempting to conceal issues rather than addressing them is akin to hiding a broken tool rather than fixing it.\u00a0 True progress comes from collaborative dialogue, even if it means embracing the messiness of public discourse.",
    "This was evident during my recent visit to IdeaHell here in Colombo, a hub for creative minds dubbed \u201cwhere good ideas go to die.\u201d\u00a0 My interaction with the young, innovative minds there underscored the critical need to protect the freedom for creators, journalists, and entrepreneurs to explore and innovate without fear.\u00a0 Yes, some good ideas die, but creators should be free to think and attempt and even fail.\u00a0 That is how we achieve progress.",
    "Overly broad and ambiguous limitations on expression can choke creativity, robbing society of potential advancements that fuel innovation and economic growth.\u00a0 A climate of censorship not only stifles innovation but also dampens the community\u2019s spirit to solve pressing issues with novel solutions.",
    "I urge you to reflect on the initial spark that drew you to journalism.\u00a0 It\u2019s doubtful it was the allure of wealth or fame; more likely, it was a drive to enact change and contribute to Sri Lanka\u2019s betterment.\u00a0 Should these be the forces that drive you, I implore you to persevere.\u00a0 Your dedication, your rights, and your freedom are pivotal to the nation\u2019s ongoing growth and prosperity.",
    "Consider this: among you, who will emerge as the modern-day Lincoln Steffens?\u00a0 Who will pen the narratives that propel Sri Lanka\u2019s economic and social advancement?\u00a0 That individual could very well be among us now, ready to champion free speech, press freedom, and the unbridled exchange of ideas.\u00a0 It\u2019s essential to remember that a free press isn\u2019t an adversary to Sri Lanka; it\u2019s one of its greatest allies, paving the way for a resilient and flourishing society."
