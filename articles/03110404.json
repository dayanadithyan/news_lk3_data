    "Slams President for working towards destroying judicial system and rule of law",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Mujibur Rahman has accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of trying to hold on to power while letting the country descend into anarchy.",
    "Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Rahman criticised the President for attempting to violate the Constitution. \u201cHe is allowing the country to descend into anarchy for the benefit of himself and his group. He is also making a concerted effort to undermine democracy and the rule of law,\u201d accused Rahman.",
    "The SJB MP said the President is using various tactics to obstruct elections, including filing Fundamental Rights petitions on the President\u2019s tenure and elections through various third parties and presenting the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution in Parliament.",
    "Meanwhile, Rahman stated that despite Wickremesinghe\u2019s invitation to the SJB to join him, none of the party\u2019s MPs will support the President. \u201cHe knows he is unable to win with the group which bankrupted the country backing him. Therefore, he is inviting the SJB group to join him. However no SJB MP will extend their support to the President,\u201d he said.",
    "According to the MP, the President is afraid of the elections, but the law will not allow him to halt them. \u201cHe will have to hold elections whether he likes it or not,\u201d he said.",
    "Rahman also said that, during his tenure, the President has attempted to control the judiciary. Despite his facade of being a democratic leader, he is working towards destroying the judicial system and the rule of law.",
    "He recalled that, despite Wickremesinghe\u2019s claims of having no power to appoint an Acting IGP, it was Wickremesinghe himself who appointed former IGP C.D. Wickremeratne as Acting IGP on three occasions.",
    "\u201cThe President is not only violating the Constitution to remain in power, but he is also attempting to create chaos and allow the country to descend into anarchy,\u201d he alleged.",
    "He assured that the SJB will defeat all conspiracies hatched by Wickremesinghe and emerge victorious in the elections."
