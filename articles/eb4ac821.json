    "CNN, Feb 08 -\u00a0 A volcano in Iceland erupted on Thursday for the second time this year, pumping lava up to 80 metres (260 feet) into the air in what is the sixth outbreak on the southwestern Reykjanes peninsula since 2021.",
    "Live video from the area showed fountains of bright-orange molten rock spewing from fissures in the ground, in sharp contrast to the still-dark night sky.",
    "\u201cWarning: A volcanic eruption started north of Sylingarfell,\u201d the country\u2019s meteorological office said on its website.",
    "Intense earthquake activity began around 5:30 a.m. and the outbreak itself started some 30 minutes later, it added.",
    "The eruptive fissure was roughly 3 km (2 miles) long, the Met Office said, adding that the outbreak was believed to be in the same location as a Dec. 18 eruption.",
    "The nearby geothermal spa Blue Lagoon had closed on Thursday, it said.",
    "The previous eruption in the area started on Jan. 14 and lasted roughly two days, with lava flows reaching the outskirts of the Grindavik fishing town, whose nearly 4,000 inhabitants had been evacuated, setting some houses alight.",
    "Thursday\u2019s eruption took place some way from Grindavik and was unlikely to pose a direct threat to the town, Icelandic geophysicist Ari Trausti Gudmundsson told Reuters.",
    "\u201cBut it could pose some threat to the road to Grindavik and it could pose some threat to the power plant and even to the Blue Lagoon,\u201d he said, adding that the risk depended on how much lava ultimately flowed from the ground.",
    "The Reykjanes outbreaks are so-called fissure eruptions which are often referred to as Icelandic-type. They do not usually result in large explosions or significant production of ash dispersed into the stratosphere."
