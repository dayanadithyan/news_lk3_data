    "As part of the company\u2019s global expansion plans, the foray into Sri Lanka will also support Garuda in capitalising on the country\u2019s strategic location and drone-friendly regulatory environment, Garuda Aerospace said.",
    "The company said it is looking to spread its presence in at least 50 countries over the next few years, and has set aside USD 10 million, of the over Rs 100 crore revenue it delivered in FY24, to fuel the international growth.",
    "\u201cThis (expansion into Sri Lanka) isn\u2019t merely about growth, it\u2019s about unlocking the full potential of drone technology to create substantial impacts across various sectors. Sri Lanka\u2019s diverse landscape allows us to showcase how our innovative solutions can bring tangible benefits, from agriculture to infrastructure,\u201d said Agnishwar Jayaprakash, Founder and CEO of Garuda Aerospace.",
    "Garuda Aerospace, which produces small and medium category drones, had partnered with Greek manufacturer Spirit Aeronautical Systems early this year. It has also signed a pact with French aerospace giant Thales to promote growth and innovation in India\u2019s drone sector."
