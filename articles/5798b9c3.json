  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has reiterated its unwavering commitment to upholding the Rule of Law and safeguarding the independence of the judiciary, while addressing recent remarks made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament regarding the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the \u2018Gender Equality Bill\u2019.",
    "In a statement issued on Wednesday (19), the BASL emphasized that the Supreme Court has executed its constitutional duty by evaluating the bill\u2019s alignment with supreme law of the land.",
    "\u201cWhile individuals have the right to agree or disagree, neither the legislature nor the executive should criticize the Court for performing its duty to the people,\u201d the BASL stressed.",
    "The BASL\u2019s response comes after President Wickremesinghe\u2019s remarks in Parliament on June 18, 2024, where he referred to the Supreme Court\u2019s actions as \u2018Judicial Cannibalism\u2019 and suggested the formation of a select committee to review the Court\u2019s determination. The BASL expressed grave concern over the relevant statement, viewing it as an attempt to undermine judicial independence and force through a Bill which has been decided to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.",
    "\u201cThe judiciary should be allowed to function independently and free from any kind of external pressure,\u201d the BASL asserted. The association further condemned the President\u2019s comments as \u201ca threat to the Supreme Court and to the entire judicial system in discharging the judicial function of the republic conferred by the Constitution.\u201d",
    "The BASL warned that establishing a parliamentary select committee to review the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the constitutionality of a bill would set a dangerous precedent.",
    "\u201cIt is the duty of both the executive and the legislature to respect the judiciary\u2019s functions. Any interference could lead to severe adverse consequences and pose a significant threat to the Rule of Law in the country,\u201d the BASL cautioned."
