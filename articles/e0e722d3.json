    "The Planters\u2019 Association of Ceylon (PA) held its 170th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on September 14, 2024, at The Galadari Hotel in Colombo. The event, graced by the presence of Chief Guest, Mohan Pandithage, Chairman and Chief Executive of the Hayleys Group, marked a pivotal moment for the nation\u2019s plantation industry.",
    "The AGM witnessed the formal handover of leadership from outgoing Chairman, Senaka Alawattegama, to Sunil Poholiyadde, who assumes the role for his second term. The transition comes at a critical juncture for the industry, facing significant challenges and opportunities.",
    "In his final address, Alawattegama reflected on the substantial progress made during his tenure, notably the successful resolution of long-standing wage negotiations. He highlighted the introduction of a new wage structure that includes a daily minimum wage of Rs. 1,350 and a productivity-linked component of Rs. 50 per kilogram. This achievement, he noted, represents a significant victory for both workers and Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs), accomplished despite considerable challenges and pressures.",
    "\u201cAs we move forward, decisions related to wages and policies must be made with the best interests of the entire industry\u2014including workers\u2014at heart,\u201d Alawattegama stated. \u201cWe must ensure that our industry remains affordable and sustainable so that it can thrive for generations to come.\u201d",
    "Taking over the helm, Poholiyadde delivered an incisive speech outlining his vision for the future. He commended the industry\u2019s collective resilience in successfully navigating the recent wage crisis, which had been considered a potential existential threat to the industry.",
    "\u201cOn May 1st, 2024, a proposed wage increase to Rs. 1,700\u2014a 70% hike\u2014threatened to cripple our industry,\u201d Poholiyadde remarked. \u201cRecognizing the gravity of the situation, the PA took unprecedented steps, including legal action up to the Supreme Court. Our persistent efforts resulted in a more sustainable wage agreement, a testament to what we can achieve when we unite.\u201d",
    "Emphasizing the crucial role of innovation and technology in overcoming current challenges, Poholiyadde asserted, \u201cWe must embrace innovation to sustain our industry. Mechanization can provide relief, especially with our diminishing labor force.\u201d He highlighted that since 1992, the industry has lost 50% of its workforce, adversely affecting production volumes. \u201cWe may not reach even 250 million kilograms of tea this year, although the industry had initially targeted over 300 million.\u201d",
    "Poholiyadde also underscored the necessity of adopting new technologies, mechanization, and automation in both field and factory operations to enhance productivity and remain competitive globally. \u201cThe technology exists globally; it\u2019s a matter of us embracing and implementing it,\u201d he said.
