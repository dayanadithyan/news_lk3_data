    "Dr. Kingsley Bernard, CIOB President Dr. Rohan Karunaratne and Secretary Eng. Saliya Kaluarachchi",
    "The Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) says the SLEDB can support the exports of the construction industry to boost foreign exchange earnings.",
    "\u201cThis is the best time for the Construction Industry to look for opportunities overseas. This is because; due to the economic crisis, over 60% of the construction industry in Sri Lanka has been halted,\u201d CIOB President Dr. Rohan Karunaratne said.",
    "\u201cMany contractors are trying to accrue overseas projects and the main barrier for them is the Central Bank ruling which restricts cross-border guarantees and capital funding to establish abroad,\u201d he added.",
    "According to CIOB, the CBSL is allowing only $ 1 million for cross border guarantees which is severely insufficient and does not even begin to scratch the surface of contractors\u2019 requirements.",
    "Dr. Karunaratne acknowledged EDB is supporting the industry to request these limits to be increased.",
    "\u201cIf the Government really supports our contractors to establish and accrue foreign projects, we can bring billions of dollars within a couple of years,\u201d he added.",
    "According to Karunaratne, the CIOB has proved that the construction cost in Sri Lanka is now on par with neighbouring countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia and therefore, Sri Lanka is in a position to attract overseas projects and also foreign investors.",
    "CIOB Chief recalled that it was President Ranil Wickremasinghe who inspired the private sector to do a comprehensive analysis and comparison on the construction cost of Sri Lanka and neighbouring countries.",
    "\u201cCIOB successfully achieved this goal, together with architects, engineers, quantity surveyors, contractors, material suppliers etc. Sri Lankan construction cost has reduced to levels in par with its neighbouring countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam etc.) Therefore, we invite EDB to support us in exporting our Construction Industry and bringing in much needed dollars to Sri Lanka,\u201d Dr. Karunaratne added."
