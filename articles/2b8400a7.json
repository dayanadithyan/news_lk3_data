  "original_body_lines": [
    "Several health sector trade unions have decided to launch a token strike at all hospitals in the Central Province on Monday (13) over their demands.",
    "Accordingly, the Health Trade Union Alliance stated the strike which commences tomorrow will gradually be expanded to other provinces as well.",
    "The trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals \u2013 including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, dental surgeons, public health inspectors, and entomology officers \u2013 have engaged in strikes time and time again over the past few months demanding an allowance increase.",
    "The trade union actions stemmed from the Cabinet Ministers\u2019 approval of a proposal tabled by President Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000."
