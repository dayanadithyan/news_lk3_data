    "\u201cWhat we hear is that a referendum will be held on abolishing the executive presidency. If there is such a referendum, we the SLFP will raise not one hand but both in support,\u201d he said.",
    "SJB MP Mujibur Rahuman, meanwhile, accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of scheming to delay the presidential elections scheduled to be held by October this year.",
    "\u201cThe local government election was delayed because the Rajapaksas and Wickremesinghes would lose. The president who postponed that election, now realising that he cannot win the presidential election, he is trying to abolish the executive presidency,\u201d he said.",

    "In a recent interview with India\u2019s WION network, Wickremesinghe was noncommittal about contesting the presidential election that should constitutionally be held by at least October 17 this year. He did, however, say \u201cboth presidential and parliament\u201d elections are due when asked about elections happening in 2024.",
    "Asked how optimistic he is of his own chances, Wickremesinghe said: \u201cFor me to be back, I must contest.\u201d",
    "When pressed for his plan, he said: \u201cI have come here to put the economy into order. My first order is to focus on that we get out of bankruptcy.\u201d",
    "There was no confirmation from the president that he would definitely be running. (Colombo/Feb13/2024)"
