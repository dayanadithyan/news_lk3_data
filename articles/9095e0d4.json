    "Speaking to reporters during the protest, the leaders of the \u201cSarvajana Balaya\u201d claim that the proposed bill abolishes the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and has made provisions to purchase electricity from foreign countries, which enables the integration of Sri Lanka\u2019s energy system with India\u2019s energy system.",
    "They also alleged that under such circumstances, Sri Lanka\u2019s energy system would be under the control of India.",
    "He charged that this could even lead to threats to Sri Lanka\u2019s national security due to the fact that the bill proposes to do away with existing provisions that have been put in place to safeguard the country\u2019s energy security and privatize the entire sector."
