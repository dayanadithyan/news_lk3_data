    "Australia quick Pat Cummins created history in St Vincent on Saturday when he became the first player to register a hat-trick in consecutive ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup matches.",
    "Cummins registered a hat-trick over two overs against Bangladesh on Thursday and the right-armer completed the feat once again against Afghanistan when he had Rashid Khan, Karim Janat and Gulbadin Naib dismissed with three consecutive deliveries.",
    "It was just the eighth time that a bowler has completed a hat-trick at a Men\u2019s T20 World Cup and the first time a player has achieved the feat on multiple occasions.",
    "Cummins is already a member of an illustrious group of seven players to have taken a hat-trick at a Men\u2019s T20 World Cup, with Brett Lee (2007), Curtis Campher (2021), Wanindu Hasaranga (2021), Kagiso Rabada (2021), Karthik Meiyappan (2022) and Josh Little (2022) the other bowlers to have done so previously.",
    "While Cummins admitted he did not know he had registered the hat-trick during the Bangladesh match, the Australia pacer revealed he was aware of what had occurred this time around.",
    "\u201cI remembered that one,\u201d Cummins said during the innings break.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy th\u00e1t I have played 100-odd games for Australia and now I have got two (hat-tricks) in a row.\u201d"
