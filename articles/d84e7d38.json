    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Spokesperson and MP S.M. Marikkar announced on Monday that the party will release its Presidential manifesto tomorrow (29).",
    "Speaking at a press conference in Colombo, Marikkar highlighted that many past election manifestos have failed to become reality.",
    "In response, he said the SJB presented its economic policy to Parliament two years ago and has updated it twice since then. The latest version of the policy will be unveiled on 29 August, the MP said.",
    "Taking aim at President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s election slogan \u201cSri Lanka Can,\u201d Marikkar remarked that Wickremesinghe can only burden the people with taxes, hike the prices of goods, raise electricity tariffs by 300%, import substandard medicines, and engage in various types of scams.",
    "\u201cThe bankrupt country has not yet begun repaying its debt. After debt restructuring, we must start making payments, which requires an increase in dollar revenue, along with a boost in foreign direct investments (FDIs) and exports,\u201d he noted. However, the MP pointed out that the Government has failed to take any steps to increase FDIs over the past two years, leading to a lack of investor confidence.",
    "He noted that several allegedly corrupt politicians, including Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Nimal Lanza, and Prasanna Ranatunge, as well as those accused of crimes and even terror activities like Pilleyan and Karuna, have extended their support to Wickremesinghe. \u201cTherefore what they can do is not bring in investments, increase exports, reduce people\u2019s cost of living or reduce taxes but instead steal,\u201d he said.",
    "Marikkar was similarly critical of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) party and took aim at its Presidential candidate, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, for his pledge to establish a bank that would provide loans to entrepreneurs without requiring guarantors.",
    "He said the NPP is only capable of making such mindless proposals."
