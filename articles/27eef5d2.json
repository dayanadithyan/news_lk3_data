    "Colombo, Feb 08 (Daily Mirror) - In a heated parliamentary session today, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Member of Parliament, Lakshman Kiriella, accused the government of orchestrating a\u00a0 delay of the upcoming Presidential Election.",
    "Kiriella asserted that the President's Government Policy statement notably omitted any mention of the Presidential Election, fueling suspicions of ulterior motives.",
    "Speaking in the Parliament, Kiriella outlined the alleged scheme, pointing to proposals for the abolishment of the executive presidency as a pretext for postponement. He argued that such a move would necessitate the drafting of a new Constitution, a process that could take at least a year."
