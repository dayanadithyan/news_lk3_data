    "The Minister made these remarks while addressing the NAM Ministerial Committee on Palestine, at the invitation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uganda, and expressed Sri Lanka\u2019s deep concern on the tragedy that is continuing to unfold, causing an unprecedented level of civilian casualties in Gaza.",
