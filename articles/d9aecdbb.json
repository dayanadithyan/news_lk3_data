    "SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam says party merely advised the President that prioritising general elections might be preferable",
    "Highlights ongoing efforts to spread hatred against national leaders and says Parliamentary election is most effective to expose these tactics",
    "Stresses ultimate decision lies with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and SLPP is ready to face any election",
    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam clarified yesterday that the SLPP has not formally requested President Ranil Wickremesinghe to hold Parliamentary elections first. Instead, Kariyawasam emphasised that the SLPP merely conveyed its viewpoint on polls to the President.",
    "\u201cAccording to legal provisions, the timing of the Presidential election is predetermined. The President holds the authority to dissolve Parliament at any point after two and a half years of its term. The decision to dissolve Parliament rests with the President,\u201d said Kariyawasam during a press briefing.",
    "Kariyawasam elaborated that SLPP founder Basil Rajapaksa had advised the President that prioritising the General election might be preferable. However, he stressed that the ultimate decision lies with the President, affirming the SLPP\u2019s readiness to contest any upcoming elections, including Presidential, General, Local Government, or Provincial Council elections.",
    "The General Secretary emphasised the party\u2019s advocacy for parliamentary elections, citing a perceived distortion in society.",
    "\u201cThere are ongoing efforts to instil hatred against the leaders who safeguarded our nation, with attempts to portray them as thieves,\u201d he said. \u201cA political faction is orchestrating these actions. We firmly believe that a Parliamentary election would be the most effective means to expose them.\u201d",
    "Responding to queries regarding ongoing support for President Wickremesinghe, Kariyawasam clarified that the SLPP\u2019s commitment extends only until the conclusion of Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s term.",
    "\u201cWe have not made any agreements beyond that period. The party will collectively determine the most suitable candidate for the Presidency, considering several potential candidates. We will announce our chosen candidate when the time is opportune,\u201d he added.",
    "He also criticised jibes aimed at the party, stating that while they haven\u2019t selected a Presidential candidate yet, it\u2019s noteworthy that they have several potential contenders, which he viewed as a positive development."
