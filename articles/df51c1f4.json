Sukumaran said: \u201cWhile we explore growth and expansion outside of Sri Lanka, we still believe in the future of the apparel industry in Sri Lanka and the potential it holds. The acquisition of Kolonna Manufacturing cements this belief. We remain bullish about the prospect of Sri Lanka apparel and its growth despite the economic hardships the country has had to face.\u201d",
