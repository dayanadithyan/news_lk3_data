    "Calls for Indian travelers to boycott the Maldives is \u201cabsolutely\u201d helping Sri Lanka\u2019s travel industry, the country\u2019s Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said Wednesday.",
    "\u201cThe Maldives issue is \u2026 helping us,\u201d Fernando told CNBC, referencing a social media row in January that resulted in a sharp drop in Indian visitors to the Maldives this year.",
    "India was the Maldives\u2019 largest source market in 2023. But now it sits in 6th place, behind arrivals from China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany, according to Sri Lanka\u2019s Ministry of Tourism.",
    "By contrast, nearly 34,400 Indian travelers went to Sri Lanka in January, more than double the 13,759 that visited in January last year, according to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. Arrivals in the first quarter of 2024 outpaced the same time period in 2023, despite a dip in April caused by a visa controversy that saw Sri Lankan visa temporarily double in price.",
    "Fernando also noted the tight relationship between Sri Lanka and India, both in business and tourism.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is a big market for [Indian travelers],\u201d he said. \u201cSri Lanka has more to offer \u2026 Sri Lanka has more value when it comes to India.\u201d",
    "He referenced the country\u2019s beaches, casinos, shopping and the Ramayana Trail, a series of sites that are referenced in the Ramayana, an ancient Hindu epic.",
    "\u201cConnectivity \u2014 that is the trigger factor,\u201d he said. \u201cSri Lankan Airlines alone flies 80 times a week into Indian airports.\u201d",
    "Indian travelers are set to become the world\u2019s fourth-largest travel spenders by 2030, a prediction which \u201cabsolutely\u201d bodes well for Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry, said Fernando.",
    "\u201cI think the fastest-growing economy is India, and Sri Lanka is definitely benefiting out of it,\u201d said Fernando, adding that Indian companies have made substantial investments on the island.",
    "\u201cITC, the big hotel chain, opened their first hotel out of India in Sri Lanka. We just opened it about a few weeks back, and it\u2019s a beautiful property \u2026 in Galle Face,\u201d he said, referencing the ocean-side area in the country\u2019s capital city of Colombo. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best things that I\u2019ve seen in my life.\u201d",
    "Fernando said he hopes to see more investments from global brands coming to Sri Lanka \u2014 investments that eluded the \u201cTeardrop Island\u201d as it waged a 25-year civil war, which ended in 2009.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve invited a lot of investment from abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing some water bungalows in our new area \u2014 like a Maldives concept as well \u2014 because we are surrounded by the beach.\u201d",
    "Fernando also outlined plans to add adventure activities to appeal to younger travelers, from hot air balloons to skydiving and diving to explore more than 100 nearby shipwrecks dating to World War II, he said.",
    "With concert economics causing a tourism boom, Sri Lanka plans to bring in musical acts to attract tourists too, said Fernando.",
    "\u201cWe are launching Sri Lanka as an entertainment hub,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of big names coming in to perform.\u201d"
