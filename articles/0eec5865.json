    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings said it assigned Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and Finance Plc (MBSL) a first-time national long-term rating of \u2018BBB+(lka)\u2019.",
    "\u201cMBSL\u2019s rating is driven by our view that the parent, BOC, would provide extraordinary support to MBSL, if required,\u201d the rating agency said.",
    "\u201cWe assess MBSL\u2019s standalone credit profile as being weaker than its support-driven rating because of its small franchise with 1.8% market share of sector loans, evolving business model, and weak financial profile, which is reflected in its poor asset-quality metrics, weak profitability and high leverage.\u201d",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Mumbai \u2013 22 Feb 2024: Fitch Ratings has assigned Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka & Finance PLC (MBSL) a first-time National Long-Term Rating of \u2018BBB+(lka)\u2019.",
    "MBSL is 84.5% owned by Bank of Ceylon (BOC, A(lka)/Stable) and other BOC group entities. BOC is the largest banking group in the country.",
    "Shareholder Support Drives Ratings: MBSL\u2019s rating is driven by our view that the parent, BOC, would provide extraordinary support to MBSL, if required. BOC\u2019s ability to support MBSL is reflected in its credit profile, which is underpinned by its standalone strength. We believe that any required support for MBSL would be manageable relative to BOC\u2019s financial capacity.",
    "Our support assessment also takes into consideration BOC\u2019s majority shareholding in MBSL, increasing product offerings by MBSL that are complementary to those provided by BOC, the parent\u2019s oversight of MBSL\u2019s policies and strategy through board representation, and the usage of the BOC brand by MBSL in its business operations, which raises reputational risk for BOC should MBSL default.",
    "Limited Importance to Parent: MBSL is rated two notches below BOC due to its limited importance to the group. MBSL mainly serves high-yielding, under-banked segments that have limited overlap with BOC\u2019s core customer base, but this is partly offset by BOC\u2019s focus on increasing merchant banking via MBSL to strengthen group feebased revenue. MBSL made up 0.8% of BOC\u2019s consolidated assets at end-September 2023, and makes negligible contribution to group profitability. MBSL also has considerable management independence and there is limited operational integration between the entities.",
    "Weak Standalone Profile: We assess MBSL\u2019s standalone credit profile as being weaker than its support-driven rating because of its small franchise with 1.8% market share of sector loans, evolving business model, and weak financial profile, which is reflected in its poor asset-quality metrics, weak profitability and high leverage. MBSL focuses on vehicle leasing, and gold- and property-backed loans. It has a high risk profile stemming from its significant exposure to borrower segments that are highly susceptible to economic and interest rate cycles.",
    "Stabilising Economic Outlook: We expect the operating environment for Sri Lankan finance and leasing companies (FLCs) to continue to stabilise following the inflation and interest-rate shocks over the past two years. Easing inflation and interest-rate pressures should provide steadier conditions for FLC sector performance. Some headwinds linger, as higher taxes will continue to weigh on household finances in 2024. Investor confidence will also take time to recover. Nonetheless, we expect economic activity in Sri Lanka to improve in the financial year ending March 2025 as GDP growth recovers.",
    "Asset Quality Pressure: The company\u2019s loans that are more than three months past due were high at 25.3% of total loans at end-September 2023 (end-2022: 24.3%) due to its high risk profile. Nonetheless, MBSL\u2019s focus on bad debt recovery has resulted in a decline in the non-performing loan ratio from a much higher level in previous years. We expect a pick-up in borrowers\u2019 business activity and declining interest rates to aid loan collections in the medium term.",
    "Weaker Profitability: MBSL\u2019s pre-tax profit/average asset ratio was low at 0.9% in 9M23 and -0.9% in 2022, primarily due to the sharp reduction in its net interest margin and increase in operating costs on lower business volumes. We expect MBSL\u2019s profitability to improve in the near to medium term, though it will likely remain weaker than that of peers, as its lending operations pick up, borrowing costs decline, and bad debt recovery improves.",
    "History of Capital Shortfalls: MBSL\u2019s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) rose to 16.9% (equity Tier 1 ratio at 13.4%) by end-September 2023 from 12.3% (11.7%) at end-2022, and against the regulatory minimum CAR of 12.5%. MBSL suffered significant capital shortfalls in 2020, with CAR at end-2020 of 5.6% below the minimum required 10.5% due to losses. BOC injected equity into MBSL in 2021 to improve its capitalisation. The breaches resulted in the regulator limiting MBSL\u2019s deposit and lending balances, which affected its business franchise. The caps were removed after its capital ratios increased.",
    "The recent improvement in CAR was due to significant reduction in total gross loans, an increase in gold loans, which carry lower risk weights, in the lending mix, and an increase in Tier 2 capital. We expect capitalisation pressure to ease in the medium term due to improved profitability prospects.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "MBSL\u2019s rating is sensitive to changes in BOC\u2019s credit profile, as reflected in BOC\u2019s National Long-Term Rating, as well as Fitch\u2019s opinion around BOC\u2019s ability and propensity to extend timely extraordinary support. Developments that could lead to a downgrade include:",
    "\u2013 meaningful reduction in the parent\u2019s ownership, control or influence that could weaken its propensity to support the subsidiary",
    "\u2013 notable decline in MBSL\u2019s capital buffers, indicating reduced timeliness in financial support to back growth or meet regulatory norms",
    "\u2013 insufficient or delayed liquidity support from the parent relative to MBSL\u2019s needs, which hinders MBSL\u2019s ability to meet its obligations in a timely manner",
    "\u2013 sustained weak performance of MBSL that we believe will weaken the parent\u2019s propensity to support the subsidiary",
    "\u2013 a material increase in size relative to the parent that makes extraordinary support more onerous for the parent.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "An upgrade is less likely in the near term. However, a significantly greater strategic role for MBSL within the BOC group, along with closer integration with BOC across broader functional areas and greater sharing of the BOC brand name besides the operational usage of brand, could be positive for the rating in the long term.",
