    "In a letter to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Mr Stalin said, \u201cI am writing to you with grave concern regarding yet another incident of apprehension of fishermen from Tamil Nadu.\u201d The fishermen were apprehended while fishing southeast of Kodiakarai in Nagapattinam district, he said.",
    "\u201cI have repeatedly highlighted that such incidents are occurring at an alarming frequency. In 2024 alone, 324 fishermen and 44 boats were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy. The fishing community in Tamil Nadu continues to face immense hardships due to the recurrent arrests, which severely affect their means of subsistence,\u201d he said.",
