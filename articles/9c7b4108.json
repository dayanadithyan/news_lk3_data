  "original_body_lines": [
    "Labels former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa a failure who was unable to even execute Executive Powers vested in his post",
    "Claims Rajapaksa had signed documents after succumbing to pressure from Duminda Silva\u2019s faction only to now be left humiliated",
    "Says SC decision affirms that truth will eventually prevail despite influence wielded by financial, political, or media entities",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) former MP Hirunika Premachandra yesterday declared Gotabaya Rajapaksa as a complete failure as a President, notably even in executing the executive powers vested in him by the constitution.",
    "She underscored this point, citing yesterday\u2019s landmark Supreme Court\u2019s decision to invalidate the Presidential Pardon granted by Rajapaksa to former MP Duminda Silva, who was convicted in the murder case of her father, veteran politician Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra.",
    "During a press conference after the verdict, Premachandra, one of the petitioners in the case, remarked that Gotabaya Rajapaksa displayed ignorance, as evidenced by his failure to adhere to proper procedures in granting a Presidential pardon.",
    "Premachandra claimed Rajapaksa had succumbed to pressure from Duminda Silva\u2019s faction and signed the document to grant Silva a Presidential pardon, only to find himself ultimately humiliated after the Court ruling.",
    "She remarked that the Supreme Court decision also affirmed that truth will eventually prevail, surpassing any influence wielded by financial, political, or media entities.",
    "The MP opined that Silva killed her father for speaking out against drug trafficking activities, despite her mother\u2019s warnings to refrain from commenting on such matters. \u201cMy father even informed Mahinda Rajapaksa about Silva\u2019s activities but Rajapaksa ignored him. Had he heeded my father and resolved these issues my father would be alive today. Instead, he orchestrated a conflict between them,\u201d she alleged. Premachandra also claimed her father\u2019s killing was carefully planned and not a coincidence as claimed."
