    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 A future Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) government will reduce taxes and utility bills, increase state revenue and create an investment-friendly environment, for which protests and strikes may have to take a back seat, an SJB MP said.",
    "\u201cWe will definitely reduce taxes and bills. We will enter new markets and increase state revenue. We\u2019ll create an investment-friendly environment. Protests and strikes must be stopped for some time,\u201d SJB legislator S M Marikkar said.",
    "Speaking to reporters, Marikkar said a \u201csomewhat tough\u201d administration is called for.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka and Vietnam used to have similar economic growth rates. But today, there isn\u2019t a single rupee of foreign direct investment (FDI) coming in. Vietnam had 35 billion US dollars in FDI just last year (actual figure was 36.6 billion).",
    "\u201cWe have to understand this reality and maintain a somewhat tough administration, won\u2019t we?\u201d he said.",
    "The SJB has been critical of what the party has been calling the authoritarian tendencies of President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s government. Since Wickremesinghe\u2019s ascendancy, the party and its leadership have issued strongly worded statements on the government\u2019s attempts at quelling protests and new laws such as the Online Safety Act.",
    "Government spokespersons have defended itself claiming that many of the protests were the work of saboteurs attempting to disrupt Sri Lanka\u2019s ongoing reform backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "Asked to comment on a recent remark by Palitha Range Bandara, general secretary of the President\u2019s United National Party (UNP), that a group of prominent SJB members were planning to cross over to the UNP, from which the SJB broke off in 2020, MP Marikkar intimated that Bandara was bluffing.",
    "\u201cThey have been saying for one and a half years now that this one will go and that one will go. I don\u2019t think there are idiots in the SJB,\u201d said Marrikar.",
    "\u201cThis is President Wickremesinghe\u2019s final days. I don\u2019t trying to insult him, but he is over 75 years old. People won\u2019t be voting for anyone over 75 this time,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Mar04/2024)"
