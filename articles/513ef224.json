    "Colombo, Feb. 01 (Daily Mirror)- Claiming that the SJB protest did not turn out to be successful, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said if he was to organise it, he would have done it more skillfully.",
    "The MP said some 8,000 people participated in the protest but ultimately it was neither a protest nor a rally.",
    "\"People had to leave soaked after being attacked with tear-gas and water cannons,\" he said responding to a question during a media conference.",
    "\"There was good participation for the protest though some people who usually attend our rallies did not turn up this time. People have so many issues and we had to face difficulty in bringing them. However, there were around 7,000 to 8,000 people. Ultimately,it was neither a protest nor a rally and ended up with people having to leave getting tear-gassed and soaked due to water cannon attacks. If I had organised it, I would have done it somewhat skillfully,\" he said."
