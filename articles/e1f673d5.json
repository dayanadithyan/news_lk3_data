    "\u201cOur party decided to bring in a second No Faith motion against Minister Rambukwella some weeks ago, but we did not collect signatures as we knew President Ranil Wickremesinghe was going to prorogue Parliament. However, we will start collecting signatures from MPs for the No Confidence motion from February 7 when the House convenes,\u201d MP Jayawardene said.",
    "\u201cWe will publish the signatures we get for the motion this time so that the public will know who will go against corruption,\u201d he added.",
    "The MP alleged that the Minister\u2019s involvement in the Human Immunoglobulin scam is becoming clear with the information that is being disclosed before the judiciary."
