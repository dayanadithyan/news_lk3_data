    "The Minister of State also pointed out that some parties in the opposition are engaged in sabotage to weaken the program launched by the government to develop the country.",
    "State Minister Indika Anuruddha conveyed these updates during a media briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) held today (04) under the theme \u201cCollective Path to a Stable Country\u201d.",
    "\u201cMany energy sector projects were stalled during the recent crisis. However, agreements for debt restructuring have been signed with bilateral creditor countries. This has resolved the legal issues necessary to restart these foreign-funded projects. As a result, the successful debt restructuring will significantly help address the country\u2019s energy crisis.",
    "Additionally, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), and the Ministry of Power and Energy have calculated the costs of producing electricity using rooftop solar panels.",
    "Consequently, prices have been reduced, and a related cabinet paper was presented last week. This has enabled us to apply for electricity purchase agreements at a lower price, allowing the CEB to achieve a loss-free situation.",
