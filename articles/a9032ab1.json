    "Manilal Perera, who latched up with the band Mirage, last year, as their frontline vocalist, has decided to do his own thing, once again\u2026with his band Upekka, also as a solo artiste, or even duo, or trio, depending on the occasion, he said.",
    "In the not too distant past, Manilal and Upekka were big in the scene here but family commitments, etc., compelled Manilal to curtail his activities as a performer.",
    "This time, too, he says family commitments are cropping up and he needs to spend time where it matters.",
    "The singer is scheduled to travel to Italy, in September, this year, and then to Germany, with his family, for his daughter\u2019s wedding in October.",
    "\u201cThis is the main reason why, at the present moment, I can\u2019t commit myself to be 100 percent active in the music scene,\u201d he said, but added that he and his band Upekka are likely to have a regular contract coming their way, once his family commitments are over.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve also given the green light for the members of Upekka to perform with other outfits until I\u2019m able to devote full time to my music, and my band.\u201d",
    "Manilal also mentioned that he is working on a contract for 31st night, to perform with Upekka.",
    "Last year, he did the Grand Hotel Nuwara Eliya scene, with the hotel\u2019s resident band Index 33, during the festive period.",
    "Manilal\u2019s last overseas trip was to Australia, with the group Mirage, where his style of singing, and choice of songs, gave the band\u2019s repertoire an added flavour.",
