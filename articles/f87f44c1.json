    "Colombo, Feb. 19 (Daily Mirror)- An organization called the \u201cLankalokaya\u201d headed by incumbent Southern Province Governor Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena\u2019s son Pasanda Yapa Abeywardene today presented a proposal to all candidates of this year\u2019s Presidential election urging them to abolish the Provincial Councils.",
    "The organisation proposed to abolish Provincial Councils and set up district councils while strengthening the Pradeshiya Sabhas instead.",
    "\u201cOur intention is to present a proposal to all candidates of this year\u2019s Presidential election asking them to abolish the Provincial Councils, set up District Councils and strengthen the Pradeshiya Sabhas instead. We also want the appointment of District Ministers other than the Cabinet Ministers, so that development in the district level will be more effective,\u201d he added.",
    "Abeywardene who is the Chief Organiser of Lankalokaya told a media briefing that Provincial Councils are indeed white elephants as they have eaten up Rs. 7,000 billion (Rs. 7 trillion) since 1988.",
    "\u201cSome 71 percent of the total of Rs. 7 trillion has been accounted for recurrent expenditure. Accordingly Rs. 5,000 billion (Rs. 5 trillion) has been accounted for recurrent expenditure,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThere is no reason to continue with Provincial Councils as no one even in the North have called for reinstating the Provincial Councils. Even India is not pressing the government to hold Provincial Council elections. There is no reason to continue with the Provincial Councils under these circumstances,\u201d he also said."
