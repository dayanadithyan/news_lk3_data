    "Sajith Premadasa, the presidential candidate of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), emphasized the importance of electing a leader who treats everyone equally, regardless of caste or religion.",
    "He made this statement during a rally held yesterday (15) in the Kaththankudy area.",
    "Drawing a parallel with Malaysia\u2019s thriving tourism industry, Premadasa highlighted the potential for Sri Lanka to strengthen its own tourism sector.",
    "\u201cBy taking cues from Malaysia, we can elevate our tourism industry to new heights,\u201d he remarked.",
    "He also pledged to address the housing issues in Kaththankudy by creating housing schemes for families without lands or houses.",
    "Additionally, he also promised to transform all 361 schools in the Batticaloa District into \u2018smart schools\u2019 and to upgrade all local hospitals into \u2018smart hospitals.\u2019",
    "Commenting further, Premadasa criticized his rivals: \u201cBoth Ranil Wickremesinghe and Anura Kumara Dissanayake were silent when the previous government committed that injustice to the Muslim community with Covid-19 cremation policy. They did not stand up for the Muslim community\u201d.",
    "He reminded of the SJB\u2019s strong stance on the issue, noting that his party had organized large protests both in parliament and on the streets against this unjust policy.",
    "Premadasa urged the people of Kaththaankudy, and the wider Muslim community, to reflect on these events when deciding on the country\u2019s future leadership.",
    "\u201cRegardless of your religion or culture, it\u2019s crucial that we safeguard Sri Lanka\u2019s identity by choosing the right leader,\u201d he concluded."
