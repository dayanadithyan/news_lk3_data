    "The Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka has countered recent reports alleging Indian companies\u2019 involvement in visa issuance at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake.",
    "In a clarification issued, the Indian High Commission stated that the companies mentioned in the incident at the airport were not Indian or Indian-based but were headquartered elsewhere.",
    "\u201cAny reference to India in this context is unwarranted,\u201d the Indian High Commission added.",
    "The clarification follows a video circulating on social media, where an agitated Sri Lankan national claimed that Indian companies who had taken over visa processing at the BIA were causing delays and levying extra processing fees."
