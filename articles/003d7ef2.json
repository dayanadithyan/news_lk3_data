    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings has assigned a first-time national long-term rating of \u2018AA-(lka)\u2019 for the Sri Lanka branch of MCB Bank. The outlook is stable.",
    "Fitch said MCBSL\u2019s currency liquidity coverage ratio of 551% at end-1H24 is supported by the branch\u2019s large cash balance and investments in Sri Lanka treasury securities, which make nearly 51% of its total assets.",
    "Fitch\u2019s assessment also takes into consideration the parent\u2019s credit profile, which is constrained by the Pakistan sovereign.",
    "Fitch Assigns MCB Bank \u2013 Sri Lanka Branch First-Time National Rating of \u2018AA-(lka)\u2019; Outlook Stable",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 12 Sep 2024: Fitch Ratings has assigned MCB Bank Limited \u2013 Sri Lanka Branch (MCBSL) a first-time National Long-Term Rating of \u2018AA-(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable.",
    "Head Office Supports Rating: MCBSL\u2019s rating reflects Fitch\u2019s expectation of support, if required, from its head office of MCB Bank Limited (MCB), a large bank in Pakistan (CCC+) claiming nearly 7% of sector assets at end-2023. The rating is underpinned by MCBSL\u2019s status as a branch of MCB, making it part of the same legal entity as MCB, subject to any regulatory constraints on MCB remitting money from Pakistan into Sri Lanka.",
    "Fitch\u2019s assessment also takes into consideration the parent\u2019s credit profile, which is constrained by the Pakistan sovereign on high interconnectedness, as well as MCBSL\u2019s operational integration with MCB and the small size of its branch, at 0.9% of MCB\u2019s total assets.",
    "Liquid Branch: MCBSL\u2019s all currency liquidity coverage ratio of 551% at end-1H24 is supported by the branch\u2019s large cash balance and investments in Sri Lanka treasury securities, which make nearly 51% of its total assets. We estimate that this covers around 90% of its deposit obligations. Part of its excess liquidity is also in the form of bank placements, which make up nearly 13.5% of assets.",
    "MCBSL\u2019s liquidity position is supported by its ability to access funding from MCB, as reflected in MCB\u2019s adequate liquidity coverage ratio of 261.9%. MCB also maintains a stable funding position, indicated by a gross loan/customer deposits ratio of around 33.0% and a net stable funding ratio of 164.9%.",
    "High Capital Buffers to Moderate: We expect MCBSL\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 65% at end-1Q24 to decline moderately over the medium term due to loan growth alongside a stabilising economy. However, the ratio is likely to remain well above the system average of 14%. The bank\u2019s capital buffers could be vulnerable should stress exceed our expectations, due to its small absolute capital base and high concentration towards small and mid-sized corporates and rising SME exposure.",
    "Small Franchise: MCBSL\u2019s operation in Sri Lanka is minimal, holding only 0.1% of system assets at end-1Q24. The bank\u2019s business model focuses on riskier mid-sized and small corporate and SME borrowers. It also faces significant competition from larger banks.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "MCBSL\u2019s National Rating would be downgraded upon a major change in Fitch\u2019s expectation of support from MCB, such as a change in the branch\u2019s legal status or the branch being wound down.",
    "A downgrade of Pakistan\u2019s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating, a weakening ability of the parent relative to the Pakistan sovereign or any other developments that affect the branch\u2019s ability to service its obligations could also lead to a multiple-notch downgrade of MCBSL\u2019s National Rating.",
    "A change in the relativities among the credit profiles of issuers based in Sri Lanka could also prompt a downward revision in the rating.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "MCBSL\u2019s National Rating could be upgraded should MCB\u2019s credit profile improve, reflecting a greater ability to provide extraordinary support to the Sri Lankan branch. This assumes our expectation of the parent\u2019s propensity to provide support remains unchanged."
