    "Beaten, broken and bruised: but carrying on with courage and compassion \u2018beyond checkpoints\u2019",
    "In a nation notorious for not remembering many matters of importance beyond the news cycle, remembering right becomes a sacred trust and duty. Sri Lanka has faced many challenges as a country and a people in its chequered history since independence, and forgetfulness must not be added to its woes.",
    "Thus a poignant memoir of episodes still not out of mind comes as a welcome reminder that once upon a time in our erstwhile island paradise, there was \u2018something rotten in the state\u2019. It was not a people, political party or government, or even a separatist movement that escalated into terrorism, which were solely to blame for the phenomenon we ironically recall as a \u2018civil war\u2019.",
    "Shall we suggest there was little if anything civil about it? Perhaps the bruises of memory are soothed by the balm of forgetfulness. However \u2013 and lest we are condemned to repeat the lessons of a painful past we have yet to learn and benefit from as an island race \u2013 there is great merit in permitting a meaningful percolation.",
    "\u2018Beyond Checkpoints: Stories of human resilience in troubled Sri Lanka\u2019 is precisely such a brew. While not a panacea, \u2018strong emotions recollected in tranquility\u2019 offers a soothing potion of sorts if it is imbibed in the right spirit and measure.",
    "This slim (yet, in other ways substantial) volume of personal experiences encapsulates the traumas of a nation and her children in a sensitive and significant volume of recollections.",
    "Bishop Emeritus Duleep de Chickera begins with a confession \u2013 that this book \u201chas not been researched\u201d. Instead it is based on \u201cobservations, encounters and experiences\u201d which he says \u201ctaught us hard and lasting lessons\u201d. Together with his wife Geetha, the former overseer of the Anglican Diocese of Colombo considers it to have been their \u201csacred privilege to befriend a cross-section of people directly caught up in the conflict\u201d.",
    "A shepherd\u2019s ethos shines through the Preface to the book in which the writer affirms its rationale:",
    "\u201cAs these interactions slowly transformed our understanding of human nature, we gained fresh insights into human resilience and more. The way most persons coped with and how some even matured in stature through these harsh realities was overwhelming, and had to be recorded.\u201d",
    "In this enterprise, the author\u2019s methodology was \u201cto allow memory to trigger memory, and narration to do its bit\u201d when \u201cthe space to write widened\u201d.",
    "Therefore, the genre of this tome \u201cis neither a history nor a novel, even though real happenings and story-telling feature in it\u201d; and in addition, \u201cits contents suggest it could be best described as the public disclosure of an informal, personal journey, mostly recorded in the mind\u201d.",
    "Despite the informal oeuvre of a shepherd\u2019s walk with a larger flock than mandated ex officio, there is a certain poignancy in the author\u2019s articulation of a people\u2019s distress whereby \u201cthe faces, the places, the words and the silence, the moods and the wounds, the gestures and the signs, the risks and the sacrifices, the fears and aspirations, explanations and protests; all connect, to compel a more permanent form\u201d.",
    "That form is a book, which according to Foreword writer Prof. Gameela Samarasinghe, \u201cis a testimony of Bishop Duleep\u2019s connection to people, male and female, of all ages and ethnic groups, during the war that ravaged Sri Lanka for more than 30 years\u201d. The Clinical Psychologist and Faculty Member at the University of Colombo adds, \u201cin some ways, my work is similar to his, as it also examines narratives of people, though through a therapeutic lens with the objective of alleviating psychosocial suffering,\u201d thereby framing the work\u2019s raison d\u2019etre.",
    "It is a work that embraces the deepest human feelings, emotions and instincts manifested in times of conflict and war: loss, suffering, courage, survival, resistance, kindness and compassion.",
    "The narratives also serve to encapsulate the harsh realities to which multiple generations of islanders were subject over three decades \u2013 and demonstrably more, in a milieu where we have failed to beat our swords into ploughshares, by transforming ourselves from a postwar state into a postconflict society more appetised by the fruits of peace with justice.",
    "These realities span the gamut of authoritarian regimes; conscription by ruthless terrorist organisations; the rule of law in its awesome presence and use, as well as awful absence or abuse; the ethnic violence of July 1983 that still scars so many Sri Lankans even today and arguably always; power dynamics at checkpoints in a war-torn country; \u201chow war divides people and how it \u2018becomes a convenient method of resolving differences\u2019\u201d; and discrimination, disappearances and conscription.",
    "The work is at its richest in reflective vein. These insights take many and varied forms. That the narrator of the overarching work is often silent \u2013 in fact, mostly so, eschewing editorial commentary in order that his characters may speak more directly to the reader \u2013 is a technique usefully and skilfully deployed.",
    "For instance, one conversation around a breakfast table in the north \u2013 bereft of utilities as much as useful answers \u2013 reflects the burning issues that bothered a people inflamed by the human condition stretched to its utmost limits: \u201cWhat was really wrong with us as a people? Why were we not civic-minded enough to bring change, and why were we allowing discrimination and violence to take the upper hand? Why was there no public protest against war, and why was there no North-South people\u2019s movement to bring us to our senses?\u201d",
    "This, in an epoch of extreme rationing and dangerously low reserves of everything \u2013 from energy to enthusiasm \u2013 in the North, ironically foreshadowing a similar era that was to be the South\u2019s fate, including the emergence of a people\u2019s movement fuelled by the notion of popular sovereignty\u2026",
    "Other conversations point to the predicament of people under oppressive regimes. As one champion of the people in the face of state and separatist tyranny muses: \u201cWe have to learn to handle power without losing our social consciousness. This is our best chance to become a developed and just society. Take, for instance, the ones in parliament. No sooner they get in there, they become different people. They forget their mandate is from the people, for the people, and become immersed in self-interest. The strings of power become like a toy. The ability to make things happen with just a word can be intoxicating.\u201d",
    "Years, decades, after the war, has anything changed? Is there, in fact, a war for justice still going on amidst an alien people clutching their demigods of failed democracy and fanatic demagoguery alike?",
    "In all of this, the author does not take sides. In truth, he uses the editorial voice amidst compelling and often chilling narration to make this sense of balance and perspective abundantly clear:",
    "\u201cCareless words easily provoked \u2018The Other Side\u2019 syndrome, and pressed buttons marked \u2018Suspicion\u2019. \u2026 \u2018the other side\u2019 geographically means \u2018the other side\u2019 ideologically. Land and people simultaneously became [the] enemy in times of war. It did not matter if most on \u2018the other side\u2019 did not want this war or that all sides belonged to one national family.\u201d",
    "Speaking truth to power \u2013 be it state tyrant or separatist terrorist or the usual suspects whom victims of war often caricaturize to make sense of meaninglessness in times of stress and conflict \u2013 the author holds out hope based on his encounters with survivors:",
    "Beyond Checkpoints: Stories of human resilience in troubled Sri Lanka by Bishop Emeritus Duleep de Chickera (Published by the Diocese of Colombo, October 2023)",
    "\u201cThere was a way to survive under oppressive conditions. This was to nurture one\u2019s inner sense of freedom within that private unseen terrain that neither tyrant nor informant could see or invade. It was within this crevice of privacy that people of conscience had, through history, defied attempts to steel their freedom.\u201d",
    "This small triumph of the human spirit flickers like a candle in the wind of human endeavour on behalf of their stricken fellows in the microcosm of conflict that is the universe of this book. In which there is little else to hold on to when \u201call the UN\u2019s motions and all the parliaments of the world brought little relief when tyranny strode down lonely byways in the darkness of night.\u201d",
    "Yet, the personal becomes the pointedly anecdotal as this former Sub-Warden of S. Thomas\u2019 College Mount Lavinia reveals his experience of a pogrom during his tenure at the \u2018School by the Sea\u2019. It was, in the words of another chronicler, \u201cthe best of times, the worst of times\u201d.",
    "The worst was made evilly manifest in the grim reality that \u201cTamils were being attacked indiscriminately\u201d, \u201cTamils were attacked for being Tamil\u201d, \u201ca more sinister explanation began to unfold\u201d, \u201crampaging mobs had lists of Tamil homes and businesses\u201d, \u201cthe violence was orchestrated\u201d, \u201cthe confirmation was chilling\u201d, and \u201cwhen he finally addressed the country, five days into the havoc, the then President implied the Tamils deserved it\u201d.",
    "But there was a best to better this blatantly racist business. The school became a shelter; the scared and confused were comforted and encouraged; the frightened were fed; where \u201csleep was a luxury\u201d when and where \u201cthere was something ominous in the air\u201d, \u201cthe response was spontaneous\u201d and while \u201call that the College stood for, over the decades, was being put to the test\u201d, the staff, stewards, and stalwarts of S. Thomas\u2019 safeguarded those within and without their precincts who sought refuge in the environs of the school.",
    "And although it was a shining hour for Sri Lankan solidarity in the face of an insidious evil that has never been fully explained, forgiven or forgotten, it is regrettable that \u201call that remained were brittle memories that, with time, would escape the attention of the historian\u201d.",
    "From boys to men, there are plenty of tear-jerkers in store for the sensitive reader. One of the most poignant chapters is about the funerals of former students who donned one uniform or another in the service of the state or defence of the motherland. When the senior cleric called over to pay his respects, \u201cI had no word for their families.\u201d And this was later to match the dictum observed by the clergy-led teams that visited the theatres of war: \u201cKill the empty words.\u201d",
    "This poignant insight cannot fail to move more than bereft mothers or grieving widows: \u201cTo remember the dead as they lived is a small consolation in times of grief. It creates a healing ramp that slowly acknowledges the inevitable. Memory of life together is just a step away from life together.\u201d",
    "The living are paid their due respect too. Writes their erstwhile mentor: \u201cIn a highly politicized civil conflict, tensions between command and conscience were to be expected. \u2018Things are becoming difficult,\u2019 was all they would say. \u2026 The conflict was not about going to the front. They had the courage for that. This was about happenings that their work ethic refused to accommodate. The lessons of loyalty and sportsmanship learned on the \u2018small club\u2019 and \u2018big club\u2019 [the \u2018playing fields of S. Thomas\u2019] prevented them from staying on or saying more\u2026\u201d",
    "The book subtly captures a plethora of issues, events and happenings through the eyes and words of people.",
    "Apparently aware of the author\u2019s interest in reconciliation, his driver \u2013 who faithfully chauffeured him \u2018beyond checkpoints\u2019 \u2013 is reported as discoursing on \u201cthe potential in face-to-face community gatherings to heal misunderstandings\u201d.",
    "The writer comments: \u201cHis simple reasoning made a profound case for public scrutiny at peace negotiations. Knowing they are being watched by their constituencies would have potential to reduce dilly-dallying and improve the performance of the parties at the table.\u201d",
    "The same character \u201coften lamented that not enough Sinhalese people knew Tamil\u201d and \u201clistened intently\u201d when his episcopal charge \u201cspelt out the ill-begotten Sinhala Only Act\u201d.",
    "And the former \u201csoon came to believe that all Sri Lankans should be conversant in each other\u2019s languages\u201d and was amused by the bishop\u2019s suggestion that \u201cwe needed to know at least two and a half languages, to cement relationships and hold the country together\u201d.",
    "But \u201cthe Sinhala [sic] mindset was changing slowly. After the war, a former classmate of [the driver\u2019s], in uniform, talked of \u2018the elderly Hindu man who would weep at the site of his property taken over for a Buddhist shrine.\u2019 Under the stern image of the military uniform, the conscience of these rural soldiers was being stirred. Their worldview had space for fair play beyond populist provocation.\u201d",
    "The author observes that \u201cthe narration of these experiences and stories in the villages became counter-messages to the lies and propaganda that sections of the media churned out\u201d, affirming that \u201cthe living witness next door is more powerful than the aggregated mass of media manipulation.\u201d",
    "A Buddhist-monk friend of the author agrees: \u201cIt is war propaganda more than the actual war that divides the people \u2026 the clever use of words and symbols that suggest the other side is in the war for evil reasons while we are in it for noble reasons.\u201d A senior journalist cited in the book concurs: \u201cThe task of war propaganda is to change the ugly face of war and make it seem like an exciting game.\u201d",
    "Not only media and state actors but separatists and terrorist movements also get short shrift, albeit through the utterances of people who had been inveigled to settle in the north to provide a buffer zone for the LTTE. As one such notes: \u201cThe Tigers were master manipulators. They brandished a gun and imposed a street psychology, beginning with those they claimed to protect.\u201d",
    "The author in situ muses: \u201cThe first casualty in war is not truth. \u2026 This saying surely came from a comfortable neoliberal capitalist. It is the poor [who are the first casualties]. The need for survival slings a gun on the shoulders of those who search for bread. This is a born again fact of history. The poor are always excluded from the right to dignity.\u201d",
    "And the interestingly named Kadir \u2013 a science graduate from Colombo University then resident in Kilinochchi \u2013 agrees: \u201cPatriotism, nationalism, separatism mean nothing to the poor who point their guns at each other. \u2026 Causes beyond this are manipulated in plush places in Colombo, Canada and Canberra.\u201d",
    "They say there are no heroes in war, only victims or survivors. However, even though it does not explicitly say so, this work may beg to differ. By offering up for thoughtful public consumption the private slices of life that redound to personal courage and heroism in the face of dire circumstances and daunting challenges, the book dresses wounds in the body politic.",
    "And by addressing issues faced by as well as misconceptions about desperate people caught up in a conflict not of their making, it redresses the balance between arrogant resolutions and resilient attitudes.",
    "As a Reverend Sister who worked among vulnerable women in the South asserts: \u201cThis inner resilience creates an unbelievably strong network of resistance among persons of conscience.\u201d",
    "It teaches people to \u201cacknowledge and support one another\u201d, affirms a journalist of the bishop\u2019s acquaintance, adding: \u201cTogether, we look for some fresh air in a highly polluted political prison.\u201d",
    "These prisoners of conscience, and captives of hope and human resilience, amidst the vagaries of life in general and the vicissitudes of war in particular, comprise a formidable ensemble in a book about making meaningful survival a salutary alternative to capitulating to evil or apathy when senseless conflict rules the order of the day and times.",
    "The author dedicates his work to his grandchildren, as well as the children of their generation, with the observation that \u201csome books make us strong by first making us sad\u201d and the wish \u201cI hope this book will deepen your sensitivities and add strength to your lives\u201d.",
    "That is a hope and a wish fit for dedication to their parents and grandparents too.",
    "Trust that the personal experiences offered \u2013 not as a prescription but a description (and a diagnosis or prognosis) of what once ailed us as a people \u2013 will safeguard all our generations from a similar destiny, which could come to pass again if we don\u2019t remember rightly our traumatic inherited past\u2026",
    "As now, so then: \u201cThe task ahead [is/was] to comfort the broken-hearted, hear unending cries for justice and peace, and dig out the remains of hope that lay buried in the debris\u2026\u201d of war, the Wanni and a wounded nation.",
