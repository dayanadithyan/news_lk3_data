    "\u201cI shared the experiences of Sri Lanka which can provide valuable lessons for others and explored the critical elements of capacity building and sound institutional practices in managing debt, particularly in the context of economic challenges,\u201d Semasinghe said on X (twitter).",
    "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s experience demonstrates that effective debt management is not just about managing numbers but also about building robust institutions and capacities.\u201d",
    "The journey underscores the importance of transparent, accountable governance and the need for international support and cooperation in times of crisis, he said.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka prioritized addressing gaps in public debt management by drafting a consolidated Public Debt Management Act, ensuring clarity and legal robustness and establishing a centralized Public Debt Management Office with operational autonomy.",
    "\u201cThe role of debt management in navigating crises is multifaceted and critical. Further, by investing in capacity building, adhering to sound institutional practices, and strategically managing debt restructuring and liability operations, countries can better withstand economic shocks and pave the way for sustainable recovery.\u201d",
    "Developing countries face severe debt distress as they are more vulnerable to external shocks, Semasinghe said, and \u201cmanaging global debt requires coordinated international efforts on debt restructuring where necessary, timely fiscal policy adaptation and help sustainable economic growth.\u201d",
    "The state minister also pointed out the financial impact of climate change was an emerging challenge, as countries need investment to mitigate and adapt to climate impacts, \u201cespecially through non-debt creating inflows, which would require private capital mobilization.\u201d (Colombo/Jun20/2024)"
