    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s president has apologised for the government\u2019s decision to enforce cremations during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
    "\u201cThis house would like to apologise for what happened,\u201d Ranil Wickremesinghe said in parliament on Tuesday. \u201cDuring this time there was a lot of pain, mainly felt by the Muslims, but also Hindus, Buddhists and Christians, I know who also like to bury.\u201d",
    "He said that a committee appointed to look into the matter at the time recommended cremation, a decision which was upheld by the supreme court.",
    "\u201cSo the government had to follow that. There was no choice at that stage.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka would bring a law that would allow the right of burial, right of cremation or gifting one\u2019s body to medical institutions.",
    "\u201cIn this country any person should have the right to determine whether he or she is buried, cremated or given to the medical faculty.\u201d",
    "The Sri Lanka government\u2019s stubborn insistence, under the presidency of Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2020, 2021, on cremating Muslim and Christian victims of the virus, going against their religious believes, drew widespread condemnation from UN experts and Muslim countries.",
    "Rajapaksa\u2019s arrogant policy, which he later blamed on experts, led the OIC and Middle East nations to reject Sri Lanka\u2019s repeated requests for credit lines to buy oil and loans before the country collapsed after an unprecedented economic crisis in 2022. (Colombo/Jun18/2024"
