    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Public Security Minister Tiran Alles, who is also in charge of the island nation\u2019s police, slammed the United Nations Human Rights Commission and its local arm for criticizing the government\u2019s anti-drug campaign which has nabbed around 39,000 for their involvement with drugs.",
    "Sri Lanka has recognized the drug menace as one of the key threats and Alles has backed drastic measures in a police-led operation titled \u201cYukthiya\u201d (justice) to nab the drug distributors across the country.",
    "Since the operation was launched in mid-December, the police have arrested nearly 39,000 people mostly with drugs including heroin, cannabis, synthetic drugs, and cocaine, police data show.",
    "The UN Human Rights Commission last week said it was \u201cvery concerned that authorities in Sri Lanka\u201d were \u201cadopting a heavily security-based response to the country\u2019s drugs problem, instead of public health policies grounded in human rights\u201d.",
    "The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk has urged the Sri Lankan government to review the ongoing \u201cYukthiya\u201d operation, and to implement human rights based approaches, notably the right to health, in addressing the issues of illicit drugs in society.",
    "Liz Throssell, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in a statement said people were reported to have been subjected to a number of violations during and after these operations, including unauthorised searches, arbitrary arrests and detention, ill-treatment, torture, and strip searches in public.",
    "Throssell also said lawyers acting for those detained have alleged that they have faced intimidation from police officers.",
    "However, Minister Alles said most of the content in the statement by the UN was generalized.",
    "\u201cUnfortunately, the Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka and the UN Human Rights Commission, they go on the people who write to them with various kinds of things,\u201d Alles told Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Association (FCA) forum on Thursday (18).",
    "\u201cIf they say these 3-4 incidents have happened and please inquire, it is that I will accept. But generally, you make a statement. On what basis?\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Human Rights Commission\u2019s duty is to tell us: okay, these are the incidents and get our answers. Without all that, they issue statements.\u201d",
    "The operation has led to nab around 4.8 billion Sri Lankan rupee worth drugs and the police have taken assets worth of 725 million rupees including assets and properties under the Money Laundering Act, police data show.",
    "According to the police data, out of 39,000 arrested, 1,703 people have been detained with detention orders, while nearly 2,000 people have been sent to rehabilitation and others have been released on bail.",
    "Alles said he had asked the local UN Resident Representative this week to speak to the Human Rights Commission and ask them \u201con what basis they issued this statement\u201d.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t want these kinds of statements. Tell them to come up with facts and figures,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI will be very honest. As far as I am concerned, the UN Human Rights Commission\u2026can issue statements. But I will not stop this operation. We will go ahead, and we will do it in the same way because we know that we are doing something good for the children of this country, for the women of this country.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd that is why the general public is whole heartedly with us in this operation. If we are doing anything wrong on the ground, people are not going to support this.\u201d",
    "The UN in its statement said a heavy-handed law enforcement approach is not the solution for the drug use which has become \u201ca serious challenge to society\u201d.",
    "It said the abuse of drugs and the factors that lead to it are first and foremost public health and social issues.",
    "\u201cPeople suspected of selling or trafficking drugs are entitled to humane treatment, with full respect for due process and transparent, fair trials,\u201d Throssell, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said. (Colombo/Jan 18/2024)"
