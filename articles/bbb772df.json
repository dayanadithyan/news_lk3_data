    "\u201cNew facts reveal how Congress callously gave away Katchatheevu\u2026This has angered every Indian,\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X.",
    "Modi on Sunday (31 March) once again attacked the Congress about its decision to \u201ccallously give away\u201d the island of Katchatheevu.",
    "\u201cEye opening and startling! New facts reveal how Congress callously gave away #Katchatheevu. This has angered every Indian and reaffirmed in people\u2019s minds \u2014 we can\u2019t ever trust Congress!\u201d he posted on X.",
    "The prime minister\u2019s post comes after documents obtained by BJP Tamil Nadu chief K. Annamalai seemed to indicate that Congress never attached much importance to the tiny, uninhabited island, The Times of India reported. According to the report, Jawaharlal Nehru once even remarked that he would not hesitate \u201cin giving up claims to the island\u201d altogether.",
    "This story is not new \u2014 the circumstances in which India, under Indira Gandhi\u2019s prime ministership, relinquished its claims over Katchatheevu in 1974 have been well documented. BJP\u2019s Tamil Nadu campaign has, however, made it among the state\u2019s most hot button political topics.",
    "Katchatheevu is a 285-acre uninhabited speck in the Palk Strait, between India and Sri Lanka. It is no more than 1.6 km in length and slightly over 300 m wide at its broadest point.",
    "It lies northeast of Rameswaram, about 33 km from the Indian coast. It is about 62 km southwest of Jaffna, at the northern tip of Sri Lanka, and 24 km away from the inhabited Delft Island, belonging to Sri Lanka."
