    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena who survived a no confidence motion against him claimed that MPs among those who signed the motion had tried to unconstitutionally appoint him Sri Lanka president in 2022.",
    "Addressing parliament on Thursday March 21 after the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) government comfortably defeated the no confidence motion (NCM), Abeywardena said \u201cpowerful forces\u201d had urged him to take over the presidency after it became vacant following former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s resignation after months of intense public protests.",
    "The latest NCM, filed by the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), was the fifth against a sitting speaker in parliament\u2019s history, but the first on the grounds of an alleged violation of the constitution, said Abeywardena.",
    "\u201cPersonally, I believe I have acted according to the constitution and to my conscience,\u201d he said, adding that, in fact, he was asked to violate the constitution in 2022 during the Aragalaya youth-led street protests.",
    "\u201cDuring the Aragalaya in 2022, I got frequent phone calls urging me to take over the government even in violation of the constitution. I was surprised to see that those who had tried to influence me to do this have signed this NCM,\u201d he said.",
    "Abeywardena claimed that he had maintained his silence all this time as a \u201cresponsible speaker\u201d but is now compelled to reveal all.",
    "\u201cThere were powerful elements that tried to influence me to establish a government. Their intention was not to calm the situation or protect the country but to establish an illegal government through me and turn our country into a Libya or Afghanistan,\u201d he claimed.",
    "\u201cThere were also attempts to achieve some objectives that could not be achieved over the past 30 years,\u201d he added, ostensibly referring to a violent overthrow of the government.",
    "Abeywardena said he had unequivocally rejected invitations, both local and international, to step into the presidency upon Rajapaksa\u2019s resignation. He claimed that he had stressed to these parties that his fervent desire was to \u201cuphold the supreme constitution\u201d.",
    "\u201cWhen it was evident that my mind could not be changed, some of them became violent and surrounded my house and threatened my life. I\u2019m devastated to this day that among those were Buddhist monks and clergymen of other faiths,\u201d he said.",
    "Amid these threats to his life, claimed Abeywardena, President Rajapaksa had contacted him to obtain his views on transferring power to him. However, given the lack of provisions in the constitution that would empower the speaker of parliament to serve as president without a prime minister and a cabinet could\u2019ve meant a state of anarchy with regional leaders emerging all over the country, a risk he well understood, said Abeywardena.",
    "\u201cOn July 13 at the last parliamentary leaders\u2019 meeting, there was a dangerous situation brewing around parliament with some groups coming very close to destroying it. Party leaders had left and I alone stayed in this building until the last moment,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cFortunately, I was able to prevent a great disaster. If it weren\u2019t for that, there might not be none of you to present this NCM, or me to face it, or this place to take it up,\u201d he added.",
    "Abeywardena also argued that, since taking office as Speaker in 2020, he had increased the time allocated for opposition members to 40 percent of parliament time, to the chagrin of the government side.",
    "\u201cBut some opposition members complained to me in my office that this increased time was not evenly distributed among them with some leaders taking up most of it,\u201d he claimed.",
    "The speaker also rejected allegations that President Ranil Wickremesinghe was exerting influence on him in his duties.",
    "\u201cSome say the head of state is influencing me. It is true that the president is an old friend, but since he beacme president, he has not once not tried to influence me,\u201d he said.",
    "Abeywardene claimed to bemoan MPs who are sworn to serve the interests of a public burdened by taxes and high cost of living taking up three days of parliament\u2019s time at a cost of nearly 45 million rupees for the NCM against him.",
    "\u201cThis is not something a country like hours can afford,\u201d he said.",
    "He also claimed that some MPs who had signed the no faith motion had privately expressed their regret to him about being compelled to sign it.",
    "Given the recent trend of all 225 parliamentarians routinely accused of being thieves, Abeywardena said he was glad that this was one allegation no one who signed the NCM levelled at him.",
    "\u201cAll of you who supported me and those of you who harshly criticised me during this debate, my door remains open to you all,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Mar22/2024)"
