    "The pictures were taken during Ms Hasina\u2019s visit to a metro rail station in the city of Mirpur on Thursday, where ticket vending machines and the signalling control station were shattered. Ms Hasina was pictured frowning and wiping her tears with tissue paper.",
    "\u201cWhat kind of mentality leads them to destroy facilities that make people\u2019s lives easier? Dhaka city was clogged with traffic. The metro rail offered respite. I cannot accept the destruction of this transport facility made with modern technology,\u201d Bangladeshi daily The Business Standard quoted the prime minister as saying.",
    "\u201cWe lost [hundreds of] students. But PM Sheikh Hasina had the time to go \u201ccry\u201d for a metro rail, not for the people who won\u2019t return ever again,\u201d said one Twitter user.",

    "Her government is working to \u201csuppress these militants and create a better environment\u201d, the 76-year-old said earlier this week, adding she was \u201cforced\u201d to impose a curfew for public safety."
