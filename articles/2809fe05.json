    "The minister, who spoke in condition of anonymity, confirmed in a message that the attack only caused some damage. The minister has not disclosed any further details.",
    "Two citizens said they had heard massive explosions near the sea in Tripoli\u2019s luxury Hay Andalus neighbourhood, the home to PM Dbeibah\u2019s residence.",
    "A citizen said that after the massive explosions were heard, heavy security forces with their vehicles were deployed around the area.",
    "Libya has had little peace or stability since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising, and split in 2014 between eastern and western factions, with rival administrations governing each area.",
    "Dbeibah\u2019s Government of National Unity was installed through a U.N.-backed process in 2021 but the parliament, in the east, stopped recognising its legitimacy at the end of that year after a failed attempt to hold national elections, which led to prolonged political deadlock.",
    "Early of March, three key leaders said they agreed on the \u201cnecessity\u201d of forming a new unified government that would supervise long-delayed elections.",
    "Dbeibah has vowed not to cede power to a new government without national elections."
