    "The Mastercard Centre for Inclusive Growth and data.org last week launched the Artificial Intelligence to Accelerate Inclusion Challenge (AI2AI Challenge), a global call for AI solutions to accelerate inclusion and economic empowerment.",

Organisations will be considered for their innovative AI solutions that have demonstrated success and are ready to scale with additional funding and technical assistance.",
    "\u201cFive years ago, we made an early bet on the power of data to advance social impact,\u201d said Mastercard Centre for Inclusive Growth Founder and President Shamina Singh. \u201cThose early investments laid a foundation for the growing field of impact data science and have contributed to the demand for similar interventions for AI. Today, we are proud to be working with data.org to incentivise safe and trustworthy AI applications that empower communities and people. This challenge will shine a light on scalable solutions that help realise the promise and potential for AI to benefit society.\u201d",

With each challenge, we not only grow our network of peers and partners, but we also learn more about how to most effectively build capacity, empower local communities, and ultimately build the field of data and AI for social impact.\u201d",

The deadline for submissions is 18 July 2024, at 7 p.m. ET, after which a panel of distinguished expert judges bringing experience in AI at the frontier of social impact and industry will review submissions, with winners announced by early 2025.",
