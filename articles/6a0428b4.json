    "Venice, Italy (CNN) \u2014 April 25 has long been a historic day in Venice \u2013 the date is not just Italy\u2019s Liberation day, but it\u2019s also the feast day of the city\u2019s patron saint, St. Mark.",
    "But now Venice will notch up another dose of history for April 25 \u2013 as the day the city becomes the first in the world to charge day-trippers an entry fee.",
    "There were protests as the day got underway with locals waving banners and holding up their passports in anger at the city being put behind a barrier in the style of a theme park or museum. Photos show police clashing with some protesters.",
    "The long-awaited contributo di accesso (it\u2019s styled as an \u2018access contribution\u2019 rather than a ticket) started at 8.a.m. on Thursday. The city council is running a pilot project until mid July to see if it can make the system work.",
    "Anybody visiting Venice as a tourist for the day \u2013 except those who live in the local Veneto region \u2013 must pay the 5 euro ($5.40) charge if they arrive between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m..",
    "Tourists staying overnight don\u2019t have to pay, as an overnight tax is already added to their accommodation bills. However they too will have to register their presence to request an exemption to the fee. Essentially, anyone entering the city on dates the fee is charged must carry either a ticket or an exemption. The only exceptions are residents of Venice and people who were born there.",
    "Hundreds of locals participated in a protest at Piazzale Roma, the entry point by road to the city, though the exact number was disputed. Protestors say that at its largest the group was 1,000 strong, while the authorities said that only 300 attended.",
    "A smaller protest took place near the main train station with Venetians confronting the mayor who was giving interviews to various television crews. That protest ended up in an embrace with the mayor, according to news reports which captured the confrontation.",
    "Ruggero Tallon, one of the main protest organizers and the spokesperson for anti-cruise ship campaign group No Grandi Navi, told CNN that the group had planned to erect a banner spelling out \u201cWelcome to Veniceland\u201d and hand out fake \u201ctickets\u201d to passersby, but were stopped by police. Instead they marched to Campo Santa Margherita, one of the city\u2019s main squares.",
    "\u201cWe rose up against the mayor\u2019s idea of a closed city, a museum city,\u201d Tallon told CNN.",
    "\u201cA ticket does nothing. It doesn\u2019t stop the monoculture of tourism. It doesn\u2019t ease the pressure on Venice. It\u2019s a medieval tax and it\u2019s against freedom of movement.\u201d",
    "He expressed concern that the project is being managed by a private company, which will receive people\u2019s data, and suggested that other moves by the authorities \u2013 including angling for the return of cruise ships to the lagoon, and not yet restricting Airbnbs \u2013 are adding to the problem.",
    "\u201cWith the one hand they are doing this, with the other they are doing everything to increase the number of tourists,\u201d said Tallon, who called mass tourism a \u201cglobal problem.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe only way [forward] is to repopulate the city \u2013 we have 49,000 inhabitants and there are more beds for tourists than residents,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s try to make it possible for people to live here. Every house that\u2019s lived in is a house taken away from tourism.\u201d",
    "Elena Gastaldello, president of Arci (Italian recreational and cultural association) of Veneto, who took part in the protest, said that the entrance fee will not control numbers.",
    "\u201cThe ticket will not impose limits on tourist access to Venice as no maximum number of visitors has been established, but it will further transform the city into an amusement park,\u201d she told CNN by phone.",
    "\u201cThis measure is not accompanied by concrete policies for urban development, rent containment and ease of finding housing. It solves no problems.\u201d",
    "A spokesperson for the mayor\u2019s office told CNN that 113,000 visitors registered for the first day, with about 80,000 doing so in advance. Of that number, 15,700 \u2013 a little over 10% \u2013 paid the fee.",
    "Of the exemptions, almost 40,000 were hotel guests, and around 4,000 were friends or family of residents. Over 20,000 commuters and 13,000 students entered the city. School groups were also counted.",
    "The council said that they inspected the credentials of nearly 14,000 people."
