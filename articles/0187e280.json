    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings has confirmed Sri Lanka-based Hatton National Bank PLC\u2019s National Long-Term Rating at \u2018A(lka)\u2019 with a stable outlook, saying the economy was stabilizing but it also had the highest exposure to defaulted sovereign bonds.",
    "HNB\u2019s high risk profile, similar to peers, stems from its large exposure to sovereign risk, via the defaulted foreign-currency denominated sovereign bonds which at 10 percent of assets by end 2023, was the highest among local banks.",
    "Another 33 percent of assets iwere rupee-denominated treasury securities, all of which make the bank vulnerable to the sovereign\u2019s repayment capacity and liquidity position.",
    "\u201cFitch expects HNB\u2019s impaired (stage 3) loans to decrease in the near to medium term, buttressed by the improvement in borrower repayment capacity alongside the economic recovery and Fitch\u2019s anticipated expansion in the bank\u2019s loan book,\u201d Fitch said.",
    "\u201cThis is despite the parate suspension that is in effect until 15 December 2024.\u201d",
    "High internal capital generation through retained profits and gains from currency appreciation had boosted HNB\u2019s regulatory Tier 1 ratio to 14.7 percent by end-2023 (2022: 11.4 percent).",
    "That said, we estimate the bank\u2019s underlying capital buffers to be lower by around 100bp if a 100 percent risk weighting were applied (currently 20 percent) on these defaulted bonds.",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 06 Jun 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based Hatton National Bank PLC\u2019s (HNB) National Long-Term Rating at \u2018A(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed HNB\u2019s Sri Lankan rupee senior unsecured debt at \u2018A(lka)\u2019. The ratings on the bank\u2019s proposed and outstanding Sri Lankan rupee subordinated debt have been affirmed at \u2018BBB+(EXP)(lka)\u2019 and \u2018BBB+(lka)\u2019, respectively.",
    "Intrinsic Profile Drives Rating: HNB\u2019s National Long-Term Rating reflects its own financial strength, which is highly influenced by the bank\u2019s exposure to the sovereign\u2019s weak credit profile (Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): RD; Long-Term Local-Currency IDR: CCC-) and the ongoing sovereign debt restructuring, which has put pressure on HNB\u2019s financial profile, particularly capitalisation and funding. The rating also reflects HNB\u2019s superior domestic franchise as Sri Lanka\u2019s fourth-largest commercial bank.",
    "Restructuring Delays Hinder Progress: Sri Lankan banks\u2019 operating environment (OE) continues to show signs of stabilisation, supporting the recovery in banks\u2019 operational flexibility. There are sustained improvements in reported headline macroeconomic indicators, but persistent delays in the completion of the sovereign debt restructuring could impede the progress made so far, in Fitch\u2019s view.",
    "Exposure to Sovereign Risks: HNB\u2019s high risk profile, similar to peers, stems from its large exposure to sovereign risk, via the defaulted foreign-currencydenominated sovereign bonds (end-2023: 10% of assets) and a further 33% of assets in rupee-denominated treasury securities, all of which make the bank vulnerable to the sovereign\u2019s repayment capacity and liquidity position. HNB has the highest exposure to sovereign bonds among local banks.",
    "Sovereign Default Affects Asset Quality: HNB\u2019s asset quality metrics are burdened by its large holdings in defaulted foreign-currency-denominated sovereign bonds, in addition to loan quality stresses already facing the bank (6% of assets). Fitch expects HNB\u2019s impaired (stage 3) loans to decrease in the near to medium term, buttressed by the improvement in borrower repayment capacity alongside the economic recovery and Fitch\u2019s anticipated expansion in the bank\u2019s loan book. This is despite the parate suspension that is in effect until 15 December 2024.",
    "Sovereign Risk Pressures Capital: The sovereign\u2019s external debt restructuring, including the defaulted sovereign bonds, and the rupee-denominated government securities, weigh on HNB\u2019s capitalisation metrics. High internal capital generation through retained profits and gains from currency appreciation bolstered HNB\u2019s regulatory Tier 1 ratio to 14.7% by end-2023 (2022: 11.4%). That said, we estimate the bank\u2019s underlying capital buffers to be lower by around 100bp if a 100% riskweighting were applied (currently 20%) on these defaulted bonds.",
    "Risks to Earnings Manageable: The bank\u2019s operating profit/risk-weighted assets ratio improved to 5.9% by end-1Q24, due primarily to lower credit costs, which more than offset the decrease in the net interest margin (1Q24: 5.5%, 2023: 7.0%).",
    "We expect the bank\u2019s profitability metrics to normalise as the yield benefit from its high-yielding government securities tapers off. This is despite the potential for oneoff losses from the restructuring of sovereign bonds, should these outstrip existing provisions (52% of the balance sheet exposure).",
    "Funding and Liquidity Risks Persist: We believe HNB\u2019s funding and liquidity stresses have eased relative to the crisis period, on both the foreign and local currency fronts given more favourable external sector flows and the bank\u2019s focus on liquidity preservation, as reflected in higher liquidity coverage ratio. However, improvements in foreign-currency liquidity remain susceptible to sudden changes in creditor sentiment. The bank\u2019s ability to access foreign-currency wholesale funding remains constrained by the sovereign\u2019s weak credit profile, similar to peers.",
    "Economic Conditions Supports New Lending: Fitch expects Sri Lanka\u2019s stabilising macroeconomic environment to support HNB\u2019s ability to generate and defend business volumes, but the bank\u2019s business profile remains constrained by the high risks in the OE. Fitch also expects the resumption in lending in the sector, albeit",
    "modest, to enhance HNB\u2019s share of assets in net loans, which fell to 47% by end1Q24 (2022: 56%) on muted lending opportunities and increased liquidity preservation.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "The bank\u2019s National Rating is sensitive to a change in the bank\u2019s creditworthiness relative to other Sri Lankan issuers.",
    "Deterioration in HNB\u2019s key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers would also increase downward pressure on the bank\u2019s rating, which is driven by its intrinsic financial strength.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "Positive rating action on the sovereign may lead to an upgrade in the bank\u2019s rating.",
    "A sustained improvement in the bank\u2019s key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers, could also lead to an upgrade of the bank\u2019s rating.",
    "Senior Debt: HNB\u2019s outstanding senior unsecured debentures are rated at the same level as its National Long-Term Rating in accordance with Fitch\u2019s criteria. This is because the issue ranks equally with the claims of the bank\u2019s other senior unsecured creditors.",
    "Subordinated Debt: HNB\u2019s Basel III-compliant Sri Lankan rupee subordinated debt is rated two notches below the National Long-Term Rating anchor. This reflects Fitch\u2019s baseline notching for loss severity for this type of debt and our expectation of poor recoveries. There is no additional notching for non-performance risks, as the notes do not incorporate going-concern loss-absorption features.",
    "The senior and subordinated debt ratings will move in tandem with the bank\u2019s National Long-Term Rating.",
