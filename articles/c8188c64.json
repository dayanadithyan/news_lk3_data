    "\u201cHe has brought his entire family into parliament,\u201d Dissanayake said Wednesday during the no-confidence debate against speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena. Dissanayake read out several names of the alleged family members employed in the speaker\u2019s office.",
    "\u201cAn entire Yapa generation (paramparavak) is here,\u201d Dissanayake said, \u201cOne of his sons is the Development Lotteries Board chairman.\u201d",
    "\u201cBecause he is beholden to the executive, he acts as a parasite.\u201d",
