Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, and Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan among many others.",
    "The JVP was involved in two armed uprisings against the Sri Lankan government in 1971 and 1987-89. The motive for both uprisings was to establish a socialist state. However, both insurgencies were defeated with annihilation of Marxists youth.",

    "\u201cWe ask Anura (JVP leader) if you questioned the Indian leaders over Sri Lanka being included in the Indian map as part of India, if you spoke against the power deals violating Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d he questioned.",
    "The JVP-led protests have halted many Indian investments in Sri Lanka while it has questioned India after securing lands, not using all the oil tanks in Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic Trincomalee tanks farm which was once planned to be the oil hub of South Asia with the Indian help.",

    "\u201cWhat is the deal with Ajih Delol who made Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Indian secret service puppets? Did you take or give an election bribe of $10 million from Indian businessmen?

    "\u201cAll know that JVP is the radical outfit which organizes protest campaigns. \u00a0An Indian firm is going to buy the Sri Lanka Telecom in the near future and this is just to make sure there is consensus over the deal and there are protests against that,\u201d Neththikumara told reporters on Wednesday.",

ETCA means opening both the Sri Lankan trade and labour market to India. That means depriving the opportunity for Sri Lankans,\u201d Weerawansa told reporters.",
    "\u201cWhen they (India) want to make this (country) as a colony, they want to control all the political parties like kittens,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI am not talking only about Anura Kumara Dissanayaka\u2019s invitation. The next will be the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, the main opposition. What India wants is to give is a leg massage and keep (Sri Lanka) people happy and say don\u2019t interfere on what they do.\u201d (Colombo/Feb 08/2024)"
