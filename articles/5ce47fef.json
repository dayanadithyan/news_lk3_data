    "Recognizing excellence in empowering of women in the Sri Lankan workplace",
    "Satynmag \u2013 AICPA&CIMA Women Friendly Workplace Awards have been recognized as the singular accolades in Sri Lanka dedicated towards empowering women in the workplace. The awards acknowledge organizations that champion gender inclusivity and women\u2019s empowerment within the corporate landscape, making them stakeholders in the journey of empowering women at work in the country.",
    "Launched in 2021, the awards have swiftly gained momentum, attracting a growing number of participants dedicated to cultivating a women-friendly work environment. The Satynmag AICPA&CIMA Women Friendly Workplace Awards were introduced in 2021, with an aim to recognize companies demonstrating an unwavering commitment to fostering gender equality, diversity, and inclusivity within their organizational structures. This initiative resonates profoundly with organizations, aligning seamlessly with the growing awareness of the pivotal role women play in the workplace.",
    "\u201cThe Awards acknowledge a conscious effort to make the workplace female-friendly and ensure equity,\u201d says Prof Arosha Adikaram, Chair of the HR Department at the University of Colombo and head of the Panel of Judges. \u201cCompanies dedicated to ensuring women\u2019s safety, career growth and empowerment are also committed towards maintaining a fair representation of females at all levels, indicating a commitment to overcoming challenges.\u201d",
    "Dr Adikaram states that a significant facet of the awards was the analysis of data and experiences from participating companies. Insights brought out ranged from enabling women to enter traditionally male-dominated sectors, like the automobile industry, to providing support for victims of domestic violence. These valuable insights were shared online at the launch of the Women Friendly Workplace Awards in 2023.",
    "\u201cThe Awards have become an icon of changing dynamics in the area of greater inclusion for women in the Sri Lankan workplace,\u201d says Zahara Ansary, FCMA (UK), CGMA, Country Manager for AICPA&CIMA in Sri Lanka and a member of the panel of judges. \u201cWe have witnessed the transforming impact it has had on the entire landscape of women in the Sri Lankan workplace. Every year, when we share our findings with the audience at the Awards Night, we find more organizations taking on the best practices and improving lives of the women in their workplace. The more women in the workforce, and the better they are treated will result in better financial results for organizations whilst also helping the Sri Lankan economy \u201c",
    "\u201cAs an HR professional, witnessing more companies showcase their efforts to create gender-inclusive workplaces is key to gaining more traction for gender inclusivity in the corporate world,\u201d says Ken Vijayakumar, President of CIPM and member of the panel of judges.",
    "\u201cIt is timely for Sri Lankan organizations to encourage more women in STEM,\u201d says Dr Beshan Kulapala, tech entrepreneur, Co-Founder/Director/CEO of Cyrus and panel of judges\u2019 member. \u201cGlobally, as the world shifts to more technology, women entering tech is both relevant and vital for the future.\u201d",
    "Nayomini R Weerasooriya, Founder Editor of Satynmag.com and a member of the panel of judges, says that the growing trend of companies committed to bridging the gender gap in traditionally male-dominated sectors is noteworthy. \u201cOrganizations are also investing in continuous training and upskilling to support women in career growth, ensuring a pipeline of qualified female leaders for the future.\u201d",
