    "The Human Rights Watch (HRW) states that Sri Lanka\u2019s proposed Online Safety Bill will create broad and vague new speech-related offences punishable by lengthy prison terms, while critically threatening the right to freedom of expression.",
    "\u201cA repressive new internet law that Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe is trying to rush through parliament this week would create broad and vague new speech-related offences punishable by lengthy prison terms. The law would seriously threaten the right to freedom of expression as Sri Lanka prepares for parliamentary and presidential elections later this year\u201d, it said in a statement.",
    "The proposed law, the Online Safety Bill, purportedly provides protections against online harassment, abuse, and fraud, the statement mentioned, highlighting that instead, it is mostly concerned with creating a new \u201cOnline Safety Commission,\u201d appointed by the president, that can decide what online speech is \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201charmful,\u201d remove content, restrict and prohibit internet access, and prosecute individuals and organizations.",
    "Furthermore, the international non-governmental organization also states that the commission-appointed \u201cexperts\u201d would be empowered to enter and search suspects\u2019 premises. Offences under the law carry hefty fines and prison sentences up to five years. The United Nations Human Rights Office said the law \u201ccould potentially criminalize nearly all forms of legitimate expression, creating an environment that has a chilling effect on freedom of expression.\u201d",
    "The Asia Internet Coalition, an industry body including tech giants such as Google, Apple, and Meta, has called the bill a \u201cdraconian system to stifle dissent\u201d and warned it \u201ccould undermine the potential growth of Sri Lanka\u2019s digital economy\u201d, it added.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is still reeling from an economic crisis partly caused by misgovernment and failures of accountability. In 2022, months-long protests demanding reform toppled the prime minister and president. Since coming to power that year, President Wickremesinghe has moved to stifle dissent.\u201d",
    "\u201cOther repressive legislation before parliament includes a new broadcasting law, which the UN experts say could be used to \u2018suppress dissenting voices,\u2019 and a counterterrorism law that \u2018grants wide powers to the police - and to the military - to stop, question and search, and to arrest and detain people, with inadequate judicial oversight\u2019\u201d, the statement mentioned.",
    "Meanwhile, it has also expressed that according to the International Monetary Fund, which is supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, restrictions on civil society, including the \u201cbroad application of counter-terrorism rules,\u201d already limit \u201coversight and monitoring of government actions,\u201d contributing to \u201csevere governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s repressive laws have facilitated widespread human rights violations for decades and contributed to economic and political crises, the Human Rights Watch stressed, adding that passing the Online Safety Bill would be a \u2018disastrous setback\u2019."
