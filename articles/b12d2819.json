    "Actress Piyumi Hansamali has appeared before the Illegal Assets Investigations Division of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) this morning (01), to record a statement regarding an investigation into the alleged suspicious acquisition of property.",
    "Hansamali, emphasizing confidence in her innocence, stated to the reporters: \u201cI have not done anything wrong, so there is no need to be afraid. We were actually summoned last week, but I only received the letter on Saturday. There are many documents that we need to get prepared\u2026\u201d",
    "Additionally, she explained the legitimacy of her business, stating that her income comes from selling cosmetics products.",
    "\u201cPeople can see that one pack of my cream costs about Rs. 35,000 and I have sold 25,000 packs so far. They can do the math and see where I got the money from. We have carried out all related transactions through the banking system and are documented. Bank statements are in 5 bags. We did everything through the bank\u201d, she added.",
    "Responding to her critics, she said: \u201cPeople are jealous. They are hypocritical. Can\u2019t I buy a car after learning something and doing business? Can\u2019t I earn and buy good cars?\u201d",
    "Commenting further, Hansamali also reiterated her innocence and determination to face the investigation without any fear."
