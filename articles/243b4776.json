    "Mexico\u2019s projected presidential winner Claudia Sheinbaum will become the first woman president in the country\u2019s 200-year history.",
    "\u201cI will become the first woman president of Mexico,\u201d Sheinbaum said with a smile, speaking at a downtown hotel shortly after electoral authorities announced a statistical sample showed she held an irreversible lead. \u201cI don\u2019t make it alone. We\u2019ve all made it, with our heroines who gave us our homeland, with our mothers, our daughters and our granddaughters.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe have demonstrated that Mexico is a democratic country with peaceful elections,\u201d she said.",
    "The National Electoral Institute\u2019s president said Sheinbaum had between 58.3% and 60.7% of the vote, according to a statistical sample. Opposition candidate X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez had between 26.6% and 28.6% of the vote and Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez had between 9.9% and 10.8% of the vote. Sheinbaum\u2019s Morena party was also projected to hold majorities in both chambers of Congress.",
    "The climate scientist and former Mexico City mayor said that her two competitors had called her and conceded her victory.",
    "The official preliminary count put Sheinbaum 28 points ahead of G\u00e1lvez with nearly 50% of polling places reporting.",
    "The fact that the two leading candidates were women had left little doubt that Mexico would make history Sunday. Sheinbaum will also be the first person from a Jewish background to lead the overwhelmingly Catholic country.",
    "She will start her six-year term Oct. 1. Mexico\u2019s constitution does not allow reelection.",
    "The leftist has said she believes the government has a strong role to play in addressing economic inequality and providing a sturdy social safety net, much like her political mentor President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.",
    "Sheinbaum\u2019s her victory suggests that the political movement L\u00f3pez Obrador created will live on after his presidency.",
    "His anointed successor, the 61-year-old Sheinbaum led the campaign wire-to-wire despite a spirited challenge from G\u00e1lvez. This was the first time in Mexico that the two main opponents were women.",
    "\u201cOf course, I congratulate Claudia Sheinbaum with all my respect who ended up the winner by a wide margin,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said shortly after the electoral authorities\u2019 announcement. \u201cShe is going to be Mexico\u2019s first (woman) president in 200 years.\u201d",
    "If the margin holds it would approach his landslide victory in 2018. L\u00f3pez Obrador won the presidency after two unsuccessful tries with 53.2% of the votes, in a three-way race where National Action took 22.3% and the Institutional Revolutionary Party took 16.5%.",
    "Still, Sheinbaum is unlikely to enjoy the kind of unquestioning devotion that L\u00f3pez Obrador has enjoyed.",
    "In Mexico City\u2019s colonial-era main plaza, the Zocalo, Sheinbaum\u2019s win did not draw the kind of cheering, jubilant crowds that greeted L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s victory in 2018. Those present were enthusiastic, but comparatively few in number.",
    "\u201cI promise that I am not going to let you down,\u201d Sheinbaum said, once she arrived in the plaza.",
    "Sara R\u00edos, 76, a retired literature professor at Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University, celebrated after hearing that G\u00e1lvez had conceded.",
    "\u201cThe only way that we move forward is by working together,\u201d R\u00edos said. \u201cShe is going to work to bring peace to the country, and is going to manage to advance, but it is a slow process.\u201d",
    "Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez, a chef, 28, acknowledged challenges ahead while waiting to hear the results in the square.",
    "\u201cYou vote for Claudia out of conviction, for AMLO,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said, referring to L\u00f3pez Obrador by his initials. But his highest hope is that Sheinbaum can \u201cimprove what AMLO couldn\u2019t do, the price of gasoline, crime and drug trafficking, which he didn\u2019t combat even though he had the power.\u201d",
    "The main opposition candidate, G\u00e1lvez, a tech entrepreneur and former senator, had promised to take a more aggressive approach toward organized crime.",
    "In her concession speech, she said \u201cI want to stress that my recognition (of Sheinbaum\u2019s victory) comes with a firm demand for results and solutions to the country\u2019s serious problems.\u201d",
    "Nearly 100 million people were registered to vote and turnout appeared to be about 60%, similar to earlier elections.",
    "Voters were also electing governors in nine of the country\u2019s 32 states, and choosing candidates for both houses of Congress, thousands of mayorships and other local posts, in the biggest elections the nation has seen and ones that have been marked by violence.",
    "The elections were widely seen as a referendum on L\u00f3pez Obrador, a populist who has expanded social programs but largely failed to reduce cartel violence in Mexico. His Morena party currently holds 23 of the 32 governorships and a simple majority of seats in both houses of Congress.",
    "Sheinbaum promised to continue all of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies, including a universal pension for the elderly and a program that pays youths to apprentice.",
    "The persistent cartel violence and Mexico\u2019s middling economic performance were the main issues on voters\u2019 minds.",
    "Julio Garc\u00eda, a Mexico City office worker, said he was voting for the opposition in Mexico City\u2019s central San Rafael neighborhood. \u201cThey\u2019ve robbed me twice at gunpoint. You have to change direction, change leadership,\u201d the 34-year-old said. \u201cContinuing the same way, we\u2019re going to become Venezuela.\u201d",
    "On the fringes of Mexico City in the neighborhood of San Andres Totoltepec, electoral officials filed past 34-year-old homemaker Stephania Navarrete, who watched dozens of cameramen and electoral officials gathering where frontrunner Claudia Sheinbaum was set to vote.",
    "Navarrete said she planned to vote for Sheinbaum despite her own doubts about L\u00f3pez Obrador and his party.",
    "\u201cHaving a woman president, for me as a Mexican woman, it\u2019s going to be like before when for the simple fact that you say you are a woman you\u2019re limited to certain professions. Not anymore.\u201d",
    "She said the social programs of Sheinbaum\u2019s mentor were crucial, but added that deterioration of cartel violence in the past few years was her primary concern in this election.",
    "\u201cThat is something that they have to focus more on,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me security is the major challenge. They said they were going to lower the levels of crime, but no, it was the opposite, they shot up. Obviously, I don\u2019t completely blame the president, but it is in a certain way his responsibility.\u201d",
    "L\u00f3pez Obrador claims to have reduced historically high homicide levels by 20% since he took office in December 2018. But that\u2019s largely a claim based on a questionable reading of statistics. The real homicide rate appears to have declined by only about 4% in six years.",
    "Just as the upcoming November rematch between U.S. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump has underscored deep divisions in the U.S., Sunday\u2019s election revealed how severely polarized public opinion is in Mexico over the direction of the country, including its security strategy and how to grow the economy."
