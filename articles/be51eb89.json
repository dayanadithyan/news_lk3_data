    "SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa says despite difficulties Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s regime did not reach a point where rice distribution became necessary",
    "Notes SL has a good economy especially during his father\u2019s tenure where people could easily purchase rice",
    "Says alongside rice distribution Govt. must focus on developing SL\u2019s fledgling rural economy",
    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) National Organiser and Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa yesterday stressed that the Government\u2019s distribution of rice to the people of the country is not a solution to the struggles they are facing.",
    "\u201cDuring the tenure of Mahinda Rajapaksa, we had an economy in which people could easily purchase rice. There was no need to distribute rice to the people,\u201d he noted. He added that such a move was not necessary even during the tenure of his uncle, former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "\u201cDuring Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s tenure, power outages were prevalent. If the Uma Oya project had been completed by the previous Government, power cuts would not have been unnecessary. This would have prevented the need to import fuel, thus retaining dollars within the country. Despite the challenges we faced, our Government did not reach a point where distributing rice to the people became necessary,\u201d he said.",
    "The comments come amid a backdrop where the Government has commenced a National Rice Distribution program for low-income families. The initiative was announced by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in March.",
    "Rajapaksa acknowledged the hardships faced by low-income families in villages and recognised the challenges in the country\u2019s rural economy. \u201cDistributing rice is a commendable initiative. However, alongside rice distribution, we must focus on building an economy that supports purchasing rice from rural farmers,\u201d he emphasised. He further said that as a responsible party, the SLPP regularly informs the President and the Government about these concerns."
