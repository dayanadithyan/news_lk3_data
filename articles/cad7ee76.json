    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet of ministers had given approval to develop grid scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) to maintain power system stability as variable renewable power plants expand, a government statement said.",
    "Sri Lanka is expecting to connect large volumes solar and wind power between 2024-2030 to meet a 70 percent renewable electricity target, but due to variability of wind and solar (non-firm energy), the system stability is undermined.",
    "As a result, the power grid has to be able to absorb the shocks from non-firm energy.",
    "Battery energy systems storage (BESS) is one of the solutions identified in a long-term generation plan, the statement said.",
    "A committee appointed to study the issue had recommended building battery banks.",
    "The cabinet had approved the development of battery storage system as public private partnerships or private projects. (Colombo/May24/2025)"
