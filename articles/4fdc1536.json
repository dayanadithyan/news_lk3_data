    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s online tax collection system RAMIS is \u201cnot operatable\u201d, and the Ministry of Information Technology is ready to do for an independent audit to find the shortcomings, State IT Minister Kanaka Herath said.",
    "The Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) was introduced to the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) when the island nation signed for its 16th International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme in 2016.",
    "However, trade unions at the IRD protested the move, claiming that the system was malfunctioning despite billions being spent for it amid allegations that the new system was reducing the direct contacts between taxpayers and the IRD to reduce corruption.",
    "The RAMIS had to be stopped after taxpayers faced massive penalties because of blunders made by heads of the IT division, computer operators and system errors at the IRD, government officials have said.",
    "\u201cThe whole of Sri Lanka admits RAMIS is a failure. The annual fee is very high for that. This should be told in public,\u201d Herath told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo on Thursday (29)",
    "\u201cIn future, we want all the ministries to get the guidelines from our ministry when they go for ERP (Enterprise resource planning).\u201d",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s government said the RAMIS system will be operational from December last year.",
    "However, the failure has delayed some tax collection which could have been paid via online.",
    "\u201cIt is not under our ministry. It is under the finance ministry. We have no involvement with it, but still, it is not operatable,\u201d Herath said.",
    "\u201cSo, there are so many issues going on and I have no idea what the technical part of it. We can carry out an independent audit to find out the shortcomings of the software.\u201d",
    "Finance Ministry officials say IRD employees and trade unions had been resisting the RAMIS because it prevents direct interactions with taxpayers and possible bribes for defaulting or under paying taxes.",
    "The crisis-hit island nation is struggling to boost its revenue in line with the target it has committed to the IMF in return for a 3 billion-dollar extended fund facility. (Colombo/Feb 29/2024)"
