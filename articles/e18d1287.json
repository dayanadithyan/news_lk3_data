    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 All Sri Lankan districts including in the island nation\u2019s North and East will sign a \u201csister district\u201d deal with China\u2019s Chongqing province for investments and improve production capacity, State Minister of Social Empowerment Anupa Pasqual, said.",
    "Sovereign debt defaulted Sri Lanka has been looking to attract investments into grass root level across the country and the island nation has been in discussion for \u201csister district\u201d concept with China\u2019s Chongqing, which has around 33 million population.",
    "Minister Pasqual said Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena during his Chinese visit last year has already entered into an agreement to link one of the Chongqing\u2019s district with the island nation\u2019s Western coastal district of Kalutara as a \u201cmodel project\u201d.",
    "\u201cThere are 40 districts in Chongqing province. As a trial, we have signed agreement with one of the districts and Kalutara district. When the project goes on, Sri Lanka\u2019s other 24 districts also will enter into agreements with other districts of Chongqing and become sister districts,\u201d Pasqual told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo on Wednesday (20)",
    "\u201cWe are doing one by one. It is not practical to do all simultaneously. We have chosen Kalutara as a model district.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s effort to link with Chinese provinces in the past has not succeeded in a significant way, political analysts say.",
    "Pasqual said Prime Minister Gunawardena will discuss on the sister district concept when he visits to China later this month on an official visit.",
    "\u201cThe aim is to strengthen the production capacity and attract more investment,\u201d he said.",
    "According to government officials, China has been keen to start projects in many sectors including agriculture, fisheries, and small and medium industries at grassroot level.",
    "\u201cWe are doing some special projects with China\u2019s Chongqing region. Under the One Belt, One Road, Prime Minister last year had discussions for revival of villages,\u201d the Minister said.",
    "\u201cWe had three agreements between our ministry and Chongqing province. We had agreements with 33 vocational training institutes. Also we signed an agreement with Three Gorges institute.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe have already signed agreement for 100,000 Sri Lankans to undergo vocational training. According the agreement we signed with Three Gorges, it will establish a new branch in Sri Lanka next month to provide vocational training for 100,000 people.\u201d (Colombo/March 20/2024)"
