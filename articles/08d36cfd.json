  "original_body_lines": [
    "Thailand\u2019s Parliament elected Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the youngest daughter of the divisive former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, as the country\u2019s new prime minister Friday.",
    "Paetongtarn becomes Thailand\u2019s third leader from the Shinawatra family, after her father, who was ousted by coup before returning from exile last year, and her aunt Yingluck Shinawatra, who lives in exile. Paetongtarn also became Thailand\u2019s second female prime minister after her aunt and the country\u2019s youngest leader at 37.",
    "She is the leader of the ruling Pheu Thai party but was not an elected lawmaker, which was not required for her to be a candidate for prime minister. Paetongtarn was the sole nominee and got a majority of the votes in Parliament with the voting ongoing.",
    "The last prime minister had been removed by the Constitutional Court two days ago over an ethics violation.",
    "Thaksin is one of Thailand\u2019s most popular but divisive political figures and was ousted by a military coup in 2006. He is widely seen as a de facto leader of Pheu Thai, the latest in a string of parties linked to him. His residual popularity and influence is a factor behind the political support for Paetongtarn.",
    "Her public entry into politics came in 2021 when the Pheu Thai party announced she would lead an inclusion advisory committee. She was appointed as leader of Pheu Thai last year, after she was named one of its three prime ministerial candidates ahead of the polls.",
    "When Paetongtarn was on the campaign trail for Pheu Thai, she acknowledged her family ties but insisted she was not just her father\u2019s proxy.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s not the shadow of my dad. I am my dad\u2019s daughter, always and forever, but I have my own decisions,\u201d she told a reporter.",
    "However, her father\u2019s shadow is too big to be dismissed and her work will not be easy with him continuing to call political shots for Pheu Thai, said Petra Alderman, a political research fellow at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",
    "\u201cThaksin was a political force to reckon with, but he was also a liability,\u201d she said, \u201cHe has a tendency to overplay his political hand, so serving in his shadow has never been easy.\u201d",
    "Paetongtarn\u2019s nomination followed the removal of Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin on Wednesday after less than a year in office. The Constitutional Court found him guilty of a serious ethical breach regarding his appointment of a Cabinet member who was jailed in connection with an alleged bribery attempt.",
    "It was the second major ruling in a week to shake Thai politics. The same court last week dissolved the progressive Move Forward party, which won last year\u2019s general election but was blocked from taking power. The party has already regrouped as the People\u2019s Party.",
    "Pheu Thai and its predecessors had won all national elections since 2001, with core populist policies pledging to solve economic problems and bridge income equality, until it lost to the reformist Move Forward in 2023. It, however, was given a chance to form a government after Move Forward was blocked from taking power by the previous Senate, a military-appointed body.",
    "Move Forward was excluded from the coalition by Pheu Thai, which went on to join hands with parties affiliated with the military government that ousted it in a coup. The move drew criticism from some of its supporters but party officials say it was necessary to break the deadlock and start reconciliation after decades of deep political divisions.",
    "Thaksin returned to Thailand last year after years in exile in what was interpreted as part of a political bargain between Pheu Thai and their longstanding rivals in the conservative establishment to stop Move Forward Party from forming a government.",
    "The former senators were given special power to veto a prime ministerial candidate by the constitution adopted in 2017 under a military government. However, that power expired when their term ended in May. New members of the Senate, selected in a convoluted process last month, do not retain the veto.",
    "A candidate now needs just a majority from the lower house, or at least 247 votes. The current 11 party-coalition led by Pheu Thai now has 314 lawmakers in the lower house, and they have declared their unanimous support for Paetongtarn.",
    "The coalition under the leadership of Paetongtarn could strengthen their unity because Paetongtarn possesses something that Srettha does not \u2014 a direct line to her powerful father who has the final say \u2014 said Napon Jatusripitak, a political science researcher at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.",
    "\u201cIn a strange way, it creates a clear chain of command and curbs factionalism,\u201d he said. \u201cPaetongtarn will be given clear jurisdictions on where she can exercise her own agency and where it is a matter between her father and the coalition members.\u201d",
    "With Move Forward dissolved and the party\u2019s only prime ministerial candidate Pita Limjaroenrat banned from political activities, Napon believes it\u2019s the time that the rest of major political parties resume a \u201cgame of musical chairs\u201d of the premiership race that has been put on hold \u201cwith an agreement to share power, regardless of who becomes the prime minister.\u201d",
    "\u201cMost importantly, the overarching goal remains the same: to keep the music playing and exclude the reformists from power,\u201d he said."
