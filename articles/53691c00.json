    "\u201cWe spontaneously decided that for \u2018 One Night Only \u2018 we would perform as The Jetliners \u2013 a Birthday Tribute to our very special and dear friend Sampath.",
    "\u201cIt was a joyous experience, I hope for all present, but most certainly it was for us as we had both Mignonne and Roger Menezes, dear Jetliner colleagues, join us, plus our very dear friend Suren Ediriweera, who supported us excellently on drums.",
    "\u201cWe also had a talented younger musician Suraj Gunewardene not only join us on stage, but also helping us with equipment, etc.",
    "\u201cLooking back, we would not have missed this occasion for all the Tea in Sri Lanka, so Thank You Sampath.\u201d",
