    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said he will respond to invitations to contest the 2024 presidential election in due course, while also inviting his opposition rivals to join his efforts develop Sri Lanka.",
    "Speaking at a rally in Gampaha on Sunday July 21, Wickremesinghe said politics should align with the country\u2019s needs.",
    "\u201cThe future of our country cannot be determined solely by political agendas. I will not allow that. Politics should align with the country\u2019s needs; otherwise, our country has no future. We must advance as a proud nation, making meaningful changes rather than issuing false promises. The country\u2019s progress should not be driven by political agendas, but by a shared vision for national development. I invite Sajith Premadasa and Anura Dissanayake to join us in this effort. Let\u2019s embark on this journey together,\u201d he said.",
    "Premadasa, who leads the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) which broke off from Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party (UNP) has already declared his intention to contest the presidential election, has has leftist opposition party National People\u2019s Power (NPP) leader Dissanayake.",
    "An opinion poll for June showed that Premadasa\u2019s net favourability rating increased by 27 points to -39 while President Wickremesinghe\u2019s also increased by 10 points to -66 in June compared to the previous month, though Dissanayake remained the least unpopular at -20 despite an 18-point drop.",
    "The Gampaha rally was attended by prominent supporters of Wickremesinghe from his own UNP and the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, which has yet to officially announce its position on backing the president at the polls.",
    "\u201cWe have been involved in politics since universal franchise was established in 1931. However, after each election, power has been transferred smoothly. We do not point fingers at the Supreme Court; as such a situation is unique to our country. We proudly carry this system forward. We cannot revert to the era of queuing for essentials. Together, let\u2019s build a country where we can all live well. When an invitation is made, answers must be given, and it will be given in due course,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jul22/2024)"
