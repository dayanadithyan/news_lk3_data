    "Sri Lankan women \u2018experiencing\u2019 discrimination and disadvantages in achieving economic empowerment",
    "Shortage of female participation \u2018proving to be\u2019 detrimental to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth",
    "Legislative reforms and mindset shifts urged to reduce barriers to women\u2019s success in careers and enterprise",
    "Dr. Roshan Perera (Chairperson, Women\u2019s Policy Action Network), Shyamali Ranaraja (Attorney \u2013 at- law) and Gayani de Alwis (1st Vice Chairperson, Women\u2019s Chamber of Industry and Commerce), last week explained to the media about the urgency of legislative reforms and societal mindset shifts to reduce barriers to women\u2019s economic empowerment in Sri Lanka.",
    "It was encouraging to see that these three women who have had every opportunity and blessing in their own life wanting the same for all Sri Lankan women.They were speaking at this media event co-hosted by the The Advocata Institute and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, on July 11 at the BMICH Colombo.",
    "The event was titled \u201cUnlocking Potential: Policies for Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment\u201d.",
    "Dr. Perera outlined the establishment and objectives of the Women\u2019s Policy Advocacy Network (WPAN). Emphasising the necessity for collective advocacy, she highlighted WPAN\u2019s focus on six critical areas: land laws, labour laws, informal sector recognition, social infrastructure, women\u2019s participation in the digital economy and financial inclusion which is elusive for women entrepreneurs.",
    "\u201cAlthough there are many agencies working in this space we felt it was necessary to bring all these efforts together to amplify the voice for change in this area ,\u201d said Dr. Perera.",
    "Shyamali Ranaraja addressed the precarious nature of employment for women, highlighting societal disincentives that hinder their return to the workforce post-childbirth and marriage. She pointed out that current legislation creates significant barriers for women re-entering the labour force, with another critical juncture occurring around age 50, coinciding with eligibility for EPF payments.",
    "She emphasised the precariousness of available work for women, noting that domestic work was excluded from the 2016 minimum wage law, underscoring the need for formal recognition and enhanced protections for domestic workers. \u201cIf Sri Lanka itself does not provide women with basic pay for domestic work,\u201d she questioned, \u201chow can we ask other countries to pay expat domestic workers equally?\u201d",
    "\u201cSaying women should be able to work at night without providing infrastructure for a solution is pointless\u201d, she said. She suggested that simple legislative amendments could spur change. She proposed \u201cNew condominium developments should have child centres by law, which will have no bearing on state finances. Such a move will make a huge difference for women\u2019s empowerment.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Gender-Equality bill was written to fail \u2013 the legal terminology was not appropriate,\u201d Ms. Ranaraja pointed out. She also highlighted that the few female representatives in government, despite representing an electorate that is more than 50 percent female, are publicly ridiculed and harassed by fellow male politicians in front of the entire nation. \u201cThe burden of implementing solutions must primarily rest on the state,\u201d Ms. Ranaraja emphasised, connecting her advocacy for systemic changes in social infrastructure to broader societal and legislative reforms. This holistic approach, she suggested, is crucial to creating an environment where women can fully participate in and bene t from the workforce, addressing disparities and ensuring equitable opportunities across Sri Lanka.",
    "Ms. de Alwis emphasised the critical role of mindset change in empowering women economically. \u201cLaws are good, but how do we truly change the minds of people at a grassroots level?\u201d asked Ms. de Alwis. She pointed out the challenges women face in accessing nance and the discouraging environment in nancial institutions. Sri Lanka\u2019s ranking of 122 out of 146 countries in gender equality re ects signi cant disparities across economic participation, education, health outcomes, and political empowerment, as measured by the Global Gender Gap Index. \u201cAwareness is key, \u201d Ms. de Alwis asserted. She called for increased support for female entrepreneurs and urged the inclusion of gender equality discussions at all levels of education to dismantle misogynistic viewpoints. \u201cThe issue of mindset change must be discussed at all levels,\u201d she stressed, particularly at a school age level to remove ingrained stereotypes.",
