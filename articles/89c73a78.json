    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon has vowed to increase resources and cadres in the fight against drug menace and crimes even by closing some unproductive divisions if required.",
    "The island nation\u2019s police under Tennakoon have focused on eradicating drug menace through a special operation despite local and international criticism over human rights abuses.",
    "Sri Lanka has recognized the drug menace as one of the key threats and Tennakoon-led police have backed drastic measures in the special anti-drug operation titled \u201cYukthiya\u201d (justice) to nab the drug distributors across the country.",
    "Since the operation was launched in mid-December, the police have arrested tens of thousands of 0 people mostly with drugs including heroin, cannabis, synthetic drugs, and cocaine, police data show.",
    "The UN Human Rights Commission early this year said it was \u201cvery concerned that authorities in Sri Lanka\u201d were \u201cadopting a heavily security-based response to the country\u2019s drugs problem, instead of public health policies grounded in human rights\u201d.",
    "However, Tennakoon said the operation will be strengthened further after the traditional new year celebrated on April 14.",
    "\u201cThis year is a decisive one. We will create a nation where people can live without fear of crimes and drugs,\u201d the police chief told media on Sunday when he visited the police officials during the traditional new year.",
    "\u201cThe operation to eradicate crimes and drugs has become a huge success. So, more steps are to be taken in the future.\u00a0I will make the aggressive nature of fight against underworld after the Sinhala new year,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cPolice is a very strong institution. We are using only a few resources to fight against the crimes and drugs. If required, I will double or triple the strength and will terminate some divisions in the police which are less productive and efficient. I will divert those officers and resources to fight against drugs and crimes.\u201d",
    "The UN has urged the Sri Lankan government to review the \u201cYukthiya\u201d operation, and to implement human rights based approaches, notably the right to health, in addressing the issues of illicit drugs in society.",
    "The UN statement came after people were reported to have been subjected to a number of violations during and after these operations, including unauthorised searches, arbitrary arrests and detention, ill-treatment, torture, and strip searches in public.",
    "Police comes under the Ministry of Public Security and the Tiran Alles, the minister in charge has rejected calls to stop Yukthiya operations.",
    "Tennakoon has said the operation has reduced the supply for drugs and increased the prices by multiple folds. (Colombo/April 17/2024)"
