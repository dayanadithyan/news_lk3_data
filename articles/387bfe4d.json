    "Sri Lanka Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for Manufacturing (PMI \u2013 Manufacturing) recorded an index value of 42.0 in April 2024, indicating a contraction in manufacturing activities following the seasonal pattern. New Orders, Production, Employment and Stock of Purchases sub-indices declined during the month, resulting in an overall decline in the index.",
    "As per the respondents, the decline in New Orders was mainly due to the end of the festive season\u2019s demand, particularly for food & beverages. Further, the decrease in Production was primarily due to the fewer working days in April, as most factories were temporarily closed for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holidays. Moreover, Employment and Stock of Purchases decreased during the month, in line with the decline in New Orders and Production. Meanwhile, Suppliers\u2019 Delivery Time further lengthened in April, owing to the extended holidays in the month.",
