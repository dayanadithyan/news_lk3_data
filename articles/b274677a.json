    "Colombo, Jan 29 (Daily Mirror) -\u00a0 The terror group which carried out the Easter Sunday bomb attacks are associates of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) and had actually funded the Marxists, MP Nimal Lanza said over the weekend.",
    "\u201cIbrahim who was a key suspect in the Easter Sunday attacks was in the NPP national list. The father of one of the suicide bombers was also in the NPP national list. This group has funded the NPP with millions of rupees. Catholics in this country should remember this fact when casting their votes,\u201d Lanza said during the inaugural rally of the new alliance that is in the making.",
    "\u201cNPP leaders have not paid a single cent as taxes. They have not provided employment to a single youth, unlike us. This is because they don\u2019t own any enterprises. They are not employed. However, they lead more comfortable lives than any one of us,\u201d he said."
