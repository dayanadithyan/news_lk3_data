    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) will end the backlog of issuing laminated driving license for 865,000 temporary paper holders by October this year, State Transport Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said, as the island nation\u2019s economic recovery has helped to start printing them in usual laminated papers.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s unprecedented economic crisis forced the DMT to suspend imports of printing materials in the face of severe dollar shortage after declaring bankruptcy and sovereign debt default.",
    "\u201cWe could not issue the driving license as we did not have dollars to order the required materials,\u201d Alagiyawanna told reporters in Colombo at a media briefing.",
    "\u201cAccordingly, there are 865,000 temporary paper license holders without proper licenses.\u201d",
    "With the slight economic recovery and improved foreign exchange reserves, the government has now gradually started imports which were earlier suspended.",
    "\u201cWe have established three new machines now with the involvement of the private sector and taken steps to print around 4,000 driving licenses on a daily basis,\u201d the Minister said.",
    "\u201cFrom October onwards, we should be able to issue driving licenses instantly without any backlog.\u201d",
    "He said the DMT will be giving priority in issuing the driving license for those who have to migrate for jobs or face employment interviews. (Colombo/Jan 17/2024)"
