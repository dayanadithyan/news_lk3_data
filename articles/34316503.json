  "original_body_lines": [
    "Norway, Ireland and Spain said Wednesday they are recognizing a Palestinian state in a historic move that drew condemnation from Israel and jubilation from the Palestinians. Israel immediately ordered back its ambassadors from Norway and Ireland.",
    "It was a lightning cascade of announcements. First was Norway, whose Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said \u201cthere cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition.\u201d",
    "Gahr St\u00f8re said the Scandinavian country will officially recognize a Palestinian state as of May 28. \u201cBy recognizing a Palestinian state, Norway supports the Arab peace plan,\u201d he said.",
    "Several European Union countries have in the past weeks indicated that they plan to make the recognition, arguing a two-state solution is essential for lasting peace in the region. The decision may generate momentum for the recognition of a Palestinian state by other EU countries and could spur further steps at the United Nations, deepening Israel\u2019s isolation.",
    "Norway, which is not a member of the European Union but mirror its moves, has been an ardent supporter of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians.",
    "\u201cThe terror has been committed by Hamas and militant groups who are not supporters of a two-state solution and the state of Israel,\u201d the Norwegian government leader said. \u201cPalestine has a fundamental right to an independent state.\u201d",
    "The move comes as Israeli forces have led assaults on the northern and southern edges of the Gaza Strip in May, causing a new exodus of hundreds of thousands of people, and sharply restricted the flow of aid, raising the risk of famine.",
    "The Scandinavian country \u201cwill therefore regard Palestine as an independent state with all the rights and obligations that entails,\u201d Gahr St\u00f8re said.",
    "The development comes more than 30 years after the first Oslo agreement was signed in 1993. Since then, \u201cthe Palestinians have taken important steps towards a two-state solution,\u201d the Norwegian government said.",
    "It said that the World Bank determined that a Palestinian state had met key criteria to function as a state in 2011, that national institutions have been built up to provide the population with important services.",
    "\u201cThe war in Gaza and the constant expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank still mean that the situation in Palestine is more difficult than it has been in decades,\u201d the Norwegian government said.",
    "Also Wednesday, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris made his announcement, saying it was a move coordinated with Spain and Norway, \u201can historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine.\u201d He said the move was intended to help move the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to resolution through a two-state solution.",
    "Harris said he thinks other countries will join Norway, Spain and Ireland in recognizing a Palestinian state \u201cin the weeks ahead.\u201d",
    "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said that his country will recognize a Palestinian state also on May 28. S\u00e1nchez, Spain\u2019s Socialist leader since 2018, made the expected announcement to the nation\u2019s Parliament on Wednesday.",
    "S\u00e1nchez has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for the recognition of a Palestinian state, as well as a possible ceasefire in Gaza. He has said several times that he was committed to the move.",
    "\u201cWe know that this initiative won\u2019t bring back the past and the lives lost in Palestine, but we believe that it will give the Palestinians two things that are very important for their present and their future: dignity and hope,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
    "\u201cThis recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\u201d S\u00e1nchez added, while acknowledging that it will most likely cause diplomatic tensions with Tel Aviv. \u201cIt is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\u201d",
    "S\u00e1nchez argued that the move is needed to support the viability of a two-state solution that he said \u201cis in serious danger\u201d with the war in Gaza.",
    "\u201cI have spent weeks and months speaking with leaders inside and outside of the region and if one thing is clear is that Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu does not have a project of peace for Palestine, even if the fight against the terrorist group Hamas is legitimate,\u201d the Spanish leader said.",
    "Earlier this month, Spain\u2019s Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Albares said he had informed U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken of his government\u2019s intention to recognize a Palestinian state.",
    "Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered Israel\u2019s ambassadors from Ireland and Norway to immediately return to Israel, as Norway said it would recognize a Palestinian state and Ireland was expected to do the same.",
    "\u201cIreland and Norway intend to send a message today to the Palestinians and the whole world: terrorism pays,\u201d Katz said.",
    "He said that the recognition could impede efforts to return Israel\u2019s hostages being held in Gaza and makes a cease-fire less likely by \u201crewarding the jihadists of Hamas and Iran.\u201d He also threatened to recall Israel\u2019s ambassador to Spain if the country takes a similar position.",
    "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed Norway\u2019s recognition of a Palestinian state and called on other countries to follow.",
    "In a statement carried by the official Wafa news agency, Abbas said Norway\u2019s decision will enshrine \u201cthe Palestinian people\u2019s right to self-determination\u201d and support efforts to bring about a two-state solution with Israel."
