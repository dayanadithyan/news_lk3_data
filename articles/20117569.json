    "(Sena Thoradeniya\u2019s Latest Work: Dumbara Rata: Volume I: Foundation Essays)",
    "Returning to Kandy in 1949 Minnette de Silva set up practice, away from Colombo but at the heart of traditional Lanka \u2013 the home of lacquer work, Dumbara mats and religious & feudal architecture.",
    "\u201cThe Hilton pays homage to the country\u2019s culturally rich heritage with Dumbara-inspired motifs, a nod to the country\u2019s traditional weaving craftsmanship\u2026\u201d.",
    "\u201cClothing & accessories made from traditional crafts such as Dumbara weaving, Beeralu lace, batik\u2026.\u201d",
    "The Dumbara Valley in the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka is inextricably and umbilically linked with \u201cthe hereditary craft of textile weaving \u201d at least, in the minds of the ruling denizens of the country. These minds rarely venture South, East & North out of that constipated suburb of London (& now NY) known as Colombo, and if they do, it\u2019s only to ensure their cut of the tea plucked, rubber tapped, coconuts husked, graphite mined & garments assembled, then exported, along with workers\u2026 after all these commodities have, of course, been duly hanged, dried, quartered and calculated.",
    "usually recalls some motif, some weave they may step on, or some cloth they may exotically incarcerate their bodies in, to claim some occasional fashion, a sarong or a scarf, to scale some sartorial bridge to the dominant though repressed national culture \u2013 the Barefoot School of faux adoration and patronization of handicrafts \u2013 who the children of this valley appear to be in no hurry to inherit. They have little idea of the role that the people of this quantum of geography have played and still play in the drama of all our lives.",
    "Enter stage left then is critic and award-winning novelist, Sena Thoradeniya\u2019s latest oeuvre Dumbara Rata: Vol. I published last week. This seminal work on Dumbara consists of four volumes and if we dare measure this initial salvo by its cover, it indeed promises to unleash grand fireworks of what he ventures as \u201ca new field of study- Kandyan Affairs\u201d. The Kandyan Kingdom aka Sinhale spread to all corners of the country.",
    "The book\u2019s jacket designed by Nalinda Seneviratna (from a photograph taken by Divoj Savitha Thoradeniya, author\u2019s grandson) displays an intriguing \u201cself-portrait\u201d of King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe (1742-81), drawn on a length of Dutch cloth, donated to the high priest of a Raja Maha Viharaya in Patha Dumbara.",
    "\u201cTradition declares the painting a self-portrait\u201d, yet no historical records of the king himself as an artist. Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe\u2019s reign traverses the Dutch invasions, and midst these wars he is yet seen as a benefactor of such arts as the Kandyan countryside\u2019s temple murals.",
    "This \u201cself-portrait\u201d has been conserved by the Viharaya\u2019s present incumbent, entering the public domain for the first time. (Thoradeniya does not disclose the name of the Viharaya for its safety and the present custodian of it!). Colombo\u2019s so-called art historians and those domiciled abroad and western \u2013 trained archeologists and anthropologists are not even aware that such art exists.",
    "Thoradeniya, he himself a proud son of an ancient village in  Patha Dumbara, restricts the initial scope of his Kandyan Studies to  Dumbara. An administrative region in the ancient Kandyan Kingdom, Dumbara turns out to be an integral part of Kanda Uda Pas Rata, sometimes called Rata Paha or Rata Hatha. He examines Dumbara\u2019s evolution in the ancient kadaim poth (boundary books) and lekam miti (land rolls/cadastral registers), and how Dumbara,  Hunnasgiriya Mountains, Mahaveli Ganga and Dumbara  villages gain stature especially through folk poets. He provides valuable source material for Dumbara, and of the physical foundations of Dumbara,  of Patha Dumbara (five divisions) and Uda Dumbara (six divisions), with detailed maps \u2013 topographical sheets prepared in the early 1900s, two Appendices, listing its ancient irrigation works so vital to the economy, the Colonial Project in Dumbara and the status of Dumbara after 133 years of British occupation, including a Bibliography.",
    "Thoradeniya more recently exposed the forces behind the recent recolonization of the country \u2013 not as a struggle or a revolution but a counter-revolution. His 10-part essay titled \u201cKandyan Chieftains Under the British\u201d forms the foundation for his Kandyan Studies.",
    "Volume 2 titled \u201cDumbara Historical Foundations\u201d therefore promise exciting accounts of how Dumbara people fought against South Indian invaders such as Elara, stories of the Dumbara kings and how Dumbara people battled the English in 1818 and 1848, along the way debunking such anthropologists as Gananath Obeysekera\u2019s myth-making that D\u2019Oyly\u2019s espionage work did not encoil Dumbara.",
    "Volume 3, \u201cDumbara Economic and Social Foundations\u201c examines lekam miti relevant to Dumbara, Dumbara  villages, caste system, family names and personal names and its dialects. Most interesting are the accounts of land grab in Dumbara, plantation economy, how Grain Tax and other repressive taxes affected the Dumbara peasantry and of the collaboration of Kandyan chieftains with English rulers and plantation owners.",
    "The final volume offers \u201cDumbara Cultural Foundations\u201c, the link between Dumbara and the Dalada, Dumbara  temple paintings, Dumbara arts and crafts, folklore, gods and deities, ancient games and desserts, cultural expositions as Maname,  Sandakinduru and Sokari; for the first time bringing into the public domain an ancient ola poetry book depicting the emergence of paththini halamba (Goddess Paththini\u2019s anklet) from a stream in Patha Dumbara. Again, it\u2019s unlikely our anthro-apologists have even considered such rarities.",
    "Thoradeniya\u2019s studies are vital, as our intellectuals love to clothe themselves in the latest of Europe\u2019s epistemological fashions throwing around such words as \u201cfeudal\u201d when at least in its Marxist-Leninist sense, means an anterior pre-industrial capitalist epoch.",
    "It is hoped a publisher will ensure the other three volumes will see not just the light of day, but the lights long after. The book written in Sinhala contains 270 pages, priced at Rs. 2500/= and available at leading book shops.",
    "Four takeaways from the UN Security Council resolution on Gaza",
