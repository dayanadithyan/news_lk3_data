    "Notably, they mentioned the fact that automotive imports to Sri Lanka which have come to a halt due to the foreign exchange crisis, would get a respite this year, as the country\u2019s macroeconomic indicators are getting into a better shape after four years.",
    "\u201cWe believe that motorcycle imports will be allowed into Sri Lanka this year and we want our dealers to be ready to maintain and handle our loyal Yamaha customers, and meet the demand for Yamaha motorcycles,\u201d they said.",
    "\u201cIn such circumstances, Yamaha dealers should improve their business processes now, in order to thrive in the boom time.

    "The import ban on vehicles in Sri Lanka has been in place since 2020; a decision made by the government to prevent the outflow of much needed foreign currency. A high percentage of the Sri Lankan workforce that actively contributes to the economy mainly depends on motorcycles for transportation because motorcycles can be bought and maintained at reasonable prices.",
