  "original_body_lines": [
    "Shortly after the announcement of the new chairmen for the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA), there was a surge of criticism on social media regarding the appointment of Kalutara District SLPP MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena as the head of COPE.",
    "Both chairmen were elected to their positions, and the SLPP, with its majority representation in the committees reflecting that of the parliament, was able to secure the election of their candidates. The election of COPA chairman MP Lasantha Alagiyawanna didn\u2019t spark as much controversy, as he had previously held the position. However, Abeygunawardena\u2019s appointment drew significant backlash, with many questioning his qualifications to lead a parliamentary watchdog committee.",
    "Some posts even alleged that he had been involved in criminal activities, such as gold chain snatching, before entering politics. Critics wondered how a committee chaired by such an individual could effectively investigate the wrongdoings of government bodies and statutory boards falling under COPE\u2019s scrutiny.",
    "In parliamentary corridors, discussions echoed similar sentiments, with some opposition MPs emphasizing the public\u2019s previous respect for COPE and its work, expressing concern that the recent development would erode that reputation. One MP said that Abeygunawardena\u2019s nomination for the position was influenced by Basil Rajapaksa, who ensured SLPP members in COPE voted for him.",
    "Others questioned how the SLPP could support Abeygunawardena for a position previously held by highly qualified individuals like DEW Gunasekera, Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe, Sunil Handunnetti, and Prof. Chairtha Herath. This appointment not only undermines COPE but also reflects poorly on the integrity of parliament itself.",
    "Born on September 1, 1966, in Paiyagala, Kalutara, Abeygunawardena attended Gnanodaya Vidyalaya in Kalutara and Alexandra College in Colombo. One MP raised the question of Abeygunawardena\u2019s qualifications beyond his loyalty to the Rajapaksa family, pointing out his notorious reputation as \u201cRaththaran\u201d in Kalutara, allegedly involved in snatching gold chains from women on trains. Another MP pointed out that Abeygunawardena has denied these allegations.",
    "It is indeed true that Abeygunawardena has refuted these allegations in the House. On February 21 he denied any involvement in chain-snatching activities and stated that he would resign from his MP position if anyone could provide evidence of a complaint filed against him for such offenses at any police station in the Kalutara district. During that session, he also addressed the Parliament, asserting that his privileges as an MP had been violated due to social media posts made by a female constituent residing in his electorate.",
    "Abeygunawardena said that a woman by the name of Lalanthi Perera of No 908, Galle Road, Katukurunda, Kalutara, has put up various social media posts stating that he and Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon were rogues and thieves, and they should be taken into custody immediately.",
    "Tabling copies of social media posts, he said: These statements could harm our lives because they instigate others against us. I want Lalanthi Perera to be summoned before Parliament\u2019s privilege committee and act against her. Some others do this using fake accounts. Here in this instance, she has used her own true account. She had contested in the 2015 general election and Kalutara people know her by the name of \u2018Cake Nona\u2019. I think all 225 MPs should stand up against this. Otherwise, what is the use of our passing of the Online Safety Bill,\u201d the MP queried.",
    "It is also true that Abeygunawardena been a staunch Rajapaksa loyalist. In a display of this loyalty, he was at the airport to welcome Basil Rajapaksa last Tuesday along with SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam, MP Sarath Weerasekara and Minister Prasanna Ranatunga.",
    "While discussions criticizing Abeygunawardena\u2019s appointment circulated outside the Chamber, TNA MP Shanikyan Rasamanikkam mentioned his name during Thursday\u2019s debate on the impact of wild animals on agricultural harvests. \u201cThe harm inflicted upon the lives of the people of this country by the Rajapaksas outweighs the damage caused by wild animals to agriculture. Upon Basil Rajapaksa\u2019s return, a person convicted of mismanaging the economy, his associates, including an MP allegedly involved in chain-snatching, were present at the airport to welcome him. When I raised this concern, I was labeled an LTTE member,\u201d Rasamanikkam said during the debate.",
    "Soon after the lunch interval, Rasamanikkam raised a privilege issue and said Abeygunawardena had tried to assault him in the Parliamentary complex.",
    "Rasamanikkam said that the incident occurred at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office at the Parliamentary complex when he went to meet the Prime Minister concerning an issue in Batticaloa.",
    "\u201cMP Rohitha Abeygunawardena tried to assault me in the Parliament a short while ago. This happened in the Prime Minister\u2019s office within the Parliament complex. I have raised a privilege issue and am concerned for my safety as he has threatened to assault me outside Parliament as well. MP Abeygunawardena stating that I speak against the Government questioned how I can enter their Prime Minister\u2019s Office. He challenged me to walk out to the lift, after I had insisted that the Prime Minister was for the entire country.\u201d",
    "Rasamanikkam said that MP Abeygunawardena had implied that he could not enter the PM\u2019s Office as he was a Tamil politician and questioned if this was the example the Parliament Members set for national reconciliation.",
    "He said that State Minister Ashoka Priyantha had prevented MP Abeygunawardena from assaulting him, which was also witnessed by the staff at the PM\u2019s Office.",
    "Rasamanikkam requested the matter to be raised before the Parliament Ethics and Privileges Committee, adding that in the event it is not raised, he will be forced to file a Police complaint as this incident was a threat to his life.",
    "Soon after taking to \u2018X\u2019 the Rasamanikkam noted that he has alerted the Speaker of the House about the incident today. \u201cThis is not the first time I have been threatened by SLPP members. The Parliament Privileges Committee has failed to investigate and act against on previous instances, and it has now reached to a point of assault,\u201d he said in his post.",
    "MP Abeygunawardena arrived in the Chamber later and denied that he tried to assault him. I was trying to accompany him to the lift. In addition, I have already responded to the chain-snatching allegation in this House. Today too I deny it and challenge MP Rasamanikkam to make that allegation out of this House if possible. I have 25-year experience in Parliament,\u201d he said.",
    "Kurunegala District SJB MP Nalin Bandara said the COPE chair should not be accorded to an MP only based on his or her experience. \u201cWe think that an MP should need some more qualifications than experience. We proposed the name of Gamini Waleboda who was a graduate of Colombo University. He had worked at the BOI and was a deputy commissioner at the Inland Revenue Department,\u201d Nalin Bandara said, adding that now the COPE members must think twice attending COPE meetings because new chairman may assault them.",
