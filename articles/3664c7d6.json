  "original_body_lines": [
    "The much-delayed passenger ferry service connecting Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu with the Kankesanthurai (KKS) suburb of Jaffna district in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka is set to commence on August 16, Indian media reported.",
    "IndSri Ferry Services Private Limited, the ferry operator, announced that the service bookings will open from midnight today.",
    "There were plans to relaunch it in May but there were delays and it eventually got cancelled.",
    "The service was virtually flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 14 last year with the vessel \u2018Cheriyapani\u2019, after a hiatus of nearly 40 years. It was operated by the Shipping Corporation of India under KPVS Private Limited. It was then halted after about a week, owing to rough weather during the North-East monsoon."
