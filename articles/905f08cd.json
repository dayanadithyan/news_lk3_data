    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s China-backed Hamtantota Port Group said it was getting ready for container transshipment in 2024 after gaining a key position in the roll-on-roll-off vehicle shipping business.",
    "\u201cWe continue to grow our RORO and bunkering businesses and saw exponential growth in 2023,\u201d Lance Zuo, General Manager, Commercial and Marketing of HIPG said in a statement.",
    "\u201cIn 2024 we will be looking at container transshipment for which the port is now ready.\u201d",
    "HIPG delegation had met with Ports Authority of Thailand and Ranong Port to strengthen a partnership.  HIPG hoped to invite teams from the Thai port authority and the Ranong Port to explore and evaluate possible business opportunities.",
    "HIPG had signed an agreement with the Thai Port Authority before the Covid pandemic hit the global economy.",
    "\u201cBut now, the time is right to reconnect with Thailand, particularly with the Ranong Port, because international businesses are seeking more and more opportunities with the Sri Lankan economy,\u201d Johnson Liu, Chief Executive of HIPG said.",
    "\u201cAs ports, one of the most important aspects is our location, in terms of offering the best connectivity to businesses on key maritime routes, and secondly, providing efficient services and facilities in order to ensure easy cargo movement, transshipment and transportation.",
    "\u201cConnecting with the Ranong Port which operates under PAT is an obvious choice for Hambantota International Port in making strides to the BIMSTEC region.\u201d",
    "Late last year HIPG took part in the Port Development South East Asia Summit (PDSEAS 2023) in Vietnam, the only South Asian port to do so.",
    "\u201cHere in Hambantota, we have the strategic advantage of being in close proximity to the East West sea routes,\u201d Liu was quoted as saying last November.",
    "\u201cWhilst connecting to this advantage we are looking at ports in the South Asian region and direction to HIP.",
    "\u201cThis enables us to project our services to these ports and provide logistical support to those who wish to connect with HIP either for transshipment or to actually set up a base to manufacture products in Sri Lanka, for export to various markets within and outside the region.",
    "\u201cWhile our transshipment business in RORO has expanded tremendously, HIP is developing the next area of expansion by opening up its industrial park adjacent to the port complex.\u201d",
