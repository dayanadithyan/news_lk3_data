    "Colombo, April 13 (Daily Mirror) - In the wake of calls by some people for the conduct of both the Presidential and Parliamentary polls on the same day, the Election Commission says it is something impossible due to practical difficulties.",
    "An official of the Commission said separate ballot papers should be printed for each electoral district as far as a parliamentary election is concerned whereas the same ballot paper is meant for all the districts in case of a Presidential election.",
    "Also, he said the political parties form alliances differently at both elections.",
    "\u201cA political alliance that supports a Presidential candidate at such an election will part ways at a general election,\" the official said."
