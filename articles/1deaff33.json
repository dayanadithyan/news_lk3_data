    "\u201cWe admit that we did not have the sufficient number of officers to repair damaged fences,\u201d Minister Wanniarachchi told Parliament Thursday.",
    "\u201cThat is why we are looking to recruit a new workforce of at least 4,000 multipurpose development officers to sort this out.\u201d",

    "Sri Lanka was estimated to have around 7,000 elephants around the country based on a 2022 survey.",

    "\u201cThese fences are maintained with the help of multi-purpose development officers and civil defence servants under the Wildlife Department\u2019s directions.\u201d",
