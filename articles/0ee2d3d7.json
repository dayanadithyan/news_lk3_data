    "Amaraweera said recently that the decision was taken in consideration of the strong commitment of the people of the Northern Province to carry out all the work in relation to agricultural development, especially since there are people in the war torn Northern Province who have suffered for three decades due to the war.",
    "Amaraweera added: \u2018President Ranil Wickremesinghe is of the opinion that most of the money allocated to the ministries should in turn be provided to the people of the Northern and Eastern Provinces when implementing development activities.",
