    "May 31 - In a country where Ministers often believe they can get away by taking the law into their own hands, Water Supply Minister Jeevan Thondaman was the latest to be ridiculed for his thuggish behavior when he threatened police officers and the management of a Nuwara Eliya tea estate.",
    "In a social media video, likely to have been filmed by someone closely following the Minister, Jeevan was seen turning into an 'angry rowdy' while entering the tea estate by force and threatening the management.",
    "He was also seen arguing with the police and later blocking the roads, in a manner not suitable for a Cabinet Minister.",
    "However, after coming under criticism, Jeevan took to his X account defending his actions.",
    "Thondaman in a lengthy post said,\u201d I entered the factory to release workers who were being kept inside by force by the management. Workers have the right to protest. No one can lock them inside against their will. I then called for a meeting between the union and the estate management. However, during the meeting, Acting ASP Ekanayake entered it without cause, sat on the side of the estate management and started taking the side of the management. This was unprecedented and violates the IGP\u2019s circular prohibiting police interference into Trade Union meetings and action. This itself showed the culture of intimidation that is constantly used by estate management against their workers. As the police have no business in interfering into a union meeting, I had to remind him of the Circular and ask him to step out,\u201d"
