    "Stunning artworks have been uncovered in a new excavation at Pompeii, the ancient Roman city buried in an eruption from Mount Vesuvius in AD79.",
    "Archaeologists say the frescoes are among the finest to be found in the ruins of the ancient site.",
    "Mythical Greek figures such as Helen of Troy are depicted on the high black walls of a large banqueting hall.",
    "The room\u2019s near-complete mosaic floor incorporates more than a million individual white tiles.",
    "The black room has only emerged in the last few weeks. Its white mosaic floor is almost complete (BBC)",
    "A third of the lost city has still to be cleared of volcanic debris. The current dig, the biggest in a generation, is underlining Pompeii\u2019s position as the world\u2019s premier window on the people and culture of the Roman empire.",
    "Park director Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel presented the \u201cblack room\u201d exclusively to the BBC on Thursday.",
    "It was likely the walls\u2019 stark colour was chosen to hide the smoke deposits from lamps used during entertaining after sunset. \u201cIn the shimmering light, the paintings would have almost come to life,\u201d he said.",
    "Two set-piece frescoes dominate. In one, the god Apollo is seen trying to seduce the priestess Cassandra. Her rejection of him, according to legend, resulted in her prophecies being ignored.The tragic consequence is told in the second painting, in which Prince Paris meets the beautiful Helen \u2013 a union Cassandra knows will doom them all in the resulting Trojan War.",
    "The god Apollo is depicted on one of the frescos trying to seduce the Trojan priestess Cassandra (BBC)",
    "The black room is the latest treasure to emerge from the excavation, which started 12 months ago \u2013 an investigation that will feature in a documentary series from the BBC and Lion TV to be broadcast later in April.",
    "A wide residential and commercial block, known as \u201cRegion 9\u201d, is being cleared of several metres of overlying pumice and ash thrown out by Vesuvius almost 2,000 years ago.",
    "Staff are having to move quickly to protect new finds, removing what they can to a storeroom.",
    "For the frescoes that must stay in position, a plaster glue is injected to their rear to prevent them coming away from the walls. Masonry is being shored up with scaffolding and temporary roofing is going over the top.",
    "A plaster glue must be injected behind a fresco or it is likely to come away from the wall (BBC)",
    "Chief restorer Dr Roberta Prisco spent Tuesday this week trying to stop an arch from collapsing. \u201cThe responsibility is enormous; look at me,\u201d she said, as if to suggest the stress was taking a visible toll on her. \u201cWe have a passion and a deep love for what we\u2019re doing, because what we\u2019re uncovering and protecting is for the joy also of the generations that come after us.\u201d",
    "Region 9 has thrown up a detective story for archaeologists.",
    "Excavations in the late 19th Century uncovered a laundry in one corner. The latest work has now revealed a wholesale bakery next door, as well as the grand residence with its black room.",
    "In the reception hall, rubble in the far right corner is from renovation at the time of the eruption (BBC)",
    "The team is confident the three areas can be connected, physically via the plumbing and by particular passageways, but also in terms of their ownership.",
    "The identity of this individual is hinted at in numerous inscriptions with the initials \u201cARV\u201d. The letters appear on walls and even on the bakery\u2019s millstones.",
    "Dr Sophie Hay explained how a rich politician left his mark on the buildings",
    "\u201cWe know who ARV is: he\u2019s Aulus Rustius Verus,\u201d explained park archaeologist Dr Sophie Hay. \u201cWe know him from other political propaganda in Pompeii. He\u2019s a politician. He\u2019s super-rich. We think he may be the one who owns the posh house behind the bakery and the laundry.\u201d What\u2019s clear, however, is that all the properties were undergoing renovation at the time of the eruption. Escaping workers left roof tiles neatly stacked; their pots of lime mortar are still filled, waiting to be used; their trowels and pickaxes remain, although the wooden handles have long since rotted away.",
    "Dr Lia Trapani catalogues everything from the dig. She reaches for one of the thousand or more boxes of artefacts in her storeroom and pulls out a squat, turquoise cone. \u201cIt\u2019s the lead weight from a plumb line.\u201d Just like today\u2019s builders, the Roman workers would have used it to align vertical surfaces.",
    "She holds the cone between her fingers: \u201cIf you look closely you can see a little piece of Roman string is still attached.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s possible to see a remnant piece of string around the neck of the plumb line (BBC)",
    "Dr Alessandro Russo has been the other co-lead archaeologist on the dig. He wants to show us a ceiling fresco recovered from one room. Smashed during the eruption, its recovered pieces have been laid out, jigsaw-style, on a large table.",
    "He\u2019s sprayed the chunks of plaster with a mist of water, which makes the detail and vivid colours jump out.",
    "You can see landscapes with Egyptian characters; foods and flowers; and some imposing theatrical masks.",
    "\u201cThis is my favourite discovery in this excavation because it is complex and rare. It is high-quality for a high-status individual,\u201d he explained.",
    "The archaeologists have had to piece together a ceiling fresco that was shattered during the volcanic eruption (BBC)",
    "But if the grand property\u2019s ceiling fresco can be described as exquisite, some of what\u2019s being learned about the bakery speaks to an altogether more brutal aspect of Roman life \u2013 slavery.",
    "It\u2019s obvious the people who worked in the business were kept locked away in appalling conditions, living side by side with the donkeys that turned the millstones. It seems there was one window and it had iron bars to prevent escape.",
    "It\u2019s in the bakery also that the only skeletons from the dig have been discovered. Two adults and a child were crushed by falling stones. The suggestion is they may have been slaves who were trapped and could not flee the eruption. But it\u2019s guesswork.",
    "\u201cWhen we excavate, we wonder what we\u2019re looking at,\u201d explained co-lead archaeologist Dr Gennaro Iovino.",
    "\u201cMuch like a theatre stage, you have the scenery, the backdrop, and the culprit, which is Mount Vesuvius. The archaeologist has to be good at filling in the gaps \u2013 telling the story of the missing cast, the families and children, the people who are not there anymore.\u201d",
    "There are certainly more than a million tiles in the mosaic floor, possibly up to three million (BBC)",
    "Boxes full of artefacts: One of the many oil lamps recovered during the excavation (BBC)",
    "Another fresco depicts Leda and Zeus in the form of a swan, whose union would lead to Helen\u2019s birth (BBC)",
    "Brilliant colours: Ornate cornicing was also preserved under the volcanic debris (BBC)",
