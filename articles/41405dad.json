  "original_body_lines": [
    "The General Secretary of the Ceylon Workers\u2019 Congress (CWC), Minister Jeevan Thondaman says that the party\u2019s decision to back incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe comes as the CWC acknowledges his commitment to uplifting and fully integrating the plantation \u2018Malaiyaha\u2019 Tamil community into the social-economic fabric of Sri Lanka.",
    "Posting on \u2018X\u2019 (formerly Twitter), the CWC General Secretary highlighted that never before have they seen a leader dedicate so much effort to improving the living conditions and status of plantation \u2018Malaiyaha\u2019 Tamil community, which he termed as \u2018our people\u2019.",
    "\u201cThis decision by the CWC therefore represents the faith that our party, union and our community has in the President and his ability to resolve the issues that matter to us the most\u201d, Thondaman said.",
    "Meanwhile, the Minister added that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the CWC and President Wickremesinghe, setting out the CWC\u2019s requests, is currently being prepared and will be signed shortly.",
    "\u201cThe CWC is ready to stand with a leader who has not only delivered results but has done so with compassion and a clear vision for Sri Lanka\u2019s future\u201d, he said.",
    "Furthermore, Minister Jeevan Thondaman wrote: \u201cOur support is in recognition of his remarkable leadership since he took up the Presidency in July 2022 during one of the most challenging chapters in our nation\u2019s history. We know that his continued leadership is the right thing for our country.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn his two years of leading our nation, President Wickremesinghe has turned around Sri Lanka\u2019s economy after a period of bankruptcy and economic collapse. Under his leadership, we have seen a significant recovery, with shortages easing, prices stabilising and the country regaining international confidence\u201d, he added.",
    "\u201cFor the first time in our history, we are successfully implementing a reform programme, that is setting us on a path to long-term economic stability and social progress\u201d the CWC General Secretary added."
