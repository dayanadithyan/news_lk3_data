    "Based on the recommendation of the governing board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the government will \u201cimplement steps under a phased plan of releasing foreign exchange limitations applicable to banning the conversion of Sri Lankan rupees to foreign exchange for certain mobile foreign exchange transactions,\u201d Gunawardena said.",
