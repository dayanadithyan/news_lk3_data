    "In trying times, it is theatre\u2019s duty \u2013 and its privilege \u2013 to step up to the plate, where other actors in civil society have dropped the ball in terms of finding an alternative to our much needed \u2018right of recall\u2019",
    "For a while now, it would seem English-Language Theatre (ELT) in Sri Lanka has neglected its greater potential as a vehicle to engage critically with civics and government in the larger national interest.",
    "When this writer \u2013 then an arts editor \u2013 first proposed a consortium of the creative and critical arms of ELT in 1994, there were few takers (and even fewer now) for a role in which theatre dares speak truth to power.",
    "This it would do after talking (on- and off-stage) amongst its producers, players and paying members of the public \u2013 a coalition of civil society against crime, corruption and crooked politics.",
    "Many valuable and valiant attempts were made \u2013 from politically-angled dramatisations of Shakespeare, George Orwell and Dario Fo, to original scripts such as Jehan Aloysius\u2019 \u201cRag\u201d which exhilaratingly addressed the bane of varsity hazing as an evil to be eradicated.",
    "There have been less sensitive attempts such slapstick passed off as satire, stand-up comedy that is \u2018caviar to the general\u2019 (meaning tasteless morsels for the masses as the Bard of Avon meant it) and even, ahem, musicals in all their theatrical glory that missed the opportunity to make a statement.",
    "However these fell short of the mark because they sought more to please those whom they considered their true audiences \u2013 cast and crew, and families and friends and fans \u2013 rather than critically engage the powers that be with serious content.",
    "In trying times, it is theatre\u2019s duty \u2013 and its privilege \u2013 to step up to the plate, where other actors in civil society have dropped the ball in terms of finding an alternative to our much needed \u2018right of recall\u2019 (a legitimate constitutional mechanism) whereby we retard the chicanery of our elected representatives when they don\u2019t deliver on manifesto and election promises.",
    "ELT\u2019s Sinhala counterpart, which is far more subversive and serious about their stagecraft, remains marginal to Colombo audiences and peripheral to the City\u2019s consciousness in that it hardly speaks to finance, economy and business power centres.",
    "If paternalism, the patriarchy and patron-client cocktails circuits want a circus, they have the real thing in their political intrigues anyway, right?",
    "Meanwhile, English-speaking impresarios covering the \u2018Colombo 7\u2019 (and \u20183\u2019 and \u20185\u2019) circuit \u2013 the affluent coffee-morning matriarchy and influential yuppies, as well as irritating yobbos and indolent yahoos \u2013 are more mindful about making a splash with amusements and entertainments.",
    "Sadly, they\u2019re also making a handful of shekels where feasible (admittedly rare in these post-debt-defaulting days and quite forgivable even in a pre-bankruptcy ethic), rather than making a change to the often abysmal status quo on the socio-political economic scenes that cries out for critical engagement ahead of any",
    "In a new year ahead, we hope for a sea-change into something rich and strange: a milieu in which mindful thespians through meaningful drama shore up for posterity rather than popularity.",
    "Let\u2019s continue to look at the possibilities in this regard held out by the re-run of a play that went on the boards in November 2024 and saw Feroze Kamardeen (FK) reprise the eponymous role last weekend at the Wendt.",
    "NOTE: this analysis and commentary is based on the original script as it first took shape in FK\u2019s febrile brain; and therefore, may differ from successive theatre performances \u2013 after all, it\u2019s \u201cad libitum\u201d (\u2018at the performer\u2019s pleasure\u2019), though not necessarily at the audience\u2019s!",
    "Grow Up Nana (GUN) \u2013 no comma, no exclamation! \u2013 was a satirical exploration of the Sri Lankan Muslim (SLM) community undertaken by the dynamo behind (and in this case, up in front of the footlights of) StageLight&Magic, that other SLM.",
    "Nana is in funereal \u2013 yet funny \u2013 mood as we find him today:",
    "\u201cWhat is the difference between a rich Muslim man\u2019s funeral and a poor Muslim man\u2019s funeral? The rich man\u2019s funeral might leave more widows. But you have to admit: better to leave widows and legitimate children than leave mistresses and fatherless children. Widows have their dignity; widows have their rightful share of the inheritance; and if or when they get remarried, they don\u2019t have to go through the whole business of changing their name, again, because they keep their father\u2019s name for life! Just to be clear \u2013 Islam does allow polygamy; but what most people may not know is that it is under very strict rules, the most important one being that all the wives must be treated equally, emotionally, financially and sexually. Yes, it specifies that you must be able to do that. It\u2019s not for every Tom, Dick and Harry. Or in this case: Tuan, Dilshan and Hashan.\u201d",
    "It is this studied interweaving of the general into the particular that gives one hope there is a future for both satire and stand-up comedy as tools for social change undertaken by critically engaging societal issues in jocular mode. It is by extrapolating ethnic peculiarities that the larger fabric of society may be given a \u2018golden thread\u2019 to \u2018wind it into a ball\u2019.",
    "On the Public Display of Wealth (PDW) front, Nana takes a sly dig at all communities by addressing \u2018you guys\u2019 \u2013 i.e. the ethnic others \u2013 in the audience: \u201cIf you want to show off your wealth, you guys can serve Red Label, show the world you are rich. Super-rich, you can serve black label. Ultra-rich, you can serve Chivas or single malt and have a champagne tower, stack up the glasses like the Eiffel Tower and pour Crystal over it. What can we do? Pour a mega-bottle of Faluda? We can\u2019t!\u201d",
    "In similar vein he attacks the wastefulness of showing off at weddings that are commonplace with our society\u2019s parvenus and Colombo\u2019s ubiquitous nouveau-riche: \u201cEven with food, you guys have so many options. Rich, you can serve a buffet with an action station. Super-rich, you can have three stations and sushi. Ultra-rich, you can serve anything from lobster to caviar to Kobe beef! What are our options? Rich, we serve good buriyani; super-rich, we serve better buriyani; ultra-rich, best buriyani. But it\u2019s still buriyani, no? Can\u2019t put caviar or lobster on top of that... no way!\u201d",
    "While on the subject of food and drink, Nana critiques the so-called \u2018eating-drinking Muslims\u2019 who may well imbibe but never ever eat pork. Going the whole hog, Nana confesses to having once been guilty of tasting the bitter cup not of paradise but \u00e0 la \u2018podara\u2019 Muslims, and claims he is clean now. By being humorous about pious SLMs who say their \u2018bismis\u2019 \u2013 \u201cbismillah hirrahman nirraheem\u201d (\u2018in the name of almighty Allah the most beneficent, the most merciful\u2019) faithfully even before taking a surreptitious sip of the cup that cheers, FK is able to expose the hypocrisy as well as emptiness of conventional religious traditions. Would that other fundamentalisms could face their",
    "Ethnic labelling \u2013 even and especially internecine rivalries \u2013 are ridiculed in the name of a higher SLM unity.",
    "Says Nana: \u201cWhen it comes to labelling ourselves, we Sri Lankan Muslims are in a league of our own. No other community puts so many labels on themselves. We are roughly two million people in this country and we have Moor, Memon, Borah, Bhai, Malay, Thakkiya party, Galle Fort party, Thablik Jamaath, Tawheed Jamaath, Kandiri party, Awliya party, Uppu party, Waral aata-er party, Thakbir katta-er party, Bawrula Thakbir, Nenjila Thakbir, Kalathala Thakbir. You name it we put a label",
    "Shall we mention the remarkable parallels between this labyrinthine partisanship and the morass of middle-class ethno-religious virtues and social mores among Sri Lanka\u2019s melting-pot classists?",
    "\u201cBorah, Bhai, Memon, Moor, Malay, we divide ourselves nicely so we can become superior to someone else. In addition to being adorably racist, we are also unashamedly placist. Colombo Muslims look down on Galle Muslims, who look down on Colombo Muslims AND Kandy Muslims, who look down on Gampola Muslims, and EVERYONE looks down on Batticaloa Muslims. Even in Galle, they divide themselves as Galle Muslims and Galle Fort Muslims. Galle Fort Muslims get along with the Colombo Muslims but they are looked down by the Kandy Muslims because apparently their ancestors flirted too much with the Portuguese. They are quite fair, actually \u2013 the Portuguese AND the Galle Fort Muslims.\u201d",
    "Sri Lankans of other ilk have similar placisms, don\u2019t they? \u2018I am a southerner\u2019 or \u2018We are not Kandyans but GSB all the same\u2019 and even \u2018The KSD castes are far more entrepreneurial than...\u2019",
    "Nana addresses the innate \u2018placism\u2019 of SLMs to make a larger point about the insular ethnic pettiness that runs the gamut across our island-nation\u2019s diverse and divergent communities:",
    "\u201cThe Kalmunai Muslims look down on the Akkaraipattu Muslims because they are not educated enough. Sammanthurai Muslims don\u2019t like the Mardamuna [Maruthamunai] Muslims because they are not rich enough. Nindoor [Nintavur] Muslims don\u2019t marry their girls off to boys from Nappatimunna [Natpaddimunai] and the Attalachena [Addalaichenai] Muslims don\u2019t marry their boys off to Oluvil Muslims \u2013 all within the same province! At least, the rest of the Muslims practise their placism across the country. In the East, it\u2019s a concentrated local operation. Can\u2019t blame them\u2026\u201d",
    "It is not so \u2018local\u2019 that other similarly much-segmented communities based on caste and creed can\u2019t relate, no?",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s face it \u2013 most of my fellow countrymen, when given the choice of unity versus anything else (and I mean, literally anything else, I can confidently say) will choose anything else. If it was a choice between a rotten sandwich with spoilt jam and unity, some of us will go: \u2018What flavour was that jam?\u2019 And before anyone gets triggered, remember: \u201883 weren\u2019t the only riots we had and the LTTE weren\u2019t the only armed civil insurrection we had.\u201d",
    "Let me also say, before anyone reading all of this \u2018gets triggered\u2019, that there\u2019s much food for thought here\u2026 and for more than \u2018eating-drinking Muslims\u2019 at that! #NuffSaid",
    "Nana says it better: \u201cOur myth of unity is only superseded by our myth of superiority over our neighbours.\u201d",
    "Did he mean Sri Lankan Muslims in particular or Sri Lankans in general? Even if you\u2019ve never before thought of your own community as being such one-upmanship-loving beings, please consider it now \u2013 in print, being spared the (hefty) price of admission for GUN or its reprise.",
    "But speaking about \u2018food for thought\u2019 \u2013 there are things to be learned about watalappam you never dreamed of in your philosophy, Horatio (or Haroun or Haramanis or Hariharan)!",
    "\u201cIf you are ever having a function and you are inviting Muslims friends, do not under any circumstances serve watalappam for dessert. Because you can get it from the best kitchen in this country, you can get Adriano Zumbo to make it \u2013 but to every SLM, that watalappam is like cream caramel with jaggery. Every SLM has already eaten the best watalappam in the world: mummy\u2019s.\u201d",
    "Nana has tasted sugar and he\u2019s hitting that sweet spot between sarcasm and subversion:",
    "\u201cYou guys think watalappam is watalappam? There are many different criteria used to judge the watalappam. The colour, which must be dark but not black; the right amount of spices; quantity and mix has not changed for generations \u2013 no need to be progressive! That\u2019s why you don\u2019t get \u2018cinnamon watalappam\u2019 or \u2018cardamom watalappam\u2019 or \u2018vanilla watalappam\u2019! Watalappam is watalappam, no variations required.\u201d",
    "Trust you gourmets and gourmands alike \u2013 to say nothing of critics with an appetite for government-bashing \u2013 are taking this all down...",
    "\u201cIt must have the right number of holes; the top cannot be smooth; it must have some peaks and valleys; when you scoop out the watalappam it must leave a little juice at the bottom of the dish; it must be a little firm on top and slightly less so at the bottom, and the colour too must vary ever so slightly. It\u2019s a complex dish to get right.\u201d",
    "So is satire. So is stand-up comedy. So is subversion of sacred cows. So is speaking truth to power. So is standing up for what you believe in as well as what is best for yourself and your neighbour \u2013 after you\u2019ve taken a long, hard, clear, unbiased, critical and charitable view of your own household, where societal judgment must start.",
    "Speaking of which: no FK farce or festively slapsticky play is complete without a stab at politics!",
    "Again, let Nana speak for himself. However, that would be in the third and final instalment of this review of the role of ethnics in shaping society through speaking truth to power in theatre."
