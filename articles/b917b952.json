    "\u201cYoung people, especially children, are the most affected by the daily harsh realities of climate change such as extreme heatwaves, flooding, and disruption of lives. The consequences of these climate change episodes not only threaten the lives of children in the immediate term but also have long term consequences on their opportunities to grow and develop\u201d, said Mr. Skoog.",

    "Pasindu Guneratne, Chairperson of NYSC, expressed enthusiasm about the collaboration, stating, \u201cwe are dedicated to mobilizing youth to catalyze positive community transformation. Through our collaboration with UNICEF, we aim to empower young leaders with the expertise and capabilities required to address climate change proactively and make a lasting impact.\u201d",
    "Under the agreement, UNICEF and NYSC commit to collaborate on a series of structured activities/events focusing on raising critical awareness and development of skills on climate change and environment conservation across Sri Lanka, and improving the collaboration between the government, civil society, academia, in the field of climate change and environment conservation, the statement added.",
    "UNICEF\u2019s work on climate change for children is grounded in the Sri Lanka Children\u2019s Declaration on Climate and Disaster Risk Reduction, a long history, experience, and deep understanding of the needs of children in the country and the expertise in fulfilling the rights of children through programmes, advocacy, and an extensive network of partners, including government, non- profit, and community organizations.",
