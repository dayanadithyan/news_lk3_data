    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s female tea pluckers do not get promoted as male tea pluckers do, Minister of Estate Infrastructure Jeevan Thondaman said.",
    "\u201cI know educated women who are plucking tea because they are not getting into management, and I know less than qualified men who are in management positions. Why? Because they know how to order people around,\u201d Thondaman told EconomyNext.",
    "A study done by Verite Research in 2022 shows that the estate sector\u2019s economically active population is 404,002 out of which 167,156 are women.",
    "However, there is a difference in the work that men and women do while being paid the same wage.",
    "\u201cThe men do sundry work and the women pluck tea so it\u2019s not that men get paid more it\u2019s that men do a different set of work. The gender inequality is that women have to pluck tea for let\u2019s say 10 hours across three sittings, but there are men who get appointed as the watcher, the cook in the bungalow, or the manager will have some guys to take his child to school and all of that,\u201d Thondaman said.",
    "\u201cThe management believes that women are meant to pluck tea and are not into management.\u201d",
    "In addition to being rejected for management positions, female tea pluckers also lack bathroom facilities, and are being forced to remove their pottus, the minister said.",
    "\u201cWith Kelani Valley they did not inform the workers that they could have an alternative. It was either you remove it or we will remove you,\u201d Thondaman said.",
    "\u201cWe cannot forcibly remove pottus, however we do not allow the sticker pottu according to ISO regulations,\u201d CEO of Kelani Valley Plantations, Roshan Rajadurai said. \u201cIt is not just Kelani Valley; no plantation company will allow it. He is just saying this to justify his insane behaviour.\u201d (Colombo/Jun13/2024)"
