    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lankans may have to wait more time to read the meeting minutes of the Central Bank\u2019s Monetary Board, a top official said, despite a new act that has made the central bank to be more transparent and accountable for its decisions.",
    "Many central banks including the United States\u2019 Federal Reserve, India\u2019s Reserve Bank, and Bank of Mexico release the minutes of their monetary policy meeting to ensure transparency.",
    "The new Central Bank Act passed by the Parliament in line with the guidance by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) includes measures for Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank to be more transparent and accountable.",
    "These measures include releasing the Monetary Policy Report every six months and the first such report was released on February 15.",
    "However, the central bank has not taken a decision to release the minutes of the Monetary Board meetings on the monetary policy.",
    "\u201cGoing forward, one day this could happen,\u201d Chandranath Amarasekara, Assistant Governor at the Central Bank told reporters on Wednesday (21) at a media briefing.",
    "\u201cRight now, we have just started working on the new Central Bank Act. We are not there yet. There is no such decision on releasing minutes yet.\u201d",
    "The central bank in the past printed billions of rupees to keep the market interest rates artificially low and provide cheap funding for successive governments to propel a debt-driven economy.",
    "It\u2019s decision, however, led Sri Lanka into an unprecedented economic crisis in 2022 with sovereign debt default.",
    "It also propped up the rupee currency artificially in the past to maintain a stable exchange rate at the expense of billions of US dollars. The move also contributed for the economic crisis and later the central bank was forced to allow over 60 percent depreciation in the rupee in March 2022.",
    "However, none of the top central bank officials was held responsible for wrong decisions to hold interest rates artificially low with money printing and propping up the rupee. (Colombo/Feb 23/2024)"
