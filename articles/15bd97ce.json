  "original_body_lines": [
    "Australian employees can now ignore work emails and calls thanks to a new \u201cright to disconnect\u201d law designed to curb those and other intrusions into personal lives.",
    "The new rule, which came into force on Monday, means employees, in most cases, cannot be punished for refusing to read or respond to contacts from their employers outside work hours.",
    "Supporters say the law gives workers the confidence to stand up against the steady invasion of their personal lives by work emails, texts and calls, a trend that has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic scrambled the division between home and work.",
    "\u201cBefore we had digital technology there was no encroachment, people would go home at the end of a shift and there would be no contact until they returned the following day,\u201d said John Hopkins, an associate professor at Swinburne University of Technology.",
    "\u201cNow, globally it\u2019s the norm to have emails, SMS, phone calls outside those hours, even when on holiday.\u201d",
    "Australians worked on average 281 hours of unpaid overtime in 2023, according to a survey, last year by the Australia Institute, which estimated the monetary value of the labour at A$130 billion ($88 billion).",
    "The changes add Australia to a group of roughly two dozen countries, mostly in Europe and Latin America, which have similar laws.",
    "Pioneer France introduced the rules in 2017 and a year later fined pest control firm Rentokil Initial 60,000 euros ($66,700) for requiring an employee to always have his phone on.",
    "Rachel Abdelnour, who works in advertising, said the changes would help her disconnect in an industry where clients often have different working hours.",
    "\u201cI think it\u2019s actually really important that we have laws like this,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cWe spend so much of our time connected to our phones, connected to our emails all day, and I think that it\u2019s really hard to switch off as it is.\u201d",
    "To cater for emergencies and jobs with irregular hours, the rule still allows employers to contact their workers, who can only refuse to respond where it is reasonable to do so.",
    "Determining whether a refusal is reasonable will be up to Australia\u2019s industrial umpire, the Fair Work Commission (FWC), which must take into account an employee\u2019s role, personal circumstances and how and why the contact was made.",
    "It has the power to issue a cease and desist order and, failing that, levy fines of up A$19,000 for an employee or up to A$94,000 for a company.",
    "But the Australian Industry Group, an employer group, says ambiguity about how the rule applies will create confusion for bosses and workers. Jobs will become less flexible and in doing so slow the economy, it added.",
    "\u201cThe laws came literally and figuratively out of left field, were introduced with minimal consultation about their practical effect and have left little time for employers to prepare,\u201d the group said on Thursday.",
    "The president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Michele O\u2019Neil said the caveat built into the law meant it won\u2019t interfere with reasonable requests. Instead, it will stop workers paying the price for poor planning by management, she said.",
    "She cited an unidentified worker who finished a shift at midnight, only to be texted four hours later and told to be back at work by 6 a.m.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to make contact, common sense doesn\u2019t get applied anymore,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cWe think this will cause bosses to pause and think about whether they really need to send that text or that email.\u201d"
