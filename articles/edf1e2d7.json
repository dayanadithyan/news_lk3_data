    "Speaking in Parliament yesterday, Marikkar claimed that the Government\u2019s apology was an attempt to shift the blame onto officials rather than addressing the true responsibility for the controversial policy.",
    "He questioned how the decision was made if officials had not based their recommendations on scientific evidence and why Cabinet members did not question the policy at the time.",
    "The MP said the apology has been issued in a bid to gain the Muslim vote in the upcoming elections.",

    "He said even the IMF is aware that the current Parliament lacks majority support.",
    "Marikkar questioned the undervaluation of the Hilton Hotel and who stands to gain from it. He asserted that the Government is similarly exploiting the crisis to enrich themselves through various deals."
