    "May 28, (CNN) - Pope Francis has apologized for using an anti-gay slur during a meeting with bishops.",
    "The 87-year-old pontiff reportedly made the homophobic remark in a closed-door meeting last week as he told Italian bishops that gay men shouldn\u2019t be allowed to train for the priesthood.",
    "\u201cThe Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who felt offended by the use of a term, as reported by others,\u201d the Vatican said in a Tuesday statement.",
    "\u201cAs he (Pope Francis) has said on several occasions, \u2018in the Church there is room for everyone, everyone! No one is useless, no one is superfluous, there is room for everyone. Just as we are, everyone.\u2019\u201d",
    "The Pope\u2019s comments came to light on Monday when two Italian newspapers - the Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica \u2013 reported on the May 20 meeting, citing sources in attendance.",
    "The newspaper articles, which were translated from Italian, claimed the Pope had said there is \u201cfrociaggine\u201d \u2013 which translates in English to \u201cfaggotry\u201d \u2013 in some of the seminaries.",
    "Francis\u2019 comments were made in the context of proposals from the Italian bishops to amend guidelines on candidates to seminaries.",
    "The Vatican ruled in 2005 that the church cannot allow the ordination of men who are actively gay or have \u201cdeep-seated\u201d homosexual tendencies. Francis upheld the ruling in 2016.",
    "Two years later he told the Italian bishops not to accept gay candidates for the priesthood."
