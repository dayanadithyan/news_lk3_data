    "The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) has secured detentions orders against criminal gang member Piyum Hasthika alias \u201cPiyuma\u201d, who was repatriated to Sri Lanka from Dubai, UAE last morning (Feb. 15).",
    "Thus, the Colombo Fort Magistrate\u2019s Court has issued a 72-hour detention order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to interrogate the suspect, after the CID reported facts to the courts regarding the repatriation of \u201cPiyuma\u201d.",
    "However, the Colombo Fort Magistrate has also ordered that the 72 hours be counted retrospectively from Feb.15, the day he was brought back to the island.",
    "\u201cPiyuma\u201d is reportedly the main accomplice of the notorious underworld figure and drug trafficker Salindu Malshika Gunaratne alias \u201cKudu Salindu,\u201d who is also currently in the custody of the CID.",
    "According to the Public Security Ministry, the criminal suspect was brought back to the island by a special team of the CID.",
    "As per police records, \u201cPiyuma\u201d was first arrested in 2018 for the possession of 20g of heroin and had been referred to a rehabilitation centre for three months.",
    "He was reportedly complicit in the January 2021 shooting that claimed the life of a youth named Lakshan Sandaruwan in Panadura North. Two years after the murder, he was identified as one of the two assailants involved. The investigating officers later learned that \u201cPiyuma\u201d had fled to Dubai to evade arrest.",
    "In June 2022, \u201cPiyuma\u201d was involved in another shooting, which he had orchestrated under the instructions of \u201cKudu Salindu\u201d for the killing of Nilantha Kumara and Mohammed Samsad in Katubedda, Moratuwa.",
    "On this account, a Red Notice was subsequently secured from Interpol in November 2023 to apprehend and repatriate \u201cPiyuma\u201d to Sri Lanka."
