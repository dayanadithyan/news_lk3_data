    "The Guardian, June 7- C\u00e9line Dion has said she has suffered muscle spasms so strong that her ribs were broken as a result, as she lives with the condition stiff person syndrome.",
    "Speaking in her first TV interview since the diagnosis, to Hoda Kotb on NBC News, Dion said: \u201cI had broken ribs at one point, because sometimes when it\u2019s very severe \u2026\u201d Kotb asks her: \u201cIt can spasm so hard it can break a rib?\u201d, with Dion nodding agreement.",
    "Dion also said that when she experiences muscle spasms in her throat, \u201cit\u2019s like somebody is strangling you, like someone is pushing your larynx\u201d, and explained that she can only speak at a certain pitch while experiencing the spasm. \u201cBut it can also be in the abdominal [area], in the spine, in the ribs,\u201d she added, describing cramps in her hands: \u201cIt\u2019s cramping, but it\u2019s like in a position of, like, you cannot unlock them\u201d.",
    "Dion was diagnosed with the rare and incurable syndrome in 2022, and has had to put live performances on hold. She has previously said it is \u201ccausing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I\u2019m used to\u201d.",
    "In an interview with Vogue France in April, she said she was undergoing physical and vocal therapy five times a week. She admitted feelings of desperation but also affirmed that she was trying to work towards a singing career again.",
    "\u201cAt the beginning I would ask myself: why me? How did this happen? What have I done? Is this my fault?\u201d she said. \u201cLife doesn\u2019t give you any answers. You just have to live it! I have this illness for some unknown reason. The way I see it, I have two choices. Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it\u2019s over, I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of my mirror and sing to myself. I\u2019ve chosen to work with all my body and soul, from head to toe, with a medical team. I want to be the best I can be. My goal is to see the Eiffel Tower again! \u2026 I have this strength within me. I know that nothing is going to stop me.\u201d",
    "A feature-length documentary about her illness, I Am: Celine Dion, will be on Prime Video from 25 June. It is directed by Irene Taylor, who was Oscar-nominated for her 2009 film The Final Inch."
