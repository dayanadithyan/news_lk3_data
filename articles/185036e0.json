    "An attacker with a knife killed three people and seriously wounded at least five late Friday at a festival in the western German city of Solingen, authorities said.",
    "Witnesses alerted police shortly after 9:30 p.m. to an unknown attacker having wounded several people indiscriminately with a knife on a central square, the Fronhof. Police said the perpetrator was on the run, and they had only very little information on the man so far.",
    "They said they believe the stabbings were carried out by a lone attacker.",
    "One of the festival organizers, Philipp M\u00fcller, appeared on stage and asked festivalgoers to \u201cgo calmly; please keep your eyes open, because unfortunately the perpetrator hasn\u2019t been caught.\u201d",
    "At least one helicopter was seen in the air, while many police and emergency vehicles with flashing blue lights were on the road and several streets were closed off.",
    "Police put the number of seriously injured at five. The region\u2019s top security official, Herbert Reul, gave a figure of six as he visited the scene in the early hours of Saturday.",
    "\u201cNone of us knows why\u201d the attack took place, said Reul, who is the interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t say anything about the motive now\u201d and it isn\u2019t clear who the assailant was, he said, but the attacker left the scene \u201crelatively quickly.\u201d",
    "Mayor Tim Kurzbach said in a Facebook post, \u201cThis evening, we in Solingen are all in shock. We all wanted to celebrate our city\u2019s anniversary together and now have dead and wounded to lament.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt breaks my heart that an attack on our city happened,\u201d he added.",
    "Local newspaper Solinger Tageblatt quoted Celine Derikartz, its reporter covering the festival, as saying that \u201cthe atmosphere is spooky.\u201d She said a party atmosphere had turned to shock within minutes and she saw festivalgoers weeping.",
    "The \u201cFestival of Diversity,\u201d marking the city\u2019s 650th anniversary, began Friday and was supposed to run through Sunday, with several stages in central streets offering attractions such as live music, cabaret and acrobatics.",
    "The city canceled the rest of the festival after the attack. Solingen has about 160,000 residents and is located near the bigger cities of Cologne and Duesseldorf.",
    "There has been concern about an increase in knife violence in Germany recently.",
    "In May, a knife attack by an Afghan immigrant on members of a group that describes itself as opposing \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d left a police officer dead.",
    "Germany\u2019s top security official, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, proposed toughening weapons laws to allow only knives with a blade measuring up to 6 centimeters (nearly 2.4 inches) to be carried in public, rather than the length of 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) that is allowed now."
