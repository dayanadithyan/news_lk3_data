    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The leadership of Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) are still members of the United National Party (UNP), according to former chairman of the now-defunct Ape Jathika Peramuna (AJP) Senaka de Silva.",
    "de Silva, who is the spouse of former MP Diana Gamage, said at a press conference on Friday May 10 that according to the party constitution members cannot hold membership of two parties at once.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re talking to our lawyers about next steps. Neither I or Diana Gamage sold a party. We gave him this party for the country. I gave the party to Sajith Premadasa and made him leader of the party. Diana Gamage was secretary. She stepped down and gave the position to Ranjith Madduma Bandara,\u201d said de Silva.",
    "\u201cIt was given for them to take the party forward and serve the people of the country,\u201d he said.",
    "de Silva showed a document bearing the seal of the Election Commission on the transfer of the AJP to the breakaway faction of the UNP that was led by Premadasa.",
    "\u201cAs chairman, I have signed, and Diana Gamage has signed as secretary, under that Sajith Premadasa and Ranjith Madduma Bandara have signed,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIf something comes up, we can take it to a place where Premadasa\u2019s leadership is not accepted and Madduma Bandara\u2019s position is not accepted,\u201d said de Silva.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re throwing stones from inside a glass house,\u201d he added.",
    "The former AJP leader said that they would play this \u201ctrump card\u201d when the time was right in an effort to stop what he called the revenge being extracted from Gamage.",
    "He added that, as permanent members of the party, he and his wife could not be removed.",
    "Asked about the implications for Premadasa\u2019s candidacy at the upcoming presidential election, de Silva said the issue could prove a \u201cbig problem\u201d, hinting that Premadasa will not be allowed to contest under the SJB symbol.",
    "\u201cAccording to the party constitution, you can\u2019t me members of two parties. Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Sajith Premadasa are members of the UNP even now,\u201d he said. (Colombo/May10/2024)"
