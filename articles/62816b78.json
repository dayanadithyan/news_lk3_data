    "(AP) \u2014 President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the lower house of France\u2019s parliament in a surprise announcement sending voters back to the polls in the coming weeks to choose lawmakers, after his party was handed a humbling defeat by the far-right in the European elections Sunday.",
    "The legislative elections will take place in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.",
    "The announcement came after the first projected results from France put the far-right National Rally party well ahead in the European Union\u2019s parliamentary elections, handing a chastening loss to Macron\u2019s pro-European centrists, according to French opinion poll institutes.",
    "Marine Le Pen\u2019s anti-immigration, nationalist party was estimated to get around 31%-32% of the votes, a historic result more than double the share of Macron\u2019s Renaissance party, which was projected to reach around 15%.",
    "Macron himself wasn\u2019t a candidate in the EU elections and his term as president still runs for three more years.",
    "He said the decision was \u201cserious\u201d but showed his \u201cconfidence in our democracy, in letting the sovereign people have their say.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn the next few days, I\u2019ll be saying what I think is the right direction for the nation. I\u2019ve heard your message, your concerns, and I won\u2019t leave them unanswered,\u201d he said.",
    "In latest legislative elections in 2022, Macron\u2019s centrist party won the most seats but lost its majority at the National Assembly, forcing lawmakers into political maneuvering to pass bills.",
    "With Sunday\u2019s decision, he is taking a big risk with a move that could backfire and increase the chances of Le Pen to eventually take power.",
    "A scenario in which an opposition party would eventually win a parliament majority could lead to a fraught power-sharing situation called \u201ccohabitation,\u201d with Macron to name a prime minister with different views.",
    "Le Pen, who head the National Rally group at the National Assembly, \u201cwelcomed\u201d Macron\u2019s move.",
    "\u2018We\u2019re ready for it,\u201d said Le Pen, who was the runner-up to Macron in the last two presidential elections. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to exercise power if the French people place their trust in us in these future legislative elections. We\u2019re ready to turn the country around, ready to defend the interests of the French, ready to put an end to mass immigration, ready to make the purchasing power of the French a priority.\u201d",
    "The EU elections results were a hard blow for Macron, who has been advocating for Europe-wide efforts to defend Ukraine and the need for the EU to boost its own defenses and industry.",
    "The National Rally\u2019s lead candidate for the EU elections, Jordan Bardella, campaigned for limiting free movement of migrants by carrying out national border controls and dialing back EU climate rules. The party no longer wants to leave the EU and the euro, but aims to weaken it from within.",
    "\u201cTonight, our compatriots have expressed a desire for change,\u201d Bardella said. \u201cEmmanuel Macron is tonight a weakened president.\u201d",
    "An official at Macron\u2019s office said the decision to dissolve the National Assembly was justified by the \u201chistoric score of the far-right\u201d that could not be ignored and the current \u201cparliamentarian disorder.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re never wrong when you give the people a say,\u201d said the official, who spoke anonymously in line with the practice of Macron\u2019s office.",
    "EU elections\u2019 projections also show a resurgence of the Socialist Party, with about 14% of the votes. The party campaigned on more ambitious climate policies and protections for European businesses and workers, with about 14% of the votes.",
    "Reacting to Macron\u2019s announcement, far-left politician Francois Ruffin called on all leaders from the left, including the Greens to unite under a single \u201cPopular Front\u201d banner. \u201cTo avoid the worse, to win,\u201d he wrote on X.",
    "France is electing 81 members of the European Parliament, which has 720 seats in total."
