    "The World Bank has hailed Sri Lanka\u2019s \u20181990 Suwa Seriya\u2019 ambulance service for saving countless lives while providing citizens the highest level of pre-hospital care.",
    "In a blog post, the World Bank\u2019s Vice President for the South Asia Region, Martin Raiser further commended the ambulance service for reducing complications caused by delayed care and enabling them to get back into the workforce in record time \u2014 making a positive contribution to the country\u2019s economy.",
    "\u201cSince its launch in 2016, 1.8 million Sri Lankan citizens in distress have dialled 1990, and a Suwa Seriya ambulance has rushed them to the nearest hospital or primary care facility within 12 minutes of their call, one of the fastest response rates in the world for an ambulance service.\u201d",
    "South Asia is home to many development innovations, including in the delivery of social services through government-private sector-and civil society partnerships, Raiser said, noting that 1990 Suwa Seriya stands in a proud tradition.",
    "The \u20181990 Suwa Seriya\u2019, one of the world\u2019s most digitally advanced and free ambulance services, was established through a dedicated Act of Parliament in 2018. It is a government entity that operates with the agility and independence of a private sector organization, resulting in remarkable efficiency and setting new standards for government-delivered services."
