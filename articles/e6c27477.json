    "\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the hardest BikingMan I\u2019ve done. A lot of unknown elements (the food, the heat, the route), which made it difficult as well as an unforgettable gravel experience,\u201d said Franck Vergely from France.",
    "\u201cIt was amazing! And the sunrises and sunsets were absolutely magnificent,\u201d added Ceri and James Bickenel from the UK.",
