    "Consequently, contributions to both the President\u2019s Fund and the government saw notable increases, with a 13% rise for the former, surpassing the target, and a 6% increase for the latter. Mr. Ajith Gunaratne Narangala, Chairman and CEO of the Development Lotteries Board, attributed this success to strategic measures aimed at mitigating the country\u2019s economic challenges, with special guidance from President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who also serves as the Minister of Finance.",
