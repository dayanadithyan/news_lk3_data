    "Discussing the significance of transitioning to a 100% digital onboarding process, Aasiri Iddamalgoda \u2013 Senior Vice President of Retail Banking and SME at DFCC Bank, said, \u201cIn our pursuit of creating a unique, friendly, and seamless banking experience, we have recognised that Sri Lankans seek convenience and ease of access. As a champion of digital empowerment, we\u2019ve collaborated with all stakeholders to introduce a truly digital and online customer onboarding platform, enabling genuinely online account opening. This is a landmark achievement that aligns our customer experience with global standards for convenience, simplicity, and ease. It also supports our sustainability goals, reducing our reliance on paper and customers\u2019 need to visit the bank physically.\u201d",
    "The new platform also enables other convenient features to ensure a truly seamless experience. These include checking on your application status, opening both LKR and FCY accounts, saving your partially completed application and resuming the process seamlessly from where you left off at a later time. Accordingly, with this move, DFCC Bank has taken a quantum leap towards its goals for digitisation and digitalisation of its services and processes, both internally and externally, thus rendering it indeed at the forefront of the digital banking revolution in Sri Lanka.",
