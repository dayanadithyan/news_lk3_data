    "A global leader in responsible tourism raised concerns on lack of focus on sustainability in the tourism sector, which in turn could impede the current growth momentum in the medium term.",
    "Intrepid Travel Chairman and Co-Founder Darrell Wade, who was recently in Sri Lanka, said the current status of the tourism industry, in terms of sustainability, is worrisome, primarily because of the\u00a0drive for growth.",
    "\u201cWe understand that it\u2019s good for the economy, jobs, balance of payments, all sort of things. But if the growth is too fast and doesn\u2019t factor sustainability, then that\u2019s a major problem. We haven\u2019t seen enough attention on sustainability (in Sri Lanka),\u201d Wade told Mirror Business during his recent visit\u00a0to Sri Lanka.",
    "Although Sri Lanka may sustain the current growth momentum for the next two to three years, he expressed concern that it would not be sustainable beyond four to six years, if sustainability is not factored into the tourism strategy now.",

    "Intrepid plans to foster greater economic growth in Sri Lanka, supporting a vibrant tourism industry and engaging local community philanthropy under its 2030 strategy.",

    "\u201c... we are very happy to take a leadership role on sustainability and we do it everywhere in the world,\u201d\u00a0Wade added."
