    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 India has given a lot of offers to establish Ramayana Trails in Sri Lanka, State Tourism Minister Diana Gamage said, as the island nation is focusing more on Indian tourists to boost the hospitality industry.",
    "Historians say, according to Hindu mythology, Sri Lanka was the kingdom of Ravana, the ten-headed demon king who abducted Sita, the wife of Rama, the hero of the Ramayana, a smriti text from ancient India, one of the two important epics of Hinduism known as the Itihasas, the other being the Mahabharata.",
    "The epic narrates the life of Rama, a prince of Ayodhya in the kingdom of Kosala.",
    "With the opening of Ram Mandhir in Ayodhya, Sri Lanka has renewed the establishment of Ramayana Trails, which includes all the places believed to be associated with Ramayana.",
    "The places include Sigiriya, Ashok Vatika, a garden in the city of Nuwara Eliya, which is believed to be the place where Ravana kept Sita captive, Ravana Ella Falls, Koneswaram Temple in Trincomalee and Divurumpola Temple in Bandarawela which is believed to be the place where Sita underwent a trial by fire to prove her purity among many other places.",
    "\u201cI think India is even willing to invest in it. They have given proposals that they are willing to invest in it. They will build hotels even around where they can have accommodation for the people who are visiting these areas,\u201d Diana Gamage told reporters in Colombo.",
    "\u201cThey (Indians) have given a lot of offers. If we do this in the right way, we can bring 5 million tourists from India alone.\u201d",
    "Indians topped the list of tourists to Sri Lanka last year with over 300,000 visitors.",
    "\u201cAt the moment I am having discussions with some of them, and they are in touch with me,\u201d Gamage said.",
    "\u201cIf you look at Seetha Eliya, Seetha Temple is one of the main areas in this Trail. So that area also will be developed, specially.\u201d",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know if you have seen how many millions visited the Ayodhya temple. There are so many millions from around the world. So, there is an interest in this and we have to grab that opportunity being in the country that it actually has taken place.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt is so unfortunate that why it has not been done so far. This should have been done a long long time ago. So now I am thinking that we should do it at least now.\u201d (Colombo/Feb 22/2024)"
