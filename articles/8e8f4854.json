    "UNP MP suggest engaging in traditional politics at Presidential Election could risk return to civil war",
    "Says responsible parties should be held accountable for any potential third civil war",
    "Expresses disappointment at dissemination of misleading information on Economic Transformation bill",
    "Calls on voters to approach upcoming Presidential Election with focus on nation\u2019s future and not out of hatred or revenge",
    "United National Party (UNP) MP Wajira Abeywardana has issued a warning against adhering to traditional political ideologies in the upcoming Presidential Election, suggesting it could risk a return to civil war in the country.",
    "Speaking at a press conference yesterday at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), themed \u2018Collective Path to a Stable Country,\u2019 Abeywardana emphasised the critical nature of the upcoming election on 21 September, which will elect the 9th Executive President of Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cIf we continue with traditional political ideologies, caste-based politics, or religious divisions, the responsible parties should be held accountable for any potential civil war,\u201d he said.",
    "Abeywardana pointed out that Sri Lanka has a history of rebellions and civil wars, including a rebellion against the previous regime. He questioned whether voters would risk another civil war or choose to prevent such a scenario by their ballots on 21 September.",
    "\u201cDuring the country\u2019s economic crisis, the Opposition did not take responsibility for rebuilding, leaving President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the sole UNP member in Parliament at the time, to secure the country\u2019s future. On 22 July 2022, Wickremesinghe assumed the role of the 8th Executive President and committed to nation-building, introducing many reforms, including the Economic Transformation Act,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWhile the new Economic Transformation Bill was unanimously passed by all 225 members of Parliament, it is unfortunate that some individuals have presented misleading ideas to the public,\u201d Abeywardana noted.",
    "He urged all political parties to set aside traditional divisions and unite behind the national plan to build the country.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that despite the unanimous support for the Economic Transformation Act, some MPs express conflicting views publicly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to set aside their religious, caste, and political differences and work together on a national plan for the country\u2019s development.\u201d",
    "Abeywardana emphasised President Wickremesinghe\u2019s call for all parties to support a long-term national development program, putting aside individual policies to avoid undermining progress.",
    "\u201cTo build this country, we need to collaborate on a national plan spanning 6 to 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why President Wickremesinghe is running for the presidential election as an independent candidate. It\u2019s crucial that we stop misleading the public for political gain. There is no alternative path to recovering our nation.\u201d",
    "He also highlighted the importance of unity and prioritising the country\u2019s well-being. \u201cIn a democracy, political parties have the right to express their opinions. However, we must avoid causing further harm to the country. Voters should approach the upcoming Presidential Election with a focus on the nation\u2019s future, not out of hatred or revenge. This election should not be used as a means to undermine the country.\u201d he said."
