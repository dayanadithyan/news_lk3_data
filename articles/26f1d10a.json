    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the presidential candidate of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP), vowed to hold accountable those who spread false information out of fear of the NPP\u2019s potential victory.",
    "Addressing a public rally in Mirigama, Dissanayake expressed his intent to pursue legal action against individuals who disseminate misleading claims.",
    "Dissanayake criticized his political opponents, accusing them of resorting to conspiracy theories as their primary defense. \u201cTheir politics have deteriorated to the point where they can only respond with baseless conspiracy theories,\u201d Dissanayake stated. He contrasted his campaign\u2019s focus on national unity with what he described as the divisive rhetoric of his opponents.",
    "Drawing comparisons, Dissanayake noted that while Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa align with regional leaders Athaullah (A. L. M. Athaullah, MP)\u00a0and Hakeem (Rauff Hakeem, MP) respectively, his own campaign is grounded in a message of unity that has been a longstanding principle of his party. He rebuked Premadasa for relying on outdated racial narratives, suggesting that such tactics are unworthy of contemporary politics.",
    "In response to criticisms from figures like SJB\u2019s Tissa Attanayake, who alleged that a government led by the National People\u2019s Power would disrupt traditional cultural events like the Perehara, Dissanayake promised to hold these critics accountable in court. \u201cWe will bring all those who have spread such falsehoods about our intentions in a Perehara (procession) to the court,\u201d he declared."
