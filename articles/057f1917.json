    "Parliament, Feb. 21 (Daily Mirror)- SLPP MP Rohitha Abeygunawardane said today his privileges have been infringed due to a social media post posted by a woman in Katukurunda, Kalutara and requested the Speaker to bring her before the Privilege Committee.",
    "Raising a privilege issue in Parliament, MP Abeygunawardane said the woman had posted an insulting post in her social media account, stating that he and acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon were thieves and should be arrested immediately.",
    "The MP said his privileges, as a Member of Parliament, had been infringed by this post and that it was a threat to his life.",
    "\u201cThis post can cause threats to our lives. It is a dangerous situation,\u201d he said.",
    "He said the particular woman had contested the general election in 2015 and is known to him.",
    "He said all 225 MPs must rise against posts of this nature and said it was pointless enacting the Online Safety Act if actions were not taken against such posts.",
    "\u201cIt is wrong to accuse us when we have not committed any wrongdoings. People have a right to accuse us if we are at fault. Making false allegations violate not only the rights of the MPs but of all citizens,\u201d he said."
