  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Supreme Court today ordered for the fundamental rights (FR) petitions filed against the appointment of Deshabandu Tennakoon as the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) to be taken up for consideration on July 08, 2024.",
    "A three-member bench has issued this order after consideration of the eight petitions put forward by several parties including the Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Prof. Savitri Gunasekara, former MP Hirunika Premachandra and several others.",
    "The petitioners allege that Tennakoon had neglected his duties during his tenure as the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) of the Western Province when the 2019 Easter attacks happened, and when a pre-mediated attack was launched on the \u2018GotaGoGama\u2019 protest site at the Galle Face Green where several protesters were brutally beaten."
