    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka will definitely call a presidential election by July 2024, election observer PAFFREL said, accusing the government of expediting development programmes targeting the coming presidential poll.",
    "Chairman of the People\u2019s Action for Free & Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Rohana Hettiarachchi told reporters on Friday February 08 that a circular issued by the presidential secretariat in January has directed officials to complete all 2024 development projects initiated under a 10-year plan to develop the hill country by July this year.",
    "\u201cThe government is prioritising elections that it has a higher probability of winning over other elections that the people are currently owed,\u201d said Hettiarachchi, referring to the long delayed local government elections.",
    "He urged Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena who hold the local government portfolio to see to it that those elections aren\u2019t further postponed.",
    "\u201cIf people\u2019s democratic space is removed, they might resort to other means to win these rights,\u201d Hettiarachchi warned.",
    "The election monitor said that Sri Lanka\u2019s upcoming presidential election period must begin by July.",
    "\u201cThe election commission must decide it. In order to hold the election before October 17, the election must be called in the first days of July,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThere are four, five months for that. The president has the power to dissolve parliament. The incumbent president can do it, but based on the current situation, it is clear that the presidential election will definitely be held this year,\u201d he added.",
    "Hettiarachchi said the government engaging in development activities targeting the election.",
    "\u201cThe presidential secretariat issued a circular on January 24 which discusses the government\u2019s 10 year plan for development in the central hills. But in this 10 year plan, it says clearly that all development projects [for 2024] must be completed before July 31, 2024. It says the funds allocated for a year must be spent in six months. Why is that?",
    "\u201cIt is clear that the ulterior motive in this is that the presidential election, which would definitely have to be called by July, and having completed these projects by then will put the government at an advantage,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Feb08/2024)"
