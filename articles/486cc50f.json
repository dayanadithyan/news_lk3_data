  "original_title": "Sri Lanka FCDO advice campaign gains UK\u2019s House of Lords support",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "In January, Experience Travel Group published an open letter with 35 signatories calling for FCDO advice on Sri Lanka to be amended.",
    "It criticised mentions of fuel and food shortages in the country dating back to the 2022 political unrest and continued references to the 2019 terrorist attacks.",
    "The letter, signed by tourism providers in the UK and Sri Lanka, labelled current advice \u201coverly harsh\u201d and said the UK the government was \u201csystematically undermining the travel industry\u201d in Sri Lanka.",
    "The letter came to the attention of Conservative peer Lord Naseby, who told the House of Lords the FCDO comments \u201ccurrently cause me concern because they refer to the fact that protests are going on when they are not\u201d.",
    "He added: \u201cThey say that there is a fuel shortage, but there is not and has not been for 18 months. They also say that there are other difficulties of a terrorist nature, which we have not had for five years.\u201d",
    "Naseby urged foreign secretary David Cameron to re-examine the guidance.",
    "He continued: \u201cPerhaps I could bring a couple of people from the newly set-up Experience Travel Group\u2026 to perhaps talk to a junior minister about amending that.\u201d",
    "Experience Travel Group managing director Sam Clark called the mention \u201ca pivotal moment in our campaign\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe are very appreciative of Lord Naseby calling for a meeting with foreign secretary Lord Cameron,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI am hopeful that this will progress our discussions on the best way forward to accurately represent Sri Lanka in our government\u2019s travel guidance in a way that does cause unjust harm to Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, which is heavily reliant on tourism.",
    "\u201cThe FCDO advice is stuck in the past and it is vital that the Foreign Office updates the system across the board so travellers can once again place their trust in its accuracy.\u201d"
