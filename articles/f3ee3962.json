    "Casio Computer Co. Ltd., headquartered in Japan recently got a significant enforcement action conducted in Sri Lanka as part of the Casio Group\u2019s IP Enforcement Policy to combat the escalating issue of Casio\u2019s counterfeits in the Sri Lankan market and protect its valued consumers.",
    "In a recent coordinated effort alongside Casio India, raids were conducted by Colombo Crime Division (CCD) simultaneously at three locations of one of the largest retail stores in Sri Lanka in March 2024. These locations included two outlets of the retail store and its warehouse, where counterfeit Casio watches, primarily G-SHOCK timepieces were found. The operation resulted in the seizure of several counterfeit watches and representatives of the accused entity were taken into custody for further legal proceedings. Subsequently, the entity pleaded guilty in the matters and fines were imposed.",
    "Casio India Head of Legal Gurmeet Singh said: \u201cAt Casio, we are taking every measure to eliminate counterfeits and ensure that our customers have access to original Casio products. Such actions underscore our unwavering commitment towards consumer interests and brand integrity. We would like to thank the enforcement authorities for their cooperation in taking expeditious actions against counterfeiters.
