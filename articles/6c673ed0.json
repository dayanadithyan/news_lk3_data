  "original_body_lines": [
    "Hundreds of handheld pagers exploded near simultaneously across Lebanon and in parts of Syria on Tuesday, wounding members of the militant group Hezbollah, the Iranian ambassador and dozens of other people.",
    "Officials pointed the finger at Israel in what appeared to be a sophisticated, remote attack at a time of rising tensions across the Lebanon border.",
    "A Hezbollah official who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press that \u201cseveral hundred\u201d people, including members of the group, were wounded in different parts of Lebanon when their handheld pagers exploded. He said a few Hezbollah fighters were also wounded in Syria when the pagers they were carrying exploded, and said it was believed to be an Israeli attack.",
    "The Associated Press reached out to the Israeli military, which declined to comment.",
    "Iran\u2019s semi-official Fars news agency, close to the country\u2019s powerful Revolutionary Guard, said on its Telegram channel that Mojtaba Amani, Iran\u2019s ambassador in Lebanon, has a superficial injury and is under observation at a hospital. Another semi-official Mehr news agency, also on its Telegram channel, reported that Amani was wounded by a pager explosion.",
    "Photos and videos from Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs circulating on social media and in local media showed people lying on the pavement with wounds on their hands or near their pants pockets.",
    "Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah previously warned the group\u2019s members not to carry cellphones, saying that they could be used by Israel to track their movements and to carry out targeted strikes.",
    "Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry called on all hospitals to be on alert to take in emergency patients and for people who own pagers to get away from them. It also asked health workers to avoid using wireless devices.",
    "AP photographers at area hospitals said the emergency rooms were overloaded with patients, many of them with injuries to their limbs, some in serious condition.",
    "The state-run National News Agency said hospitals in southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs\u00a0all areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence had called on people to donate blood of all types.",
    "The news agency reported that in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and other areas \u201cthe handheld pagers system was detonated using advanced technology, and dozens of injuries were reported.\u201d",
    "The Hezbollah official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media said the explosions were the result of \u201ca security operation that targeted the devices.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe enemy (Israel) stands behind this security incident,\u201d the official said, without elaborating. He added that the new pagers that Hezbollah members were carrying had lithium batteries that apparently exploded.",
    "Lithium batteries, when overheated, can smoke, melt and even catch on fire. Rechargeable lithium batteries are used in consumer products ranging from cellphones and laptops to electric cars. Lithium battery fires can burn up to 590 C (1,100 F).",
    "The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between Lebanon and Israel. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been clashing near-daily for more than 11 months against the backdrop of war between Israel and Hezbollah ally Hamas in Gaza.",
    "The clashes have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. On Tuesday, Israel said that halting Hezbollah\u2019s attacks in the north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal.",
    "Israel has killed Hamas militants in the past with booby trapped cellphones and it\u2019s widely believed to have been behind the Stuxnet computer virus attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in 2010."
