    "\u201cNow they have presented three political programmes. All three of them contain the same thing. Instead, we have brought a strategic plan. A strategic programme that represents the views of every man in this country,\u201d Jayaweera said.",
    "He further stated that after the people vote on the morning of September 21, the results can only be expected on September 23 because of the second preference count.",
