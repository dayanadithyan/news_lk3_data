    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MPs who left the government and have now joined an alliance with the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) first approached the National People\u2019s Power (NPP), its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.",
    "Speaking at an event in Gampaha on Thursday August 08, Dissanayake said the NPP said no to this group of legislators.",
    "\u201cThe SLPP is now split to three factions: one is with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, another with MP Namal Rajapaksa and the other with opposition leader Sajith Premadasa. A lot of them knocked on our door before going to the SJB. What did we do? We said \u2018ayubowan\u2019 and told them that their record in not that good,\u201d said Dissanayake.",
    "The NPP leader claimed that the visiting MPs were told in no uncertain terms that they had represented a party accused of spreading racism and engaged in corruption, and were shown the door.",
    "\u201cThanks for knocking on our door but we cannot let you in,\u201d he quoted the NPP spokesmen as saying.",
    "Dissanayake also mentioned the name of MP Nalaka Godahewa who is among the SLPP MPs who have declared their support for the presidential candidature of SJB leader Premadasa.",
    "Dissanayake further said a future NPP government will bring in legislation to prevent members of parliament from crossing over.",
    "\u201cThis politics of jumping from side to stop must be stopped one day. Only a movement that won\u2019t embrace those who jump can stop it,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe make one guarantee: this is the last time they jump. An NPP government will draft a law that will send them home if they cross over.",
    "\u201cThis is what corrupted this country\u2019s politics. They come into power and do anti-people things as they see fit, and fish out opposition MPs as they like. This is our biggest catastrophe,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Aug09/2024)"
