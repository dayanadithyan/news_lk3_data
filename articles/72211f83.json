    "He said the government is committed to implementing measures aimed at creating an economy that fosters self-sufficiency and financial resilience.",
    "\u201cWhile it may be tempting to make promises of free services, such as data, doing so would only exacerbate our economic challenges. Instead, our pledge is to focus on building a robust economy that empowers individuals to afford essential services and goods,\u201d he said.",

    "Addressing the audience, President Wickremesinghe stressed the imperative of transitioning swiftly to an export-oriented economy as a key aspect of economic development.",
    "The event saw the attendance of numerous young individuals representing diverse sectors, who directly posed questions to the President. In return, President Wickremesinghe offered constructive responses to their inquiries and engaged in friendly interactions with the attendees.",
