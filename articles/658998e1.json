    "The UK government has tweaked its travel advice for Sri Lanka, but campaigners believe further changes are still required.",
    "An open letter published in January called for the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) to update its advice, describing sections as \u201coverly harsh\u201d, \u201coutdated\u201d and \u201csynthetic\u201d.",
    "The advice has now been changed slightly, with a reference to roadblocks amended.",
    "Sam Clark, chief executive of Sri Lanka specialist Experience Travel Group, said the advice is now \u201cmuch better and more contextualised, but still not reflective of the current situation on the ground\u201d.",
    "In February, the advice stated: \u201cProtests, demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest can happen anywhere across the island at short notice, and security authorities may use tear gas and water cannons against protesters. The authorities may impose restrictions, including curfews, with little or no notice. Avoid demonstrations, political protests or large gatherings.\u201d",
    "The updated advice reads: \u201cProtests and demonstrations can happen anywhere across the island at short notice, and can become violent. Security authorities may use water cannons and tear gas to control protesters.",
    "\u201cLarge-scale protests in 2022 resulted in violence and loss of life. Movement around the island was difficult due to restrictions such as curfews and roadblocks. Avoid demonstrations, political protests or large gatherings.\u201d",
    "Earlier this year, Clark and his fellow campaigners expressed disappointment with the advice\u2019s claim that violent unrest could happen anywhere in Sri Lanka at short notice. They were also unhappy with the appeal to UK travellers to avoid crowded places, which Clark said was \u201cparticularly excessive and unfair\u201d.",
    "This week, Clark described the advice tweaks as a \u201cmajor win\u201d but he repeated his concerns about the claim that protests can happen anywhere in Sri Lanka at short notice.",
    "\u201cIf the reality on the ground doesn\u2019t match the advice, it undermines faith in the system,\u201d said Clark.",
    "He added:\u00a0 \u201cWe hope the FCDO continues to review their travel guidance on Sri Lanka. Nobody should deny themselves the beauties and cultural riches of this amazing country just because of a moderate risk that exists everywhere.\u201d",
    "The FCDO said: \u201cThe safety of British people is the main factor when determining our travel advice. Our advice is designed to help British people make informed decisions about foreign travel and remains under constant review to ensure it reflects our latest assessment of risks when travelling abroad.\u201d"
