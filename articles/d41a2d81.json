    "SLPP National Organiser Namal Rajapaksa says differing views within parties is a common feature in SL\u2019s Presidential election history",
    "Stresses SLPP has a responsibility to represent SL\u2019s leftist camp against UNP and protect party ideology",
    "Blames current political scenario for some SLPP MPs extending support to Wickremesinghe",
    "Calls on SLPP members to continue supporting their camp and set aside all differences",
    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) National Organiser Namal Rajapaksa has said the decision by certain party members to support President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the upcoming election was anticipated.",
    "Addressing the media yesterday after several key meetings at the party headquarters, Rajapaksa remarked that differing views and discussions between and within parties is a common feature in the country\u2019s Presidential election history.",
    "He said the SLPP is continuing to work on strengthening the party and must focus on ensuring the success of its ideology and stance rather than prioritising the victory of an individual candidate. \u201cWe have always been in the anti-UNP camp. Today, we will continue to stand in opposition to the UNP,\u201d he said, while flanked by MPs D.V. Chanaka, Tissa Kuttiarachchi, Sumith Udukumbura, and D. Weerasingha.",
    "Rajapaksa stressed the SLPP has the responsibility to represent the leftist camp against the UNP.",
    "He emphasised that it is important to remember that Presidential elections are about connecting with the people and for garnering preferential votes. \u201cSome may think this is a good time to attract preferential votes for an upcoming election, but this is not that type of election. Historically, the winning candidate has been the one with a national program. We have such a program,\u201d he said.",
    "When asked about a majority of SLPP MPs extending their support to the President, Rajapaksa said it doesn\u2019t matter whether it is a majority or a minority. He mentioned that those who met with the President did so after meeting with party members at his residence, revisiting them the night before, and even meeting with him again yesterday morning. \u201cThere are some doubts in their minds on the matter,\u201d he said, attributing it to the current political context.",
    "He called on them to continue supporting the SLPP camp to protect it and set aside all differences. \u201cLet us be together,\u201d he said.",
    "Rajapaksa said the SLPP will continue to deliberate on its Presidential candidacy. He clarified that the decision to field its own candidate is a policy stance, not a position for or against any politician, whether it be Wickremesinghe, Namal Rajapaksa, or another individual.",
    "He emphasised the importance of protecting the camp\u2019s ideology and not undermining it, especially at this critical juncture, to prevent the ideology of another camp from prevailing."
