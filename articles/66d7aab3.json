    "Wickremesinghe arrived at the parliament complex on Wednesday morning to brief the House on the progress of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic recovery process.",
    "Addressing the parliamentary proceedings, the Head of State said imposing the VAT was not an easy decision to make, adding that this helped boost state revenue to nearly 11% of the GDP.",
    "He explained that the growth in state revenue gave assurances to the international community that the island nation was capable of settling its outstanding debts.",
    "Increased state revenue led to the appreciation of the rupee, which ultimately resulted in the reduction of prices on imported goods including fuel, Wickremesinghe continued, adding that if Sri Lanka continues to move forward on this path successfully, the economy would further stabilize by the end of this year.",
    "Speaking further, the Head of State revealed the government\u2019s intentions to expand the tax net further.
