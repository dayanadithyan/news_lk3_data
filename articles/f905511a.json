    "Colombo, Feb 22 (Daily Star) -\u00a0 Sri Lanka said Wednesday it had exported tea worth $20 million to Iran to partially repay its $251 million oil debts, with Colombo saying Tehran's visiting foreign minister had expressed \"satisfaction\" at the deal.",
    "\"So far $20 million worth of tea has been exported to Iran under the barter trade agreement,\" Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena's office said in a statement after talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.",
    "The tea-for-oil deal was agreed upon in December 2021, but exports were delayed by Colombo's economic crisis that forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down in July 2022.",
    "The barter deal allows sanctions-hit Iran to avoid having to use scarce hard currency to pay for imports of popular tea.",
    "It also allowed Sri Lanka to pay with tea, as the country was short of foreign currency.",
    "Sri Lankan officials have previously said that the tea-oil swap did not break US sanctions on Iran, since tea was a food item and the deal did not involve Iranian blacklisted banks.",
    "The island defaulted on its $46 billion foreign debt in April 2022 and secured a $2.9 billion IMF bailout early last year."
