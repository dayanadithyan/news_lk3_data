    "However President\u2019s Counsel Wickramaratne has explained that the leaving out Section 83 (b) of the constitution was a not an \u201coversight\u201d but it was a result of instructions received by the then administration to avoid making changes that required a referendum.",

    "\u201cSome critics argue that democracy is at risk during certain crises. However, our constitution, judiciary, and political system have worked to advance and protect it.
