As the digital signage market is projected to exceed $35 billion by 2026 according to Fortune Business Insight, Samsung has consistently expanded the boundaries of this dynamic industry.",
    "Over the past decade, digital signage has evolved from being a mere advertising display to a powerful platform for personalized information, education, sports, art, and more.

    "In 2023, Samsung continued to advance immersion across various fields, creating a total experience for organizations that adopt its technology. From historic monuments like St. Peter\u2019s Square in Vatican City to ultra-luxury resorts such as Atlantis the Royal in Dubai, Samsung\u2019s high-precision LED displays and audio solutions have enhanced events and created awe-inspiring environments.",
    "One notable example is the collaboration with the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, where Samsung\u2019s immersive room equipped with 18 meters of LED screens redefines the learning experience.

    "The Wall for Virtual Production, a new addition to Samsung\u2019s product lineup, demonstrates the company\u2019s commitment to supporting creativity in the TV, film, and creative industries. It allows creatives to use ultra-large LED walls to create virtual content with real-time visual effects technology, reducing production time and costs.",
    "Samsung\u2019s role as a digital art platform is exemplified by its collaboration with contemporary artists like the late Park Seo-Bo and Dutch-American audiovisual artist 0010\u00d70010. Exhibitions in locations such as New York\u2019s Rockefeller Center and Bangkok, Thailand, showcase how Samsung\u2019s technology brings art to life, redefining the boundaries of modern art and exploring the convergence of the digital and physical worlds.",
