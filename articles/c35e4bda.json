    "The Deputy Director of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) Dr. Rukshan Bellana has stated that he is ready to resign at any moment, if required.",
    "Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday morning (20 Feb.), Dr. Bellana explained that if he is transferred from his current post, as demanded by the junior staff of the Colombo National Hospital, he is willing to resign.",
    "Dr. Bellana further accused the Ministry of Health and high-ranking officials within the health sector of having adapted to an \u2018easy administration\u2019 policy, within which crucial decisions are taken solely based on \u2018the power of voices\u2019.",
    "On 17 February, the junior staff of the Colombo National Hospital warned that they will continue their protests until the hospital\u2019s Deputy Director Dr. Rukshan Bellana is removed from his position.",
    "They resorted to this move against the criticisms made by Dr. Bellana regarding the junior staffers\u2019 involvement in the recent strike launched by health trade unions over disparities in allowances.",
    "On Friday (Feb. 16), Dr. Bellana was forcibly held inside his office by the junior staff of the hospital. Later, a tense situation arose in front of the hospital as the staff members commenced a demonstration.",
    "Thus, police anti-riot squads were also deployed to beef up the security of the hospital premises."
