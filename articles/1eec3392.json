    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition has questioned claims made by government spokesmen that a tax on housing proposed in an International Monetary Fund deal is only limited to rich people but if as promised by President one house is exempt, it is welcome, legislator Harsha de Silva said.",
    "Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe made a promise in parliament that the first house of a citizen will be excluded from the property tax.",
    "Related Sri Lanka to exempt one house from imputed rent wealth tax: President",
    "But opposition legislator Harsha de Silva pointed out that the IMF program documents clearly says taxes will be levied on owner occupied houses on \u2018imputed taxes\u2019, not second houses.",
    "Under current inland revenue laws, actual rent income from a second house is already captured as part of taxable income.",
    "The IMF document mentions a threshold value from which taxes will be exempt but not that a whole owner-occupied primary residence will be exempt.",
    "\u201cThe tax is imposed on the income of individuals (rather than real property itself) and thus raises central government revenue in accordance with the constitution,\u201d IMF staff said in their report.",
    "\u201cA similar tax was previously included in the Inland Revenue Act. No. 10 of 2006.",
    "\u201cUnder this regime, primary residences were exempt and the assessed values for rating purposes were used to determine the base.",
    "\u201cGiven the broad exemption and the use of outdated and downward biased annual values, the tax generated hardly any revenue.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile Sri Lanka has promised to impose the housing tax from April 01, 2025.",
    "\u201c\u2026[W]e will introduce an imputed rental income tax on owner-occupied and vacant residential properties before the beginning of the tax year on April 1st, 2025,\u201d the memorandum of economic policies agreed with the IMF said.",
    "\u201cAn exemption threshold and a graduated tax rate schedule would make this tax highly progressive.",
    "\u201cThe full revenue yield from this tax is estimated at 0.4 percent and would materialize in 2026 (with a partial yield of 0.15 percent in 2025).",
    "\u201cThis yield would still fall short by 1 percent of GDP relative to the expected yield of 1.2 percent of GDP from the property tax envisaged for 2025 onwards.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhatever the President said the IMF agreement says owner occupied house,\u201d De Silva told in parliament.",
    "\u201cIt is not the second house that is mentioned in the agreement.",
    "\u201cBut there is one thing. I am happy as Samagi Jana Balawegaya, that we have been able to save the middle class in society from a massive tax that was to be imposed.\u201d",
    "In Sri Lanka there is a belief that the most productive citizens are fair game for excessive or expropriationary taxation, just like kulaks were targeted in the Soviet Union for actual expropriation, critics say.",
    "Wealth taxes have had disastrous effects on some US cities like Baltimore, leading to falling populations and dilapidated houses.",
    "Sri Lanka is currently facing a brain drain due to high income tax after on top of depreciation from severe monetary debasement from a flexible exchange rate, which is neither a hard peg nor a clean float.",
    "Sri Lanka has imposed a wide range of taxes on the people to maintain a bloated state, after inflationists engaged in extreme macro-economic policy (tax and rate cuts) glorified in Saltwater-Cambridge doctrine to boost growth, throwing classical economic principles and monetary stability to the winds and driving the country into external default.",
    "The IMF itself gave technical assistance the central bank to calculate potential output inviting the agency to cut rates to close the perceived econometric \u2018output gap\u2019.",
    "In the run up to the default, rate cuts triggered multiple external crises, leading to output shocks as stabilization programs were implemented.",
    "Macro-economic policy as known now was devised by Cambridge academic J M Keynes  in the wake of the Great Depression triggered by the Federal Reserve after it invented open market operations and policy rates in the 1920s and also popularized by Harvard academic Alvin Hansen among others.",
    "Macro-economic policy started to de-stabilize countries in peacetime in the interwar years and after World War II it led to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system.",
    "The Great Depression was also a peacetime collapse of what was later known as the roaring 20s\u2019 monetary bubble.",
    "\u201cThey have blithely ignored the warnings of economists,\u201d classical economist Ludwig von Mises wrote of European nations which got into trouble from rate cuts and Keynesian stimulus, which brought currency depreciation and protectionism in its wake from the 1930s.",
    "\u201cThey have erected trade barriers, they have fostered credit expansion and an easy money policy, they have taken recourse to price control, to minimum wage rates, and to subsidies.",
    "\u201cThey have transformed taxation into confiscation and expropriation; they have proclaimed heedless spending as the best method to increase wealth and welfare.",
    "\u201cBut when the inevitable consequences of such policies, long before predicted by the economists, became more and more obvious, public opinion did not place the blame on these cherished policies\u2026\u201d",
    "In Sri Lanka however there is some understanding of the role played by macro-economists in the most recent crisis.",
    "There are rumblings of unhappiness about \u2018central bank independence\u2019 given to an agency to create 5 to 7 percent inflation and currency debasement under a flexible exchange rate and its constitutional status relating to parliamentary control of public finances.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank\u2019s current flexible inflation targeting (inflation targeting without a floating rate) regime as well as its 1980s money supply targeting without floating rate has busted the national currency for decades and made it impossible to run budgets, made it difficult for people build houses which are now to be taxed, and also for millions to live and work in the country of their birth.",
    "Fiscal metrics deteriorate each time rate cuts drive the country into currency crises and new taxes are brought in stabilization programs, ousting reformist governments and leading to policy reversals.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s citizens have suffered for decades from the privilege given to a few macroeconomists to print money to cut rates with inflationary open market operations and trigger forex shortages.",
    "Related How Sri Lanka\u2019s elections are decided by macro-economists and the IMF: Bellwether",
    "Critics have pointed out that since 1954 in particular, central bank rates cuts which drive the country into external crises and the stabilization programs that follow, have been the main determinant of elections in the country and election of fringe political parties. (Colombo/June13/2024)"
