    "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Japan\u2019s economy is now the world\u2019s fourth-largest after it contracted in the last quarter of 2023 and fell behind Germany.",
    "The government reported the economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.4% in October to December, according to Cabinet Office data on real GDP released Thursday, though it grew 1.9% for all of 2023. It contracted 2.9% in July-September. Two straight quarters of contraction are considered an indicator an economy is in a technical recession.",
    "Japan\u2019s economy was the second largest until 2010, when it was overtaken by China\u2019s. Japan\u2019s nominal GDP totaled $4.2 trillion last year, while Germany\u2019s was $4.4 trillion, or $4.5 trillion, depending on the currency conversion.",
    "A weaker Japanese yen was a key factor in the drop to fourth place, since comparisons of nominal GDP are in dollar terms. But Japan\u2019s relative weakness also reflects a decline in its population and lagging productivity and competitiveness, economists say."
