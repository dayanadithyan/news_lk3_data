  "original_body_lines": [
    "Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa says that certain political groups are unwilling to join a debate on economic policies as their parties have no proper outlook on the country\u2019s economy.",
    "Joining the 181st phase of the \u2018Sakwala\u2019 programme to grant smart classrooms for schools, which was held in Divulapitiya area, the SJB Leader stated: \u201c\u2026they are attempting to conceal from the country the fact that they lack a proper economic program. Such hide-and-seek politics are ineffective in a bankrupt nation. We should be transparent and forthright.\u201d",
    "\u201cMyself and my group have already proven our talent, vision and programme. Understand this clearly: no other alternative group in this country has demonstrated such skills or talents\u201d, he added.",
    "\u201cTherefore, I once again urge that we hold both proposed debates. Let\u2019s fix dates for that. Then the people can decide which party offers real solutions and which does not\u201d, Premadasa stressed."
