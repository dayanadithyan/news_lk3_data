    "Amendments to SLBFE Act now in final phase, soon be tabled in Parliament",
    "Labour and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said that the Cabinet of Ministers approved digitising the entire foreign employment sector to streamline the entire process.",
    "He emphasised that the idea would be put into action soon and that it would assist free the foreign job sector from the grip of fraudsters and traffickers. It will also enhance the processes for managing grievances and increase communication between migrant workers and authorities.",
    "He made these remarks on Saturday in a discussion held with Journalists in the Matale district on the sidelines of the \u2018Jayagamu Sri Lanka\u2019 program.",
    "The Minister emphasised that this initiative would empower the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) to thwart unnecessary interference and combat illegal activities effectively.",
    "\u201cThe digitisation of this sector will improve efficiency by including everything from SLBFE recruiting to personnel hiring at the Embassy. Furthermore, each employee will have an \u2018App\u2019 on their phone, which will allow our Colombo office to notify someone in case of an emergency. As a result, we have created a mechanism to get in touch with the appropriate individual from afar. We will update you on it later on. Once this system is established, many problems in the sector can be solved,\u201d Nanayakkara said.",
    "Responding to questions from Journalists the Minister said under the laws stipulated in the current Act, the SLBFE has no responsibility regarding sub-agents.\u00a0 \u201cThe SLBFE Act is modified to address sub-agents; it is currently in the final stages and will shortly be submitted for approval in Parliament by the Attorney General\u2019s Department. It contains that these sub-agents are regulated as agencies with licences. However, this agency must take accountability for these sub-agents,\u201d he added.",
    "The Minister said matters related to the foreign employment sector will be streamlined and more transparent with the digitisation process."
