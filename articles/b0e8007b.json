    "In a touching gesture of unity and generosity, the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) fulfilled its mission to support the \u2018Warm Meal for a Child\u2019 initiative. Following a successful \u2018Sing-Along\u2019 fundraiser event, which was held in December 2023, the IASL team traveled to Matale to share a warm meal with 31 children aged 6-18 across two children\u2019s homes. This heartening act not only brought joy to the recipients, but also showcased the power of corporate generosity and highlights the industry\u2019s dedication to making a positive impact beyond insurance.",
