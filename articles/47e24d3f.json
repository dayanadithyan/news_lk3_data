    "Colombo, June 4 (Daily Mirror) - The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has scheduled a major shutdown of the refinery at Sapugaskanda from July 8, its media spokesman S.M.C.P. Samarakoon said.",
    "He said the refinery crude unit was shut down on May 29, followed by a complete shutdown of the production processes on May 30 morning due to a failure in the water demineralization plant, which is crucial for refinery power generation facilities.",
    "After painstaking efforts, the repair work on the boiler water system has been successful, and the restoration of the power system will be completed shortly, Samarakoon said.",
    "The resumption of the crude unit operation will commence effective tomorrow, and other processors will be started subsequently, he said.",
    "Therefore, the CPC assured the public that there is no need to worry about their fuel requirements, as Ceypetco has sufficient stocks in storage tanks."
