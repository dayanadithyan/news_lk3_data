    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The global north must \u201cwalk the talk\u201d and collaborate with the global south in ensuring access to low-cost funding, debt relief and bridging the digital divide, Sri Lanka foreign minister Ali Sabry told the World Economic Forum.",
    "\u201cCountries in the global south need the support of the global north on having access to low cost funding, debt relief, transition of latest technology, the digital divide. So I think this is time for the global north to walk the talk and collaborate,\u201d he said.",
    "Sabry was speaking at a panel on \u2018North to South, East to West: Rebuilding Trust\u2019 at the Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth and Energy for Development 2024.",
    "The minster tweeted that, during the discussion, he had noted that peace and stability lead to development and prosperity and competing powers must keep the channels of communication open.",
    "\u201cPeace and stability is very important. As a result of which, as you pointed out, though economies or GDPs have grown eight times despite the challenges, a precondition was peace and stability. So as we, members of the global south, would like and request members of the global north and the players who have so much power \u2014 with great power comes great responsibility \u2014 don\u2019t close the channels of diplomacy. Open channels of communication,\u201d he said.",
    "High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission Josep Borrell Fontelles who spoke on the same panel also called for increased cooperation.",
    "\u201cWe need more cooperation. Climate, demography, technology, everything needs more cooperation,\u201d he said.",
    "The world has to start respecting the existing rules and amend those to suit modern needs, said Fontelles.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to re-invent the wheel. Many things could work, the way they are. Why they don\u2019t work is because there\u2019s a big gap in what we say and what we do,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Apr29/2024)"
