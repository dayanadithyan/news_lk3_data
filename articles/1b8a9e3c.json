    "ECONOMYEXT \u2013 State-run SriLankan said its engineering units has implemented AMOS, an aviation maintenance management system at its engineering division.",
    "By automating the monitoring and coordination of aircraft maintenance with AMOS, the airline said it will be able to boost engineering productivity, reduce costs and maintain quality and consistency in its Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) operations.",
    "\u201cThe integration took several months to complete given the complexities of transitioning data from our legacy system to the advanced AMOS platform. With this transition, we anticipate modernizing our operations, achieving greater efficiency, and ensuring that we maintain our aircraft and safety standards to the highest degree,\u201d Head of Engineering at SriLankan Airlines, Arjuna Kapugeekiyana said.",
    "\u201cWe have further integrated the AMOSmobile/EXEC Mobile add-on to maximize the overall value of the project with seamless, paperless operations such as electronic work instructions and digital sign-offs that streamline unnecessary time-consuming tasks,\u201d Group Head of Information Technology of SriLankan Airlines, Chamara Perera said.",
    "The AMOS platform has sophisticated features and data visualization functionalities that allow for precise inventory management and cost-effective practices.",
    "Accurate calculations and scheduling of maintenance work will enable SriLankan Engineering to effectively manage aircraft maintenance limits in alignment with flight schedules.",
    "The system also allows SriLankan to proactively plan manpower and material resources for maintenance activities, reducing Aircraft on Ground (AOG) occurrences as well as maintaining optimal inventory levels.",
    "The AMOSmobile/EXEC software extension additionally empowers engineers and technicians of SriLankan Airlines to perform aircraft dispatch functions; request parts; check on fleet status; and carry out line and base maintenance tasks through a touch-optimized app, replacing paper-based with a digitized workflow.
