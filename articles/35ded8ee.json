  "original_body_lines": [
    "Stressing the need to hold a discussion on the fishermen issue between Sri Lanka and India, Sri Lanka\u2019s State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya emphasized that both countries must look into this \u2018long-lasting issue\u2019 from a sustainable perspective.",
    "During an interview with India\u2019s NDTV, State Minister Balasuriya expressed that this issue has persisted for a very long period of time.",
    "\u201cIn the Foreign Ministry, I was reading some old notes of when the Indian Prime Minister Neru visited Prime Minister Bandaranaike in 1950s, and top in the agenda was the fishermen\u2019s issue. So, this has persisted for a long period of time..,\u201d Balasuriya said.",
    "Furthermore, the Foreign Affairs State Minister stressed that the people in the North of Sri Lanka are the most affected community as a result of this problem, adding that the Tamil Nadu government needs to realize that.",
    "\u201cIf you see the problem, it\u2019s not one or two Indian fishermen who come for fishing in the Sri Lankan waters. It is thousands of fishermen coming for fishing in the Sri Lankan waters\u2026\u201d",
    "\u201cYou need to realize that the people in the North of Sri Lanka have suffered the most. I think the Tamil Nadu government also needs to realize that. They have suffered as a result of the war which was in place for a period of over 30 years and now they are suffering because they can\u2019t make a livelihood from fishing\u201d, he stressed.",
    "Balasuriya also weighed that it is required to halt some of the destructive fishing practices carried out by the Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters. \u201cAlso I think some of the practices carried out by the Indian fishermen such as bottom trawling, we need to stop that\u201d, he said.",
    "Commenting further, the Sri Lankan State Minister said: \u201cSo both countries need to get together in order to address this problem. I think that\u2019s why the greater connectivity of Sri Lanka and India is also good. \u201c",
    "\u201cUsually the people who are in the fishing\u2026if one\u2019s father is a fisherman, the son also becomes a fisherman. If there\u2019s more connectivity in other areas of opportunities like tourism where they can even make more money\u2026 then less people will get into fishing\u201d, Balasuriya added.",
    "\u201cIndia and Sri Lanka has to look at fishing in such a sustainable perspective\u201d, he highlighted.",
