    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka leftist presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake has said his National People\u2019s Power (NPP) is the only party to not platform MPs accused of crime or corruption, accusing the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) of opening its doors to questionable characters.",
    "Speaking at an election rally in Kegalle on Tuesday September 10, Dissanayake claimed that a former state minister accused of swindling the stock market was now with the SJB.",
    "MP Geetha Kumarasinghe who had only just last week praised President Ranil Wickremesinghe was now saying SJB leader Sajith Premadasa is great, he said.",
    "\u201cThe one who made a teacher kneel in Anamaduwa is also with Sajith,\u201d claimed Dissanayake.",
    "The NPP presidential candidate said MP Rishad Bathiudeen who was in the centre of an alleged deforestation controversy was now with Premadasa as is a young Buddhist monk who had lodged a complaint against Bathiudeen at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).",

    "\u201cOnly the NPP has been engaging in principled politics,\u201d he insisted.",
    "The NPP is the only party to not welcome MPs who have committed criminal acts, engaged in corruption, \u201cjumped here and there\u201d or incited racism, said Dissanayake.",
    "\u201cThis alone is enough to decide who is good and who is bad,\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake also responded to allegations levelled by Premadasa of a deal between himself and President Wickremesnighe.",
    "\u201cThe true deal is between them. There are meetings some nights,\u201d he said, claiming that an SJB legislator prominently associated with SJB\u2019s economic policy outlook had met the president two weeks earlier. (Colombo/Sep11/2024)"
