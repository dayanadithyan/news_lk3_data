    "Colombo, Jan -24 (Daily Mirror) - Ceylon Workers\u2019 Congress (CWC) General Secretary Minister Jeevan Thondaman is in the centre of controversy over the presence of South Indian actresses Aishwarya Rajesh, Aishwarya Dutta, Samyuktha Menon, and Meenakshi (Pinky Sarkar) in national Thai Pongal celebrations conducted in Hatton last Sunday.",
    "He is under fire from his political opponents who question him whether these South artistes were sponsored using tax payers\u2019 money despite the government having declared austerity measures",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Organizer for Passara Letchumanar Sanjay asks why Mr. Thondaman took steps to celebrate the national Pongal festival in such a luxurious manner at a time when people are suffering due to the soaring cost of living.",
    "He said, \u201cStudent dropouts have increased in the Nuwara-Eliya District and many families are suffering from hunger. People gave more than 100,000 votes and sent them to Parliament to get the services done for them. But, Mr. Jeevan Thondaman is bringing South Indian actresses. Where did money for the visit come from? Jeevan Thondaman, as a representative of the people, should definitely answer for wasting people's money in this manner,\u201d he said.",
    "He also said, instead of inviting South Indian actresses, local artistes could have been encouraged to attend."
