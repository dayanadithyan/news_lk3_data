    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Rising temperatures and extreme weather events due to climate change are impacting business, and companies need to address the irrelevance of existing business models, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said.",
    "\u201cClimate change is affecting all of us in a big way. More particularly, the business community and businesses,\u201d Duminda Hulangamuwa, Chairman, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said.",
    "\u201cThere is a huge cost. It is imperative that we address the situation,\u201d Hulangamuwa said announcing the Sri Lanka Climate Summit 2024 \u2018Code Red \u2013 Climate Risks and Opportunities for Sri Lankan Businesses\u2019.",
    "Over three days, from May 7-9, the Summit to be held at Shangri La Colombo, will bring together businesses, government officials/policy makers and academia to discuss the risks of climate change, and the growth opportunities for Sri Lankan businesses.",
    "Sri Lanka is among the top 10 countries in the world affected by climate change, Dr Ananda Mallawatantri, Advisor, Presidential Secretariat said. \u201cOur competitiveness in the global marketplace is going down as a result of climate change. Insurance costs go up because the damages are high.",
    "\u201cWe see the floods, droughts, landslides. Sea water coming into groundwater. One of the most damaging is the temperature rise.",
    "\u201cBecause when the temperature increases the crop yield goes up. But at a certain point, the yield curve starts going down. In some of our crops, we are at that point. Increase in temperature will affect pollination.",
    "\u201cIn the dairy sector, animals won\u2019t eat after a certain temperature, humidity level. So you have to cool them. You have to add more energy to cool them. Provide more water. At the end of the day business costs get added. Procurement chains are upset.",
    "\u201cThere are many, many ways climate change is impacting businesses. All these adds to the price, the raw material availability and then overall investment risk. When you are at a high risk like Sri Lanka, attracting investments need to be factored in. We see investors asking for climate insurance.\u201d",
    "Businesses need to take into account the changes taking place for them to be sustainable, Mallawatantri said.",
    "Asia, in particular, faces an increased risk from a changing climate. \u201cIt extends from food security through to the survival of, the death of many businesses,\u201d Dilhan Fernando, Chairman, Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company Plc said.",
    "The cost of mitigation would be a fraction of the cost of confronting climate change, Fernando pointed out. \u201cThe cost of doing something would be a fraction of the cost of doing nothing.",
    "\u201cLook at our neighbors embracing the reality of a climate crisis; Singapore has set a 2030 green deadline \u2013 a pathway that will deliver jobs, economic growth. It is something that will help them to offset the growing marginalization and the irrelevance of existing business models.\u201d",
    "With \u2018Code Red\u2019, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to create panic, we aim to offer solutions that are practical, pragmatic, tested, not in the US \u2013 but in India, in the region. With practical examples of what Sri Lanka can do,\u201d he said, adding that rising temperatures were impacting the tastes of tea.",
    "\u201cAs Sri Lanka adopts mitigation measures, we will find that whether tourism, whether tea or any other industry, we will find a competitive edge growing and aligning with some of the great economies that are doing that,\u201d Mallawatantri said.",
    "\u201cThere are a list of opportunities in between. Connecting different markets and the value chains, labeling standards. All these can be part of the climate solution.",
    "Sri Lankan businesses can shift to climate smart dairy, or agriculture productivity, use of renewable energy, buildings with green standards, he said.",
    "\u201cWhen you do that, there are a lot of avenues opening up for businesses around the world. For example, EU has a bargaining channel for green growth [the European Green Deal], which can be a challenge for countries exporting to EU [like Sri Lanka].",
    "\u201cYou have to measure the amount of renewable energy used in the products. Mention the river basin where your plant is located, so if the river basin is polluted, your benefits or taxes can be pro-rated.",
    "\u201cThe brands who are importing from us are increasingly asking these conditions.\u201d",
    "Adaptation was also important to prepare companies, employees and clients to changes in climate. \u201cThen if somebody gets affected they can bounce back. It may be apparel, fisheries, agriculture, transport. All these things will have different options in adaptation and mitigation.\u201d",
    "More board members sensitive to climate change were also needed in businesses. \u201cWe would like to see more and more board directors coming into the climate science and mainstream it in business,\u201d Mallawatantri said.",
    "\u201cWe need industry clusters to come together and businesses to work together. Businesses need to understand that it is no longer business as normal. We need new skills that will help business.",
    "\u201cClimate change is everyone\u2019s business. None of the parties can solve it alone.\u201d (Colombo/Apr25/2024)"
