    "\u201cWhen I was young, a girl who got her first period was scared and frightened,\u201d Burkinabe grandmother Marie, 73, tells her daughter, Aminata, and teenage granddaughter, Nassiratou, 18 \u2013 who calls her grandma \u201cYaaba\u201d.",
    "The three women sit together beneath a tree in their village in west-central Burkina Faso, engaged in forming balls of seeds to make a condiment called soumbala. \u201cThe girl\u2019s mother would give her a sheepskin to sleep on until the bleeding stopped,\u201d confides Marie. \u201cAt that time, girls and women were isolated during their periods. They washed their sheepskin and protective cloths every day, which is why in the Moore language, we use the word \u2018washing\u2019 to refer to the time of menstruation.\u201d",
    "In Paraguay, 73-year-old grandmother Maria also shared her experience of periods with her daughter, Ester, 51, and 16-year-old granddaughter Alma, Ester\u2019s niece.\u00a0\u201cWe didn\u2019t use to talk about it,\u201d Maria says. \u201cWe, in secret, had to deal with it and there were no sanitary pads or anything. You had to use cloths, wash and iron them.\u201d",
    "Maria, 73 (right), with her daughter, Ester, 51 (left), and granddaughter, Alma, 16 (centre) in Paraguay [Plan International]",
    "On any given day, in all corners of the world, about 300 million women and girls are having their periods, according to a report by a collection of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) advocating for investment in menstrual health.. At the same time, one in four lack access to menstrual health products or clean toilets reserved for girls, according to a report by the social change non-profit advisory group, FSG.",
    "Some are forced to use materials such as old newspapers, rags, earth, sand, ash, grass or leaves to manage their periods \u2013 like grandmother Bui Non in Cambodia, who, as a young girl, used pieces of a sarong as makeshift sanitary towels. \u201cI cut the fabric into pieces,\u201d Bui Non, 57, says. \u201cAfter a week, I buried or burnt those fabrics.\u201d",
    "Taboos, stigma and myths from long ago still abound in many rural communities around the world, with a culture of silence and shame often surrounding the issue of menstruation. Beninese grandmother Angel remembers how women in her day were not allowed to cook over a fire or serve food to their fathers if they were menstruating.",
    "For Inna, a Togolese grandmother, things were even more challenging. \u201cThe family had to find a room on the roadside where the menstruating girl had to spend her entire period. Then, the family alerted the whole village.\u201d Still, in many communities, girls are excluded from everyday life and opportunities, especially school, when they are on their period.",
    "Nowadays, when girls are able to manage and talk about their periods, it is often down to longstanding community health projects working with girls and boys, women and men to encourage intergenerational dialogue to break down taboos and barriers about menstrual health. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of rights,\u201d says Inna\u2019s 16-year-old granddaughter, Denise, who \u2013 like all the teenagers in this article \u2013 participates in such a community project run by Plan International, a humanitarian organisation working to advance children\u2019s rights and equality for girls in 80 countries around the world.",
    "\u201cBefore, no head of the family would allow a discussion session like the one we\u2019re having today about menstruation in his family,\u201d agrees Aminata in Burkina Faso. \u201cThe change nowadays is clear.\u201d",
    "Marie, 76, in Burkina Faso, demonstrates the type of cloth she was forced to use as a young girl when she had her periods [Plan International]",
    "In the past, women in Burkina Faso used a thick, traditional, cotton cloth called Faso Danfani to manage their periods, which, says 76-year-old grandmother, Marie, often caused irritation between the thighs. By the time her daughter Aminata got her period, a newer, cheaper industrial wax fabric was available. \u201cOur mothers gave us pieces of cloth to protect ourselves,\u201d explains Aminata, \u201cand that was it; we didn\u2019t talk about it any more.\u201d At first, Aminata found talking about periods to her own daughter awkward \u2013 \u201cbecause we were both ashamed\u201d, she says, laughing. \u201cNow, we still talk about it with a little embarrassment, but thanks to the awareness sessions, we\u2019ve understood that menstruation is completely normal, and it\u2019s important to talk about it.\u201d",
    "Aminata (right) says at first she was ashamed to discuss menstrual health with her teenage daughter, Nassiratou (left). Now, she realises menstruation is a natural process and ought to be openly discussed [Plan International]",
    "As she speaks, Aminata is helping her daughter, Nassi, 18, who calls her \u201cM\u2019maa\u201d, lift a large basket onto her head. It is not particularly heavy but Burkinabe women traditionally help each other put things on their heads, symbolising solidarity and togetherness.",
    "\u201cIn my community, a woman on her period who takes proper precautions can do whatever she wants and go wherever she wants,\u201d says Nassiratou. Not all the taboos have been lifted: \u201cHowever, she shouldn\u2019t cook for the Muslim fast, go to the mosque, touch the Quran, approach fetish altars, or touch certain traditional medicines.\u201d",
    "Nassi has her own toilet, and when she needs sanitary pads, she asks her mother for money to buy them. \u201cToday\u2019s discussion has brought me a lot, because it allowed me to travel through three generations \u2013 my grandmother\u2019s, my mother\u2019s, and mine. Before, I was ashamed to talk about periods with my mother, but now I\u2019m comfortable. I can even talk about it with my grandmother!\u201d",
    "Assana, 24, (right) with her mother, Gnoussiado, 60, whom she calls \u2018Inami\u2019, and her grandmother, Akoyiki, 80, whom she calls \u2018Afeno\u2019, in their village in Togo [Plan International]",
    "\u201cWhen I was young, girls who were on their periods were not allowed to prepare or serve food to their fathers,\u201d says Akoyiki. \u201cThat practice was known to everybody, and no girl would be accused of laziness or lack of respect for it.\u201d",
    "In the past, women in her village of Elavagnon in Togo used pieces of red cloth as sanitary pads, which were held in place by a string of pearls fastened around their waists.",
    "\u201cOnce the cloth was nice and tight, we felt very comfortable,\u201d says Assana\u2019s mother, Gnoussiado. \u201cIn our time, a girl on her period could not be seen by, or interact with men, with the exception of her husband. The girl on her period was not allowed to go out as she pleased.\u201d",
    "Though Assana, 24, admits girls still get teased if they have a stain on their clothes, things have changed for the better. \u201cWe wear pants and bras. For our generation, we\u2019re more comfortable thanks to disposable pads that can be bought everywhere. Even during our periods, we\u2019re able to do any kind of activities without worrying too much.\u201d",
    "Teenager Blanche, 18 (pictured right), with her grandmother, Angel, 80, (centre), and her mother, Pierrette, 42, (left), both of whom Blanche calls \u2018Dada\u2019, at home in Benin [Plan International]",
    "\u201cIt was difficult for me during my periods because I was afraid of staining my uniform,\u201d says Blanche, who attends a club in Benin run by Plan International, which teaches girls about menstrual health and encourages and facilitates intergenerational dialogue on the subject.",
    "\u201cMy school didn\u2019t have toilets adapted to the needs of girls, and I had to go home every time to freshen up. Several times I missed my lessons. The distance between the house and the school is not negligible, and it was difficult to commute each time.\u201d",
    "Grandmother Angel got her first period when she was 15. \u201cI spoke to my mum about it straight away, and she got me a piece of loincloth. You hung the piece of cloth on a belt of pearls around your waist. We usually reinforced the filling with another one.\u201d",
    "Angel, 80, pictured with her granddaughter, Blanche, 18, in Benin [Plan International]",
    "When Angel was young, it was forbidden for girls on their period to prepare food for their father. \u201cThe fathers made spiritual amulets to protect themselves and their families, but these items lost their powers when they came into contact with menstruating women.",
    "\u201cGirls were also forbidden from handling fire during their periods \u2013 that is, cooking, because of the risk of bleeding too much. We were careful not to get too close to the fire, it was too strong. We were also careful not to eat too much sugar or fat.\u201d",
    "In contrast, Angel\u2019s daughter, Pierrette, who is now 42, was allowed to cook for the whole family, though many myths remained, and she avoided going out during her period \u2013 often for practical reasons. \u201cWhen I tried to walk a long distance, I got injuries between my thighs caused by the fabric padding rubbing against my skin, which was painful and very annoying.\u201d",
    "Seila, 13, (right) with her mother, Sokna, 35, (left) and her grandmother, Bui Non, 57 (centre) in Siem Reap province, Cambodia [Plan International]",
    "\u201cWe didn\u2019t have sanitary pads in my day,\u201d says Bui Non, 57, who lives in Cambodia, \u201cso I cut fabric from a sarong into pieces. I washed them to reuse for only a week. After a week, I buried or burnt those fabrics \u2013 unlike now, where you can easily buy and use sanitary pads.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhen my daughter had her period, I kept telling her to clean herself and use fabric as a pad. If she felt sick, I\u2019d help by doing skin coining once per period \u2013 we rub balm into the chest, back and shoulders until red is seen. This could relieve the pain.\u201d",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t have access to sanitary pads when I was Seila\u2019s age,\u201d says Sokna, 35, whose daughter is 13. \u201cI used soft fabric by cutting a skirt, a sarong or shorts. The hard fabric could burn my thighs, making me feel uncomfortable and sweaty. I took a shower three times daily to feel fresh.\u201d",
    "Seila, 13, picks beans near her home in Siem Reap province, Cambodia [Plan International]",
    "Teenager Seila learned about periods from different sources, including watching videos and reading posts online, as well as from her grandmother. \u201cI feel comfortable discussing menstruation with my close friends, but I haven\u2019t discussed menstruation with any male family members or friends yet. I feel embarrassed about it.\u201d",
    "Rahamatu, 19, (right) with her mother, \u2018mama\u2019 Sakina, (left) and her grandmother, also Rahamatu but known as \u2018Kaka\u2019, 58, (centre), at home in Bauchi, Nigeria [Plan International]",
    "Nigerian grandmother Rahamtatu, 58 \u2013 also known as \u201cKaka\u201d in her family \u2013 says: \u201cIn the past, mothers were often afraid to tell fathers when their daughters were menstruating, because some fathers wouldn\u2019t understand, and might even blame the girls for doing something wrong, as if we were chasing men and boys.",
    "\u201cSome husbands would even avoid their wives when they were menstruating. Some wouldn\u2019t eat their wives\u2019 food, but nowadays, husbands are more understanding. There\u2019s still room for more awareness and acceptance, especially for the younger generation.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn my time, I couldn\u2019t discuss my condition with anyone,\u201d Kaka\u2019s daughter, Sakina, says. \u201cWe had to wash the cloth we used, but nowadays, with the availability of sanitary pads, there\u2019s no need for washing. They simply use and dispose of them, and this is a noticeable change.",
    "\u2018Some girls couldn\u2019t attend school because of their periods but we got sanitary pads at school, which was a big deal\u2019.

    "Sakina\u2019s daughter, Rahamatu, receives sanitary pads at school as part of a Plan International project. \u201cBefore, when girls got their period, we\u2019d help each other out and use a clean cloth like our school head tie or wrapper,\u201d says Rahamatu, who is a peer educator for the project, and visits other girls and their families to talk to them about menstruation.",
    "\u201cSome girls couldn\u2019t attend school because of their periods, but thanks to the project, we got sanitary pads at school, which was a big deal. I\u2019m much more confident talking about menstruation now. My friends are excited too.\u201d",
    "\u2018We were told we couldn\u2019t eat tomatoes, fish, eggs or lemons\u2019. Paz, 80, (left), with her daughter, Ana, 47, and granddaughter, Hazel, 18, at home in Chalatenango, El Salvador [Plan International]",
    "\u201cSo as not to suffer later, we couldn\u2019t eat tomatoes, fish, eggs or lemons,\u201d laughs grandmother Paz, 80, chatting at home with her granddaughter, Hazel, 18, and her daughter, Ana, 47, in Chalatenango, El Salvador. \u201cAfter the period, yes, we could eat whatever we wanted. My mum used to tell me that I couldn\u2019t go to the river because the water would enter through the pores and that was bad, so what you used to do was to use old clothes, cut them into strips, and fold them. After being used, they were burned.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe project was very impactful on my life as a girl,\u201d says Hazel, a peer educator for Plan International\u2019s project in Chalatenango called Power of Red Butterflies. \u201cI was taught about my body, and they explained to me about my first period, my menstrual cycle and how to be prepared for that moment. We were a little group of girls, and it was very special, the trusting and sharing of ideas.\u201d",
    "Denise, 16, talks to her mother, Esther, 36, and grandmother, Inna, 72, about menstrual health in central Togo [Plan International]",
    "Menstruation was long a taboo subject in this village in central Togo, where 16-year-old Denise, talking to her grandmother Inna, 72, whom she calls Dada, and her mum, Esther, 36, whom she calls Mon\u2019do, takes part in a Plan International community education and awareness-raising project about menstrual health. The project tackles gender discrimination and stigma, and offers practical support for girls to access menstrual products.",
    "\u201cAs the period approached, the girl had to prepare for it by secretly buying products like talcum powder, body ointment, and a comb,\u201d explains Inna about life when she was a young girl. \u201cOn the first day of her period, we had to hide and call our mother or one of our sisters to help in secret. It was forbidden to enter the house.",
    "Denise, 16, (right), with her grandmother Inna, 72, (centre), whom she calls Dada, and her mum, Esther, 36, whom she calls Mon\u2019do [Plan International]",
    "In her day, Inna would wear pieces of cloth wound around beads as a sanitary pad. \u201cFor four days, from morning to night, the village brought food to the girl out of goodwill. Children came to spend time with the girl. During the day, all the girls of menstruation age would go to the river and bring water for her. In the evenings, girls and boys would visit her and pass the time talking, eating, singing and having fun with her.",
    "\u201cMen and boys, even if they were your brothers, were not supposed to see menstruation cloths. It was forbidden, and we carefully hid them.\u201d",
    "A ceremonial laundry session would mark the end of the girl\u2019s period, and, with her friends, the girl would cover herself with talcum powder to re-enter the village. \u201cAmong the group, some of the older ones tried to escape from the rule,\u201d laughs Inna. \u201cWe had to run after them to make sure everyone got the talcum powder.",
    "\u201cBack home, the family of the girl brought us white rice with peanut sauce, and every girl who\u2019d been to the river would bring a bowl from her house to get rice, and drink. On the fifth day, the girl who\u2019d finished her period took a good bath, wore beautiful traditional cloths and pretty beads.\u201d",
    "\u201cI understand that my mother\u2019s generation suffered a lot,\u201d says teenager Denise. \u201cFor me, if I don\u2019t have enough money for pads, I buy a few of these reusable sanitary napkins, which I can wash and dry in the sun when necessary. My wish is that the price of reusable pads be reduced. They\u2019re too expensive.\u201d",
    "Grandmother, Halima, 58, (centre) with her daughter, Deiya, 41, (right) and granddaughter Faulat, 21, in Nairobi, Kenya [Lorenzo Maccotta/Plan International]",
    "In Nairobi, Kenya, Faulat, 21, calls her grandmother, Halima, 58, \u201cShosho\u201d. \u201cIn the olden days, periods were shameful,\u201d says Halima. \u201cA girl would lock herself in for days without going to school, until it was over.",
    "\u201cThe modern children are hard-headed. There is a difference. They just do not care during their periods. They do not respect their cycle as we used to. We were very secretive about it, unlike them.\u201d",
    "\u201cDuring our time, we were also ashamed,\u201d says Faulat\u2019s mum, Deiya. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even pass near a boyfriend. Nowadays, this generation doesn\u2019t take it as a big issue. It\u2019s seen as something very normal. But for me, when I\u2019m on my periods, I don\u2019t like it. I\u2019d rather relax and stay at home.\u201d",
    "Faulat, 21. \u2018She really cried,\u2019 her mum, Deiya, says when Faulat got her first period [Plan International]",
    "Faulat\u2019s mum was able to support her when she got her first period. \u201cShe really cried,\u201d admits Deiya, \u201cbut we sat her down and talked to her, and she got to understand, but she was still afraid.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt caught me off guard,\u201d admits Faulat. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared. It came just like a sickness.\u201d",
    "In 2020, having had a difficult time coping with her periods, Faulat joined Kibera Joy, a Plan International partnership which supports girls with information, and sanitary pads. \u201cIt\u2019s very open and you\u2019re told things openly,\u201d says Faulat. \u201cBefore, I used to buy sanitary towels, but sometimes my mother didn\u2019t have the means, and she\u2019d tell me to use pieces of cloth. At Kibera Joy, you may go for the pads at any time you wish.\u201d",
