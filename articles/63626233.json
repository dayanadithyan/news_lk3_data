    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka leftist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s recent high-profile visit to India was on a routine invitation generally extended to eminent persons from other countries and not at all unusual, according to Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha.",
    "The high commissioner told EconomyNext on the sidelines of an event in Colombo on Tuesday March 05 that the invitation was part of a visitation scheme by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, an autonomous organisation of the Government of India, involved in India\u2019s global cultural relations, through cultural exchange with other countries and their people.",
    "\u201cIt was a normal invitation to a Sri Lankan leader. We have a scheme, by which we bring business leaders, political leaders and cultural leaders from other countries to India, called the Distinguished Visitors Programme of the Indian Council for Cultural Relation. It was under that scheme that he was invited,\u201d said Jha.",
    "Asked if other presidential candidates from Sri Lanka can also expect an invitation, the high commissioner said other candidates have visited India before and if they were to visit it wouldn\u2019t be their first time in the country.",
    "\u201cBut if they were willing to come, they\u2019re most welcome,\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake\u2019s invitation was rather high-profile, however, with India\u2019s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar meeting him for a discussion. Commenting on this, Jha said: \u201cA leader from Sri Lanka of a large political party gets received by senior ministers in the government. Always.\u201d",
    "Dissanayake\u2019s visit to India made waves in Sri Lanka, inviting comments \u2014 not all of them kind \u2014 from Sri Lanka\u2019s political establishment. Both Dissanayake and the National People\u2019s Power (NPP), the leftist formation that he leads, has been consistently leading at least one voting intention poll.",
    "Sri Lanka is constitutionally required to hold its presidential election between September 17 and October 17. (Colombo/Mar05/2024)"
