    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s United National Party (UNP) has called for a referendum to postpone both presidential and parliamentary elections by two years to extend President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s term to continue ongoing economic reforms.",
    "UNP general secretary Palitha Range Bandara called on the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the leftist opposition formation National People\u2019s Power (NPP) to support the move.",
    "At a press conference on Tuesday May 28, Bandara said postponing the two elections would not be undemocratic as it would be the result of elected representatives in parliament passing a motion, followed by a referendum.",
    "Update: The government has distanced itself from a statement by President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party (UNP) calling for delaying elections by two years.",
    "Sri Lanka govt distances itself from UNP call for postponing electionsSee more",
    "Defending the proposal, he recalled the controversial decision by then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike to postpone elections in the 1970s, which resulted in the decimation of her Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)-led alliance.",
    "Bandara said that all parties must understand that now is not the time for elections as the economy has yet to emerge from bankruptcy and that President Wickremesinghe must be permitted to carry out his reforms which have already brought stability.",
    "The UNP\u2019s latest statement is a far cry from its pronouncements as recently as last weekend that the presidential election would definitely be held between September 17 and October 18 this year, followed by the parliamentary elections in early 2025.",
    "UNP spokesmen also boasted that Wickremesinghe would not only contest the presidential poll but would also win it.",
    "Tourism and Sports Minister Harin Fernando told reporters that Wickremesinghe would definitely contest the election, in response to some speculation that the president may opt to sit out.",
    "\u201cI think President Wickremesinghewill himself reveal his plans next week or one of these days,\u201d said Fernando.",
    "\u201cHe will definitely contest. I said he would for sure. Not only will he contest, he will also win,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cPresident Wickremesinghe will definitely win the election,\u201d he said, adding that the president has provided much relief and that the economy continues to recover having fallen to its lowest point. (Colombo/May28/2024)"
