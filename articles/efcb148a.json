    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s military and the Civil Defence Force, city authorities are monitoring 300 trees in the capital Colombo, as pouring rain and gusting winds brings down large trees, State Minister for Defense Premitha Bandara Tennakoon said.",
    "Colombo, sometimes known as the Garden City of Asia has beautiful trees, some dating back to the British period and brought from around the world.",
    "\u201cWithin the Colombo Municipal Council city limits, there are 100,000 trees. Of these, around 300 are considered high risk,\u201d Tennakoon told reporters at a media conference to raise awareness about the current disaster management situation.",
    "Not all trees required to be cut down he said. \u201cWe can trim some of the branches and retain them.\u201d",
    "The problem was that buildings in the vicinity of the tree had cut branches on one side, causing it to become unbalanced, the minister said.",
    "New laws would be brought in so provincial/municipal institutions could strengthen enforcement of building codes.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a single institution that can issue a warning about a tree. Not one to tell us what trees can or cannot be planted near a road.",
    "\u201cTrees should be suitable for the area. Some trees have roots that spread and damage roads, buildings. When the roots can\u2019t go deep, they tend to topple over.",
    "\u201cNow Environment Day is coming up, and anyone can go plant a tree by the road. We have to take a decision about this. We have to enforce laws strongly in future.\u201d (Colombo/June3/2024)"
