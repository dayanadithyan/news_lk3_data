    "\u201cWe hope to give new life to politics,\u201d Jayasekara said addressing the media yesterday. According to him, it is evident that a program based on humanity is the need of the hour to revive the country.",
    "The SLFP MP affirmed that the new alliance would align with the SLFP and said that he would readily accept the position of General Secretary of the SLFP once more if requested by SLFP Chairman Maithripala Sirisena.",
    "Jayasekara clarified that his leadership in forming the alliance is not driven by aspirations of becoming the President of Sri Lanka, but rather by the intention to support the candidate best positioned to succeed in the elections.",
    "However, he also expressed that if invited by all parties supporting the alliance to contest as a presidential candidate, he would accept the challenge.",
    "Jayasekara extended an invitation to anyone willing to rally around a set of clear policies rather than personalities and reject racism to join the alliance and contribute to addressing the issues faced by the people."
