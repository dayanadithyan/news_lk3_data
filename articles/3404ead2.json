    "(Excerpted from Saris and Grapefruit, a collection of short stories by Rukmini Attygalle)",
    "Rupa Jayasena gazed intently on the vista below, as she sat in the front veranda of her home, high up on the hill of Hanthana, overlooking the Peradeniya University\u2019s green campus scattered with trees and bushes in bloom. She could discern within the meticulously landscaped terrain the Peradeniya-Galaha road winding its way to Getambe and beyond. She would sit in the veranda all afternoon with frequent cups of tea and watch the young men and women walking between their residential halls and lecture rooms, clutching books and files. They were in happy groups; or couples absorbed with each other; or hurrying single students.",
    "But now her fading eyes could not pick out details; she only discerned blurred green, dotted with coloured smudges. Her memory, however, carried a scene of beauty and that imbued the indistinct view, so it brought joy to her. Even the domba tree in her own garden had lost definition. She could only make out the general shape of the majestic tree, the dark green of the leaves but not their sheen.",
    "As she sat in her wheelchair, enjoying the bird song and fresh evening breeze that wafted across her face, she tried to accept the fact that she was gradually losing her sight.",
    "She was 88-years old and subject to the frailties of advanced years. Her arthritic joint pains, her swollen feet, her diminishing ability to balance, bound her to the wheelchair and reliance on carers. What bothered her most, however, was a lurking dread that she was, perhaps, losing her memory too. Sometimes her mind was sharp and her thoughts clear; at other times she felt a vague sense of unease not knowing exactly where she was and who she was speaking with.",
    "Her consciousness seemed to be slipping in and out of her mind. She was aware of this and clung to it because awareness, she was told, was a prevention to memory, loss. Sometimes she could not discern the time lapse between events. Often certain past events came up in her mind, but when they had occurred, or how, were lost. Memories flashed through, her mind as independent entities, with no connection to the rest of her life. She was losing control and she hated it. She knew she, was going downhill for sure, but the hill was not steep enough to gather speed. The descent was grindingly and painfully slow.",
    "\u201cNona, better come in now. We must close the doors and windows before the mosquitoes enter,\u201d said Soma. Soma had been in Rupa\u2019s employment for 40 years and was now part of the family. She and Menika were Rupa\u2019s carers; well-paid and seen to by her son, Ajith.",
    "As Rupa was wheeled indoors, she noticed someone standing by the dining table with a cup in hand. Rupa turned her head back to ask Soma who it was.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s Menika, Nona, the other person who looks after you. She has made you a nice cup of soup.\u201d",
    "\u201cShe has been here for some time, Nona. She is very fond you.\u201d The two women exchanged looks of sympathetic understanding.",
    "\u201cAh! Yes, of course,\u201d Rupa sighed, \u201cswitch on the lights, will you. I couldn\u2019t recognize her in the dark.\u201d",
    "Rupa\u2019s eyes rested on a basket of orchids on the sideboard. \u201cFrom where are these orchids? They look beautiful.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhy, Nona, they were sent last week by Ranjini Madam for your birthday,\u201d Soma explained patiently.",
    "\u201cYour daughter, Nona, your daughter who lives in England.\u201d \u201cAh! Yes. My daughter lives in England.\u201d She paused for a few seconds and continued, \u201cHer son is ill, Kelle, very ill, I am so sad. I can\u2019t help her at all.\u201d",
    "Although her mind meandered without course or direction, the thought of her grandson\u2019s illness stuck like a barnacle in some recess of her mind, not to be easily prised out. This particular memory, often came linked to her memory of her daughter\u2019s illness with meningitis during her childhood. The agony she had suffered at the time was indelibly stamped in her mind. These memories kept resurfacing periodically; while they emerged and submerged, they were never completely lost. They hovered in the background of a fog of temporary forgetfulness.",
    "Rupa took a sip from the bowl the woman Menika offered her. She liked her karapincha soup, she relished its pungent flavour.",
    "\u201cHow can you help Ranjini Madam, Nona,\u201d Soma continued the conversation. \u201cYou are not well yourself. Anyway, Ranjan Baba will get the best medical care over there. Don\u2019t worry, Nona.\u201d",
    "Rupa\u2019s memories slowly tapered down to nothingness. She is back in the present moment. She looks at her swollen feet and tries to wiggle her toes.",
    "\u201cWater retention, water retention,\u201d she mutters to herself. She hears the sound of a gecko bad omen, bad omen. Suddenly, the purple orchids on the side-board jogs a memory.",
    "\u201cKelle, what happened to the pot of African violets? It used to be in the veranda. I haven\u2019t seen them for some time.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat African violets, Nona? We haven\u2019t had African violets for a long time.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhy not?\u201d Rupa sounded annoyed. \u201cThe African violet pot Loku Mahattaya brought me for my birthday? They were always in bloom, remember? We used to keep them in the veranda so they would get the morning sun.\u201d",
    "Soma did not want to remind Rupa that her husband was dead 15 years. She loved her Nona and always avoided causing her distress. So, she changed the direction of their conversation.",
    "\u201cPodi Mahattaya called this afternoon to find out how you are getting on. He wanted me to call his friend, Vijita Mahattaya and ask him to get your blood pressure checked. He did not want me to disturb your afternoon nap. He also asked me to tell you that Nishard Baba has got a place in Oxford University. Anyway, he is going to call you tomorrow morning.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhere is Ajith? Where is Podi Mahattaya? Is he in Oxford? He did not tell me that he was going to England! Good if he is there, he can be of help to Ranjini Madam. She must be so worried and",
    "unhappy\u2026\u201d The sad memory was about to resurface when Soma interrupted.",
    "\u201cNo, Nona, Podi Mahattaya is working in Dubai. He has to work very hard now to educate the two boys and to take care of us. He is so good, Nona, he makes sure that we have everything we need. He is always phoning to find out how we are.\u201d",
    "\u201cYes, Kella.\u201d Rupa sighed deeply. Tears welled in her eyes. \u201cHe has always been a caring and loving child. He \u2026 he \u2026\u201d and her voice trailed off. Her tears dried. Something was gnawing at her; something sad but not identifiable. Rupa was back in her depressive apathy.",
    "Ajith Jayasena, structural engineer, worked in Dubai. When he realized that both his sons showed academic ability from their young age, he was determined to give them the best education money could buy. Although he enjoyed his work in Sri Lanka and life in his place of birth, he soon realized that there was no way he could give the boys a foreign education unless he got a much better-paid job overseas.",
    "Dubai was developing and expanding rapidly. High-rise buildings, luxury hotels, new roads and motorways, were coming up at an amazing speed. Dubai was calling out for engineering skills worldwide, and Ajith procured a job well paid and with prospects.",
    "\u201cI am so happy, Putha,\u201d Rupa had exclaimed when she heard of his new employment. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for you and your family. Send the two little professors to a good international school over there. They will prepare the boys for higher education.\u201d",
    "Ajith remembered how proud his mother was of the two boys she named \u2018My little professors.\u2019 She had been a teacher, at first in Girls\u2019 High School, Kandy, and later privately tutored undergraduates in English; improvement in English skills being a priority of the rural students. As a schoolboy, Ajith\u2019s homework was supervised by her. He would often exclaim in exasperation,,, \u201cAmma, you are such a hard taskmaster. Even the teachers at college are not as wicked as you!\u201d",
    "\u201cOf course, with a lazy and crafty son like you, I have no choice.\u201d Rupa would shout out and sometimes her voice rose. But the invisible vibrations of love that accompanied the scream pulverized and dispersed any anger or resentment that involuntarily rose in the son.",
    "He loved his mother so much that it pained him to see her succumb to old age. He knew it was inevitable, but that did not reduce his pain of mind. He wished he could be with her constantly, because he knew that his presence always cheered and comforted her. They would tease each other incessantly but there was no question about the depth of the maternal-filial love they shared. Despite her age, the mother-child bond was still very strong.",
    "Ajith felt she needed him the most now and needed him close at hand, sharing her pain, her frustration, empathizing with her feeling of incapability, showing her how much he loved her. It would make a difference to his mother, and to him too. But he had his duty by his family: his sons\u2019 welfare had to supersede his mother\u2019s need of him. Of course, there were the flying visits; but these were inadequate. He had to carry on working at his lucrative job to support his sons, his wife and his mother. A deep anxiety was building up within him; especially as he remembered his last visit home.",
    "\u201cHello Amma!\u201d He had exclaimed, walking toward her with open arms. She had been sitting in her wheelchair in the living I room with a magazine on her lap. She looked up at him blankly. Maybe she had gone blind, he surmised, with alarm. He knew her sight was failing. But when she failed to recognize his voice, he knew it was something graver than her hearing.",
    "\u201cAmma,\u201d he cried, choking with emotion. \u201cI am here to see you.\u201d He bent down, kissed her and took her hand in his. There was no response. His fists clenched and he experienced a lightening in his chest.",
    "Had they lost her? Had she left them and ensconced herself in a world beyond their reach?",
    "\u201cAre you the doctor?\u201d Rupa hesitatingly asked. \u201cYou know, doctor, my joints are becoming extremely painful. Can you give me some pain killer?\u201d",
    "Ajith brushed away the tears gathered in his eyes with the back of his hand. Just then Soma entered, wiping her hands in a dish cloth.",
    "\u201cPodi Mahattaya!\u201d she exclaimed joyfully. \u201cWhat a surprise. When did you come? You never told us you were coming. You\u2019ll stay for lunch, right? I will make your favourite ambulthial. Menika just returned with some fresh thora maalu.\u201d",
    "It was after this welcoming burst that Soma noticed Rupa\u2019s blank expression and Alith\u2019s despondency.",
    "\u201cNona, Ajith Mahattaya your son is here to see you. He has come all the way from Dubai. Isn\u2019t it wonderful? He is looking good, no?\u201d",
    "He noticed a flicker in Rupa\u2019s tired eyes. She now focused them fully on Ajith\u2019s face a furrow deepening between her eyebrows. Crows\u2019 feet at the outer corners of her eyes wrinkled as she peered deep into his eyes. Recognition was beginning to dawn.",
    "\u201cAh! Yes, of course!\u201d Her face lit up with joy. \u201cAjith Putha, it\u2019s lovely to see you! Did you forget to shave this morning?\u201d Ajith sighed with relief. She was back with them. She was back to her normal self, or almost. But the question was for how long?",
    "Ajith pushed aside the papers on his desk and reached for the phone. After just two rings Ranjini answered her mobile phone. \u201cNangi, how is Ranjan?\u201d",
    "\u201cNot so good.\u201d She did not want to disturb the other patients in the ward, nor did she want her son to hear the conversation. So, she moved out to the corridor.",
    "\u201cHe is not responding to the chemotherapy.\u201d Ranjini\u2019s voice was breaking not because of a bad telephone connection, but because she couldn\u2019t get the words out. Between suppressed sobs, Ranjini explained the full extent of her son\u2019s illness.",
    "\u201cHe is really suffering, Aiya. He even asked me if he can\u2019t be given an injection to die! I simply don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d The knot in Ajith\u2019s gut tightened. \u201cWhat about the experimental drugs they told you about?\u201d",
    "\u201cYes, Aiya, but they also warned me of the risks. There is a chance of an adverse reaction. Ranjan may not pull through. The suffering may be severe. I don\u2019t know what decision to make. Should I say \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. I wish Amma was here.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat choice do you have, Nangi\u2019? The new drug may work. I think you should go for it. We just have to hope and pray. What about Upali \u2013 what does he say?\u201d",
    "\u201cOh! Upali!\u201d Ranjini heaved a sigh. \u201cHe breezes in and out of the hospital to mark the register! He is fully absorbed now with his new family. He says the decision should be mine as I have custody over Ranjan.\u201d She paused. \u201cDo you really think I should go for the new drug?\u201d",
    "\u201cOK then\u2026\u201d Her voice trailed, ending almost inaudibly. Then died, picked up and queried,",
    "\u201cHow is Amma? How was she when you last saw her? I feel so bad that I haven\u2019t been to see her for so long. But, you know, AIya\u2026",
    "\u201cOf course, you can\u2019t leave your son. He needs you and Amma fulIy understands. She was OK when I last saw her. Her arthritis is playing up a bit but \u2026\u201d",
    "\u201cDid she recognize you? Soma said that at times she does not know whom she is talking to.\u201d",
    "\u201cNo, no, she was OK. She even joked with me about not having shaved.\u201d Ajith tried to laugh it off. Ranjini did not detectt its falsity and seemed relieved. But deep down, she knew her mother was on the decline. She wanted so much to see her and give her some comfort. But what could she do?",
    "After the call, Ranjini returned to her son\u2019s bedside. The doctors were due any moment. The curtains that made a cubicle around her son\u2019s bed were drawn providing privacy. She felt hemmed in, trapped, suffocated by the central heating. The smell of disinfectant and the clinical ambience oppressed her. She longed to go out of doors, out of the hospital to breathe fresh air, fill her lungs with it, feel the cool breeze on her face, brush off the falling leaves from her shoulders and smell the autumn air.",
    "She had made up her mind to inform the doctors she agreed to the experimental drug being administered to her son. She suddenly felt herself jolt. Was she signing Ranjan\u2019s death warrant? Surely, surely not! As her brother had said, this was the only chance to save her son, fraught with risk though it was. This decision had to be made. A black ponderous heaviness seemed to descend on her. Its gloom engulfed her. Her entire body trembled. But an inner strength pushed her mind and body to regain normalcy. It seemed as if some outside force entered her body to make her strong so she could face the ordeal looming close ahead of her.",
    "When she told the doctors, she was willing to take the risk of the new drug, they welcomed her decision. \u201cYes, Mrs Soysa, that is the only chance your son has. We will do our very best for him. We know what a heavy burden it has been for you to decide, but you have done right.\u201d",
    "Ranjini signed the consent form with trembling hand and racing heart. Her sharply focused, fearful mind and doubting thoughts slowly dissipated once the form was taken away. Mixed with the harrowing worry over her son, was an image of her mother that kept intruding. It was as if a raw nerve tingled. She sat back and assessed her situation. It was dire. Her son was dying in one part of the world and in another was her gradually but surely declining mother. She was boxed in the middle, loving both, caring for both and fearful for both.",
    "She realized this was karma vipaka. A past negative karma had caught up with her and made her a victim. She also realized that this could also change; a good karma of the past might surface and mercifully lighten her present stress and douse the danger. She had to accept it all with equanimity, she decided with resignation.",
    "Ranjini continued to sit beside her son\u2019s bed, with these and other thoughts swirling in her mind. The ward matron tiptoed to her. \u201cWe will be moving the patient to a single room Room 1032 on the same floor. He will settle down and feel better when you visit in the evening.\u201d",
    "She was exhausted; she needed to go home, shower and rest before returning. She kissed her sleeping son, whispered a blessing and tiptoed out of the ward.",
    "Ajith was anxious to know how Ranjan was responding to the first dose of the test drug.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell,\u201d Ranjini replied with hope in her voice. They say his condition is stable and there has been a slight positive reaction. But three more doses and then more scans and blood tests will give us an indication of how matters are progressing. I just live in hope, Aiya.\u201d",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, Nangi, things will work out. My friend, Vijita has arranged for a senior monk of the Dalada Maligawa to conduct pirith chanting daily until Ranjan takes a turn for the better. That will surely help. He is also doing a bodhi pooja. You just spread metta while being with Ranjan, and even at home. Pirith vibrations do have a powerful and positive effect. So, cheer up, girl! If you can,\u201d he added.",
    "A few days later, Vijita called Ajith from Peradeniya. \u201cMachang, your Amma has gone down with a chest infection and I have entered her to the Kandy Hospital. She seems to be getting weaker by the day. Maybe you should come over.\u201d",
    "Ajith took the earliest available flight to Sri Lanka. He decided not to inform Ranjini until he assessed their mother\u2019s condition. Going home to drop his suitcase, he found Soma distraught.",
    "\u201cMahattaya, our Nona is very ill. She does not recognize anyone, even me. However bad her memory had become she always knew who I was. You see, I have always been with her, never left her alone.\u201d This deterioration of her mistress affected Soma badly. It stung like a hundred debaras and nibbled into her like a hundred kadiyas.",
    "Rupa was conscious of a struggle going on within her, as though her life force was trying to liberate itself from the restraining clutches of her physical body. She drifted momentarily out of consciousness but was soon aware of her body and mind. She felt her body jerk once, twice, thrice and then relax. She lay very still as though dead but not quite dead. Her breathing turned shallow, not laboured. Minute by minute, drip by drip, her life was ebbing away. She was no longer in pain. Not wanting to struggle to live, she just let her life slip away. She clung to nothing. She gradually became aware of a deep, deep peace envelope her being.",
    "She opened her eyes and saw Ajith standing by her bedside. She looked direct into his eyes. In that instant Ajith knew his mother had regained her memory and was fully conscious of what was going on. Her eyes were windows to her inner being. He saw in them a calm acceptance and a deep serenity. She gave him a beautiful smile. He held her hand firmly, hoping his energy would flow into her.",
    "\u201cPutha,\u201d she whispered, barely audible. He bent down and placed his ear near her lips. \u201cI am fine, Putha just let me go.\u201d Ajith kissed his mother\u2019s forehead and continued holding her hand, more gently now. He lightly stroked her arm with his other hand and chanted a stanza of pirith. While there was an underlying sadness, there was also much comfort in the acceptance of her end and the knowledge that his mother was now at peace no longer trapped in a painful decaying body.",
    "He rang for the resident doctor who came immediately and confirmed that the patient had died.",
    "Ajith went out of the room after a last farewell and phoned his sister.",
    "\u201cNangi, Amma just passed away. It was very peaceful. She looks so serene. She told me just before she breathed her last, that she was fine and relieved of all pain.\u201d",
    "\u201cYes,\u201d Ranjini continued, after a short pause. He heard her deep breathing, but no sob.",
    "\u201cI was sitting by Ranjan\u2019s bed. I was tired, so I lay my head on the edge of the bed. Maybe I dozed off; maybe I dreamed Perhaps my thoughts had gone to Amma in a dream-like state I was however conscious of me in hospital beside my son who was fast asleep. I heard the words Baby Girl and it was Amma\u2019s voice soft and clear. I distinctly heard this. I had forgotten that she used that name for me. That remembrance woke me, I sat up. And then I saw her standing by the door luminous, ethereal, beautiful. She had a lovely smile and her eyes were really bright I had never seen her so radiant.\u201d",
    "\u201c\u2018Ranji-Boy is going to be all right,\u2019 she said, and I heard het clearly. Her message penetrated my brain and I suddenly felt such optimism, and gratitude too. I told her I was sorry I could not visit her. She said, `I understand,\u2019 with such love in her voice. `I understand. I was a mother too.\u2019 Then she disappeared.\u201d",
    "There was silence from the other end of the telephone connection. \u201cAiya, are you there?\u201d",
    "\u201cI feel as if a huge dark cloud has lifted off me. I feel a great sense of relief, and funnily enough, gladness too.\u201d",
