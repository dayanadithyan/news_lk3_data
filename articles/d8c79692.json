  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Israeli military rescued four hostages in a special operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza, that Gazan authorities said killed 236 people and injured more than 400 others.",
    "Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv, were rescued by the Israeli military, intelligence and special forces from two separate locations in Nuseirat, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Saturday.",
    "All four were kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7.",
    "\u201cThey are in good medical condition and have been transferred to the \u2018Sheba\u2019 Tel-HaShomer Medical Center for further medical examinations,\u201d the IDF added.",
    "An Israeli policeman from a special counter-terrorism unit was killed in Saturday\u2019s rescue operation, according to Israeli police.",
    "News of the rescue came soon after Israel\u2019s military said it was operating in Nuseirat and other areas of central Gaza, where heavy shelling and artillery fire was reported.",
    "At least 236 people have been killed as a result of the rescue operation and more than 400 injured, hospital officials in Gaza said Saturday.",
    "The killed and wounded were taken to two hospitals in Gaza, Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah. Al-Awda Hospital director Dr Marwan Abu Nasser told CNN that 142 bodies had been counted at the medical facility by late Saturday, while Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah said 94 bodies had been counted.",
    "CNN has no way of verifying casualty numbers reported by Palestinian officials in Gaza. Medical records in the war-torn enclave do not differentiate between civilians and militants killed.",
    "An Israeli military spokesperson put the number of casualties from the operation at \u201cunder 100,\u201d and had no information on how many of those were civilians.",
    "Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israeli forces had to enter civilian areas to reach hostages as this was where Hamas had embedded itself.",
    "He said the hostages had been locked in two separate apartments in civilian multi-story buildings about 200 meters (650 feet) apart, with Argamani held in a different building to the three males. He said the IDF had received intelligence on their location beforehand, noting that hostages in Gaza were frequently moved around and Argamani had previously been held elsewhere. Similar raids had been called off at the last minute \u201cmore than three or four times\u201d due to unfavorable conditions, he added.",
    "The first phase of Saturday\u2019s operation saw the IDF target militant infrastructure with pre-planned strikes, Hagari said.",
    "For the rescue, the IDF had opted for a daytime operation because of the element of surprise, he added, and it had prepared by building models of the apartments the hostages were held in.",
    "Hagari said that the IDF had come under intense fire, especially after withdrawing from the apartments, but did not provide evidence for his claims.",
    "Saturday was an \u201cemotional and happy day for the state of Israel and the IDF,\u201d Hagari said, though he cautioned that most of the remaining hostages were not being held in conditions that would allow for similar operations.",
    "Following Saturday\u2019s announcement, the total number of hostages still held in the Gaza Strip from October 7 is now 116, of which at least 41 are dead.",
    "On the ground in Gaza, locals described scenes of carnage following the strikes that led up to the rescue.",
    "Nidal Abdo, was shopping in Nuseirat on Saturday when he described a \u201ccrazy bombardment\u201d hitting. \u201c[It was] something we never witnessed before, maybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell on the market,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThere are children torn apart and scattered in the streets, they wiped out Nuseirat, it is hell on earth,\u201d he said.",
    "Another local, Abu Abdallah, said the strike hit while people were sleeping, adding: \u201cDogs were eating people\u2019s remains. We pulled out six martyrs, all torn up children and women, we risked our lives to get them to the hospital.\u201d",
    "Footage from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital shows trucks and ambulances transferring injured people and bodies to the hospital. Inside the hospital, people can be seen waiting on the floor.",
    "Graphic video shows many Palestinians, including children, injured with blood on their faces and clothes. Footage from the hospital also shows people screaming and crying, huddled over bodies covered in blankets.",
    "Hamas described the operation as a \u201cbrutal crime, devoid of the values of civilization and humanity,\u201d saying the Israeli military \u201ccommitted a horrific massacre against innocent civilians.\u201d",
    "Hamas said the rescue would not change Israel\u2019s \u201cstrategic failure in the Gaza Strip,\u201d as the group still holds a large number of other hostages after eight months of fighting.",
    "The group\u2019s leader Ismail Haniyeh said, \u201cOur people will not surrender, and the resistance will continue to defend our rights in the face of this criminal enemy.\u201d",
    "Abu Obaida, the spokesman for the group\u2019s armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, also claimed some hostages had been killed during the rescue mission, but provided no proof and did not elaborate on the identities of who had purportedly died.",
    "In a post on Telegram, he said the rescue raid \u201cposed a great danger\u201d to the remaining hostages and \u201cwill have a devastating impact on their conditions and lives.\u201d",
    "Asked about the claim, the Israel Defense Forces said, \u201cHamas is a terrorist organization that uses psychological terrorism in order to achieve its goals, accordingly its statements should be taken with limited credibility.\u201d",
    "Hostage rescues are rare: this is only the third such successful operation. IDF Corporal Ori Megidish was rescued in October last year from the northern Gaza Strip. In another operation on February 12 this year, Fernando Marman and Louis Har were rescued from southern Rafah.",
    "One of the rescued group, 25-year-old Noa Argamani, became one of the symbols of the October 7 attacks, after video emerged of her shouting and pleading from the seat of a motorbike as a group of Hamas fighters drives away with her in tow.",
    "In the video, Argamani\u2019s boyfriend, fellow Israeli citizen Avinatan Or, is also led away by Hamas fighters.",
    "Noa\u2019s mother Liora Argamani is a Chinese citizen who has been grappling with late stage brain cancer. In a video released last November, she made a desperate plea to be able to see her daughter one more time.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have left. I wish for the chance to see my Noa at home,\u201d her mother said, calling on US President Joe Biden to push for her daughter\u2019s release.",
    "A spokesperson for Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv confirmed on Saturday that Argamani had been transferred there so that she could be treated alongside her mother.",
    "Argamani\u2019s family had previously received signs that she was still alive. She appeared in a series of Hamas propaganda videos released in January this year.",
    "Video showed Argamani embracing her father after her release. She also held a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who told her \u201cwe didn\u2019t give up on you for a moment.\u201d",

    "Relatives of the rescued hostages said they felt happy and blessed to be reunited with their loved ones but also called on the Israeli government to bring back the remaining captives.",
    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop hugging him,\u201d Orit Meir, mother of Almog Meir Jan, told a news conference Saturday. \u201cTomorrow is my birthday so I got my present.\u201d",
    "Meir thanked the Israeli military and government for the rescue, but also urged the government to secure the release of the dozens of captives that remained in Gaza.",
    "\u201cWe want a deal now. We want them to come back home as soon as possible,\u201d she said.",

    "Yaakov Argamani, father of Noa Argamani, added: \u201cWe can\u2019t forget there are 120 hostages. We must do everything, but everything, as soon as possible to bring them home, so that their families can embrace them in happiness.\u201d",
    "Rozi Ziv, mother of Shlomi Ziv, said, \u201cMy dream came true. I wish for the other hostages that their dreams will come true, too.\u201d",

    "Earlier, the crowd cheered the Israeli military for its rescue operation.",
