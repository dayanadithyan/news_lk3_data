  "original_body_lines": [
    "President Joe Biden is hosting Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II in Washington Monday and the two leaders are expected to discuss the ongoing effort to free hostages held in Gaza, and growing concern over a possible Israeli military operation in the port city of Rafah.",
    "It is the first meeting between the allies since three American troops were killed last month in a drone strike against a U.S. base in Jordan. Biden blamed Iran-backed militias for the fatalities, the first for the U.S. after months of strikes by such groups against American forces across the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.",
    "The meeting with King Abdullah II comes as Biden and his aides are working to broker another pause in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in order to send humanitarian aid and supplies into the region and get hostages out. The White House faces growing criticism from Arab-Americans over the administration\u2019s continued support for Israel in the face of growing casualties in Gaza.",
    "It appeared a deal for another pause in the fighting was getting close. A senior U.S. administration official said Sunday that after weeks of shuttle diplomacy and phone conversations, a framework was essentially in place for a deal that could see the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for a halt to fighting.",
    "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations, acknowledged that gaps remained but declined to specify what they are.",
    "The official said Israeli military pressure on Hamas in Khan Younis over the last several weeks has helped bring the militant group closer to accepting an agreement. The potential for an agreement took up the majority of Biden\u2019s call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
    "The official said the two leaders also had a significant back and forth about the potential expansion of Israeli military operations into Rafah and that Biden reiterated U.S. opposition to the idea under the \u201ccurrent conditions\u201d while more than 1.3 million people are sheltering there.",
    "It was the most forceful language yet from the president on the possible operation. Biden, who last week called Israel\u2019s military response in Gaza \u201cover the top,\u201d also sought \u201curgent and specific\u201d steps to strengthen humanitarian aid. Israel\u2019s Channel 13 television said the conversation lasted 45 minutes.",
    "The official said the Israelis \u201cmade clear they would not contemplate an operation\u201d in Rafah without safeguarding the civilian population. The official said the U.S. is not sure there is a feasible or implementable plan to relocate civilians out of Rafah to allow military operations to take place.",
    "Jordan and other Arab states have been highly critical of Israel\u2019s actions and have eschewed public support for long-term planning over what happens next, arguing that the fighting must end before such discussions can begin. They have been demanding a cease-fire since mid-October as civilian casualties began to skyrocket.",
    "Biden had planned to visit Jordan during his trip to Israel in October shortly after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, but the trip was scrapped. On his way home from Israel, Biden announced he\u2019d helped broker the first deal to pause fighting temporarily and to open the crossing in Rafah to humanitarian aid.",
    "In the months since, members of his administration have made repeated trips to the region to engage with leaders there."
