    "Sri Lanka\u2019s State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya stated that 464 complaints have been received so far with regard to Sri Lankan nationals involved in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.",
    "Furthermore, he highlighted the challenge of determining the exact number of Sri Lankans who have traveled to Russia to serve in the warfront as many individuals have taken indirect routes through India or Middle Eastern countries, complicating efforts to track direct departures from Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cHowever, we are currently addressing complaints from 464 individuals,\u201d he stated.",
    "The State Minister confirmed that compensation requests for those killed in the war have been acknowledged. \u201cThese individuals, after traveling to Russia, entered into agreements with the security forces to fight alongside the Russian army. Despite claims of unawareness, these agreements are legally binding,\u201d Balasuriya explained.",
    "He also noted the difficulty in contacting about 126 individuals. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are dead,\u201d he clarified, emphasizing the ongoing efforts to address and resolve the situation."
