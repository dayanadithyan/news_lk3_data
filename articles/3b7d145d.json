  "original_body_lines": [
    "China had been an \u201ceasy source of money\u201d for past governments and the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) wants to ensure future investment isn\u2019t wasteful, said Harini Amarasuriya, a lawmaker and a member of the NPP.",
    "During an interview with the Bloomberg news in Colombo, Amarasuriya, an academic who has become one of the more public faces of the NPP\u2019s election campaign, has stated: \u201cWe don\u2019t want easy money coming in to fund unproductive projects and not care about corruption.\u201d",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what we expect of any country, and that\u2019s how we would want it to be with China\u201d, she assured.",
    "Amarasuriya said the NPP wants to maintain ties with China since the country had been one of the few to back Sri Lanka when it faced global scrutiny for human rights violations as the civil war drew to a close.",
    "\u201cWe are cognizant of the fact that China has politically backed us in sensitive moments,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we want to maintain those relations.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, commenting to Bloomberg News, a senior economist at Frontier Research in Colombo, Thilina Panduwawela expressed \u201cMarkets do not have past experience to make a judgment call on NPP policies\u201d.",
    "\u201cAnd the election itself is too close to call and that is why there is some uncertainty in markets\u201d, he added.",
    "Amarasuriya said her party was against some of the tax measures Wickremesinghe\u2019s government was implementing to meet the IMF targets. Even so, she acknowledged that the conditions of the loan program, including the primary balance and the debt-to-GDP ratio, were \u201cfairly standard.\u201d",
    "NPP\u2019s presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s election manifesto, which was launched on August 26, proposes a number of tax amendments and more oversight on government spending.",
    "He\u2019s pledged to increase the income tax-free threshold and \u201cequitably\u201d amend rates and tax brackets. He also wants to remove some essential health, education and food items from the 18% value-added tax to make them more affordable, Amarasuriya said.",
    "The tax threshold has had a huge impact on the middle class and professionals, she said, leading to a severe brain drain with over 3,000 doctors as well as IT and banking personnel having left the country.",
    "Amarasuriya added that the current administration \u201chas not paid enough attention\u201d to some other IMF conditions, including bolstering social security networks and eradicating graft.",
    "With corruption, the approach will be to \u201cclean it from the top\u201d where all elected representatives have to behave based on a code of conduct that is strictly enforced, she said. There will be restrictions on government appointments and the tender processes \u2014 two areas where \u201ccorruption gets initiated,\u201d Amarasuriya said.",
    "Foreign investors have \u201cnothing to fear\u201d as the party will make it easier for business by eliminating corruption and putting in systems, she added."
