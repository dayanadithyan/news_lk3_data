    "Addresses inherent lag in transmission that varies between 6-12 months",
    "Approx. 2-month delay between policy decisions and effects on inflation",
    "The Central Bank announced yesterday its intention to shift focus on inflation from the near term to medium term, citing the latter\u2019s greater relevance for the decision-making processes.",
    "This strategic adjustment, according to the monetary authority, aims to address the inherent lag in transmission that limits the immediate impact of policy decisions on near-term inflation outcomes.",

Despite the near-term deviations from this target, due to the recent tax amendments and short-lived supply-side disruptions, the officials remain optimistic about the economy\u2019s trajectory toward stability.",
