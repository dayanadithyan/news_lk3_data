  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday announced Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party\u2019s (SLFP) Presidential candidate.",
    "Speaking to the media, Sirisena denied he would contest at the polls himself and said instead the party would field Rajapakshe at the upcoming election.",
    "\u201cMajority in the party are in favour of Rajapakshe\u2019s candidacy,\u201d Sirisena said. When questioned about the party\u2019s stance on Sirisena\u2019s candidacy, the former President reiterated that he had fulfilled an electoral promise to serve only one term as President and therefore does not wish to contest once more.",
    "Sirisena said Rajapakshe will have the full support of the SLFP.",
    "Despite Sirisena\u2019s announcement, it remains uncertain whether Rajapakshe will secure the party\u2019s candidacy, given the ongoing internal strife within the SLFP. Both Sirisena\u2019s and Rajapaksa\u2019s positions as SLFP Chairman and Acting Chairman, respectively, have been legally contested by the SLFP faction led by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga."
