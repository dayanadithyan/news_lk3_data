    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The \u201cgood MPs\u201d in parliament consider the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) their home and are eager to return, and the party will fill vacancies in its senior leadership levels in due course, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.",
    "Speaking to reporters on Thursday April 04, Amaraweera said former president and then SLFP leader Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was compelled to take legal action against incumbent chairman and former president Maithripala Sirisena after actions led to a deterioration of the party.",
    "Sirisena\u2019s actions ended up scuttling a number of opportunities for the SLFP to lead a broader alliance, Amaraweera claimed.",
    "According to media reports, an Interim order was issued by the Colombo District Court Friday morning preventing Sirisena from functioning as the SLFP\u2019s chairman.",
    "The verdict was issued following a petition filed by former President Kumaratunga.",
    "Sirisena told reporters Friday afternoon that he had yet to receive the order officially, but added that he respects the court\u2019s decision.",
    "\u201cSuch challenges are not new to the SLFP. After Sirimavo Bandaranaike lost her civic rights, Chandrika Bandaranaike and Wijeaya Kumaratunga went and formed another party, which led us to stay in the opposition for 17 years,\u201d said Sirisena.",
    "Minister Amaraweera, who was among SLFP members controversially removed by Sirisena from the SLFP for joining President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s government, defended Kumaratunga\u2019s move.",
    "\u201cThe daughter of S W R D and Sirimavo Bandaranaike was devastated by what was happening to the party. So she went to courts,\u201d he said.",
    "Amaraweera added that interim order against Sirisena had come from the people long before the court had issued it.",
    "\u201cThere were 140 SLFP MPs when MS took over. Now it\u2019s limited to two,\u201d he said, complaining that Sirisena had removed over 500 national organisers.",
    "The agriculture minister also accused the former president of bringing in hooligans to the party and rewarding them with positions.",
    "\u201cTo prevent this destruction, President Kumaratunga went to court,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe had plenty of opportunities to form alliances, but the chairman\u2019s actions prevented those. It was not anything we did. We gave our consent. But those MPs who had initially wanted to join that alliance didn\u2019t want to come in the end,\u201d he said.",
    "Amaraweera and his colleagues\u2019 removal from the SLPF discouraged the potential crossovers, he claimed.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re not out for revenge. We we have been repeatedly saying \u2018work for the party, not for individuals\u2019,\u201d he said.",
    "Questions that remain about leadership positions in the party that will be left vacant will be addressed in due course, said Amaraweera.",
    "\u2018This is the Mahagedara (ancestral home) of the good group in parliament. They want to come. We need to come up with a good programme and show it. We\u2019re not ready to dump this party on another party. We can take this on the path to victory easily,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Apr04/2024)"
