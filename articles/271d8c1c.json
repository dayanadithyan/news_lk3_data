    "Humane Peoples\u2019 Alliance Leader Dayasiri Jayasekra yesterday said Sri Lanka urgently requires a\u00a0 new program aimed at nurturing leaders who, through their political campaigns, can articulate their vision and strive to progress accordingly.",
    "Speaking at the new alliance\u2019s launch in Colombo, Jayasekara said the current system does not have such leaders.",
    "\u201cWe must emphasise the necessity of a robust political program for the forthcoming decade,\u201d he emphasised.",
    "\u201cAre we content with a system where 250,000 individuals live in luxury while millions suffer, or should we aspire for a more equitable future?\u201d he asked.",
    "Jayasekara emphasised the significance of establishing a new generation of leaders who are incorruptible, refrain from using political power to enrich their families and demonstrate foresight.",
    "Over 20 political parties and civil society organisations joined the newly formed alliance during the event yesterday.",
    "Announcing the launch of the new alliance earlier in the week Jayasekara said they hope to give new life to politics. He said it is evident that a program based on humanity is the need of the hour to revive the country.",
    "Jayasekara extended an invitation to anyone willing to rally around a set of clear policies rather than personalities and reject racism, to join the alliance and contribute to addressing the issues faced by the people."
