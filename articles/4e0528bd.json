    "\u201cI was invited by the President and the government and I thought it was correct for me to participate in the ceremony as I am a former Minister in charge of lands. I was the one who submitted a Cabinet Paper to distribute land for the poor during the Yahapalana government. However, a certain party went to courts and stopped our programne. I was invited to the ceremony as a pioneer of the programme,\u201d MP Karunathileke told the Daily Mirror.",
    "\u201cBoth President Wickremesinghe and the incumbent Minister of Lands Harin Fernando correctly told the ceremony that it was I who pioneered the programme,\u201d he added.",
    "The MP denied speculations on social media that he is one of the MPs who are in line to crossover to the government. Speculations became rife after MP Shan Wijayalal joined the SJB and obtained the party organizer's post for the Galle District."
