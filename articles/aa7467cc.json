  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Supreme Court has determined that several clauses of the Economic Transformation Bill are inconsistent with the country\u2019s Constitution.",
    "Consequently, these clauses require a special majority in parliament and, in some cases, approval by a referendum to be passed.",
    "However, if the contentious clauses are amended, they can be passed with a simple majority, the Speaker of Parliament announced today while delivering Supreme Court determination on the bill."
