    "Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar conceded defeat Saturday as two constitutional amendments he supported that would have broadened the definition of family and removed language about a woman\u2019s role at home were headed toward rejection in early vote tallies.",
    "Varadkar, who pushed the vote to enshrine gender equality in the constitution by removing \u201cvery old-fashioned language\u201d and trying to recognize the realities of modern family life, said it was clear the amendments were \u201cdefeated comprehensively on a respectable turnout.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt was our responsibility to convince the majority of people to vote \u2018yes\u2019 and we clearly failed to do so,\u201d Varadkar said.",
    "Opponents argued that the wording of the changes was poorly thought out \u2014 an argument that appeared to have gained traction in the final days of the campaign. Voters said they were confused by the questions and others said they feared changes would lead to unintended consequences.",
    "The election was viewed as part of Ireland\u2019s evolution from a conservative, overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country in which divorce and abortion were illegal, to an increasingly diverse and socially liberal society. The proportion of residents who are Catholic fell from 94.9% in 1961 to 69% in 2022, according to the Central Statistics Office.",
    "The social transformation has been reflected in a series of changes to Ireland\u2019s Constitution, which dates from 1937, though the country was not formally known as the Republic of Ireland until 1949. Irish voters legalized divorce in a 1995 referendum, backed same-sex marriage in a 2015 vote and repealed a ban on abortions in 2018.",
    "The first question dealt with a part of the constitution that pledges to protect the family as the primary unit of society. Voters were asked to remove a reference to marriage as the basis \u201con which the family is founded\u201d and replace it with a clause that said families can be founded \u201con marriage or on other durable relationships.\u201d If passed, it would have been the constitution\u2019s 39th amendment.",
    "A proposed 40th amendment would have removed a reference that a woman\u2019s place in the home offered a common good that could not be provided by the state and delete a statement that said mothers shouldn\u2019t be obligated to work out of economic necessity if it would neglect their duties at home. It would have added a clause saying the state will strive to support \u201cthe provision of care by members of a family to one another.\u201d",
    "The debate was less charged than the arguments over abortion and gay marriage. Ireland\u2019s main political parties all supported the changes, including centrist government coalition partners Fianna Fail and Fine Gael and the biggest opposition party, Sinn Fein.",
    "One political party that called for \u201cno\u201d votes was Aont\u00fa, a traditionalist group that split from Sinn Fein over the larger party\u2019s backing for legal abortion. Aont\u00fa leader Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn said the government\u2019s wording was so vague it will lead to legal wrangles and most people \u201cdo not know what the meaning of a durable relationship is.\u201d",
    "The Free Legal Advice Centers, a legal charity, expressed concern the change to the section on care contained \u201charmful stereotypes such as the concept that the provision of care \u2026 is the private responsibility of unpaid family members without any guarantee of state support.\u201d",
    "Some disability rights campaigners argued the emphasis on care treats disabled people as a burden, rather than as individuals with rights that should be guaranteed by the state.",
    "Opinion polls had suggested support for the \u201cyes\u201d side on both votes, but many voters remained undecided as Friday\u2019s polling \u2014 held on International Women\u2019s Day \u2014 neared and some said they found the issue too confusing or too hurried to change the constitution.",
    "\u201cI thought it was too rushed,\u201d said Una Ui Dhuinn, a nurse in Dublin. \u201cI felt we didn\u2019t get enough time to think about it and read up on it. So I felt, to be on the safe side, \u2018no, no\u2019 \u2014 no change.\u201d",
    "Caoimhe Doyle, a doctoral student, said she voted yes to changing the definition of family but no to the care amendment because \u201cI don\u2019t think it was explained very well.\u201d",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a worry there that they\u2019re removing the burden on the state to take care of families,\u201d she said."
