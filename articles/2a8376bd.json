    "\u201cOur competitors; the Maldives, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore all offer free visa facilities. We have seen a significant increase in the number of requests for 6-month, multiple entry visas. There has been a similar increase in the number of requests for 1, 2 and 5-year visas.
