  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings said it has affirmed Singer Finance (Lanka) Plc\u2019s (SFL) National Long-Term Rating of \u2018BBB(lka)\u2019. The outlook is stable.",
    "Fitch also affirmed SFL\u2019s outstanding senior unsecured debt at \u2018BBB(lka)\u2019 and outstanding subordinated",
    "\u201cSFL\u2019s rating is based on our expectation of support from its parent, consumer-durable retailer, Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC (Singer, A(lka)/Stable),\u201d the rating agency said.",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Mumbai/Colombo \u2013 07 Mar 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Singer Finance (Lanka) PLC\u2019s (SFL) National Long-Term Rating of \u2018BBB(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed SFL\u2019s outstanding senior unsecured debt at \u2018BBB(lka)\u2019 and outstanding subordinated unsecured debentures at \u2018BB+(lka)\u2019.",
    "Shareholder Support Underpins Rating: SFL\u2019s rating is based on our expectation of support from its parent, consumer-durable retailer, Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC (Singer, A(lka)/Stable). This is based on our assessment of Singer\u2019s ability and propensity to provide support, if needed. Singer has an 80% shareholding in SFL, which we expect to be maintained. The assessment also considers the common brand name and a record of equity injections into SFL by Singer.",
    "Moderate Synergies: We believe SFL has limited synergies with Singer, as evident from SFL\u2019s small share of lending within the group\u2019s ecosystem. We also believe support from the parent could be constrained by SFL\u2019s significant size relative to Singer, as its assets represented 40% of group assets as at end-2023. SFL\u2019s operational integration with the group is also low, although the parent has increased its focus on the subsidiary\u2019s strategic long-term decision-making over the past few years and has meaningful representation on SFL\u2019s board.",
    "Weak Standalone Profile: SFL\u2019s intrinsic financial position is weaker than its support-driven rating. It has a small domestic vehicle-focused lending franchise and a high-risk appetite stemming from its exposure to customer segments that are more susceptible to difficult operating conditions.",
    "Vehicle Loans Remain Dominant: SFL\u2019s business model is dominated by vehicle financing, which accounted for 68% of its lending portfolio as at end-2023. Gold loans have grown at a faster rate in the past few quarters, reaching 25% of SFL\u2019s portfolio, amid lower demand for vehicle financing. However, we do not expect a major change in SFL\u2019s vehicle-focused business mix in the medium term, given its more established franchise in this segment.",
    "Stabilising Economic Outlook: We expect the operating environment for Sri Lankan finance and leasing companies to continue to stabilize, following the inflation and interest-rate shocks over the past two years. Easing inflation and interest-rate pressure should provide steadier conditions for sector performance, but some headwinds linger, with higher taxes weighing on household finances in 2024. Investor confidence will also take time to recover. Nonetheless, we expect economic activity in Sri Lanka to improve in the financial year ending March 2025 (FY25), as GDP growth recovers.",
    "Asset Quality to Improve: SFL\u2019s reported stage 3 assets ratio rose to 11.9% in FYE23, from 6.6% in FY22, on weaker collections in its core vehicle loan segment as well as the implementation of a stricter stage 3 recognition rule. That said, asset quality has shown signs of improvement, with a decline in delinquencies in recent months. Loan collections could further increase as borrower repayment capability improves on the gradually stabilising economy and declining inflation and interest rates.",
    "Profitability to Recover, Leverage Rising: We expect SFL\u2019s net interest margin to gradually recover in the medium-term amid a declining interest-rate environment. This, along with a potential pick-up in loan growth, should support earnings and profitability, but strong loan expansion in the medium-term could pressure leverage.",
    "Pre-tax profit/average total assets declined to an annualised 2.7% in 9MFY24 (FY23: 3.1%, FY22: 4.5%), on a sharply narrower net interest margin of 9.0%, against 9.4% in FY23 and 12.7% in FY22. This followed a surge in borrowing costs due to rising interest rates. SFL\u2019s debt/tangible equity reached 5.8x at end-2023, from 5.3x at FYE23, and is likely to remain at higher levels in the medium term.",
    "Improved Funding and Liquidity: SFL\u2019s share of unsecured deposits/total debt swelled to 81% by end-2023, from 66% at FYE22, supported by a greater focus on raising deposits. Increased cash and cash equivalents from deposit raising and reduced lending mitigated near-term liquidity pressure. Liquid assets/total assets reached 23% by end-2023, from 8% at FYE22, as SFL boosted its investments in liquid assets amid fewer lending opportunities.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "SFL\u2019s rating is sensitive to changes in Singer\u2019s credit profile, as reflected in the parent\u2019s National Rating. An increase in SFL\u2019s size relative to Singer that makes extraordinary support more onerous or a delay in providing liquidity support relative to SFL\u2019s needs could also lead to negative rating action on SFL.",
    "SFL\u2019s rating may also be downgraded due to a weakening in Singer\u2019s propensity to support SFL due to diminishing links. That said, SFL\u2019s standalone credit profile could provide a floor to the rating.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating",
    "A positive turnaround in Singer\u2019s financial prospects or an increase in SFL\u2019s strategic importance to Singer through a greater role within the group could lead to narrower notching from Singer\u2019s profile. A large improvement in SFL\u2019s intrinsic credit profile could result in its ratings been derived from its standalone profile.",
    "The rating on SFL\u2019s senior unsecured debt is in line with the National Long-Term Rating, as the debt constitutes the unsubordinated obligations of the company.",
    "SFL\u2019s Sri Lankan rupee-denominated subordinated debentures are rated two notches below its National Long-Term Rating to reflect their subordination to senior unsecured obligations. Fitch\u2019s baseline notching of two notches for loss severity reflects our expectation of poor recovery. There is no additional notching for non-performance risk.",
    "SFL\u2019s senior unsecured debt and subordinated unsecured debt ratings will move in tandem with the National Long-Term Rating.",
