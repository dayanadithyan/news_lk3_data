    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe today acknowledged that postponing the Local Government elections is a violation of citizens\u2019 basic rights. However, he stated that he does not regret this decision, as the time was dedicated to ensuring the people\u2019s right to live and maintaining their safety.",
    "The President made these remarks while addressing the National Conference of the New People\u2019s Front (NPF) at the Youth Service Council Auditorium in Maharagama this afternoon (22).",
    "Emphasizing his respect for both the right to vote and the right to live, the President also noted that every hour was crucial in the effort to stabilize the country\u2019s economy.",
    "Wickremesinghe stressed that had he devoted that time to conducting the Local Government elections, achieving economic stability would not have been possible.",
    "He highlighted that people cannot maintain their day to day lives without essentials such as gas, medicine, food, and fuel.",
    "The President affirmed that over the past two years, he has been dedicated to safeguarding the basic rights of the people and stated that he will continue to make necessary decisions to protect these rights in the future.",
    "President Wickremesinghe further stated that the decision has been made to hold the General Election after the Presidential Election.",
    "\u201cThe necessary funds for this have already been secured. Following the General Election, Provincial Council Elections will be held, followed by Local Government elections,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cInstead of pursuing legal action, why didn\u2019t the opposition take their case to the Supreme Court in 2022 to address the economic issues and work towards a return to normalcy?",
    "I have no regrets about postponing the election. In this country, presidential and general elections are fundamental rights of the people, and I respect that right to vote. Equally important is the right to basic necessities such as gas, medicine, and fuel. I prioritized these essential needs and will continue to do so if required.",
    "The Supreme Court has advised that the Election Commission should determine the timing of the elections. We have collectively decided to hold the general election after the presidential election, and the necessary funds for this have been secured.",
    "The Provincial Council elections are planned to follow. We acknowledge the importance of these elections and are currently securing the funds needed. Local Government and Municipal Council elections will be scheduled subsequently, with new laws to be introduced, including measures for youth representation.",
    "I am pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in stabilizing the economy within just two years. Ultimately, it is up to the people to judge whether our decisions are correct.\u201d"
