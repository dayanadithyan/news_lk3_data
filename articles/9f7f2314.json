    "There was evident cause for concern that other demographics in our isle could be subject to the potential",
    "At a recent public seminar on the Online Safety Act (OSA), a policy perspective under the title \u2018OSA: Why The Rush?\u2019 was presented by the academics and students of the Bandaranaike Academy for Leadership and Public Policy (BALPP) in tandem with cyber-security experts.",
    "The public policy initiative came in the aftermath of the government\u2019s ostensible \u2018rushing through\u2019 with this controversial piece of legislation, in the teeth of ignored criticism and concerns expressed by stakeholders in Sri Lanka\u2019s increasingly important cyber-security domain.",
    "BALPP students following a post-graduate course in cyber-security observed that the OSA is ostensibly to protect women and children from the following:",
    "Despite the passage of similar international policies \u2013 the US (1996), Japan (2013), Singapore (2019, 2023), Australia (2021) and the UK (2023) \u2013 with the focus on protecting women and children, there was evident cause for concern that other demographics in our isle could be subject to the potential excesses of the new law.",
    "Therefore it is vital as regards the OSA Act No. 9 of 2024 in Sri Lanka to examine its core purpose (its aim is to regulate online content) through a key agency (the yet-to-be constituted Online Safety Commission: OSC).",
    "Further scrutiny is warranted as regards its key provisions whereby the nature of prohibited statements under the Act, the mandate and instrumentality of the OSC, and ramifications of Internet Intermediary Registration must pass muster under the norm of democratic rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of Sri Lanka to its citizens.",
    "In the light of this, local commentary from cyber-industry stakeholders such as the Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM), Federation of Information Technology Sri Lanka (FITIS), Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL), Digital Marketing Association of Sri Lanka (DMASL) and BCS/The Chartered Institute of IT Sri Lanka must have all of us sit up and take notice.",
    "These and other key players have opined that the OSA is, inter alia, \u201cimpractical, risking economic setback and impacting key economic sectors\u201d; that \u201camendments are essential\u201d (a comment made while the present Act was still a Bill \u2013 the Online Safety Bill: OSB); and that it \u201cneeds to align with international standards\u201d.",
    "International commentary is no less sharp \u2013 with the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), for instance, commenting that the OSB was \u201cin its current form, unworkable\u201d. So with the OSA now!",
    "BALPP\u2019s academics and students led by educator and cyber-security advisor Asela Waidyalankara noted the possible impact of the Bill/Act on Sri Lanka\u2019s burgeoning digital economy.",
    "The local cyber-industry has set a target of US$ 5 billion in export revenue by the year 2025, and was projecting a \u201csubstantial boost\u201d \u2013 to US$ 15 billion \u2013 by 2030. In 2020, it raked in a billion dollars, while earnings and projected earnings for 2023 and 2030 stood at US$ 3.7 billion and US$ 15 billion respectively.",
    "Speculation was rife as to how Sri Lanka\u2019s key growth partners in its digital economy \u2013 the US, the UK, Germany, France, and the Netherlands, as well as other EU member states \u2013 would view and respond to the Act.",
    "Also under the microscope at the recent policy dialogue was \u2018a tale of two policies\u2019 \u2013 namely, the OSA and its predecessor the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) No. 9 of 2022.\u00a0 Noteworthy is the fact that the PDPA took from 2019 to 2022 to pass from being a Bill into ab Act \u2013 and that only after wider consultation \u2013 to become \u201ca more comprehensive, much lauded law\u201d, according to BALPP\u2019s analysis.",
    "The OSA, which took all of five months between September 2023 and January 2024, suffers in comparison with its predecessor the PDPA, which was a multi-stakeholder affair \u2013 with no less than 9 rounds of consultation with over 30 stakeholders (including local chambers and international tech giants amongst whom was Meta).",
    "BALPP\u2019s presentation concluded with the imperative of assessing the economic impact of the OSA on Sri Lanka. It pointed to how the UK took 3 years to revise and enact a new law, and urged a review of the legal process \u2013 especially as the Online Safety Commission is to have wide-ranging powers to regulate cyber-content.",
    "Things to think about in the year ahead \u2013 one with two key elections in it now that presidential and parliamentary are to be conducted in tandem per the President \u2013 are the possible abuse of this law; contradictions with other laws such as the ICCPR Act and the RTI Act; and the practicality of implementation (for e.g. will internet intermediaries wary of the negative publicity associated with their putative compliance actually heed Sri Lanka\u2019s stipulations per the OSA?)",
    "Responding to the question in BALPP\u2019s presentation titled \u2018OSA: Why The Rush?\u2019, Emeritus Professor of Law Savitri Goonesekere averred that we tend to see public policy as being divorced from legal requirements and ramifications.",
    "Prof. Goonesekere was unequivocal that as far as the OSA was concerned, \u201cthere is a political push for it\u201d, adding that \u201csometimes, laws are conceived in secrecy and brought forth in obscurity.\u201d Such an approach, she opined, is \u201cabsolutely lethal in trying to regulate communications\u201d.",
    "On the OSB being challenged in the courts, the pioneering law professor noted that \u201ccourts have become the last resort\u201d, intimating that sense could or should have prevailed in the first place. She observed that although counsel against the passage of the Bill into law argued that it should be thrown out as a whole, the Bench was evidently influenced by the need to regulate spurious online content.",
    "\u201cIn a democratic society, there should be freedom of communication,\u201d asserted Goonesekere, a former Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo.",
    "The Supreme Court asked for some 31 amendments to be made to the Bill before being voted into law but there was a question-mark over whether Parliament has done so, she speculated, as also raised in the House by TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran, thereby raising the issue of the legality of the Act.",
    "Referring to role played by the Presidential Secretariat in ostensibly ratifying the passage of the Act sans the court-mandated amendments, the law professor observed: \u201cGovernment decisions are being made in flagrant violation of the orders of the Supreme Court. Has the court determination been acted upon? Instead, the President has interpreted the constitution.\u201d Goonesekere intimated that parliament has subverted the agency and instrumentality of the judiciary.\u00a0 She emphasised that \u201crushed legislation has an agenda\u201d, intimating that that is tantamount to a \u201cdismantling of democracy\u201d.",
    "Goonesekere urged that civil society must question the passage of such a Bill, the absence of such interrogation being tantamount to \u201cthe poverty of democracy\u201d affecting Sri Lanka\u2019s ongoing political misadventure.",
    "Quoting the maxims of the Buddha to \u2018think, reflect and then accept\u2019, she also alluded to the intellectual curiosity and obdurate rationalism of Galileo, whose penchant to challenge the powers that be both advanced the causes of rational investigation as well as brought him into the authorities\u2019 disrepute.",
    "\u201cThe Internet is the quintessence of communication,\u201d said Goonesekere, musing that \u201cone can\u2019t treat this freedom [of expression and communication] as being limited, or in isolation.\u201d",
    "The eminent law professor concluded that \u201cintrusion by the Act is seeking to stifle all those important democratic norms \u2013 to think, reflect and act\u201d; and that as there is no ex-post facto judicial review in Sri Lanka at present, citizens are hamstrung to deal with the OSA as an \u201cillegal Act\u201d.",
    "Dr. Sanjana Hattotuwa, the Research Director of The Disinformation Project in New Zealand, began in lighter vein by citing American sci-fi author Theodore Sturgeon who had once said that \u201c90% of everything is crap\u201d \u2013 which Hattotuwa adopted to mean the information sciences, whereby we can \u201ckeep sane by ignoring a majority of stuff online\u201d. Getting down to the res right away the TED and Ashoka Fellow declared: \u201cThe OSA cannot be resurrected or re-crafted or re-engineered \u2013 it must be rejected!\u201d",
    "Reminding his audience of \u2018the Tissa case\u2019 \u2013 in 2009, journalist J. S. Tissainayagam was sentenced to 20 years rigorous imprisonment for writing a July 2006 newspaper article that criticised the then Sri Lankan government\u2019s treatment of Tamil civilians affected by the country\u2019s 26-year war \u2013 Hattotuwa predicted that the OSA will enable the same at scale.",
    "\u201cAll of us are Tissa,\u201d he said\u2026 hopefully, not prophetically \u2013 although this academic, who is the Founding Editor of Groundviews, was at pains to point out that hope in the fair use of the OSA was virtually (no pun intended) nil.",
    "Another alarming aspect of the OSA is that the full force of this law is retroactively applicable, according to Hattotuwa. Anything you wrote, posted or blogged online can be subject to its \u2018Big Brotherly\u2019 eye. And more arrestingly, the \u2018O\u2019 (\u2018Online\u2019) in OSA can mean anything \u2013 an email, images on your Google Drive, something you sent as an SMS, a YouTube clip.",
    "More to the point, perhaps, \u201cthe OSA can be unmitigated disaster in an election year\u201d especially as regards social media such as X, Facebook etc., per this academic, who has for long years advocated the use of information communication technology (ICT) to win a just peace and strengthen human rights, reconciliation and democratic governance.",
    "\u201cThe chaos that will ensue because the architecture is already present in the scaffolding of the OSA\u201d boggles the mind, in his opinion.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what Chomsky calls an \u2018amplified discussion\u2019 around a few selective issues to give an impression of a vibrant conversation taking place,\u201d foresees Hattotuwa, anticipating the authorities\u2019 counter to the charge of suppression of the freedom of expression, but the conversation will be severely limited; restricted to selective issues; and while deceptively vociferous, it will be self-censored.",
    "As a result, \u201cThe manner in which the OSA was passed does not commend Sri Lanka as a democracy that passes consequential laws,\u201d averred Hattotuwa. In his opinion, a weaponisation of the OSA inevitable; and a looseness of terms in the new law militates towards such weaponisation of the OSA, against critics and dissenters.\u00a0 \u201cIt is not a design flaw; it\u2019s part of the architecture,\u201d intuited this expert.",
    "He added: \u201cTo believe that the OSA is going to stop planned, targeted, sustained attacks on social media is farcical \u2013 and the Elections Department is clueless!\u201d",
    "This long-time critic of authoritarian regimes says that Sri Lanka is one of the most heavily surveilled states in the region \u2013 if not the world.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t need Pegasus [an Israeli cyber-arms technology designed to be covertly and remotely installed on mobile phones] because of the complicity of our telcos [the telecom companies] \u2013 such is the danger of entrenched surveillance in a panopticon state [an area or arena in which everything is visible and monitored]\u201d.",
    "He elaborated on the likelihood of \u201csuppression of dissent and creation of a climate of fear, which could dovetail into the cross-domain surveillance that comes from CCTV monitoring\u201d \u2013 referring to a recent initiative of the Public Security Ministry being implemented by the police.",
    "With reference to the architects of this \u201cdraconian legislation\u201d, Hattotuwa said: \u201cWe can\u2019t take pride in Sri Lanka as a country when we are defined by the worst of us.\u201d His conclusion: \u201cThe OSA must be repealed post-haste because it creates a new theatre of war where you can create the conditions that make critics, et al. falsely culpable \u2013 abuse of the OSA complicates what has been an untenable situation already. It\u2019s a \u2018force multiplier\u2019 [a military term meaning something that amplifies the effect of a force] especially during electoral moments.\u201d"
