    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the Sustainable Development Council of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Banks\u2019 Association are working on establishing a blended financing facility for smallholder farmers, the chamber said.",
    "The facility seeks to empower smallholder farmers with financial support and access to technology. There are an estimated 1.65 million smallholder farms, the trade body said.",
    "\u201cGiven current economic challenges, a BFF is required to increase the effectiveness of development finance by creating an environment that attracts private investment as a multiplier effect,\u201d CCC said.",
    "The initial development would be a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that pools resource commitments from different partner organisations.",
    "This will mobilise capital for business development investments in the agricultural sector, the chamber said, and \u201cOver time, as the markets mature, the facility could evolve into a decentralized financial platform.\u201d",
    "The BFF will initially focus on building resilience and inclusivity in the agri-food sector. A successful model could then be extended to other high-impact sectors, such as the energy sector, in the long run, the chamber said. (Colombo/Sep11/2024)"
