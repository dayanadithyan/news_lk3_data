    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is promoting e-ticketing for state buses to stop revenue theft by bus conductors, Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardana said.",
    "\u201cSome conductors take a portion of the money home,\u201d Gunawardana told reporters Wednesday.",
    "\u201cThe take home amount is 10 million rupees daily, or 100 lakhs, which together becomes 3 billion a year.",
    "\u201cSo therefore, I have struggled to implement e-ticketing from the moment I took this responsibility.\u201d",
    "However, Minister Gunawardana said that there has been opposition from transportation workers with some of them setting up committees and taking the matter to court as citizens.",
    "Many workers are honest, but there are some who are not, in the same way most passengers buy tickets but some travel without, he said.",
    "\u201cIf they make an e-reservation, some guards don\u2019t like it,\u201d Gunawardana said. \u201cThey take a 5,000-rupee ticket and sell it to the tourists for 30,000 rupees. They don\u2019t let us do it online.\u201d",
    "\u201cAbout 35 bus conductors are interdicted each day for siphoning off passenger revenues,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe private bus owners have solved this problem in this way,\u201d he said. \u201cThey give the bus to the driver and conductor and tell them to run it as they wish.",
    "\u201cThey say at the end of the day give us this amount of money.\u201d (Colombo/Apr03/2024)"
