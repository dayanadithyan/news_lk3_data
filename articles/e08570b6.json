    "Emphasising the principle that as one section of the population benefits from the country\u2019s economy, another should not be left to suffer, the President underscored that the revolutionary initiative of granting free land titles was launched to uplift low-income individuals.",
    "He urged the people to actively participate in building the economy in collaboration with the Government\u2019s agricultural modernisation program, highlighting the potential for Polonnaruwa to become a key export district in the country.",
    "The President highlighted his achievement in swiftly stabilising the country\u2019s economy with the help of one group, despite inheriting a Government initially opposed by all. He extended an invitation to all sectors to collaborate in bolstering the nation\u2019s economy over the next two to three years, aiming to secure a prosperous future for the youth.",
    "The Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority has outlined plans to prepare 204,002 freehold deeds, with ongoing preparations at all regional levels. It is anticipated that 20,178 freehold deeds will be distributed to Mahaweli settlers by the end of May.",
