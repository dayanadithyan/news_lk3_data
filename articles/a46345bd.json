    "NPP MP Vijitha Herath challenges President to specify the page where according to his claim notes it will annul FTAs",
    "Points to page 151 of NPP manifesto and shows party has promised to update and enter into new FTAs",
    "Asks President Ranil Wickremesinghe to stop spreading lies and depending on uninformed advisers",
    "National People\u2019s Power (NPP) MP Vijitha Herath yesterday challenged President Ranil Wickr-emesinghe\u2019s claim that a future NPP Government led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake would annul Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).",
    "Herath challenged Wickremesinghe to specify the page and article number where this information is mentioned in the NPP manifesto. \u201cStop relying on uninformed advisers and spreading falsehoods on stage. We challenge you to take not just one night, but a full month to thoroughly re-read the manifesto if necessary,\u201d he said.",
    "On Sunday, Wickremesinghe, speaking at several rallies including one in Welimada, claimed that Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s election manifesto titled \u201cA Thriving Nation, A Beautiful Life\u201d indicated that the NPP would cancel all FTAs. He questioned how exports could be increased if this was the NPP\u2019s policy. Meanwhile, in Morawaka, Wickremesinghe reiterated his claim about the FTAs while claiming he had read the entire NPP manifesto over-night. Herath pointed out that on page 151 of the manifesto, under the heading \u201cInternational and Local Market Expansions and Productivity,\u201d the NPP clearly states its intention to update existing FTAs and enter into new ones.",
    "\u201cDid you overlook this or intentionally ignore it? As a responsible President, stop spreading lies. You are not just any other candidate. Do not deceive the people and the international community,\u201d he said.",
    "Herath also noted that the same information is available in the English version of the manifesto on page 84. He demanded an apology from President Wickremesinghe for misrepresenting the contents of the NPP manifesto to both the public and the international community."
