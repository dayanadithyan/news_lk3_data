  "original_body_lines": [
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s statement in Parliament on Wednesday that \u201cresolution of the economic crisis lies not in a political but economic and scientific solutions\u201d is incorrect.",
    "We need to categorically state that the economic crisis has a well-defined identifiable disproportionately large political component.",
    "Incompetent corrupt democratically elected politicians taking unscientific and economically incorrect political decisions to meet their short and long term political goals which were justified and sustained by a cohort of absolutely incompetent cohorts of \u2018yes sir\u2019 spineless Government officials who were political appointees.",
    "As such the solution to the current economic crisis is bringing about an immediate change in the mode and style of governance and government by politicians and bureaucrats through a process of elections where the people decide their political and economic future.",
    "As such the President\u2019s statement that the current economic crisis is not political is misleading and perhaps rooted in his personal desire to democratise his already expired political shelf life to the further detriment of Sri Lanka in general and Sri Lankan politics"
