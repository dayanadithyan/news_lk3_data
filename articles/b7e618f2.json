  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Cable Solutions Limited, a subsidiary of Sri Lanka\u2019s ACL Cables Plc, said it was looking to supply cables to the US operations of a multinational company.",
    "\u201cOur commitment to obtaining international certifications has opened doors to new markets and attracted more discerning customers. For instance, we have begun supplying cables to the UK and potentially the US operations of a multinational company,\u201d Chairman Suren Madanayake told shareholders.",
    "Previously, the company\u2019s products were only available through its Indian plant, he said in the company\u2019s first annual report as a listed company, presenting audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending 2023/2024.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Cable Solutions begins trading on CSE Diri Savi Board",
    "The company made a gross profit of 761,562,327 million for 2023/2024, lower than the 1,084,425,516 in 2022/2023.",
    "\u201cThe global economic environment also plays a role in shaping the outlook for cable manufacturing. While global demand for cables is influenced by infrastructure investments and technological advancements, macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions cause fluctuations in raw material prices and predictability which impact margins and production costs.\u201d",
    "Addressing persistent issues within the manufacturing sector will be key to fostering a robust recovery, Madanayake said.",
    "\u201cFocused strategies, including optimizing supply chains, enhancing operational efficiencies and leveraging technological advancements, will be essential for achieving sustainable growth.\u201d",
    "The company said it had invested in new machinery to enhance efficiency, quality, and to address production bottlenecks: \u201cThe introduction of the 80-50 extrusion line marks a significant upgrade from its predecessor enabling faster out-put and enhanced production efficiency.",
    "\u201cAdditionally, the new machine\u2019s lower power consumption will contribute to considerable energy cost savings.",
    "\u201cLooking ahead, we anticipate further new customer acquisitions, supported by a strong pipeline of advanced R&D discussions and recent marketing leads.",
    "\u201cThe benefits from large accounts acquired in FY22 and FY23 will be more fully realized in FY25 and beyond.\u201d",
    "Although its India operation had made a loss, the company continues to explore opportunities for product diversification, Madanayake said.",
    "While continuing to maintain a significant revenue share from export customers, Cable Solutions will intensify focus on Europe and the US, alongside expanding marketing efforts in India, Australia, and other targeted regions and in the Renewable Energy space, in particular, Sri Lanka.",
    "The momentum for scaling up the business is gaining strength, it said. (Colombo/Sep16/2024)"
