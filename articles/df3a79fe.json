    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has no intention of helping the United National Party (UNP) or any other party, but will only assist in the rebuilding of the fractured Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) so long as it can be done, Kumaratunga said.",
    "At a press conference held Monday April 29 morning, Kumaratunga said the SLFP, the party she led for over a decade, has splinted into several factions and must be built from the ground up.",
    "\u201cThe SLFP has fractured and is now split to six or seven groups. It has been fallen to zero,\u201d she said, lamenting the state of a party that she said has ruled the country for over 40 years, representing the aspirations of the people.",
    "\u201cThe SLFP ruled this country for 40 years. Party supporters have nowhere to go. I plan to do what I can using my knowledge and experience to develop young leaders, not just for politics but for the country,\u201d said Kumaratunga.",
    "The former president claimed that Sri Lanka\u2019s current crop of politicians will do anything to gain power and enjoy the perks of that power.",
    "\u201cI never did that kind of politics. I don\u2019t want to do politics with any of the politicians now,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI was asked to take the party chairmanship, I said no. I will only help if the SLFP can be developed to some level. That\u2019s it,\u201d she added.",
    "Kumaratunga also dismissed speculation that she intends to support President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party (UNP) at the upcoming presidential election.",
    "\u201cNow the biggest lie being told is that Chandrika has come here to help the UNP. I have no such intention,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI will hep if the SLFP can be developed. People walk up to me on the road and say \u2018madam, please come and take over the party. We made a mistake and voted for the SLPP, we won\u2019t again.\u2019 Because of that, I will help. But I have no intention of supporting any party,\u201d she said. (Colombo/Apr29/2024)"
