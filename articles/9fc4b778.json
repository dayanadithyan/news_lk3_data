    "The Russian Embassy in Colombo in a statement yesterday slammed the double standards of \u201cnumerous Western political figures, diplomats and foreign quasi-human rights organisations\u201d concerning human rights in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cIn spite of the fact that the above-mentioned personalities and entities are well known for their policy of double standards, the Embassy as the official representation of the Russian Federation would like once again to express its perplexity by the way those \u2018ambassadors of justice\u2019 see things,\u201d it said.",
    "The Embassy highlighted increased external pressure on Sri Lanka regarding its human rights situation, with Western political figures, diplomats, and foreign quasi-human rights organisations issuing critical statements and observations.\u00a0 \u201cWhy are they reticent about the Gaza situation? Why don\u2019t they provide their assessments of the humanitarian damage NATO caused to Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Libya and other regions to which the Alliance aims to export its \u2018freedom and democracy\u2019? What prevents them from looking into the matter of Russian-speaking minorities being oppressed in Baltic countries? Why do they finally omit and even indulge the atrocities by the Nazi regime of Zelenskyy in respect of his own people?\u201d it asked.",
    "The Russian Embassy remarked that although partial answers to these questions are known, the public community desires to hear them clearly and unequivocally."
