  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says JVP is resorting to making various claims and statements to evade a face-off",
    "Stresses that regardless of polls a party\u2019s core economic policies must remain unchanged",
    "Claims JVP is uncertain of its own economic policies and is thus evading a debate",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Deputy General Secretary Mujibur Rahman yesterday criticised the rival Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) for sidestepping the challenge posed by the SJB economic council to engage in a public debate on the economy between the two parties.",
    "Instead, he said the NPP is resorting to making various claims and statements in an attempt to evade a face-off with the SJB.",
    "Speaking at a press conference in Colombo, Rahman emphasised that regardless of the upcoming elections, a party\u2019s core economic policies must remain unchanged.",
    "\u201cInstead of embracing the challenge presented by the SJB, the JVP is issuing various statements to evade it,\u201d he remarked, suggesting that this reluctance may stem from the JVP\u2019s uncertainty regarding its own economic policies.",
    "\u201cThe JVP General Secretary asserts that the JVP\u2019s economic policy aligns with the Compass\u2019s (National People\u2019s Party) policy. If that\u2019s the case, why establish a separate entity like the NPP? It appears they are struggling to advance under the JVP banner. Hence, they\u2019ve introduced the compass. They\u2019re attempting to alter red into pink to gauge public acceptance,\u201d he commented.",
    "\u201cWhen it comes to discussing the economy, the JVP tends to evade the subject,\u201d he stated. \u201cThe JVP appears to be intentionally avoiding this topic, possibly because its policies and philosophy lack realism. They seem hesitant to openly share their stance with the public,\u201d he added.",
    "However, despite Rahman\u2019s claim, SJB MPs Harsha de Silva and Nalin Bandara specifically issued the challenge for a public debate to the economic council of the NPP, which includes members Sunil Handunnetti, Prof. Anil Jayasinghe, and Seetha Bandara, rather than the JVP.",
    "In response, Handunnetti accepted the challenge on behalf of the NPP and said however the party was keen to hold a debate between the leaders of both parties instead of between the economic councils. He requested the SJB to formally extend its invitation to the party in writing, which it has failed to do yet.",
    "He claimed it was futile to engage in debates with SJB members, citing their previous involvement as policymakers under the United National Party (UNP) and their current affiliation with the SJB."
