    "SJB MP S.M. Marikkar stresses President is elected through public vote and not through Parliament",
    "Questions if Wickremesinghe being backed by 92 MPs will translate into broader voter support",
    "Points out pointed same MPs who are now backing Wickremesinghe had previously voted no on NCM against Minister Keheliya Rambukwella",
    "Claims many MPs backing Wickremesinghe are those with corruption charges levelled against them",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar has downplayed the significance of 92 MPs extending their support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, asserting that the President is elected by the majority of the electorate rather than by Parliamentary votes.",
    "Speaking to the media outside the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) yesterday, where he was accompanied by party members to place the cash deposit for the Presidential Election on behalf of party leader Sajith Premadasa, Marikkar argued that the backing of 92 MPs does not necessarily translate into broader voter support.",
    "\u201cThere is considerable celebration over 92 MPs joining President Wickremesinghe. However, the President is elected by a majority of 17 million voters, not merely by a majority vote in Parliament,\u201d Marikkar said.",
    "He expressed scepticism about whether the support of these MPs would effectively convert into votes from the public.",
    "Marikkar also pointed out that the same MPs who are now backing Wickremesinghe had previously voted against a No Confidence Motion brought by the SJB against Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, highlighting their defence of Rambukwella despite the controversy surrounding him.",
    "Marikkar also criticised the integrity of some MPs supporting Wickremesinghe, noting that many of them face corruption charges. \u201cThey have all banded together,\u201d he added, questioning the motives behind their support."
