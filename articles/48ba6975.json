    "COLOMBO (News 1st); In an effort to bolster community security and prevent crime, the Sri Lanka Police have established a nationwide network of 14,022 Community Police Committees.",
    "These committees are operational across all Grama Niladhari Divisions, the smallest administrative units in Sri Lanka.",
    "The initiative hinges on a trilingual form developed by the Police, designed to gather demographic details of all residents within each division.",
    "Crucially, the Community Police Committees will play a vital role in updating this information by reporting any changes in residency, including both arrivals and departures.",
    "\"By promptly reporting changes in residency, these committees enable us to effectively track individuals potentially engaged in criminal activities, extremism, drug peddling, or even underworld operations,\" said Acting Police Chief Deshabandu Thennakoon.",
    "The initiative further addresses the issue of anonymous rentals, often exploited by criminals for temporary hideouts, he added.",
