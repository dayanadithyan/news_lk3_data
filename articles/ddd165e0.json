    "Colombo, May 21 (Daily Mirror) - Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe will officially announce his candidacy for the Presidential election next month, Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said today.",
    "\u201cA story is being spread by many, including the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), that President Wickrmesinghe will not be contesting the Presidential election that is to be held this year. However, Wickremesinghe will deliver a blow to all those who make such a claim, as he will seek another term. He will officially announce his candidacy next month,\u201d Minister Nanayakkara told a media briefing.",
    "\u201cWickremesinghe has proven his capability by accepting the Presidency at a difficult time for the sake of the county. He did so when many others avoided it. Many others ran away from the responsibility and only thought of their political future,\u201d he added.",
    "Also, he said Wickremesinghe will not be contesting from a single party but will represent many forces at the Presidential election.",
    "Meanwhile, SJB Mulkirigala organizer Nimal Fransiscu obtained UNP membership today. He obtained his UNP membership from party Chairman Vajira Abeywardene at the party headquarters in Sirikotha.",
    "Minister Nanayakkara, who referred to the situation, said many in the SJB are frustrated about the effort made by outsiders to take over the party.",
    "\u201cThose who were in the Viyathmaga are joining the SJB and are trying to take over the party. Many in the SJB are leaving the party as a mark of protest,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSome are questioning us as to why SJBers did not get on to the UNP stage on May Day. However, there is no hurry for such an eventuality. There are SJB MPs who are waiting to join at the right time. They will join as a group or individually. There are others in the SJB who call for a merger with the UNP. They will abandon the SJB leader and join us if their demand is not met,\u201d he also said."
