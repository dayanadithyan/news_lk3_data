    "Colombo, April 19 (Daily Mirror) - A request by some MPs across the political divide for concessionary vehicle permits is likely to be shot down by the party leaders given the dire economic situation of the country, Daily Mirror learns.",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne brought to the notice of the Business Committee last week that a letter is being signed by the MPs for such a request.",
    "He said such a request would tarnish the honorary services of the MPs and therefore such facility should not be granted to them in adherence to due protocols as in the case of other public servants and judicial officers.",
    "However, SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa and Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella said at the same meeting that such a request should not be entertained at all due to what they called bankruptcy of the country."
