    "India, June 9 (Indian Express) - Narendra Modi took oath as the Prime Minister of India for the third time, equalling a feat that only Jawaharlal Nehru achieved in the past. Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, J P Nadda, Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Nirmala Sitharaman have also taken oath as cabinet ministers in the new government. With over 8,000 guests at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Modi and his council of ministers officially kicked off the NDA\u2019s third stint.",
    "Earlier in the day, the newly-elected Members of Parliament had gathered at Modi\u2019s residence, many of whom will also be included in the Cabinet. 66 ministers are taking oath now."
