  "original_title": "Tamil Nadu\u2019s First DMK Chief Minister CN Annadurai known as \u201cAnna\u201d made very significant contributions to Tamil theatre, cinema,  and literature.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai may have been instrumental in shaping the course of Tamil Nadu\u2019s political history. But his artistic and literary persona played a major role in his achieving the rare iconic status he enjoyed.",
    "His contributions as a writer and actor undoubtedly aided him in his propaganda all the way. However, when viewed sans the political agenda, his work can be seen as having made very significant contributions to Tamil theatre, cinema and literature.",
    "Some of Anna\u2019s plays were made into films and are regarded as very important productions in Kollywood. \u2019Velaikkari\u2019 and \u2019Or Iravu\u2019 are two of his most popular films.",
    "Both were stage plays penned by him that were later made into films which also had Anna penning the story and dialogue. In fact, at one point producers began capitalising on the audience\u2019s response to mere mention of \u2019Kadai, Vasanam \u2013 C.N.Annadurai\u2019 on the title cards. So much so that it would precede even the actors\u2019 and directors\u2019 names.",
    "One particular scene in the film \u2019Velaikkari\u2019, in which the character Anandan argues with Kaali, the presiding deity at the neighbourhood temple, was perceived by many as a rather powerful dosage of atheistic views. Jupiter Pictures, which produced \u2018Velaikkari\u2019 is said to have been a little apprehensive about releasing the film which had portions like this that strongly critiqued some contemporary practices. But, Anna was quite confident of his skills as a writer and more so, of the ideology voiced in his writing. He told the producers to go ahead with the release and not to worry. The film which was released on February 25, 1949, is said to have done remarkably well at the box office.",
    "For his production \u2018Nallathambi,\u2019 actor N.S.Krishnan requested Anna to pen the dialogues. This film which was released in 1949 did reasonably well, but many of Anna\u2019s close associates and Anna himself felt that his lines had been distorted. Consequently, when NSK approached Anna to write the script for his next project, \u2018Thambidurai,\u2019 it is said that the writer showed no interest.",
    "Another play written by Anna, \u2018Sivaji Kanda Indhu Samrajyam\u2019, had interesting consequences. V.C.Ganesan, an upcoming stage actor, played the protagonist. Watching his impressive performance, E.V. Ramasami gave him the title \u2018Sivaji\u2019, which would soon become the inimitable Sivaji Ganesan. It was in this play that actor Manorama also played a role. \u201cThose were the days when Tamil theatre flourished. Anna played the role of a madadipathi in that play,\u201d she reminisces.",
    "Then, it was common to have celebrities presiding over Tamil plays. On one such occasion, Anna was the chief guest at \u2018Manimagudam\u2019, a play written by Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi. The role of Alli played by Manorama impressed him very much. \u201cWhen he spoke later, he commended my performance and said it was important to have such women in politics, too,\u201d Ms. Manorama says.",
    "Besides inspiring and drawing great talent to politics, Anna also has the credit of inspiring many youngsters to take up theatre and cinema.",
    "Director K. Balachander says that plays such as \u2018Velaikkari\u2019 and \u2018Or Iravu\u2019 has a marked impact on him in his student-days. \u201cI was amazed by CNA\u2019s mastery over language. I enjoyed his emphatic way of expressing his views,\u201d he says.",
    "\u201cThough I did not completely agree with his ideology, I was quite enamoured by his language prowess.\u201d Mr. Balachander also points to Anna\u2019s eye for detail and openness in commending others\u2019 works.",
    "\u201cHe presided over my play \u2018Major Chandrakanth\u2019. As a timid youngster, I stood behind the curtains on the stage and quietly watched his expressions. After the play, he came on stage and spoke. It was such a brilliant review of the play, highlighting even the nuances. It was such a thrill.\u201d",
    "The director, who was making his play \u2019Yedir neechal\u2019 into a film, was eager to screen the film to Anna, who had seen the original play. \u201cHe was ailing then and we thought he would not come. But to our surprise, he came, saw the film and told us he liked it more than the play. That is possibly the last film he saw,\u201d says Mr. Balachander.",
    "In a tribute of sorts, the director included a scene in his \u2019Iru Kodugal\u2019 where a character [played by Sowkar Janaki] would want to meet the Chief Minister. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a dupe in his place. But I wanted to bring in Anna somehow.\u201d He did, and that scene was received with thunderous applause. With a voice sounding just like his, a pair of glasses on the table and a pen in the foreground, the audience knew it had to be him!"
