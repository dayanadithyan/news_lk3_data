    "US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Friday he had spoken by telephone with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky, and pledged to end the European country\u2019s war with Russia.",
    "\u201cI appreciate President Zelensky for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families,\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.",
    "\u201cBoth sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.\u201d",
    "The United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in military assistance for Kyiv since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 -- though a Trump victory in the November election would put Washington\u2019s continued support into question.",
    "Zelensky confirmed the call, during which he congratulated Trump on formally becoming the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee, as well as wishing the 78-year-old well after an attempt on his life a week ago.",
    "\u201cWe agreed with President Trump to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting,\u201d Zelensky said in a post on X.",
    "\u201cI noted the vital bipartisan and bicameral American support for protecting our nation\u2019s freedom and independence,\u201d he said.",
    "Trump has repeatedly claimed he would end the war very quickly, without offering details as to how.",
    "Last week, the ex-president hosted at his Florida estate Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month.",
    "Trump\u2019s frequent praise for Putin and reluctance to outright criticize the Russian invasion have stirred concerns among Ukraine\u2019s allies that he would force the country into accepting partial defeat.",
    "He has also repeatedly suggested backing away from NATO, even undermining the alliance\u2019s collective defense guarantee by saying he would encourage Russia to attack any members not who had not met their financial obligations.",
    "Trump\u2019s running mate J.D. Vance leads the isolationist wing of congressional Republicans, who argue the United States should drop aid to Ukraine.",
    "Vance was one of the fiercest opponents of the approval of $61 billion in new military aid for Ukraine, which was stalled by Republican lawmakers for months earlier this year -- a time in which Russia made battlefield gains.",
    "Trump told the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday that he would bring an end to raging international crises, saying he could \u201cstop wars with a telephone call.\u201d",
    "\u201cI will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created, including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine,\u201d Trump said, without elaborating on how.",
    "Zelensky said earlier this week that he and Trump would \u201cwork together\u201d if the Republican won the White House.",
    "Zelensky declined to say whether he was worried about US President Joe Biden, who has been facing calls to drop his reelection campaign following a disastrous debate performance and questions over his health and mental acuity.",
    "He did, however, acknowledge that \u201cturbulence\u201d during the US election cycle was having a \u201cbig impact\u201d on his country.",
    "Trump\u2019s relationship with Zelensky famously goes back to his time in the White House.",
    "In 2019, Trump was impeached for withholding military aid to Ukraine while pressuring Zelensky to help him dig up dirt on his election rival Biden -- a race he went on to lose in 2020."
