    "A group of sustainable energy activists convened a press conference in Colombo last week and called for resolving any issues with the Adani wind power project in Mannar and find pragmatic and sustainable ways to implement it without dragging on it.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is blessed with plenty of wind \u2014 a renewable energy resource with which cheaper electricity can be provided to consumers without spending millions of dollars on fossil fuel, but it is still an enigma why the government of Sri Lanka is dragging on finalizing the Adani wind power project in Mannar,\u201d they said.",
    "Indunil Bandara, Convener of the Youth for Renewable Energy Organization voiced concerns over the issue of increasing electricity unit tariffs faced by Sri Lankans. Bandara highlighted that nearly 25% of the average income is allocated to electricity consumption, posing significant challenges to households and businesses alike.",
    "He questioned the country\u2019s reluctance to embrace this particular project that could foster national development and progress.",
    "\u201cThe surge in electricity bills is adversely impacting businesses and entrepreneurs, hindering economic growth and innovation. So, we can\u2019t comprehend why the government is dragging its feet on regulatory approvals for green energy projects even when the advantages are clear,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile, Rajitha Abeygunasekera, General Secretary of Sri Lanka Blue Green Alliance said, \u201cOil and coal claim more than 60% of the country\u2019s electricity generation input mix, despite the country not lacking in Renewable Energy potentials, which impacts on national energy security heavily and is a major strain on the country\u2019s trade budget with negative economic impact. The fact that only 4% of power needs are met by Renewable Energy, viewed along with the declared goal of achieving a 50% renewable electricity supply by 2030 under Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (clause 31 in \u201cEnvironment\u201d section) calls for major initiatives in Renewable Energy generation\u201d, he said.",
    "National Organizer of the Alliance, Vinshada Yasasmini said, \u201cRenewable energy projects have gained greater importance especially after Sri Lanka policymakers decided that we need to be using 100 percent renewable energy by 2050. The 2016 \u201cBlue Green Era\u201d programme of Sri Lanka upholds our commitment to adopt climate smart strategies and low carbon footprint based on the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and Sustainable Development Goals. These policies call for significant levels of renewable energy projects for the country. So, the government needs to declare its position on Adani wind power project in Mannar without any vacillation.\u201d",
