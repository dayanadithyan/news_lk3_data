    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will revoke the privatization of plantation companies that do not pay government dictated wages, by cancelling land leases and find new investors under a \u2018competitive system\u2019, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has said.",
    "Sri Lanka privatized the ownership of 22 plantations companies in the 1990s through long term leases after initially giving only management to private firms.",
    "Management companies that made profits (mostly those with more rubber) were given the firms under a valuation and those that made losses (mostly ones with more tea) were sold on the stock market.",
    "The privatized firms then made annual lease payments and paid taxes when profits were made.",
    "In 2024 the government decreed a wage hike announced a mandated wage after President Ranil Wickremesinghe made the announcement in the presence of several politicians representing plantations workers.",
    "The land leases of privatized plantations, which do not pay the mandated wages would be cancelled, Minister Siyambalapitiya was quoted as saying at a ceremony in Deraniyagala.",
    "The re-expropriated plantations would be given to new investors through \u201cspecial transparency\u201d",
    "The new \u2018privatization\u2019 will be done in a \u2018competitive process\u2019 taking into account export orientation, worker welfare, infrastructure, new technology, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.",
    "It is not clear whether paying government-dictated wages was a clause in the privatization agreement.",
    "Then President J R Jayewardene put constitutional guarantee against expropriation as the original nationalization of foreign and domestic owned companies were blamed for Sri Lanka becoming a backward nation after getting independence with indicators \u2018only behind Japan\u2019 according to many commentators.",
    "However, in 2011 a series of companies were expropriation without recourse to judicial review, again delivering a blow to the country\u2019s investment framework.",
    "Ironically plantations that were privatized in the 1990s were in the original wave of nationalizations.",

    "Sri Lanka state interference in plantation wages escalates into land grab threat",
    "From the time the firms were privatized unions and the companies had bargained through collective agreements, striking in some cases as macro-economists printed money and triggered high inflation.",
    "Under President Gotabaya, mandating wages through gazettes began in January 2020, and the wage bargaining process was put aside.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s macro-economists advising President Rajapaksa the printed money and triggered a collapse of the rupee from 184 to 370 to the US dollar from 2020 to 2020 in the course of targeting \u2018potential output\u2019 which was taught by the International Monetary Fund.",
    "In 2024, the current central bank governor had allowed the exchange rate to appreciate to 300 to the US dollar, amid deflationary policy, recouping some of the lost wages of plantations workers.",
    "The plantations have not given an official increase to account for what macro-economists did to the unit of account of their wages. With salaries under \u2018wages boards\u2019 from the 2020 through gazettes, neither employees not workers have engaged in the traditional wage negotiations.",
    "The threat to re-exproriate plantations is coming as the government is trying to privatize several state enterprises, including SriLankan Airlines.",
    "It is not clear now the impending reversal of plantations privatization will affect the prices of bids by investors for upcoming privatizations.",
    "The firms were privatized to stop monthly transfers from the Treasury to pay salaries under state ownership. (Colombo/May25/2024)"
