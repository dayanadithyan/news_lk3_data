    "Former Sri Lankan captain Aravinda de Silva lamented that the current bunch of men\u2019s cricketers don\u2019t play as bravely as their predecessors did. The former national men\u2019s team\u2019s chief selector feels England\u2019s present approach to Test cricket is impressive and reckons it\u2019s not impossible to defeat them in their backyard.",
    "The likes of Romesh Kaluwitharana, Sanath Jayasuriya, Arjuna Ranarunga, de Silva, Chaminda Vaas, and Muttiah Muralitharan were the nucleus of the men\u2019s team\u2019s golden era. They were part of the Island nation\u2019s World Cup-winning squad in 1996, with de Silva scoring a hundred to overhaul Australia\u2019s total of 241 in the final.",
    "The 58-year-old stated that the team of the yesteryears inspired their rivals to emulate their style of play. He also observed that England decided to take a positive approach and it\u2019s paying off handsomely.",
    "\u201cThat was Sri Lanka playing like no other side has done in history,\u201d Aravinda de Silva said. \u201cWe had an identity, people knew the way that Sri Lankan cricketers played the game and teams wanted to emulate that. I don\u2019t think we have that at the moment.\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019m enjoying the way that England are playing their cricket at the moment. They\u2019re playing very, very attacking cricket \u2013 whether they\u2019re bowling or batting, England are taking a really positive approach and it\u2019s paying off. Winning in England is hard. But it\u2019s certainly not impossible,\u201d he added.",
    "Since Brendon McCullum took over as England\u2019s Test team\u2019s head coach role, they have been playing aggressively. The 2022 home season saw them chase down three consecutive targets of over 250 successfully, including 378 against India at Edgbaston."
