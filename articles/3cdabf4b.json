    "China and the US face a choice between stability and a \u201cdownward spiral,\u201d Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told counterpart Antony Blinken on Friday in Beijing, as the American diplomat kicked off a day of meetings with top Chinese officials.",
    "Blinken\u2019s trip to China \u2013 his second in the space of a year \u2013 comes as the two global powers seek to expand communication and stabilize rocky ties, while also navigating a host of thorny issues from China\u2019s support for Russia to its aggression in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan.",
    "\u201cShould China and the United States keep to the right direction of moving forward with stability or return to a downward spiral? This is a major question before our two countries, and tests our sincerity and ability,\u201d Wang told Blinken during a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, after saying US-China ties were \u201cbeginning to stabilize.\u201d",
    "\u201cShould our two sides lead international cooperation against global issues and achieve win-win for all? Or engage in rivalry and confrontation \u2013 or even slide into conflict, which would be a lose-lose for all?\u201d he said, speaking through an interpreter.",
    "Wang\u2019s comments come as Chinese officials bristle at actions Washington has taken in the name of national security, which Beijing sees as meant to suppress its development. Those have included US controls on the export to China of high-tech goods that could have military uses, as well as curbs on US investment in certain high-tech sectors in China.",
    "On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden signed a bill that could lead to a nationwide ban on the social media platform TikTok if the company\u2019s Chinese parent ByteDance doesn\u2019t sell it \u2013 legislation Beijing has previously decried.",
    "In his comments to Wang, Blinken pointed to a \u201cshared responsibility\u201d between the two countries to \u201cmake sure that we\u2019re as clear as possible about the areas where we have differences, at the very least, to avoid misunderstandings, to avoid miscalculations.\u201d",
    "\u201cI hope we can make some progress on the issues that our presidents agreed we should cooperate on, but also clarify our differences, our intents, and make very clear to each other where we stand,\u201d Blinken said.",
    "The trip is the latest in a string of high-level engagements that included a summit meeting between President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in California in November, following a period of immense tension.",
    "Officials from both nations suggested ahead of the trip that the visit would be focused on managing the relationship and communicating concerns.",
    "The two sides are also expected to discuss areas of contention.",
    "Blinken is expected to raise the issue of China\u2019s industrial and economic support for Russia, which the White House says has allowed Moscow to continue its war against Ukraine, and press China to use its relationship with Iran to push it to be less provocative in the Middle East.",
    "In a briefing with reporters earlier this week ahead of the meeting, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official said Beijing has been \u201cplaying a constructive role as a responsible major country\u201d on issues related to the Middle East, Ukraine, the Korean Peninsula and \u201cexpects the US side to do the same.\u201d",
    "In addition to concern about US technology curbs, Wang will likely continue to stress China\u2019s so-called \u201cred lines\u201d in the relationship, the foremost of which being how the US maintains its unofficial relationship with Taiwan.",
    "China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has ramped up its military intimidation of the democratic island in recent years.",
    "\u201cWe always call for respecting each other\u2019s core interests and urge the United States not to interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs, not to hold China\u2019s development back, not to step on China\u2019s red lines on China\u2019s sovereignty, security and development interests,\u201d Wang told Blinken ahead of the meeting."
