    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings has confirmed a \u2018BBB(lka)\u2019 insurer rating of Sri Lanka\u2019s National Insurance Trust Fund, with a stable outlook but warned on its inability to get re-insurance cover on time.",
    "The NITF\u2019s major source of revenue is riots, civil commotion and terrorism (SRCCT) premium it gets from other insurers, where claims were not high.",
    "\u201cNITF\u2019s risk-management practices continue to be weak, as evident from its inability to renew reinsurance contracts on time,\u2026\u201d Fitch said.",
    "\u201cWe believe facing unforeseen losses without reinsurance cover could result in heightened volatility for NITF\u2019s capital position and earnings.\u201d",
    "NITF\u2019s retrocession cover had expired in January 2023 and reinsurance cover for SRCCT in July 2023, but firm has not been able to renew them, Fitch said.",
    "Fitch said NITF\u2019s gross premiums would surge in 2024 following a after directive requiring primary insurers to remit 100 percent of motor SRCCT premiums to NITF, up from the previous 12 percent.",
    "SRCCT contributes about 42 percent of gross premiums and dominates NITF\u2019s profitability, since claims are modest.",
    "NITF\u2019s net profit rose by 32 percent to 2023 to 9 billion rupees, on higher investment income and return on equity that averaged 36 percent in the past three years.",
    "But Fitch said the concentration of profitability in SRCCT and restricted cash flow between SRCCT and other lines was viewed as a weakness.",
    "Fitch Affirms National Insurance Trust Fund\u2019s \u2018BBB(lka)\u2019 National IFS; Outlook Stable",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 17 Jul 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based National Insurance Trust Fund Board\u2019s (NITF) \u2018BBB(lka)\u2019 National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating. The Outlook is Stable.",
    "\u2018Moderate\u2019 Company Profile:>/b> We regard the insurer\u2019s company profile as \u2018Moderate\u2019 compared with other domestic insurers, based on a \u2018Favourable\u2019 business profile and \u2018Less Favourable\u2019 corporate governance. NITF\u2019s business profile is supported by its large domestic operating scale and substantive business franchise, which benefits from its full state ownership and role in implementing government policies. Our \u2018Less Favourable\u2019 corporate governance assessment is driven by the weak governance structure and limited financial transparency.",
    "No Reinsurance Cover: NITF\u2019s risk-management practices continue to be weak, as evident from its inability to renew reinsurance contracts on time, following the expiration of NITF\u2019s retrocession cover from January 2023 and reinsurance cover for strikes, riots, civil commotion and terrorism (SRCCT) from July 2023. We believe facing unforeseen losses without reinsurance cover could result in heightened volatility for NITF\u2019s capital position and earnings.",
    "SRCCT to Drive Growth: We expect NITF\u2019s gross premiums to surge in 2024 due to a recent directive requiring primary insurers to remit 100% of motor SRCCT premiums to NITF, up from the previous 12%. SRCCT contributes about 42% of gross premiums and dominates NITF\u2019s profitability, since claims are modest. NITF\u2019s net profit rose by 32% in 2023 to LKR9 billion, on higher investment income and return on equity that averaged 36% in the past three years. However, Fitch views the concentration of profitability in SRCCT and restricted cash flow between SRCCT and other lines as a credit weakness.",
    "The combined ratios for NITF\u2019s reinsurance, motor and health segments surpass 100%, indicating weak underwriting returns due to less flexibility in price revisions in its nonSRCCT segments. In contrast, the consolidated combined ratio improved to 72% in 2023 (2022: 83%), due mainly to a reversal of incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims and claim provisions in the \u201cagrahara\u201d (health) and SRCCT segments. The three-year consolidated combined ratio stood at a favourable 77% compared to non-life peers, bolstered by modest claims from the SRCCT fund and the insurer\u2019s low-cost operating model.",
    "Weak Capital in Non-SRCCT Segments: The insurer\u2019s regulatory capital positions are weak in non-SRCCT lines such as reinsurance and other general insurance segments, with limited ability to transfer capital between business lines. Nonetheless, its consolidated regulatory risk-based capital (RBC) ratio remains robust, largely due to the SRCCT segment, and compares well against the industry average. The RBC ratio rose to 613% by end-2023 (2022: 430%, 2021: 600%) on higher earnings.",
    "Reduced Investment and Liquidity Risks:  Fitch believes investment and liquidity risks have eased following the positive rating action on the Sri Lankan sovereign\u2019s LocalCurrency Long-Term and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings to \u2018CCC-\u2018 and \u2018C\u2019, respectively, as well as on Fitch-rated Sri Lankan bank and non-banking financial institutions in late 2023. NITF\u2019s investments are entirely in government securities, with 97% of the invested assets allocated to sovereign assets such as treasury bonds, treasury bills and repo investments, while the remaining 3% is held in cash and cash equivalents.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade:",
    "\u2013 Rising investment and asset risks, including a downgrade of the ratings of financial institutions or the sovereign",
    "\u2013 Deterioration in the RBC ratio to below 250%, or a significant deterioration in the capital positions of non-SRCCT lines, for a sustained period;",
    "\u2013 Deterioration in the combined ratio to above 103% for a sustained period;",
    "\u2013 Significant weakening in NITF\u2019s company profile, such as a large reduction in government-related business.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade:",
    "\u2013 Improved company profile in terms of better business risk profile and improved riskmanagement practices or broader diversification into stable sources of underwriting profitability.",
