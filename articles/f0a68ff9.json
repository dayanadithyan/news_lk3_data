    "The electricity tariffs will be reduced by 21.9% with effect from midnight today (March 04), the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) announced.",
    "PUCSL chairman Prof. Manjula Fernando revealed this during a press briefing held in Colombo today (04) to deliver its decision on the electricity tariff reduction proposal mooted recently by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).",
    "He explained that the overall average tariff reduction is about 21.9%. \u201cThen accordingly there are consumer groups. There are two categories for the domestic customers, namely those consuming less than 60Kwh and more than 60Kwh.\u201d",
    "He said the electricity tariff of customer groups who are consuming less than 30 units will be reduced from Rs. 12 to Rs. 08 per unit. That is a reduction of around 33.3%.",
    "For consumers who use between 31 \u2013 60 units, the reduction is 28% while for those who consume between 61 \u2013 90 units the tariff reduction is 30%, he said.",
    "The tariff reduction for consumers using between 91 \u2013 180 units will be 24% while for those consuming more than 180 units the tariff reduction is 18%.",
    "In relation to the religious places of worship, he said that overall rate of tariff reduction is 33% while the hotel and industry consumer group will receive around 18% overall rate of reduction.",
    "The tariff reduction rate for general purpose and government institutions is 23%.",
    "\u201cTo come to these final values, we considered two factors. One is to give the maximum benefits to the consumers and the other is to ensure 24/7 power security. That means no power cuts,\u201d the PUCSL chairman said.",
    "The state-owned electricity supplier had submitted its tariff revision proposal to the commission on February 22, 2024.",
    "Last month, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera had informed the parliament that the CEB expects to reduce the rates by at least the same rates and percentages increased in October 2023.",
    "In October last year, the electricity tariffs were raised by 18% for domestic and religious places of worship, by 12% for industries and hotels and by 24% for government institutions."
