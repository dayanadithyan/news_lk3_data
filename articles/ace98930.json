  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved a proposal to amend the Constitution, addressing inconsistencies in the terms of the President and Parliament.",
    "\u201cThe proposed amendment seeks to substitute the phrase \u2018exceeding six years\u2019 with \u2018exceeding five years\u2019, thereby ensuring that both the Presidential and Parliamentary terms are aligned,\u201d Cabinet Co-Spokesman and\u00a0 Minister Bandula Gunawardena said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday.",
    "The decision comes amid Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissing a petition seeking to postpone the upcoming Presidential election. The five-judge bench, led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, rejected the petition by C.D. Lenawa on several grounds. Firstly, they noted the lack of new evidence compared to a similar petition filed in 2019. Additionally, the Attorney General argued that the petitioner\u2019s fundamental rights were not violated as the constitution clearly states a \u2018five year\u2019 Presidential term.",
    "Against this backdrop, Cabinet Co-Spokesman said the move is intended to eliminate any ambiguities and ensure consistency in the Constitution.",
    "The proposed amendment, put forth by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, aims to resolve the discrepancies between Articles 30(2), 62(2), and 83(b) of the Constitution.",
    "Last week, UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara also revealed that President Wickremesinghe has highlighted an inconsistency in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution regarding the President\u2019s tenure.",
    "Speaking at a public meeting in Medawachchiya, Bandara explained that the amendment ambiguously states the President\u2019s term as both five years and six years in different sections.",
    "\u201cTo address this issue, the President has submitted a proposal to the Cabinet on 1 July,\u201d he added."
