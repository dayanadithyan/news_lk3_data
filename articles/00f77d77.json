    "The directive comes on the heels of an incident in the Narammala Police Division, where a lorry driver, 41, was killed after a Police Sub-Inspector (SI) clad in civvies allegedly \u2018accidentally\u2019 discharged his firearm during a vehicle inspection.",
    "The police media division said the driver had failed to comply with the signal to stop at a checkpoint in Dampelessa, Narammala.",
    "The concerned SI and a Constable had then chased down the lorry and pulled it over for a spot inspection, following which the SI had allegedly \u2018accidentally\u2019 discharged his firearm, critically wounding the driver, who was rushed to the Narammala District Hospital, but succumbed to injuries shortly after.",
    "The SI in question was subsequently arrested and remanded until 23 January on the orders of Narammala Magistrate\u2019s Court.",
