    "The presidential candidate of the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera emphasized his commitment to integrating more women into Sri Lanka\u2019s economic landscape.",
    "Addressing a rally held in Kalalgoda, Jayaweera highlighted the pivotal role women play in both family and national prosperity, stating: \u201cOne of the primary reasons for my political foray is the women of Sri Lanka. For years, I have been advocating for greater recognition of their role in our society. We need to harness and support the entrepreneurship of Sri Lankan women.\u201d",
    "\u201cDespite the challenges of a reduced household income and soaring living costs, Sri Lankan women have maintained the integrity and happiness of their families. This is a testament to their entrepreneurial spirit,\u201d he remarked.",
    "He noted that women constitute 53% of the population, yet many remain underrepresented in the economic sector.",
    "\u201cTo enhance Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP, we must ensure that women are more actively involved in the economic process. The management skills demonstrated by women in maintaining family happiness are akin to entrepreneurship. By recognizing and expanding these skills into broader economic roles, we can drive national growth,\u201d Jayaweera argued.",
    "He further said: \u201cSri Lankan women have the capacity to become stars in our economic sphere, given their proven ability to manage and nurture their families. Their potential to influence and drive economic success is immense.\u201d"
