    "U.S. Ambassador Julie Chung says Sri Lanka\u2019s adoption of the controversial Online Safety Bill sends a negative signal in Sri Lanka\u2019s path towards reform and recovery, when major global tech companies characterize the bill as \u201cunworkable\u201d and stifling innovation and democracy, instead of actually addressing online crimes.",
    "She also emphasised that in order improve Sri Lanka\u2019s business climate, the government of Sri Lanka, while carrying out reforms, must also make its people aware of these reforms in a \u2018clear manner\u2019.",
    "Addressing the Amcham XO Forum \u201c75 years and Beyond: U.S. \u2013 Sri Lankan Business Relations in 2024\u201d, Ambassador Chung highlighted that while it is imperative that the Sri Lankan government carries out reforms, \u201cit\u2019s also important to explain those reforms to the people in a clear manner\u201d.",
    "She admitted that while this process inevitably makes for slower legislation, it results in good legislation and reforms.",
    "Taking the controversial Online Safety Bill as an example, Ambassador Chung revealed that according to A poll conducted by the Centre for Policy Alternatives earlier this month, over 70% Sri Lankans were unaware of the bill before its passage.",
    "\u201cWhen major global tech companies characterize the bill as \u201cunworkable\u201d and stifling innovation and democracy, instead of actually addressing online crimes, frankly this sends a negative signal in Sri Lanka\u2019s path towards reform and recovery.\u00a0 Previous bills, such as the Personal Data Protection Act, took much longer to craft, but did a better job of taking stakeholder feedback into account\u201d, she said in this regard.",
    "As such, the Ambassador emphasised that Sri Lanka needs to do better in the future in terms of working on legislation and reforms that are \u2018durable, enforceable and wise\u2019.",
    "\u201cThis will be key to improving the business climate\u201d, Ambassador Chung highlighted.",
    "The Ambassador made these remarks while commenting on the commitments required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from Sri Lanka, as part of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), stating that they \u201ccall for government reform measures in both tax compliance and combatting corruption\u201d",
    "Ambassador Chung admitted that while Sri Lanka has taken difficult measures, that are \u201chard and not always popular, to put the country on a long-term sustainable footing and comply with the IMF commitments, \u201cthe people of Sri Lanka deserve and continue to demand openness, transparency, and accountability from their leaders as the process of reforms moves forward\u201d.",
    "Speaking on the recently increased Value Added Tax (VAT) in this vein, Ambassador Chung said, \u201cThe new higher VAT rates have been a hit on the average Sri Lankan and your businesses.\u00a0 We understand that while there may be short term necessary pains, the public deserves to know that such measures are being taken looking at the wholeness of the problem and endemic issues that must be addressed in a structural, sustainable way, fair and transparent to all\u201d.",
    "She noted, however, that these measures should not solely include the raising of taxes, but should also instead include the elimination of tax loopholes and addressing government inefficiencies, particularly in state owned enterprises.",
    "\u201cIt means digitalizing customs to raise revenue and reduce corruption.\u00a0 Creating predictable customs duties and streamlined processes would encourage importers, who want to import more to Sri Lanka but are worried about the uncertainty in the import process.\u00a0 Unpredictable customs fees discourage importers and limit the amount of customs revenue the Sri Lankan government can collect.\u00a0 This shifts the burden of tax revenue further onto the shoulders of the people, who can\u2019t bear much more\u201d, she said in this regard.",
    "Recalling a meeting she had had with the National Chamber of Exporters earlier this week, Ambassador Chung noted that \u201cred tape, regulatory challenges, and unpredictability\u201d were some of the key challenges that impacted their businesses.",
    "Meanwhile, commenting on Sri Lanka\u2019s future in this regard, the Ambassador opinionated that the growth of both, the exports and private sectors, will be the \u201cengine of recovery\u201d. She noted, however, that \u201cthey need the space and support to thrive\u201d.",
    "\u201cExports and private sector growth will be the engine of recovery, but they need the space and support to thrive.\u00a0 As the largest export market for Sri Lanka, the United States can help be part of the solution\u201d, she commented."
