    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s revolutionaries, whose children study at international schools, oppose education reforms and scuttle any attempt at reforms by taking to the streets, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said.",
    "\u201cThere is one group that is opposed to education reforms. These are revolutionaries who recently became \u2018modern\u2019. They say free education need not be modernised. They say Sri Lanka\u2019s stagnating education must continue the way it is,\u201d Premadasa said speaking at an event.",
    "\u201cEvery time something new is being attempted, what do they do? They take to the streets. They go on paada yatras and hold protests.",
    "\u201cBut did you know? The children of these big revolutionaries study at international schools,\u201d the leader of the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) said.",
    "Acknowledging that disparity in education is a real problem in Sri Lanka, Premadasa said that measures must be taken to address it.",
    "\u201cAn SJB government will be dedicated to achieving that change,\u201d he said.",
    "The SJB is currently lagging behind the leftist National People\u2019s Power (NPP) in at least one voting intentions poll.",
    "The NPP is led and controlled by the Janatha Vimukathi Peramuna (JVP), a Marxist-Leninist party that led two unsuccessful attempts to overthrow the government and capture state power, resulting in two of Sri Lanka\u2019s most violent periods.",
    "The JVP has historically been harshly critical of private participation in the education sector, particularly in higher education. (Colombo/Mar01/2024)"
