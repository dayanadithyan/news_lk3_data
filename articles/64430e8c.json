    "Colombo, Feb 01 (Daily Mirror) -\u00a0In the wake of the government failing to provide a concrete solution to their grievances, the health sector trade unions have decided to continue the island-wide strike till Friday (02 Feb.).",
    "This was confirmed by Ravi Kumudesh, the Convenor of the Health Service Trade Unions.",
    "The decision to extend the strike, according to Kumudesh, stems from the government's failure to grant reasonable allowances as granted to the doctors in the form of the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT).",
    "This announcement follows the launch of a comprehensive one-day strike across the nation this morning (01 Feb.) by a consortium of 72 health sector trade unions, urging immediate attention from the authorities.",
    "Despite the widespread participation in the strike, notable exceptions include the doctors\u2019 unions and the All Ceylon Nurses\u2019 Union, which have chosen to distance themselves from the collective action."
