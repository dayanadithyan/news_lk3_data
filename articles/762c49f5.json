    "\u201cWe implemented measures to turn Hambanthota into an aviation and naval hub.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the good governance government put an end to those measures.\u00a0 After the 22nd of September, we expect to turn hambanthota into South Asia\u2019s hub of aviation and naval affairs once again, creating close to a million direct and indirect employment opportunities\u201d, Rajapaksa claimed.",

Let\u2019s work to ensure that the policies we believe in, win in the upcoming election. The SLPP will definitely win this election.\u201d"
