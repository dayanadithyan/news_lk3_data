    "The Thera expressed these concerns during a conversation with Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member and Parliamentarian Prof. G.L. Peiris, who visited the Asgiriya Vihara yesterday.",
    "He also emphasised that there is no need to postpone the elections.",
    "Peiris also pointed out to the Thera that according to the Constitution, the President\u2019s term of office is unequivocally five years, a principle affirmed by the Supreme Court in two prior rulings.",
    "He also emphasised that the Government should allow the Election Commission to fulfil its role at this time.",
    "Speaking to those gathered, the Registrar of the Asgiriya chapter, Medagama Dhammananda Thera expressed concern that politicians frequently instigate multiple crises, causing people to endure immense pressure and live in despair.",
    "He said politicians should prioritise actions to uplift the lives of the people, but instead, there is a prevalent focus and tendency to criticise each other while discussing retaining or gaining power.",
