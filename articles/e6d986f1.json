  "original_body_lines": [
    "Large chunks of Australia\u2019s Victoria state lost power on Tuesday afternoon when a major power plant shut down because a storm knocked out parts of the state\u2019s electricity transmission network.",
    "AGL\u2019s Loy Yang A power station, responsible for about a third of the state\u2019s power, was forced to shut down on Tuesday afternoon after several towers along a major section of the state\u2019s transmission network collapsed in bad weather.",
    "More than 500,000 homes or businesses had lost power, state energy minister Lily D\u2019Ambrosio said in a social media post.",
    "As the plant shut down, electricity prices spiked across the state to their maximum of A$16,600 per megawatt hour, up from around A$200, according to data from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).",
    "In response, AEMO ordered electricity usage cut across the network, according to a statement on Tuesday afternoon.",
    "D\u2019Ambrosio said in her post that one of Loy Yang\u2019s four units had been brought back online and the mandatory power cuts had ended.",
    "AGL said in a statement it was working to bring three of Loy Yang\u2019s units back online through Tuesday evening.",
    "\u201cWe continue to work with AEMO and stakeholders to investigate the cause of the issue.\u201d",
    "The failure comes amid repeated warnings from AEMO that urgent investment is required to ensure power supply remains reliable as the country\u2019s fleet of aging coal-fired power plants are retired."
