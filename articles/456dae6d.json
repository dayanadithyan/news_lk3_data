    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Officials of the crisis-riddled Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) are contradicting each other over the appointment of Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as SLFP acting chairman.",
    "SLFP spokesmen also disagree over Rajapakshe\u2019s purported candidacy at the upcoming presidential election.",
    "Agriculture Minister and SLFP senior vice president Mahinda Amaraweera claimed at a press conference on Tuesday April 23 that Rajapakshe\u2019s appointment as acting chairman was made by a group of people that do not represent the party\u2019s executive committee.",
    "\u201cWe are reliably informed that there was some coercing and threats. There was also the involvement of the security detail deployed for former presidents,\u201d Amaraweera claimed.",
    "The minister represents a faction of the SLFP that opposes former President Maithripala Sirisena, whom the Colombo District Court has issued an enjoining order against, preventing him from serving as SLFP chairman.",
    "Sirisena was replaced by Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, whom the anti-Sirisena faction of the SLFP politburo appointed.",
    "SLFP Deputy Vice President Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa, a Sirisena loyalist, however, said that de Silva\u2019s appointment was illegal.",
    "\u201cThe interim injunction applies to Nimal Siripala de Silva and Faiszer Mustapha as well. They illegally convened something called a politburo. Only the chairman can convene that. If there is a crisis, it must be deferred to the general secretary,\u201d said Piyadasa speaking to reporters on Tuesday.",
    "Meanwhile, SLFP organisers are also split over the appointment of Justice Minister Rajapakshe as another \u2018acting chairman\u2019 by the pro-Sirisena faction.",
    "Ratnapura organiser Priyantha Karunatillake told reporters on Tuesday that the party\u2019s executive committee was not affected by the court\u2019s verdict.",
    "\u201cSo the convening of this committee and the appointments were all legal, clearly.",
    "\u201cThe party will contest the coming elections. From what we understand, Acting Chairman Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe will contest the presidential election,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAt a time when it is widely believed that ministers are not good, the government\u2019s Justice Minister has been brought in and they\u2019re making a different deal now,\u201d he claimed. (Colombo/Apr24/2024)"
