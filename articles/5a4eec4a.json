    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will need to either connect to India or set up a nuclear power plant if the country is to reach its renewable energy targets due the country\u2019s weather patterns, a researcher and policy advocate has said.",
    "Sri Lanka has set ambitious goals for renewable electricity generation by 2030, apparently without much prior study or any costs being revealed when the target was set by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "Rohan Pethiyagoda, a taxonomist and researcher who had also been senior state officials involved in policy at one time said overall Sri Lanka used a large volume of biomass (firewood) for cooking.",
    "\u201cWe need to recognize, of course, that about 60 percent of Sri Lankan households still use firewood as their primary fuel,\u201d Pethiyagoda told a climate forum organized by Sri Lanka\u2019s Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.",
    "\u201cBless them, because they reduce our dependence on fossil fuels for cooking. Even the tea industry, one of our largest exports, uses biomass as its primary fuel for about 90 percent of its production.\u201d",
    "In the electricity sector, where the renewable lobby and other activists oppose coal on the basis of carbon emissions based on international trends, as well as dust, base load still has to be generated if thermal generators are replaced.",
    "Solar power is available only for a few hours in daytime and it can also vary depending on cloud cover.",
    "Hydro power (run of the river plants) is more stable but is dependent on rain. Large hydros with storage can be used for peaks, industry analysts say.",
    "Wind is available throughout the day but can also be unstable. The problem of variability (non-firm energy) can be solved to some extent through ramping and battery storage at additional cost, analysts say.",
    "A renewable plant in Poonakary with battery storage was priced at around 48 to 49 rupees (about 15 US cents) based on public statements.",
    "Meanwhile Pethiyagoda said Sri Lanka\u2019s weather patterns created an additional problem.",
    "\u201cWe have this unusual thing for our renewable energy in Sri Lanka, that at the tail end of the northeast monsoon, from about December to April, we have a dry period in this country, which means that our hydro potential during those months goes down,\u201d Pethiyagoda said.",
    "\u201cNow, as luck would have it, our wind potential goes down at the same time.\u201d",
    "As a result, Sri Lanka needs a reliable alternative to the current coal baseload.",
    "\u201cSo for that reason especially, we need to look at either connecting to India\u2019s grid in the long term or having a nuclear facility in Sri Lanka if we want to be low carbon. And of course, we need to replace our vehicle fleet.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd our base load can probably come from nuclear,\u201d Pethiyagoda said.",
    "\u201cBut whichever way we do it, the cheaper way would be for us to connect to India\u2019s grid.",
    "\u201cWhichever way we do it, we\u2019re looking at an investment of about 40 billion dollars. And then we have the problem of looking at how wind and solar will behave.\u201d",
    "It was not clear what the 40 billion dollar investments would be made up of.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s external debt as at December 2024, including unpaid principal after default was 37.3 billion US dollars.",
    "In 2021 when the 70 percent target was unveiled in President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s election manifesto power engineers said a 53 percent energy share planned for 2030 in a general plan at the time was was equal to that of Germany.",
    "Pushing up the share to 70 percent would require billions of dollars of extra investments, they said.",
    "Sri Lanka generation plan renewable power share for 2030 equal to Germany: CEB engineers",
    "After the central bank cut rates and triggered an external default however, Sri Lanka growth, and power demand in the next few years is expected to be lower than before extreme macro-economic policy.",
    "Related Sri Lanka to invest US$11bn by 2030 to meet renewable target",
    "In 2023, the CEB said about 11 billion US dollars would be needed to meet the 70 percent target. (Colombo/June19/2024)"
