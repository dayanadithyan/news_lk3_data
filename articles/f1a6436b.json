    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka hopes to resume talks with bondholders after the International Monetary Fund assesses their latest proposal of the ad hoc group that deals with the country, State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe said.",
    "Sri Lanka initiated the first round of face-to-face discussions with bondholders in March where proposals and counter proposals were exchanged and agreement was reached to issue bonds linked to economic performance.",
    "However, Sri Lanka had not agreed to the triggers nor the actual quantum of upside and the latest April proposal had not been assessed by the International Monetary Fund to ensure whether it was in line with a debt sustainability assessment. Their earlier proposal in March was assessed to be insufficient.",
    "\u201cThe next steps would entail further consultation with the IMF staff regarding assessments of the compatibility of the latest proposals with program parameters,\u201d Semasinghe said.",
    "\u201cFollowing these consultations, we hope to continue discussions with the bondholders with a view to reaching common ground ahead of the IMF board consideration of the second review of Sri Lanka\u2019s EFF program.\u201d",
    "Bondholders are insisting on a GDP link as they believe IMF GDP growth projections \u2013 which determine the quantum of debt service or the Gross Financing Need \u2013 is too narrow.",
    "Bondholders also proposed a governance linked security (ESG bond) initiated by Sri Lanka\u2019s Verete Research.",
    "\u201c..[C]onfidential discussions held in recent weeks with bondholders\u2019 representatives proved constructive, building on the restructuring proposals presented by both parties,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cDuring the talks both sides successfully bridged a number of technical issues enabling important progress to be made.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka articulated key remaining concerns that need to be addressed in a satisfactory manner.\u201d"
