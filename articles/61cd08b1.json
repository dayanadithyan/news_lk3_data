    "If you are to grab the spotlight, in a big way, in the scene here, and have the masses on your side, you have got to do songs in the official language, and that\u2019s Sinhala.",
    "Janaka Palapathwala, who has changed his stage name to JPal, and whose Elvis/Jim Reeves style of singing, has the support of music lovers, overseas, is now keen to broaden his fan base here.",
    "Says Janaka: \u201cYou need Sinhala songs in your repertoire, and originals, as well. Without Sinhala songs, it\u2019s very difficult to make it big in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cThe masses, and the electronic media, won\u2019t accept anything other than Sinhala, so we need to give them what they want.\u201d",
    "And, with that in mind, Janaka moved into action and is now in the process of completing two Sinhala originals.",
    "\u201cI have an extremely talented lot of folks helping me to put together my Sinhala originals and I\u2019m quite certain both songs will be welcomed by the masses.\u201d",
    "The recordings are being done at one of the most modern studios in the island \u2013 Sonexco.",
    "Helping Janaka to make his dream a reality are Krishantha Deepal de Silva (Project Coordinator), Priyantha Gamage (keyboard/piano), Buddhika Perera (lead and rhythm guitar), Sangeeth Wickamasinghe (bass guitar), Manjula Kaluarachchi (drums), Muditha Settinayake (mandolin), Rushan Manuranga (sound engineer) and Kuma D (lyrics/music/melody).\u201d",
    "Janaka went on to say that of the two Sinhala originals, one is a romantic ballad, and the other is a Baila\u2026and that\u2019s in keeping with the happenings in the scene here where the Baila is heard here, there and everywhere!",
    "However, Janaka\u2019s Elvis/Jim Reeves singing style has brought him fame, overseas, and he has performed quite a few times in the USA and Canada.",
    "JPal (Janaka Palapathwala): Without Sinhala songs, it\u2019s very difficult to make it big in Sri Lanka",
    "In fact, there is an overseas tour coming up for Janaka \u2013 Summer and Autumn Tour of the USA 2024.",
    "Referring to the change of name, Janaka said that those abroad find it difficult to pronounce his real name Janaka Palapathwala.",
    "\u201cPalapathwala is a tongue twister so I opted for JPal as my stage name.\u201d",
    "Janaka also indicated that once the two Sinhala originals are completed, the visuals, too, will be finalised, and then he will work on material for an album.",
