    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s economy will fall if the debt restructuring process is started again on an alternative debt sustainability analysis (DSA) to the one that has already been prepared with the International Monetary Fund, opposition legislator Harsha de Silva said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s National People\u2019s Power party has proposed that external debt is restructured on an alternate DSA.",
    "\u201cI am telling you, if you try to do that, the country will fall,\u201d de Silva told reporters in Colombo Saturday.",
    "\u201cThere are no two words (dekak ne). It was I who first said to go the IMF in parliament in August 2020. At the time they made fun of us and did not take it seriously.",
    "\u201cI am not telling an alternative DSA cannot be done. But if you do that, we have to exit the currency process. It will take more time. May be a year or more I do not know. Then all the current negotiations will fall. Then they will have to start new negotiations.",
    "\u201cThe Samagi Jana Balawegaya is not prepared to put the country at such a risk. Sri Lanka is at a very risky situation. Who will be accountable?",
    "De Silva said the DSA has been updated, but it has not led to any change in the parameters of the program.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee interest rates were also elevated before domestic debt restructuring. They fell after final debt restructuring plan was announced.",
    "However of late, bond yields have started to get up. Sovereign bond prices have also fallen. (Colombo/Aug08/2024)"
