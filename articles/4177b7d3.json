    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 About 300 central bank staff out of 1,200 are employed in the Employees Provident Fund and related work, Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said, with the function due to be transferred to a separate agency after a revamp of its governing law.",
    "\u201cWhen it comes to the EPF there is an obvious conflict of interest. We are very happy to take that function out,\u201d  Governor Weerasinghe told a forum organized by Colombo-based Advocata Institute.",
    "\u201cWe have about 300 staff out of 1,200 including contract staff, almost 150 of permanent staff is employed to run this huge operation. I don\u2019t think the central bank should be doing this business,\u201d",
    "The EPF had come under fire in the past over questionable investments in stocks and also bonds.",
    "In addition, the central bank also faced a conflict of interest because it had another agency function to sell bonds for the Treasury at the lowest possible price, not to mention its monetary policy functions.",
    "\u201cThere has been a lot of allegations on the management of this fund. This is the biggest fund of the private sector; about 2.6 million active, I think about 10 million accounts.",
    "\u201cWhen it comes to EPF, obviously there\u2019s another thing. We obviously have, in terms of resources, on the Central Bank, that has a clear conflict because we are responsible for the members.",
    "\u201cWe have to give them a, as a custodian of the fund, we have to give them a maximum return for the members.",
    "\u201cFor us to get the maximum return, on one hand, we determine the interest rates as multi-policy. On the other hand, we are managing public debt as a, raising funds for the government.",
    "\u201cAnd on the third hand, this EPF is investing 90 percent in government securities. And also, interest rates we determine, and they want to get the maximum interest. That\u2019s a clear conflict, obviously, there\u2019s no question.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s up to the government or the members to determine to establish a new institution that has a trust and credibility and confidence of the members that this institution will be able to manage and secure an interest and give them a reasonable return, good return for their lifetime savings,\u201d Governor Weerasinghe said.",
    "\u201cThe question is that how whether we have whether we can develop that institution, whether we have the strong institution with accountability and the proper governance for this thing.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think it should be given completely to a private sector business to run that. Because one is that here we have no regulatory institution. Pension funds are not a regulated business.",
    "\u201cFirst one is we need to establish, government should establish a regulatory agency to regulate not only the EPF business fund, there are several other similar funds are not properly regulated.",
    "\u201cOnce we have proper regulations like we regulate banks, then we can have a can ensure proper practices are basically adopted by all these institutions.",
    "\u201cThen you can develop an institution that we who can run this and can be taken back by the Labour Department. I\u2019m not sure Labour Department has the capacity to do all these things.\u201d",
    "While some EPF managers had come under scrutiny during the bondscam and for questionable stock investments, in recent years, it had earned better returns under the central bank management than some private funds that underwent debt restructuring according to capital market analysts with knowledge of he matter.
