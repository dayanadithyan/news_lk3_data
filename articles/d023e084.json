    "The Democratic National Alliance (DTNA) reportedly held discussions this week about fielding a common Tamil candidate for the upcoming Presidential election. The DTNA comprises several Tamil political parties, including Crusaders for Democracy, Democratic People\u2019s Liberation Front (DPLF), People\u2019s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), Eelam People\u2019s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation (TELO). The DTNA holds opposing views to the rival Tamil National Alliance (TNA).",
    "On Monday, DTNA party leaders met and discussed the idea of fielding a common Tamil candidate, agreeing not to support a candidate from the mainstream political parties. Sources indicated that the proposal to field a common candidate was initially brought forward by the EPRLF, led by former MP Suresh Premachandran.",
    "The TNA previously dismissed proposals to field a candidate representing the North, while the Tamil National People\u2019s Front (TNPF), led by MP Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, has called for a boycott of the upcoming Presidential election by the Tamil community. The TNPF urged Tamils to abstain from voting until their aspirations are addressed."
