    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings said it was confirming an A-(lka) rating on Sri Lanka\u2019s DFCC Bank Plc with a stable outlook, amid an improvement in operating environment, indicated by headline macroeconomic indicators.",
    "Fitch said it expected the country\u2019s stabilising economic conditions to support DFCC\u2019s ability to generate and defend business volumes, \u201cbut the bank\u2019s predominant exposure to the persisting domestic OE risks constrains its business profile.\u201d",
    "DFCC\u2019s net loans in total assets inched up to 56.9% by end-1Q24 from 54.1% in 2023, reversing a contracting trend since 2021 (74.9%), reflecting early signs of lending resumption, the rating agency said.",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 22 Jul 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based DFCC Bank PLC\u2019s (DFCC) National Long-Term Rating at \u2018A-(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed DFCC\u2019s senior and subordinated debt ratings of \u2018A-(lka)\u2019 and \u2018BBB(lka)\u2019, respectively.",
    "Intrinsic Profile Drives Rating: DFCC\u2019s National Long-Term Rating reflects its own financial strength, which is highly influenced by exposure to the sovereign\u2019s weak credit profile (Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): RD; Long-Term Local-Currency IDR: CCC-) and the ongoing sovereign debt restructuring, which had",
    "been putting pressure on the bank\u2019s credit profile. The rating also reflects DFCC\u2019s modest domestic franchise as Sri Lanka\u2019s eighth-largest commercial bank.",
    "Stabilising OE: Sri Lankan banks\u2019 operating environment (OE) continues to show signs of stabilisation, as evident in sustained improvements in reported headline macroeconomic indicators, supporting the recovery in banks\u2019 operational flexibility.",
    "Further improvement to the banks\u2019 OE remains contingent on successful execution of the sovereign\u2019s external debt-restructuring exercise alongside the restoration of the sovereign\u2019s creditworthiness, given the strong link between sovereign financial health and banks\u2019 operating conditions.",
    "Lending Likely to Resume: Fitch expects Sri Lanka\u2019s stabilising economic conditions to support DFCC\u2019s ability to generate and defend business volumes, but the bank\u2019s predominant exposure to the persisting domestic OE risks constrains its business profile.",
    "DFCC\u2019s net loans in total assets inched up to 56.9% by end-1Q24 from 54.1% in 2023, reversing a contracting trend since 2021 (74.9%), reflecting early signs of lending resumption.",
    "Sovereign Risk Lingers: DFCC\u2019s risk profile is linked closely to the sovereign credit and market risk, with just over a quarter of assets in rupee-denominated treasury securities at end-2023. We estimate DFCC\u2019s exposure to defaulted foreign currency-sovereign instruments to be one of the lowest among peers. That said, this significant overall exposure makes the bank vulnerable to sovereign\u2019s repayment capacity and liquidity position.",
    "Asset-Quality Risks Prevail: We estimate DFCC\u2019s impaired (stage 3) loans ratio at 1Q24 to have remained flat at 18%, the highest among the large-private banks (peer average: 12.9%). Fitch expects a modest improvement in the ratio over the near- to medium-term due to focused recoveries, improved borrower repayment capacity, and anticipated loan book expansion. The sovereign exposure continues to weigh on the bank\u2019s asset quality.",
    "Profitability to Normalise: DFCC\u2019s operating profit/ risk weighted assets ratio improved to 6.8% in 1Q24 from 4.1% in 2023, above the large private banks\u2019 peer average of 5.2%, supported by the zero-risk weighted high-yielding government security portfolio. The bank\u2019s planned growth in loans \u2013 attracting significantly higher risk weights \u2013 and the declining yields in government securities should see this ratio normalising over the",
    "Thin Capital Buffers: DFCC\u2019s bank-level common equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio at end1Q24 was 10.4% (group level 11.3%), the lowest among the large private banks (peer average: 14.2%). We estimate the ratio to have improved by approximately 79bp if 1Q24 profit were included. The bank\u2019s CET 1 ratio is currently benefitting from the low risk weights attributable to government securities. In our view, the bank\u2019s thin capital buffers, relative to peers, conditions its ability to expand the loan book \u2013 which attracts higher risk weighting.",
    "Funding and Liquidity Risks Ease: We believe the favourable external sector flows and the bank\u2019s focus on liquidity preservation have subsided stresses on funding and liquidity and reduced the risk of bank failure. That said, DFCC\u2019s funding and liquidity profile, particularly in foreign currency, remains susceptible to sudden changes in creditor sentiment driven by adverse changes to the sovereign\u2019s credit profile, similar to peers.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "The bank\u2019s National Rating is sensitive to a change in the bank\u2019s creditworthiness relative to other Sri Lankan issuers.",
    "A deterioration in DFCC\u2019s key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers would also lead to increased pressure on its rating, which is driven by its intrinsic financial strength.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "Positive rating action on the sovereign may lead to an upgrade. A sustained improvement in key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers, could also lead to an upgrade.",
    "OTHER DEBT AND ISSUER RATINGS: KEY RATING DRIVERS SENIOR DEBT",
    "DFCC\u2019s outstanding senior unsecured debentures are rated at the same level as its National Long-Term Rating in accordance with Fitch\u2019s criteria. This is because the issue ranks equally with the claims of the bank\u2019s other senior unsecured creditors.",
    "DFCC\u2019s Basel III-compliant Sri Lankan rupee-subordinated debt is rated two notches below the National Long-Term Rating anchor. This reflects Fitch\u2019s baseline notching for loss severity for this type of debt and our expectations of poor recoveries. There is no additional notching for non-performance risks, as the notes do not incorporate goingconcern loss-absorption features.",
    "The senior and subordinated debt ratings will move in tandem with the bank\u2019s National Long-Term Rating.",
