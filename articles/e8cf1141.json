The new collaboration between the two will further enhance the distribution, availability of high-quality products and market presence of Sierra Cables in Maldives while contributing to the ongoing development and growth of the region\u2019s infrastructure in keeping with the company\u2019s growing global footprint.",
    "Sierra Cables currently fulfils orders from Sri Lanka for client projects and retail stockists in the Maldives. With this, the company has recognised the need for an improved and structured approach in order to maximise its sales presence in the Maldivian market and the collaboration with ASK Holdings is a significant step in strengthening Sierra Cables\u2019 overseas marketing strategy.",
    "With its network of showrooms across the Maldives, ASK Holdings has and continues to be a vital contributor towards Sierra Cables\u2019 sales.

Serving a diverse range of sectors spanning energy, industrial, speciality and communications markets in Sri Lanka and beyond, today, the company has expanded its reach to Asia, Eastern Europe, Australia, North America and various regions across Africa. This market penetration has been attributed to Sierra Cables\u2019 ability to obtain the most stringent international certifications and its advanced manufacturing facilities in several global locations along with the presence of a dedicated marketing team in the Maldives as well.",
