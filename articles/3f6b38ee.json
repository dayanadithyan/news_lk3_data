Police say the bodies of his wife, four children, and an acquaintance were then found inside the home.

De-zoysa is to be produced in court on March 14. Unconfirmed reports said that De-zoysa, who had been living in the basement of the Wickremesinghe family home, had also been an avid gamer.",
    "Canadian news outlet CBC News spoke to one of the family\u2019s neighbours, identified as Hilal Ahmed, who claimed to have been contacted by Dhanushka, with the intention of hiring him\u00a0as an accountant. Ahmed, who stated that he had not met Dhanushka but corresponded via email and telephone, said that Dhanushka had told him that he arrived in Canada in September 2011\u00a0on a student-work visa.",
    "Dhanushka had then moved to Barrhaven, when his wife and children joined from Sri Lanka in July last year, Ahmed added.",
    "Bhante Suneetha, a resident monk and director of the Hilda Jayewardenaramaya Buddhist Monastery, speaking to CBC said that Dhanushka\u2019s family had only been in Canada for about a\u00a0year. Dhanushka arrived first in 2020 after completing his education and getting a work permit, the monk claimed. Last year said, Dhanushka\u2019s wife who had been pregnant at the time,\u00a0joined him with their three children. A representative of Uber confirmed to CBC that Dhanushka was employed as a driver for their service. Suneetha meanwhile said Dhanushka\u00a0had also opened a cleaning business.",
    "Suneetha who had visited Dhanushka in hospital Thursday said that the victim told him that he arrived home from his evening cleaning job Wednesday night to be attacked as he entered\u00a0the house. He said Dhanushka had part of two fingers cut off, but one has been repaired. He also suffered a slash across his face between his nose and his eye and stab wounds to the chest\u00a0and back.",
    "Suneetha also said that the family had thrown a birthday party for de Zoysa, when he turned 19, last week.",
    "\u201cThis was a senseless act of violence perpetrated on purely innocent people,\u201d said Ottawa Police Chief Eric Stubbs, who said a knife or other edged weapon was used in the attack.",
    "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has condemned the mass killing calling it an act of \u201cterrible violence\u201d. \u201cObviously, our first reactions are all ones of shock and horror at this terrible violence,\u201dtrudeau told media.\u201cwe\u2019re expecting that the community reaches out to support family and friends, as Canadians always do. And we expect the police of jurisdiction to be\u00a0doing the work and keeping us all informed of this terrible tragedy.\u201d"
