    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 As Sri Lanka\u2019s population declines, the island nation must modernise its agriculture and orient it towards emerging export markets whose own populations are on the rise, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "Speaking at an event, Wickremesinghe said a modernised agriculture is the means with Sri Lanka can become an export economy and lift rural communities out of poverty.",
    "\u201cAgriculture is what stabilises the economy. We can\u2019t keep living on loans. That\u2019s why we have decided to turn this country into an export economy. The cabinet on Monday approved the draft legislations needed for an export economy.",
    "\u201cNow we\u2019re trying to modernise agriculture and go for an export industry. That needs to be done. Agriculture is the way to eliminate poverty in our villages. For this, we need a modern agriculture,\u201d he said.",
    "The president predicted that by 2048, Sri Lanka\u2019s population will have declined by about one million, though a population boom of nearly one billion could be expected in neighbouring regions, from Africa to Indonesia.",
    "\u201cThey will have to be fed, and food will have to be supplied to a strong middle class in those regions. That\u2019s going to be our market. We must get ready for that,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cWe sell tea to Europe now, and that\u2019s good, but population is declining in Europe too. So we must move to new places, and cultivate. It\u2019s not the traditional plantation that we\u2019re expecting. We want to develop a new agribusiness,\u201d he said.",
    "In February this year, President Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka needs to adopt modern agriculture techniques and involve the private sector to develop the sector.",
    "\u201cOur first step is to restructure the existing system and involve the private sector,\u201d Wickremesinghe said at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s 37th Asia and Pacific Conference in Colombo on February 20.",
    "\u201cWhen assessing our economy, agriculture emerges as a sector capable of delivering swift results,\u201d Wickremesinghe said. \u201cWe are endeavouring to transform agrarian service centres nationwide into modernization hubs for agriculture. To achieve this goal, we are actively seeking contributions from both the public and private sectors.\u201d (Colombo/May15/2024)"
