  "original_body_lines": [
    "Prof. Channa Jayasumana says that the recent statement made by leader of the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake regarding the chronic kidney disease spreading associated with agricultural communities in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts is completely false.",
    "The Parliamentarian, who was a researcher on epidemic kidney disease in agricultural communities in Sri Lanka, alleged that research has already confirmed the cause of kidney disease in these areas.",
    "\u201cThere is nothing new to discover about this, nor any new treatment to be found. We have been conducting research on the matter for 15 years, and all the facts have been revealed\u201d, he said.",
    "\u201cTwo main causes have been identified for this kidney disease: one is the impact of certain types of agrochemicals, and the other is long-term dehydration.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe solution is to provide clean drinking water to the people in these areas. We have been supplying drinking water to these areas through water filtrations systems continuously since 2011. As a result, this agricultural kidney disease is being reduced\u201d, Jayasumana expressed.",
    "\u201cThis statement was made by Mr. Anura Kumara after seeing a large crowd\u201d, he charged.",
    "On Saturday (22), NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the cause of the chronic kidney disease that is spreading in the agricultural communities associated with the North Central Province will be identified through research in near future under an NPP government.",
    "He had made this remark while addressing a farmers\u2019 rally of the National People\u2019s Power held in Dehiattakandiya yesterday."
