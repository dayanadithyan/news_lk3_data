  "original_body_lines": [
    "A key ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged support to him on Wednesday and was set to attend a meeting to discuss forming a coalition government, boosting Modi\u2019s chances of a record-equalling third term in office.",
    "Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist party lost its outright majority in parliament in a surprise election verdict on Tuesday, and he will need support from partners in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to form the government.",
    "On Wednesday, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), a key regional player in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh which is in the alliance, said it stood firmly with Modi and his party.",
    "\u201cWe are with the NDA, I will be attending the meeting in Delhi today,\u201d Chandrababu Naidu, the leader of the TDP, told reporters.",
    "The NDA won 293 seats in 543-member lower house of parliament, more than the 272 needed to form a government.",
    "Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was held back to 240 seats on its own, spooking investors and causing concerns about the government\u2019s reform agenda. The TDP won 16 seats and other allies won the rest of the NDA total.",
    "The weakened majority for Modi\u2019s alliance could pose challenges for the more ambitious elements of the government\u2019s reform agenda, ratings agency Fitch said.",
    "However, it added: \u201cDespite the slimmer majority, we do expect broad policy continuity to persist, with the government retaining its focus on its capex push, ease of doing business measures, and gradual fiscal consolidation.\u201d",
    "Newspapers said Modi\u2019s halo had dimmed, with the Indian Express\u2019s banner headline reading \u201cIndia gives NDA a third term, Modi a message.\u201d",
    "Modi\u2019s own victory in his seat of Varanasi, considered one of the holiest cities for Hindus, was subdued, with his margin of victory down from nearly 500,000 votes at the last general election in 2019 to a little over 150,000.",
    "But this reduced victory may not necessarily mean reform paralysis, the chairman of a government finance panel, Arvind Panagariya, said in an editorial in the Economic Times newspaper.",
    "\u201cDespite the reduced majority in parliament, the necessary reforms are entirely feasible. Delivering sustained growth at a accelerated pace can only strengthen the government\u2019s hand in the coming years,\u201d he said.",
    "The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi\u2019s centrist Congress party won 230 seats, more than forecast. Congress alone won 99, almost double the 52 it won in 2019 - a surprise jump that is expected to boost Gandhi\u2019s standing.",
    "The INDIA alliance was also expected to meet on Wednesday in New Delhi, and discuss a future course of action."
