  "original_title": "Elon Musk sues ChatGPT-maker OpenAI over Microsoft links",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Elon Musk is suing OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, arguing it has breached the principles he agreed to when he helped found it in 2015.",
    "The lawsuit \u2013 which has also been filed against OpenAI boss Sam Altman \u2013 says the firm has departed from its original non-profit, open source mission.",
    "It says instead of trying to \u201cbenefit humanity\u201d \u2013 as it was set up to do \u2013 it is focusing on \u201cmaximising profits\u201d for major investor Microsoft.",
    "The firm was created with the intention of building what\u2019s known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2013 AI that can perform any task a human being is capable of.",
    "It was also set up as a not-for-profit company, meaning it would not aim to make money.",
    "The lawsuit, which has been filed in San Francisco, states it was under these conditions, that Mr Musk agreed to found OpenAI, along with Mr Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman. He left three years later.",
    "\u201cThis case is filed to compel OpenAI to adhere to the Founding Agreement and return to its mission to develop AGI for the benefit of humanity, not to personally benefit the individual Defendants and the largest technology company in the world,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
    "The filing comes after the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that US regulators had begun to probe the ChatGPT creator over whether investors had been misled, following boardroom drama at OpenAI in November 2023. It saw Mr Altman suddenly ousted from the board, before being reinstated at the helm several days later.",
    "The board at the time accused Mr Altman of not being \u201cconsistently candid in his communications\u201d, and said as a result they had \u201clost confidence\u201d in his leadership. It was a row Microsoft became deeply embroiled in \u2013 including an offer to take on any staff who quit OpenAI.",
    "Mr Musk had said in a post on X \u2013 formerly Twitter \u2013 that he was \u201cvery worried\u201d by the situation. His lawyers now say in this lawsuit that these \u201cstunning developments\u201d highlight Microsoft\u2019s increased influence over the company.",
    "\u201cIts technology, including GPT-4, is closed-source primarily to serve the proprietary commercial interests of Microsoft,\u201d it says.",
    "Microsoft\u2019s initial $1bn backing of OpenAI in 2019 came shortly after the AI firm \u2013 previously operating as a non-profit \u2013 announced a new \u201ccapped profit\u201d structure which would allow investment in it. Microsoft\u2019s investment swelled to a multi-year, multi-billion partnership in January 2023 following the launch of OpenAI\u2019s chatbot, ChatGPT.",
    "The partnership is now being examined by UK, EU and US regulators.",
    "The lawsuit also alleges that details about the design of OpenAI\u2019s most recent AI model, GPT-4, were kept secret. \u201cOn information and belief, this secrecy is primarily driven by commercial considerations, not safety,\u201d it says.",
    "Mr Musk announced his own AI start-up called xAI in July 2023, citing its mission as being to \u201cunderstand reality\u201d. It developed Grok, its own chatbot with a little humor,\u00a0 to try and rival the likes of ChatGPT in November that year.",
    "Mr Musk\u2019s lawyers say, among other desired outcomes of the lawsuit, they want OpenAI to be ordered to continue making information relating to its AI developments available to the public.",
