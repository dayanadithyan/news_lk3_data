  "original_title": "Raffealla Fernando Face of Sri Lanka for Prerna Gupta",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "It\u2019s not only her name that is famous but her face, too, and I\u2019m referring, of course, to Raffealla Fernando \u2013 Founder and CEO at Raffealla Fernando Photography, and Fashion Designer and Stylist at Raffealla \u2013 who excels in what she does and shines bright wherever she goes.",
    "Raffealla was in India recently and, I\u2019m told, her face did bright up the fashion scene over there. And, guess what! Raffealla is now the face of Sri Lanka for Prerna Gupta as she expands her unique fashion label to take in Sri Lanka, as well.",
    "Prerna Gupta couture is an award-winning Indian fashion house, from Nagpur, and she creates beautiful sustainable outfits and textiles made out of milk, aloe vera and orange peel, and what Raffealla is wearing in the photographs, on this page, are clothes made out of orange peel, aloe vera and milk.",
    "Prerna Gupta has launched and showcased at reputed fashion shows where celebrities like Vicky Kaushal, Rani Mukherjee, Raj Kumar Arao, Evelyn Sharma, Sana Khan, Kailash Kher, Shankar Mahadevan and Bhapi Leheri have visited and adorned her label.",
    "Says Raffealla: \u201cI feel truly honoured and privileged to be working with a brand like this.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s celebrity was also featured in the leading Bangladesh fashion magazine \u2018Fashion People\u2019.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m super hyped because it\u2019s the first time FELLA got featured in an international magazine.\u201d",
    "And FELLA is the brand name for Raffealla\u2019s fashion designs.",
    "Talking about her recent trip to India, she said one of the interesting and colourful fashion projects she did in Mumbai (photography and conceptualization) was connected with Kutch \u2013 a district of Gujarat state.",
    "Raffealla went on to say that costumes of Kutch are exquisitely stylized and intricately embroidered.",
    "Dazzling with vibrant colours, flooded with striking mirror work and stunning jewellery, it\u2019s one of the most alluring custumes in India, she said.",
    "\u201cThe mirror work and embroidery work forms an integral part of Kutch. Although handicrafts, irrespective of the community or ethnic group to which they belong, remain the same, the workmanship differs.",
    "\u201cIn fact, the various communities can be identified by the pattern of handicrafts and dress, or costumes, they are in. For instance, the Garacia Jat women wear only red or black chunis, while Rabari women wear black open blouses, or cholis, with odhnis to cover their heads.",
    "\u201cIn the rural areas, the women wear Chaniya choli the whole year, Chaniya choli\u2019s are of many designs and fashion. A typical Kutch costume is incomplete without \u2018Abha\u2019 or \u2018Kanjari\u2019. \u2018Abha\u2019 is the name of the typical choli worn by women folk and \u2018Kanjari\u2019 is a long blouse, beautifully embroidered and with mirror work.",
    "\u201cMost men in Kutch wear loose trousers, a long-sleeved under-jacket, and a short coat, a plain or silk-bordered cloth. Normally men prefer white clothes except the Muslims who prefer coloured clothes.\u201d",
    "Raffealla is now ready, and excited, to do it for Prerna Gupta.",
