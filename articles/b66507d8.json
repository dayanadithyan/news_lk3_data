    "(Reuters) - Citizens from Australia, Britain and Poland were among seven people working for celebrity chef Jose Andres\u2019 World Central Kitchen who were killed in an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza on Monday, the NGO said.",
    "The workers, who also included Palestinians and a dual citizen of the United States and Canada, were travelling in two armoured cars emblazoned with the WCK logo and another vehicle, WCK said in a statement.",
    "Israel has long denied it is hindering the distribution of urgently needed food aid in Gaza, saying the problem is caused by the inability of international aid groups to get it to those in need.",
    "Despite co-ordinating movements with the Israeli Defence Force, the convoy was hit as it was leaving its Deir al-Balah warehouse, after unloading more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza by sea, WCK said.",
    "\u201cThis is not only an attack against WCK, this is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war,\u201d said Erin Gore, chief executive of World Central Kitchen.",
    "The Israeli military said it was doing a thorough review at the highest levels to understand the circumstances of what it called a tragic incident and pledged an investigation by \u201can independent, professional and expert body\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe IDF makes extensive efforts to enable the safe delivery of humanitarian aid, and has been working closely with WCK in their vital efforts to provide food and humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,\u201d the military said.",
    "Israel has been under mounting international pressure to alleviate the severe hunger in Gaza, which has been devastated by months of fighting that has laid waste to much of the enclave and forced most of the population from their homes.",
    "The United Nations and other international groups have accused Israel of hindering aid distribution with bureaucratic obstacles and failing to ensure the security of food convoys, underlined by a disaster on Feb. 29, in which around 100 people were killed as they waited for an aid delivery.",
    "Hamas, the Islamist group that controlled Gaza, has said the main problem with aid distribution was Israeli targeting of aid workers. Following the latest incident, it issued a statement saying the attack aimed to terrorise workers of international humanitarian agencies, deterring them from their missions.",
    "Last week, the World Court ordered Israel to take all necessary and effective action to ensure basic food supplies to the enclave\u2019s Palestinian population and halt spreading famine.",
    "In response, Israeli officials accused the United Nations and other international bodies of \u201cfailure\u201d over the problems in getting aid to hungry people in Gaza, saying they lack the logistical capacity to perform their jobs.",
    "Andres, who started WCK in 2010 by sending cooks and food to Haiti after an earthquake, earlier said he was heartbroken and grieving for the families and friends of those who died.",
    "\u201cThe Israeli government needs to stop this indiscriminate killing,\u201d he said on social media.",
    "\u201cIt needs to stop restricting humanitarian aid, stop killing civilians and aid workers, and stop using food as a weapon. No more innocent lives lost. Peace starts with our shared humanity. It needs to start now.\u201d",
    "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirmed the death of 44-year-old aid worker Lalzawmi \u201cZomi\u201d Frankcom and said his government had contacted Israel to demand those responsible be held accountable.",
    "\u201cThis is a human tragedy that should never have occurred, that is completely unacceptable and Australia will seek full and proper accountability,\u201d he told a press conference on Tuesday.",
    "Albanese said innocent civilians and humanitarian workers needed to be protected and reiterated his call for a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza along with more aid to help those suffering from \u201ctremendous deprivation\u201d.",
    "Poland, which also lost a citizen, issued a statement objecting to the \u201cdisregard for international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians, including humanitarian workers.\u201d",
    "Video obtained by Reuters showed a large hole in the roof of a four wheel drive WCK vehicle and its burned and torn interior, as well as paramedics moving bodies into a hospital and displaying the passports of three of those killed.",
    "\u201cWe are heartbroken and deeply troubled by the strike that killed @WCKitchen aid workers in Gaza,\u201d U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said on social media.",
    "\u201cHumanitarian aid workers must be protected as they deliver aid that is desperately needed, and we urge Israel to swiftly investigate what happened.\u201d",
    "WCK said it was pausing its operations in the region immediately and would make decisions soon about the future of its work.",
    "WCK delivers food relief and prepares meals for people in need. It said last month it had served more than 42 million meals in Gaza over 175 days.",
    "WCK was involved in the first shipment of aid to Gaza via a sea corridor from Cyprus in March. A second WCK maritime aid shipment of 332 tons arrived in Gaza early this week.",
    "Since starting operations in 2010, the organisation has delivered food for communities hit by natural disasters, refugees at the U.S. border, healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and people in conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza."
