    "\u201cMany people in the tourism industry, even top-end hotels, are still facing an issue with their moratoriums, having to pay back the loans that they took because of the hit that we had from Covid as well as the economic crisis and the political crisis. People are still coming out of it. We are not far from the woods. We have lot more to go, a lot more to do,\u201d Fernando said.",
    "The minister stressed upon the importance of a consistent tourism policy, increased government support and the urgent need of the sector to commit towards green initiatives.",

    "\u201cWe are the last lap of finalising it. Therefore, it is the job of the government, the job of the Sri Lankan Tourism authority to help everyone in the industry moving into green, to make Sri Lanka at least a 50 percent green destination whilst going at our target in 2030, to move up to four million or five million tourists,\u201d Fernando stated.",

    "Therefore, more experiences should be given, more sights and attractions should be seen, more new thinking should be given,\u201d he said. (NR)"
