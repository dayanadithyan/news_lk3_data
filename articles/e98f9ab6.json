    "A university student before the pandemic, La Awng joined mass education boycotts after the coup. Ten months later, when a friend mentioned that a casino in Laukkai was offering 7,500 Chinese yuan ($1,035) a month \u2013 more than most minimum-wage workers in Myanmar earn in a year \u2013 La Awng decided to give it a try.",
    "He paid a job agent 750,000 kyats ($360) and joined a friend for the 530km (329-mile) car journey to the city. Dropped off on the outskirts of Laukkai, they were escorted inside by a militia the next day and dropped off at a newly built high-rise.",
    "\u201cWhen we saw it, we thought, \u2018This isn\u2019t a casino; maybe they will make us work as carpenters,\u2019\u201d said La Awng. But when training began a day later, he and his friends realised they were caught up in something far more sinister.",
    "Each assigned a computer, they had to strike up conversations with men and women in foreign countries using fake profiles on applications including Instagram, Facebook, and Tinder, or use virtual WhatsApp numbers to send messages at random. \u201cWe start by saying things like, \u2018Oh, I sent a message to the wrong number. Sorry,\u2019\u201d said La Awng.",
    "During 15 days of training, the company fired people they considered underperformers, but La Awng and his friends passed the selection. They began working 12 hours a day or sometimes more in order to meet scamming targets set by their bosses.",
    "While many people are trafficked into online fraud by friends or acquaintances, others are lured by fraudulent job advertisements. \u201cPeople would take any job that would accept them, without fact-checking,\u201d said an anti-trafficking specialist with a nonprofit based in northern Myanmar who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of her work. \u201cWe advise people not to take jobs advertised on Facebook that look too good to be true.\u201d",
    "But in a country where millions of students boycotted classes after the coup and formal jobs evaporated, many young people were tempted.",
    "Htun, a former English tutor from Myanmar\u2019s central Sagaing region, responded to an advertisement calling for customer service workers in Laukkai in February 2022.",
    "During an online interview, an agent told him that the job involved talking to foreigners on the phone and that because he had some English and computer skills, he would be paid a starting salary of 1.5 million kyats ($715) a month. \u201cThe main thing is money,\u201d said Htun. \u201cI was persuaded by that amount.\u201d",
    "It was only after he had signed a one-year contract that he realised what he was expected to do. Assigned to be an English scammer, he used fictitious profiles on Instagram to strike up romantic connections with people overseas and move the conversation to WhatsApp before transferring the case to another worker.",
    "Although he was unhappy, his bosses demanded two months\u2019 compensation to allow him to quit \u2013 an impossible amount given that they also deducted money from his wages if he did not meet their daily scamming targets. With the building surrounded by armed guards, escape also felt impossible. So he toiled from early morning to midnight, seven days a week. \u201cI wanted to go home, but I faced so much pressure,\u201d he said.",
    "Brang, from Kachin State, also fell foul of the traffickers. A university student before the pandemic, he joined nonviolent protests after the coup and travelled to Laukkai in October of 2021 at the invitation of a friend.",
    "He arrived to learn that his friend had set him up with a scamming company but reluctantly accepted.",
    "Only when he tried to quit, and his bosses told him that they had paid for him under a two-year contract, did he realise his friend had profited from the arrangement.",
    "\u201cI accepted this job because I felt bad freeloading at my friend\u2019s house, but it turned out, I was sold,\u201d said Brang. \u201cI felt betrayed and stabbed in the back.\u201d",
    "By then, however, he was trapped. \u201cI worked like a robot from 8am to 2am without rest. I wasn\u2019t even allowed to leave the building,\u201d he said.",
    "Seated at a long table, he had to search for wealthy-looking women in their 30s and 40s on the Chinese social media and messaging application WeChat, comment on their posts using a translation application, and send them private message requests.",
    "For each woman who accepted, Brang got 300 yuan ($42), and a bonus if the contact led to a scam. But if he did not net at least 10 women a day, he was \u201cpunished\u201d.",
    "Most days, only three or four women accepted Brang\u2019s requests, and his bosses beat him in front of the other workers, who were forced to watch in silence as he was thrashed on the bottom. \u201cIt was harrowing. I ached when I sat down,\u201d he said.",
    "Brang estimates that he was beaten on 10 to 15 occasions before his company decided he would be more useful to them in a different role. Forced to wear the uniform of a military-affiliated militia, he became a bodyguard for the company\u2019s bosses.",
    "The job offered Brang a sense of the scale of Laukkai\u2019s cyber-scamming industry, as well as the power of the Chinese gangs running it. \u201cThe whole of Laukkai was like their city or territory,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Myanmar military and militia controlled Laukkai, but they didn\u2019t seem to have that much authority, because the Chinese bosses had enormous amounts of money.\u201d",
    "Although he was no longer beaten, Brang seethed with resentment. Not only did he have to protect the same bosses who were holding him captive, but he was also working for a group associated with the military.",
    "The last straw came when he was forced to beat another worker. Soon after, he requested a leave of absence from his boss, concocting a story that he needed to go home for his mother\u2019s funeral. \u201cI even cried in front of him so that he would let me go,\u201d said Brang.",
    "Months after returning home, he fled to Malaysia, where he joined an undocumented workforce from Myanmar that has swelled since the pandemic. He now fears being caught up in an immigration raid, while he is also struggling to cope with memories of his trafficking. \u201cI\u2019m still traumatised by what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d he said.",
    "Were he to do so, or to deviate from the rules in any way, the consequences were clear. \u201cWe hear all the groaning and torture on a daily basis and sometimes, it even feels strange if we don\u2019t hear it,\u201d he said. Once, his bosses made a public display of cutting off a worker\u2019s ear after he tried to escape, according to La Awng.",
    "He and another worker interviewed separately by Shwe Phee Myay, a Shan State-based media outlet which collaborated with Al Jazeera for this report, said scamming bosses also kept cages with animals, including lions, tigers, bears and large birds, and threatened to lock workers in these cages if they disobeyed. Both sources also believed that some workers at their companies had been killed, and their bodies quickly burned to destroy the evidence.",
    "Al Jazeera was unable to verify their claims, but regardless of whether the punishments actually happened, the psychological effect of scamming under the constant threat of violence was clear. \u201cI had dreams for my future, but because of working here, I feel like all my dreams have gone,\u201d said La Awng. \u201cEven If I manage to get out of this industry, I think the trauma will still haunt me.\u201d",
