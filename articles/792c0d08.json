    "Despite a previous period of economic decline, the Sri Lankan economy has witnessed a strengthening, leading to the appreciation of the rupee against the dollar, Wickremesinghe highlighted.",
    "He attributed this positive shift to effective economic policies implemented by the government, which allowed for the current recruitment of teachers.",
    "\u201cLast year, the rupee had depreciated to 370 against the dollar, but today, it stands at 300.\u201d The president expressed his optimism in further reducing this value to 280 in the future, which he said would bolster the purchasing power of the people.",

This year alone, around 4000 teachers have been recruited, marking a significant milestone after a hiatus of three to four years.\u201d",
