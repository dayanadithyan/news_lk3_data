    "The presidential candidate of the \u2018Samagi Jana Balavegaya\u2019 (SJB), Sajith Premadasa says that he has never supported the groups that plunged the country into economic crisis.",
    "Addressing a public rally held in the Kirulapone area, he stated that even if the opposing parties conspire to prevent his victory, their efforts would be futile.",
    "\u201cToday, the only goal of that political couple is to prevent the victory of Sajith Premadasa. They are engaging in every possible conspiracy. But remember that both of them were members of the previous cabinets. They both sat alongside Rajapaksas in the cabinet\u201d, he added",
    "The Opposition Leader further stated that neither he nor the \u2018Samagi Jana Balavegaya\u2019 have ever associated with the group that drove the country into bankruptcy.",
    "\u201cTherefore, remember that on the 21st, use your valuable vote and take the initiative for a progressive turning point for the people of the country,\u201d Premadasa said."
