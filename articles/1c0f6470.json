    "The Colombo High Court on Friday (26) fixed a date for the hearing of the case filed against the notorious criminal figure and drug trafficker Nadun Chinthaka alias \u201cHarak Kata\u201d over his failed escape attempt from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).",
    "Accordingly, the case filed against \u201cHarak Kata\u201d and two others will be taken up on 15 May, on the orders of High Court Judge Damith Thotawatta.",
    "The accused is being held at the old prison complex in Tangalle, which currently operates as a detention centre.",
    "On 10 September 2023, \u201cHarak Kata\u201d, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers, had reportedly laced the officers\u2019 teas with poison during his questioning, with the help of a Police Constable.",
    "During the questioning, \u201cHarak Kata\u201d had allegedly requested to go to the washroom and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his accomplice \u2013 the police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspect\u2019s protection.",
    "Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officer\u2019s firearm leading to a scuffle.",
    "A group of other CID officers were quick to arrive at the scene, upon hearing the commotion and managed to detain \u201cHarak Kata\u201d in their custody."
