    "It was a fitting occasion to reflect on NHCo\u2019s remarkable journey, milestones, and enduring commitment in providing exceptional client services in accordance with our philosophies of achieving the right balance in everything we do. Established in 1984 under the visionary leadership of Nihal Hettiarachchi, NHCo\u2019s humble beginnings have blossomed into a thriving firm of chartered accountants today.",
    "In addition to their primary operations, they have expanded their reach through strategic partnerships which includes Wijeratne & Company, HLB Lanka Business Advisory, RNH BPO, RNH Holdings and LexAG. NHCo is an independent member of HLB International, an award-winning Top 10 worldwide accounting network, focused on innovation, collaboration, and cross-border client growth. This expansion is a testament to the commendable local and global teamwork and collaborations which underpin their success.",

The staff of NHCo also performed a captivating traditional dance during the celebration, which brought a vibrant atmosphere to this jubilant occasion.",
