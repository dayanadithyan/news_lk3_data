  "original_body_lines": [
    "Six European countries paused funding for the U.N. refugee agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) on Saturday, following allegations that some of its staff were involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel.",
    "Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Finland on Saturday joined the United States, Australia and Canada in pausing funding to the aid agency, a critical source of support for people in Gaza, after the allegations by Israel.",
    "\u201cPalestinians in Gaza did not need this additional collective punishment,\u201d Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA commissioner-general, said on X. \u201cThis stains all of us.\u201d",
    "The agency said on Friday it had opened an investigation into several employees and severed ties with those people.",
    "Encouraging more donor suspensions, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said UNRWA should be replaced once fighting in the enclave dies down and accused it of ties to Islamist militants in Gaza.",
    "\u201cIn Gaza\u2019s rebuilding, @UNRWA must be replaced with agencies dedicated to genuine peace and development,\u201d he added on X.",
    "Deputy U.N. spokesperson Farhan Haq, asked about Katz\u2019s remarks, said: \u201cWe are not responding to rhetoric. UNRWA overall had had a strong record, which we have repeatedly underscored.\u201d",
    "Lazzarini said the decision by the nine countries threatened its humanitarian work across the region, especially in Gaza.",
    "\u201cIt is shocking to see a suspension of funds to the Agency in reaction to allegations against a small group of staff, especially given the immediate action that UNRWA took by terminating their contracts and asking for a transparent independent investigation,\u201d he said in a statement.",
    "The Palestinian foreign ministry criticised what it described as an Israeli campaign against UNRWA, and Hamas condemned the termination of employee contracts \u201cbased on information derived from the Zionist enemy\u201d.",
    "UNRWA was set up to help refugees of the 1948 war at Israel\u2019s founding and provides education, health and aid services to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon.",
    "It helps about two thirds of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million population and has played a pivotal aid role during the war that Israel launched to eliminate Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks",
    "Announcing the investigation, Lazzarini said on Friday that he had decided to terminate the contracts of some staff members to protect the agency\u2019s ability to deliver humanitarian assistance.",
    "Lazzarini did not disclose the number of employees allegedly involved in the attacks, nor the nature of their alleged involvement. He said, however, that \u201cany UNRWA employee who was involved in acts of terror\u201d would be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution.",
    "During weeks of Israeli bombardment of the Palestinian enclave, UNRWA has repeatedly said its capacity to render humanitarian assistance to people in Gaza is on the verge of collapse.",
    "Hussein al-Sheikh, head of the Palestinians\u2019 umbrella political body the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), said cutting support to the agency brought major political and relief risks.",
    "\u201cWe call on countries that announced the cessation of their support for UNRWA to immediately reverse their decision,\u201d he said on X.",
    "The Foreign Ministry in Germany, a major donor to UNRWA, welcomed UNRWA\u2019s investigation, saying it was deeply concerned about the allegations raised against agency employees.",
    "\u201cWe expect Lazzarini to make it clear within UNRWA\u2019s workforce that all forms of hatred and violence are totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated,\u201d it said on X."
