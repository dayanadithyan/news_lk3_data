    "A man with life-threatening injuries was taken to hospital, where he died on Wednesday, they said.",
    "The Tamil Refugee Council said it believed the time Mr Yogalingham had spent on a bridging visa had been a contributing factor to his death.",
    "A council spokesperson told the ABC Mr Yogalingham\u2019s claim for refugee status was previously rejected under the controversial \u201cfast-track\u201d system introduced in 2014, an outcome he had been seeking to appeal.",
    "Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has been contacted for comment and his department has been asked about the status of Mr Yogalingham\u2019s visa application.",

    "Friend Rathy Barthlote said Mr Yogalingham was a \u201cstrong person, very energetic, very lovely\u201d.",

    "Friends of Mr Yogalingham gathered outside the Home Affairs department\u2019s Docklands office on Wednesday to protest the young father\u2019s death.",
    "Ms Barthlote said many of those present had also spent years on bridging visas like Mr Yogalingham.",
    "She urged the federal government to change its policies so that people who had lived in Australia for years on bridging visas could have certainty.",
    "\u201cPlease, stop this limbo for all of our life, we don\u2019t want to lose anyone else anymore,\u201d Ms Barthlote said.",
    "\u201cGive us a permanent residency because we are living this life for more than a decade.",
    "\u201cWe are contributing to this community as much as we can. We are the hard-working people, we are the carers and aged-care workers, we are doing business, everything we are doing our best for the government.\u201d"
