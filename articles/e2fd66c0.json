    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Chandima Weerakkody has called on President Ranil Wickremesinghe to take steps to appoint an Attorney General immediately.",
    "Addressing a press conference on the weekend, he urged the President to appoint a qualified senior official as the Acting Attorney General or Attorney General with immediate effect.",
    "Weerakkody accused the President of attempting to weaken the country\u2019s judicial system and launch attacks against it.",
    "\u201cHe even accused the judiciary in Parliament without considering the potential damage to the country\u2019s democracy,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP also accused the President of neglecting duties assigned by the constitution.",
    "\u201cLast Friday, State Counsels and Deputy Additional Solicitor Generals representing the Attorney General\u2019s Department appeared in the country\u2019s courts. The question arises whether it is legal to represent the Attorney General without an Attorney General in office. As of now, no Acting Attorney General has been appointed. This situation underscores concerns about the President\u2019s influence on the country\u2019s democracy and the independent judicial process,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP noted that often when the Attorney General retires, traditionally the Solicitor General assumes the position.",
    "He noted that Ayesha Jinasena, the current Solicitor General known for her honourable service and lack of accusations, has not been mentioned for the role of Attorney General or Acting Attorney General. The MP said this raises questions about whether there is an attempt to test her compliance with the President\u2019s wishes."
