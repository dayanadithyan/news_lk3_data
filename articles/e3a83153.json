    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Namal Rajapaksa has accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of attempting to cause a rift within the SLPP.",
    "Speaking to the media outside the party headquarters on Nelum Mawatha yesterday, Rajapaksa said Wickremesinghe has a habit of causing divisions within political parties and organisations. \u201cHe is attempting to dismantle our party. This is no secret. We supported him with genuine intentions. However, if his response is to try and divide our party, he needs to reconsider his approach,\u201d Rajapaksa asserted. The SLPP MP emphasised that the party had fully supported Wickremesinghe and had refrained from undermining the Government, even when policies they disagreed with were being implemented.",
    "When asked if he was directly accusing the President of attempting to cause a rift in the SLPP, Rajapaksa clarified that it wasn\u2019t just his opinion, pointing out that similar allegations were also coming from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). The accusations come after many SLPP stalwarts joined Wickremesinghe on stage at the recent \u201cEkwa Jayagamu\u201d (Let\u2019s Win Together) series of rallies and extended their support to him.\u00a0 Rajapaksa said this was not treatment meted out by Wickremsinghe to the Pohottuwa alone. \u201cIt is a habit,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re not angry with him; it\u2019s simply his nature. We were aware of this when we welcomed him into our ranks. He has a history of dismantling parties and organisations, including the United National Party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Good Governance Government, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, and even the LTTE,\u201d Rajapaksa remarked. He also denied any knowledge of a special meeting held between SLPP founder Basil Rajapksa and Ranil Wickremesinghe. Rajapaksa said the party will take an appropriate political decision going forward."
