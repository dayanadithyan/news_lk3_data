    "Dr SinhaRaja Tammita-Delgoda\u2019s new art history book, \u201cGeorge Keyt \u2013 The Absence of a Desired Image,\u201d provides fascinating insights into the life and work of Sri Lanka\u2019s greatest artist. The book, published by the Taprobane Collection, is 464 pages long from cover to cover with the Appendices (expertly compiled by Uditha Devapriya) comprising about 90 pages. A hefty piece of non-fiction, it is skillfully crafted with meticulous attention paid to detail. Tammita Delgoda has produced a work of art \u2013 a tour de force that grips the reader and captures the imagination like an epic novel. Thanks to the author\u2019s breezy writing style and great zest for story-telling, it moves at a brisk pace and takes us on an unforgettable journey. The book\u2019s design is exquisite, especially in respect of the delicate interplay between stylish narrative and ravishing visual imagery.",
    "The book could be viewed as a marvelous tapestry of the painter\u2019s journey through life created by a master craftsman. We discover that not only was Keyt a great, self-taught artist but a brilliant poet, scholar, and linguist as well. How a single individual could excel in so many different fields is something to behold. Here was someone who danced ecstatically to the music of his soul.",
    "Keyt died at the age of 92 and his life spanned all ten decades of the previous century. Though he was playful in his youth, he became a studious and serious-minded individual after leaving school. As The Absence of a Desired Image demonstrates, in terms of range and versatility, Keyt\u2019s artistic and literary output was phenomenal. The book has 18 engrossing chapters plus a lucid Introduction that contains a compact literature review. It is worthwhile noting that several eminent authors have written books on George Keyt including the Indian art historian, critic and curator, Yasodhara Dalmia, whose book is entitled, Life and Times of George Keyt (2017).",
    "Tammita-Delgoda does an excellent job in revealing the multifaceted nature of Keyt\u2019s personality as well as his work. Though Keyt the painter is the central theme of his book, there are several sub-themes, such as Keyt the poet, Keyt the scholar, Keyt the writer, Keyt the translator, and Keyt the illustrator, which also receive close attention. Arguably, The Absence of a Desired Image goes further than any other book on Keyt in terms of weaving the man and his work into a composite whole.",
    "An attractive feature of this weighty tome is that Keyt\u2019s life is interwoven with Sri Lanka\u2019s history, culture, and social fabric. We learn a great deal not only about Keyt\u2019s family background and personal life, but also about how two great religions \u2013 Buddhism and Hinduism \u2013 influenced his work and his mindset. Keyt was a Burgher and so was his closest friend, Lionel Wendt \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s greatest photographer. Accordingly, the book\u2019s observations on and impressions of the Burgher community in the first half of the 20th century are highly pertinent to the overarching theme \u2013 Keyt the painter.",
    "Because India and Keyt\u2019s life were inextricably linked, the book provides a comprehensive account of how Indian culture influenced Keyt and vice versa. The adroit manner in which it captures the shades and nuances of this synergistic interaction is laudable. But if Keyt ultimately turned to cubism and gave it a distinct Sri Lankan flavor, it was largely due to the influence of Picasso, an artist that he deeply revered.",
    "The focus of Chapter I is the impact that Sri Lanka\u2019s transition from British colonial rule to self-rule had on Keyt\u2019s life. \u201cConfronted with the turmoil of Independent Sri Lanka, Keyt deliberately withdrew into a private world of idyllic romance, divine fantasy and literary symbolism.\u201d",
    "Chapter II contains a fine description of Keyt\u2019s formative years at Trinity College, where students were encouraged to develop their creative, intellectual and artistic skills. Though Keyt never passed any exams, he did win the College Art Prize at age fourteen. And he began to read and write poetry.",
    "In Chapter III we learn how Keyt began studying Buddhism and Pali after leaving school. The Keyt family lived near the Malwatte Vihara, overlooking Kandy Lake, and the scholar monk and poet, Ven. Pinnawela Dheerananda, became Keyt\u2019s mentor.",
    "Chapter IV tells us that when Keyt began to paint, his initial focus was the rhythms and routines of life in Buddhist temples. Meanwhile, he produced many essays and illustrations for various magazines. \u201cHis first major literary work was entitled Poetry from the Sinhalese (1938).\u201d",
    "Chapter V indicates that his career as an artist began to take off in his late twenties. \u201cKeyt\u2019s early paintings depicted the landscape and people of Kandy. Naturalistic and representative, they are very carefully structured and solidly organized \u2026\u201d If he was not painting, he was writing poetry. He published several poems in the 1930s, including Image in Absence.",
    "The painter married Ruth Jansz in 1930 by whom he had two daughters. Though Ruth was a devoted wife and mother, Keyt was unfaithful to her, and their marriage broke down before the decade ended. He was in love with Lucia, his daughter\u2019s nanny. Abandoning his family, he went to live with Lucia in her village, Pilawela. Lucia (also known as Pilawela Menike) took good care of him and bore him two sons. The couple relocated several times and eventually made Sirimalwatte (a village in Kandy) their home in 1950.",
    "As explained in Chapter VI, \u201cGeorge Keyt was the first contemporary painter to derive inspiration from the wellspring of Sri Lanka\u2019s ancient tradition.\u201d By carefully studying the Sigiriya frescoes, he mastered the art of drawing the vaka deka, double curve. In the 1930s he began to abandon naturalism and representation in favor of the curving line. From then on, sweeping curves and counter curves became a prominent feature of his work. \u201cTwo women, painted during the 1930s, shows how integral the curving line was to Keyt\u2019s work \u2026\u201d",
    "The culture of Polonnaruwa during the Middle Ages was an amalgam of Buddhism and Hinduism and Keyt was profoundly influenced by the bronze images of Hindu deities produced by the cholas. \u201cThe heads of many of Keyt\u2019s figures, both male and female, were inspired by the Polonnaruwa bronzes. Abstracted and sharply drawn, with their long faces, pointed noses and heavy lidded eyes, many of them resemble Shiva and Parvati.\u201d Examples of Keyt\u2019s paintings that demonstrate these stylized features are Nayika and The Flutist.",
    "Keyt had in-depth knowledge of Kandyan Buddhist art. \u201cIan Goonetileke notes that the wall paintings of Kandy were a major factor in the artistic language which Keyt evolved for himself.\u201d For example, Gotaimbara closely resembles a Kandyan mural in style, form and color scheme.",
    "Chapter VII , written with verve and sensitivity, is about Keyt and his best friend \u2013 the pianist, photographer, critic and cinematographer, Lionel Wendt. If Wendt opened Keyt\u2019s eyes to the world of modernism, Keyt introduced Wendt to the world of Kandyan dance.",
    "Chapter VIII provides a cogent analysis of Keyt\u2019s Kandyan village paintings such as Ploughing, Harvest, Man with Bull, Woman with Parasol, Fruit Seller in respect of style, form, color, and thematic content. It also elaborates upon Keyt\u2019s fascination with Kandyan dance. \u201cOver the years, Keyt became deeply versed in the arts and drumming. His essay, Kandyan Dancing (1953), provides a comprehensive introduction to the world of Sinhala dance.\u201d",
    "As elucidated in Chapter IX, it was through the books, journals and magazines that Lionel Wendt shared with Keyt that the latter discovered modernism. Of these, the most important was Cahiers d\u2019Art, which showcased the work of leading European modern artists. \u201cKeyt\u2019s discovery of cubism caused him to discard the art of representation. By the 1930s his style had changed. Like Picasso, he combined distortion with bold outline. Using crisp, heavy lines, he made the continuing line a defining feature, merging and fusing figures together.\u201d The influence of other European modern artists such as L\u00e9ger, Braque, Derain and Matisse can also be observed in his work. For example, Matisse\u2019s Odalisque (1920-21) inspired Keyt to paint Reclining Woman  almost fifty years later.",
    "Chapter X provides useful information on the formation of the Ceylon Society of Arts as well as the 1943 Group consisting of prominent artists excluded by the Ceylon Society, including Ivan Peries, George Keyt, Justin Daraniyagala, and Harry Peiris. The idea for the establishment of this Group came from Ivan Peries and was executed by Lionel Wendt. \u201cThe 43 Group became Asia\u2019s first modern art movement. For Lionel Wendt it was a great moment of fulfillment which embodied the climax of his artistic career \u2026\u201d",
    "From Chapter XI we learn the 43 Group became famous due to its authentic blend of traditional forms with modern Western influence. \u201cIn the years which followed Independence, the 43 Group held a series of regular exhibitions which gradually established modern art in Sri Lanka. By the early fifties, the 43 Group was winning international acclaim and showing its work in Europe.\u201d Keyt\u2019s good friend, Ian Goonetileke (a well-known scholar and bibliographer,), observed that though the core members of the 43 Group were highly gifted, they were not genuinely rooted in their culture, which is why the Group disintegrated in the late sixties. But as this book points out, the only exception was George Keyt.",
    "\u201cCrossing the boundaries of alienation, Keyt was able to find a new truth and forge a relationship with his environment. This endowed his work with the enduring relevance which exists to this day.\u201d",
    "Chapter XII provides a fascinating account of how Keyt became more and more \u201cIndian\u201d in respect of his mindset as well as his art. After his first visit to India in 1939, he kept going back. In 2021 Tammita-Delgoda interviewed Keyt\u2019s elder daughter, Diana Keyt, who said: \u201cOnce he went to India, he changed and converted to Hinduism. He became a follower of Krishna. Hinduism came to exercise a bigger influence on him. In the end it won over Buddhism.\u201d The painter lived in India from 1946 to 1949.",
    "Ratikeli is a fine example of a Keyt painting inspired by Hindu mythology. The two great Sanskrit epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabarata, also had a profound impact on his work. This chapter demonstrates with the assistance of drawings and paintings the significant extent to which the painter was also inspired by Indian art, sculpture, music, and dancing.",
    "One of the most nostalgic sections in this book is Chapter XIII, where the Indian factor continues to receive attention. Keyt\u2019s circle of friends during his three-year stay in India (1946-49) included Mulk Raj Anand, Minette de Silva, and her sister Marcia (Anil). From 1946 to 1948, Anil was the assistant editor and Minette, the architectural editor of Marg. During this time Lionel Wendt, Geoge Keyt, and the 43 Group as a whole figured prominently in this prestigious magazine.",
    "The trio (Anand and the de Silva sisters) were the chief organizers of Keyt\u2019s first ever solo international exhibition at the Convocation Hall in Bombay in 1947. The exhibition, which featured 64 paintings as well as a comprehensive catalogue, was lauded by both Indian and foreign critics. \u201cWhat resonated most was the way in which Keyt had absorbed and depicted the Indian heritage.\u201d According to his biographer, Martin Russel (as per his book,  George Keyt) as well as the art historian William Archer (as per his book, India and Modern Art), Keyt\u2019s contribution to the evolution of modern art in India was seminal. (Both authors, by the way, were British.)",
    "In 1947 Keyt published an illustrated version of Gita Govinda, an epic poem recounting the loves of Radha and Krishna which he had rendered from the Sanskrit. \u201cDirectly linked to Keyt\u2019s portrayal of love, it became the subject for some of his most powerful erotic paintings.\u201d A notable example, in this regard, is Rasa Lila, the Dance of Divine Love. Keyt, incidentally, had a passionate affair with one Barbara Smith \u2013 \u201can attractive and sophisticated woman of Anglo-Indian descent.\u201d A well-known editor with the Oxford University Press, she was based in Bombay.",
    "As per Chapter XIV, the exhibition at the Convocation Hall opened many other doors for this preeminent Sri Lankan artist. His solo exhibition in New Delhi in 1952, which featured 72 paintings, was a great success. \u201cIn the years since Bombay, Keyt\u2019s work had become embedded in the Indian consciousness. In new Delhi he was hailed as a product of the Indian tradition.\u201d Mulk Raj Anand\u2019s The Story of India (1948) and well as A.S. Raman\u2019s Tales from Indian Mythology (1961) were illustrated by Keyt. We note that though the two authors were Indian, the illustrator was Sri Lankan.",
    "In Chapter XV we return to Sirimalwatte and to Keyt\u2019s work based on rural life and Sinhalese traditions, culture and folklore. \u201cIn much the same way as he had done with his great murals at the Gotami Vihare, Keyt brought the classical inheritance of the country in visual form.\u201d The use of acrylics from the seventies onwards made his colors much brighter and augmented the decorative beauty of his paintings.",
    "During the second half of the 20th century his paintings found buyers in every part of the world and his work was featured in numerous foreign journals, magazines, and newspapers. \u201cHe had become famous, a national and international celebrity.\u201d He held several solo exhibitions in Sri Lanka and India and three in London as well. In 1977 he was honored with a special Felicitation Volume to mark his 75th birthday and in 1988, the George Keyt Foundation was established to promote and publicize his work.",
    "We note from Chapters XVI and XVII that female nudity, lesbianism, and unbridled sexuality are the central, interlocking themes in a significant number of Keyt\u2019s paintings. \u201cAt the core of his treatment is the line and curve. Key\u2019s mastery of the curving line enables him to create sweeping, all engrossing curves which capture the lush sexuality of a woman\u2019s body. With the curve as his foundation, Keyt combines line with rhythm, evolving a rhythmic line of his very own.\u201d In this regard, Lovers \u2013 an acrylic painting depicting a lesbian couple \u2013 is one of his most stylish works.",
    "Chapter XVIII, the most poignant section in the book, is where we learn that Keyt eventually left his second wife for a young Indian woman, Kusum Narayan, whom he married in 1973 by converting to Islam. The couple actually stayed in Sirimalwatte for a while before moving to the Western Province. The cities they lived in included Nugegoda and Galle. In 1992, they returned to Sirimalwatte and Pinawela Menike graciously accepted them. Keyt\u2019s health began to deteriorate and his life came to an end in July 1993. This great modern artist, who was fondly known as the Asian Picasso, was so highly regarded in his homeland that he was given a state funeral in Colombo.",
    "The Appendices are breathtaking, especially the Plates section where paintings, drawings and other works by Keyt are featured for the first time in any formal publication. It is truly the icing on the cake.",
