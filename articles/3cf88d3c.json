    "India\u2019s main opposition political party- the Congress claimed on Friday (Feb 16) that all its bank accounts have been frozen. Addressing a press conference, Congress treasurer Ajay Maken said the accounts have been frozen ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.",
    "\u201cYou will be surprised to know that democracy has completely ended in India. The Congress received information the day before yesterday that the party\u2019s bank cheques issued were not being honoured,\u201d Maken said.",
    "\u201cWhen we started probing this matter, we were told that all the bank accounts of the party were frozen,\u201d Maken said, adding that not just bank accounts (of Congress) were frozen but the country\u2019s democracy has also been frozen. He pointed out that the Youth Congress\u2019 bank accounts have also been frozen.",
    "\u201cJust a few weeks are left for the announcement of the election dates and the bank accounts of the main opposition party have been frozen. What does the central government want to prove?\u201d the party treasurer further said.",
    "According to the Congress, the accounts were frozen on an Income Tax demand of $25.28 million (Rs 210 crore) for 2018-19. Maken told reporters on Friday that Congress already appealed to the Income Tax appellate authority.",
    "Maken also said that the party doesn\u2019t have \u201cany money to spend, to pay electricity bills, to pay salaries to our employees.\u201d He highlighted that all political parties of the Congress will be impacted.",
    "Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge lashed out at the Modi government over the freezing of bank accounts. In a post on X, Kharge said, \u201cPower drunk Modi Govt has frozen the accounts of the country\u2019s largest Opposition party - the Indian National Congress - just before the Lok Sabha elections. This is a deep assault on India\u2019s Democracy!\u201d",
    "\u201cThe UNCONSTITUTIONAL money collected by the BJP would be utilised by them for elections, but the money collected by us through CROWDFUNDING shall be sealed!\u201d Kharge added.",
    "The Congress president further appealed to the judiciary to save the multi-party system in this country and protect India\u2019s Democracy."
