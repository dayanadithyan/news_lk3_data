    "In its efforts to recognise and reward Sri Lanka\u2019s outstanding female entrepreneurs, Women\u2019s Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) recently announced the launch of its annual flagship event \u201cWCIC Prathibhabhisheka \u2013 Women Entrepreneur Awards 2024\u201d.",
    "This national event, held for the third consecutive year, will be held in January 2025.

The awards ceremony will honour women entrepreneurs for their tenacity to scale and grow, and for their contribution and impact on the economy.",
    "\u201cWe invite outstanding women entrepreneurs, who have braved the challenges in the past few years, to share their story of resilience and achievements to compete for the coveted WCIC Prathibhabhisheka \u2013 The Women Entrepreneur Awards (WEA) 2024,\u201d said WCIC Chairperson Anoji De Silva, highlighting that the women entrepreneurs who participated in the event in the previous years had received many opportunities, including networking and publicity.",
    "She said that the event was aimed to help women entrepreneurs build their business networks while giving them the opportunity to grow and scale their businesses, especially to be export-oriented businesses. \u201cThe applicants are now very aware of the need for a strategic outlook for the business and the need to establish robust governance and finance procedures.

    "The competition empowers and encourages entrepreneurs that contribute or has the potential of contributing highly to the country\u2019s economy, she said. \u201cThe combined revenue of the Sri Lankan applicants for the competition in the previous year was Rs.35.1 billion. We were also happy to see a significant increase in the start-ups, which accounted for 35% of the applicants \u2013 a very positive sign, especially in a situation where we are economically stressed to have more start-ups coming in,\u201d she noted.",
    "On behalf of the organising committee, WEA Co-Chairs Nilani Seneviratne and Tusitha Kumarakulasingam shared the following sentiments. \u201cWe are extremely excited to conduct this National initiative to honour women entrepreneurs across the country. The momentum has been established and entrepreneurs eagerly await to be a part of this journey. We will be accepting applications under the categories \u2013 Start-Up, Micro, Small, Medium and Large. Each category will have a specified revenue for the year under review \u2013 2023/2024. Gold, Silver and Bronze Awards will be presented for each category.",
    "WEA seeks participation from regional women entrepreneurs where participants from across the 9 provinces are expected to participate. \u201cBest of the Province\u201d is awarded to the most outstanding of all the applications, from each province.",
    "The women will also be considered for the special awards: \u201cThe Most Outstanding Export Oriented Entrepreneur (Product and Services)\u201d, \u201cThe SAARC Entrepreneur of the Year\u201d, \u201cDigital Entrepreneur of the Year\u201d, \u201cThe Most Innovative Entrepreneur of the Year\u201d, \u201cThe Woman of Courage\u201d, \u201cThe Young Woman Entrepreneur of the Year\u201d, \u201cOutstanding Start-Up of the Year\u201d and \u201cThe Social Entrepreneur of the Year\u201d for 2024.
