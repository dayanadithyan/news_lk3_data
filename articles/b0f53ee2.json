    "Insights from Prof. Jayati Ghosh and Prof. Howard Nicholas via RIUNIT podcast",
    "In the latest series of the RIUNIT podcast hosted by Roshan Madawela, distinguished economists Prof. Howard Nicholas and Prof. Jayati Ghosh, delve deeply into the rapidly changing economic and geopolitical environment, examining both local and global economic orders. By questioning popular narratives, they provide insightful analysis and perspectives on the complex forces shaping our world today.",
    "\u201cIf the top ten billionaires sat on top of their collective fortunes/combined wealth piled up in US dollar bills, they would reach almost halfway to the moon.\u201d \u2013 Inequality Kills Note by Oxfam",
    "Roshan Madawela highlighted alarming wealth disparities reported by Oxfam. \u201cThe richest 1% accumulated nearly twice as much wealth as the rest of the world combined in the past two years up to 2023. They have seized half of all new wealth in the last decade, with billionaire fortunes increasing by $ 2.7 billion a day,\u201d he stated. He noted that taxing just 5% of the world\u2019s multi-millionaires and billionaires could raise $ 1.7 trillion annually, enough to lift 2 billion people out of poverty.",
    "Prof. Ghosh echoed these concerns stating, \u201cThis aligns with Marx\u2019s concept of the anarchy of capitalism. Wealth concentration is not only among individuals but also between the private and public sectors. Private wealth has surged at the expense of public wealth, diminishing Governments\u2019 ability to provide essential services.\u201d",
    "Prof. Nicholas provided a comparative analysis, noting that in countries like China and Vietnam, real wages have kept pace with per capita income growth, unlike in India. \u201cChina and Vietnam, despite being capitalist, are led by forward-thinking leaders who encourage vibrant competition and technological advancement. Conversely, many advanced nations and India are experiencing monopolistic tendencies, which drive up share prices but stifle genuine market growth,\u201d he observed.",
    "Prof. Ghosh added, \u201cChina and Vietnam practice state-led capitalism that fosters competition and innovation. In contrast, India displays capital-led state monopolies, explaining the varied economic outcomes in these regions.\u201d",
    "Prof. Ghosh discussed the repercussions of privatisation, citing the UK as an example. \u201cNeoliberalism dismantled state-led capitalism, giving undue power to large capital entities. This has led to asset stripping and deteriorating services in essential sectors like water and railways,\u201d she remarked. Prof. Nicholas noted, \u201cThe UK Government often ends up nationalising failing enterprises, as seen with the railways. This cycle benefits corporations at the public\u2019s expense.\u201d",
    "The economists also addressed the IMF\u2019s impact on developing economies. Prof. Nicholas criticised the IMF\u2019s deal with Sri Lanka, stating, \u201cThe IMF deal is deeply unequal, imposing harsh conditions while favoring bondholders. Future Sri Lankan Governments will be constrained by the IMF\u2019s governance-linked bonds, leading to deflationary policies.\u201d Prof. Ghosh concluded, \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s situation resembles a Greek tragedy. The IMF deal is unfair, focusing on cutting public services and restructuring domestic debt, disproportionately affecting the poor. This setup benefits bondholders even if GDP growth remains minimal.\u201d",
    "Prof. Nicholas analysed key economic indicators, highlighting concerns. \u201cIndicators such as profits, employment, and basic metals are signaling trouble,\u201d he noted. He mentioned that a rise in US unemployment, following a low, often precedes a recession. Additionally, the recent sharp decline in the growth rate of industrial metals like aluminum, copper, nickel, and zinc is worrisome. China\u2019s manufacturing sector, a global leader, showed signs of recovery until June, but recent deterioration, alongside weaknesses in Europe and Japan, poses a risk. \u201cWe concur with forecasts predicting a recession in early 2025,\u201d he added.",
    "Prof. Ghosh emphasised the underlying fragility of the global economy. \u201cProf. Nicholas\u2019s prediction of a potential recession in early 2025 is compelling, though such timings are unpredictable. The global economy has been fragile, not just post-COVID but also since the recovery from the global financial crisis,\u201d she explained. She described India as \u201cinternally hollow, similar to global capitalism, which has been sustained by extensive monetary policies and fiscal expansions benefiting the global elite with limited trickle-down to real wages.\u201d"
