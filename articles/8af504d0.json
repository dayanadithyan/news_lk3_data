    "Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader Rauff Hakeem over the weekend opined that forming a National Government after the upcoming parliamentary election is essential to revive the country.",
    "The MP said he was confident the opposition would secure a majority of the votes at the polls, however, it would be favourable for the country if a National Government is formed.",
    "\u201cIf there is an opportunity this time, we should strive to establish a National Government to rebuild the country. It\u2019s imperative for both the Government and opposition to collaborate in forming a parliament without an opposition to ensure the country\u2019s revival at this juncture,\u201d he said."
