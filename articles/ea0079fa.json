    "\u201cI got disillusioned with politics. An idea was born in my mind that a social revolution minus political colouring should be staged. The Sarvodaya Shramadana movement was the outcome of this thinking.\u201d \u2013 A.T. Ariyaratne",
    "The passing of A.T. Ariyaratne at the age of 92 years on April 16, 2024 removes from the national scene a colossus that straddled many spheres of local life and singularly gained international recognition for himself and his country to an unimaginable extent. Though small and diminutive in physical size he reached dizzy heights that should inspire the current and future generations to emulate him. A.T. Ariyaratne was an innovative thinker who consistently punched above his weight.",
    "Much has been written of him and much will be written of him in the future. Therefore, I will confine myself in this essay to the lesser publicized aspects of his charismatic life.",
    "On a personal note, I became aware of him when I was in the primary school when my cousins at Nalanda and Ananda College started to talk of him in the late 1950s. Ariyaratne was a teacher at Nalanda College and he organized a strike at school in protest against a palpable injustice, the news of which spread rapidly among school teachers and their students. In that era school strikes were unheard of.",
    "My first encounter with Ariyaratne was in 1961. I was then 13-years of age. The German Dharmaduta Society (GDS) founded by Asoka Weeraratna (my uncle), decided to construct in one day a boundary wall around the perimeter of the land at its premises at No. 417, Bauddhaloka Mawatha (formerly Bullers Road). The Society called for volunteers as it intended to carry out this project on a purely pro bono basis. Ariyaratne and his students (members of the fledgling Sarvodaya Shramadana movement at Nalanda Vidyalaya) responded magnificently. There were others too including children of the office bearers of the GDS who participated in this project by carrying bricks to assist the masons.",
    "Ariyaratne, then a young Buddhist school \u2013 teacher, began adapting Gandhian concepts and strategies of rural awakening (Sarvodaya) to Sinhalese culture. It started small in the late 1950s at Nalanda Vidyalaya under this visionary teacher and developed in the 1960s into a widespread national movement with a philosophical underpinning. A Sri Lankan Gandhi was in the making.",
    "However, there was another major involvement of Ariyaratne in a national Buddhist movement that is lesser known. The media hardly refer to it today. That was the formation of the Bauddha Jathika Balavegaya (BJB) that came into being following the abortive \u2018Catholic Army Officers\u2019 coup in January 1962. Had it succeeded Sri Lanka may have plunged into becoming another South Vietnam under minority control (President Ngo Dinh Diem) backed by USA.",
    "It was to prevent such a catastrophe in Sri Lanka that the Bauddha Jatika Balavegaya (BJB) was formed in November 1962. The inaugural meeting was held at the premises of the All-Ceylon Women\u2019s Buddhist Conference (ACWBC) on the invitation of L.H. Mettananda to a select 100 persons. The topic \u2018A discussion about the future of the Sinhala Buddhist Society\u2019",
    "In his autobiographical \u2018Bhava Thanha \u2019 A.T. Ariyaratne gives a good description of the origins and birth of the Bauddha Jatika Balavegaya.",
    "L. H. Mettananda (President), Nissanka Wijeyaratne (Vice \u2013 President), Gunaseela Vithanage (Secretary), Ronnie de Mel (Treasurer).",
    "A.T. Ariyaratne was a founder member of the BJB and served as a Committee Member. Gunaseela Vithanage was a highly learned and dedicated intellectual who did much of the paperwork of the BJB.",
    "Mr. L.H. Mettananda stands out among the Buddhist mentors that he was associated with. \u201cMettananda was an exemplary character \u2013 humble, courageous, principled, living a simple life style, and never bearing rancour. He spurned high posts offered to him by the State \u2013 even ministerial and ambassador posts. Economically he was under pressure but would never give up principles for personal gain. He was almost my guru. Born on March 19, 1894, he passed away on November 01, 1967. We participated fully at the last rites of this great man\u201d.",
    "The pages 290 \u2013 316 extracted from his autobiography \u2018 Bhava Thanha\u2019 and reproduced as an attachment (and pdf document in the weblink below) are of historical value as they contain vital information on a National Buddhist movement i.e., BJB, which played a pivotal role in the affairs of the nation from 1962 \u2013 1965. Social historians should take note of this description.",
    "I though young of age (14 years) witnessed much of these events in the company of my father Dharmasena Weeraratna, whom A.T. Ariyaratne describes on page 298 as follows: \u201cMr. Dharmasena Weeraratna, a businessman, was another untiring warrior in our movement\u201d i.e., Bauddha Jatika Balavegaya.",
    "Dharmasena Weeraratna served as a Committee Member and Press Officer of the BJB. I remember occasionally visiting Ariyaratne at his home (\u2018Under the Breadfruit Tree\u2019) in a lane off the main road at Maradana to deliver BJB related material given by my father. Our family shop \u2018P. J. Weeraratna & Sons, was situated at Second Division, Maradana, Colombo 10 not far from where Ariyaratne then resided.",
    "The official headquarters of the BJB were located at Galle Road, Kollupitiya and declared open on June 04, 1963. However, it was our family residence that served more or less as an unofficial headquarters of the BJB in the 1962 \u2013 1965 period. The likes of L.H. Mettananda, T.U. de Silva, Gunaseela Vithanage, Nissanka Wijeyaratne,, Premachandra de Silva, A.N.S. Kulasinghe, W.J. Fernando, Ramsay Wettimuny (CTB Engineer and father of Sunil, Mithra, Sidath, Ranjan), Professor K.N. Jayatilleka, A.T. Ariyaratne, Wijayananda de Abrew, K.H.M. Sumathipala among others ,were some of the visitors there including leading monks who congregated at our home before leaving in a convoy of vehicles for the public meetings they addressed.",
    "My father\u2019s vehicles among others loaned by others such as W.J. Fernando and A.N. S. Kulasinghe were deployed to help transport the speakers to the BJB meetings which were held in various parts of the country such as Polonnaruwa, Medawachchiya, Anuradhapura, Badulla, Kandy, Ratnapura, Kalutara, Galle, Beruwala, Matara, Nugegoda, and Kirulapone among others. I have attended some of these meetings.",

    "The highly reputed monks who addressed these meetings were Ven. Kalukondayawe Pannasekera Nayake Thero, Prof. Ven. Bambarande Siri Sivali Thero, Dr Kotagama Vachissara Thero, Ven. Madihe Pannasiha Nayake Thero, Ven. Baddegama Wimalawansa Nayake Thero, Ven. Talpavila Seelavansa and Ven. Devamottawe Amarawansa Thero, among others. Ven. Devamottawe Amarawansa Thero was one of the finest orators at that time. He was kept as the last speaker at a meeting to retain the crowd and keep them enthralled.",
    "\u201cPeople by the thousands flocked to our meetings \u2026\u2026..They used to come in processions. It was a Buddhist Resurgence at a sizzling peak\u201d says Dr. Ariyaratne (page 299).",
    "He further says that Mettananda used to delegate him (Ariyaratne) to speak first at these meetings because he always placed stress on Ahimsa (non \u2013 violence) a cardinal tenet of Buddhism. The crowning public meeting of the BJB was held in front of the Ananda College building and within the school premises. Thousands of people attended this meeting in November 1963 and the demonstration with placards and colourful banners took two hours to pass a point. It was at the height of the Buddhist protest in South Vietnam against the dictatorship of President Ngo Dien Diem. Mettananda was at the height of his popularity as a Buddhist leader. The Buddhist public of Ceylon showed utmost solidarity with the victimized Buddhists of South Vietnam.",
    "Mrs. Sirima Bandaranaike who was the then Prime Minister alerted the United Nations via our delegate Mr. R.S.S. Gunawardena to the persecution of Buddhists in Vietnam. However, it was the worldwide publication of the photograph of self-immolation of the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc (1897\u20131963) on June 11, 1963, that brought international attention to the suppression of Buddhists in Vietnam. President Kennedy called for the exploration of a regime change. On November 02, 1963 President Ngo Dien Diem was over thrown by a coup d\u2019etat of the Vietnamese army.",
    "The special feature of the BJB meeting at Ananda College was the presence of leading Hindu nationalist leaders like Sir Kandiah Vaithianathan, who joined hands with Mettananda in protesting against religious conversions by unethical means.",
    "\u201cMrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike\u2019s Government established a Press Commission. We utilized this Commission to highlight anti \u2013 Buddhist activities and focus attention on immoral acts treacherous to the nation. The Supreme Court Justice K.D. de Silva headed this Commission\u201d. (page 298)",
    "\u201cThe Press is an instrument which is primarily meant to serve the real interests of a country. It can also be misused. If we were not satisfied that the newspapers of the Lake House and the Times groups were guilty of anti -national and anti \u2013 Buddhist conduct on a large scale, we would not have recommended a drastic change in the ownership of the newspapers belonging to these groups. From the evidence placed before us we are satisfied that the existing newspapers did not hesitate to fabricate, suppress, slant or distort news and views whenever it suited them.",
    "\u201cThey have been further guilty of anti-national and anti\u2013Buddhist activities, which are more serious than the earlier mentioned lapses on their part. Indeed, the most vehement critics of the present activities of the Press were the Buddhists and some of their organizations, and we are satisfied that their grievances are genuine and should be removed.",
    "\u201cBuddhist leaders have been falsely accused of being intolerant. Their hopes and ambitions receive scant consideration, and the rightful place due to their religion has been denied to it by the newspapers. This has been deliberately done in order to help the minorities, in particular, the Christian minorities, to perpetuate the unjust privileges acquired by them during the last four centuries at the expense of the Buddhist majority. \u201c",
    "Paragraph 212, Page 90 Final Report of the Press Commission (1964)",
    "The following web link was found in a highly resourceful web site dedicated to L.H. Mettananda.",
    "The BJB made a major contribution to public debate by taking an important and brave stand on Catholic Action. Its publication \u2018Catholic Action: A Menace to Peace and Goodwill\u2013 A Reply to the Catholic Union of Ceylon\u2019 was published by the Bauddha Jathika Balavegaya in March 1963.",
    "The other major publication of the BJB (September 1963) was the work of A.T. Ariyaratne himself entitled",
    "He calls for the establishment of a Buddhist Social Order in a wide-ranging discussion about the challenges faced by Buddhism both within and from outside. The content of the booklet has been reproduced in the \u2018Bhava Thanha\u2019 autobiography under the Chapter title \u2018 A Path to Buddhist Resurgence\u2019 (pp 302 \u2013 316).",
