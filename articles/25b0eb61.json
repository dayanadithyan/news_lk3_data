    "ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka\u2019s Medical Association has opposed the lowering of the age of consent from 16 to 14 years.",
    "\u201cIn a country where Healthy Sexual and Relationship Education is not being taught in schools, a child of 14 years who consents for sex is mostly unaware of the potential repercussions of the sexual act \u2013 i.e. early unwanted pregnancy, and exposure to sexually transmitted infections. Hence, the consent given, cannot be taken to imply informed consent.\u201d The Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) statement said on\u00a0 Monday.",
    "We, a conglomerate of medical professionals advocating for the rights of children of",
    "Sri Lanka, wish to express our gravest concerns regarding the proposed amendments",
    "The minimum age of sexual consent is the age at which someone is deemed capable of",
    "consenting to sexual activity. The objective of the minimum age of sexual consent is",
    "to protect adolescents from sexual abuse and from the consequences of early sexual",
    "In the proposed amendment the age of consent for sex has been reduced to 14 years from",
    "We vehemently object to this proposal for the following compelling reasons:",
    "1. It is our considered opinion, as corroborated by many scientific studies, that",
    "a child at 14 years is not cognitively mature to give informed consent for such",
    "In a country where Healthy Sexual and Relationship Education is not being taught",
    "in schools, a child of 14 years who consents for sex is mostly unaware of the",
    "potential repercussions of the sexual act \u2013 i.e. early unwanted pregnancy, and",
    "exposure to sexually transmitted infections. Hence, the consent given, cannot be",
    "2. A child of 14 years is not developmentally mature both physically and",
    "emotionally to mother a baby she may give birth to, following the sexual act.",
    "3. Adolescent mothers and their offspring are high risk groups, both",
    "\u2022 Complications of pregnancy leading to high maternal morbidity and",
    "\u2022 mental health problems due to depression and elevated emotional",
    "\u2022 the offspring being at greater risk due to suboptimal nurturing and",
    "4. Early pregnancy and motherhood are well known to lead to school dropouts",
    "amongst adolescent girls. Sri Lanka increased the compulsory age of education",
    "up to 16 years in 2016. We take this as a very positive step. However, with the",
    "new amendment if a child becomes pregnant after consensual sex, what are the",
    "prospects of her pursuing her education? We pose the question as to whether a",
    "pregnant teenager will be allowed to pursue her education in the socio-cultural",
    "5. For all other matters pertaining to consent in childhood the legal age is",
    "18 years. i.e. consent for medical treatment, consent for medico-legal",
    "examination etc. Hence, we are puzzled and extremely disappointed as to",
    "why only the age for consent for sex has been reduced to 14 years.",
    "We note that in the proposed amendment the offender\u2019s age is mentioned as under 22",
    "years. No consideration has been paid to the imbalance of power between two such",
    "parties concerned which again raises apprehension on the validity of the consent. Due to",
    "rapid personality growth the difference of emotional and cognitive maturity between a",
    "14 and 22-year-old is immense. Hence, we believe that this proposed amendment is a",
    "While appreciating the positive steps taken towards gender neutralization pertaining to",
    "rape law we strongly urge, on behalf of children of Sri Lanka to immediately withdraw",
    "the proposed amendments to the Section 363 and 364 \u2013 Chapter 19 of the Penal Code."
