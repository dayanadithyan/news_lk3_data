  "original_body_lines": [
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Nalin Bandara yesterday expressed the party\u2019s inability to support the President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s endeavours to revive Sri Lanka, citing his collaboration with the leaders of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the same party responsible for the country\u2019s bankruptcy.",
    "\u201cThe President has made many statements of Government policy within the last two years. In turn, Government MPs are now singing the praises of the President. Yesterday President Wickremesinghe questioned why the SJB cannot support him as the Pohottuwa members have. That is the very reason we cannot support his efforts,\u201d Bandara said.\u00a0 He remarked that those responsible for leading the country to bankruptcy since 2005 are now praising Wickremesinghe, and they appear to view the President in a favourable light.\u00a0 \u201cSJB lawyers even filed cases against them, and they were found responsible for the crisis. Hence, we are unable to collaborate with them,\u201d he said."
