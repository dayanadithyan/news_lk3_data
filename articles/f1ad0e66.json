    "Minister of Sports and Tourism Harin Fernando has revealed that the presidential election will most likely happen in the first week of October.",
    "Speaking to the media today (05 Feb.), acknowledging the need for there to be a newly elected President by 14 October, Fernando expressed his confidence that President Ranil Wickremesinghe would contest the upcoming election.",
    "He further emphasised that President Wickremesinghe\u2019s reappointment is essential in order for Sri Lanka to further develop, and fully recover from the worst economic crisis the country has seen since independence in 1948.",
    "\u201cOther people can also try [contesting], but the way I see it, this President needs another chance if we are to save the country, because he saved this country from bankruptcy in such a short term, probably the shortest period in which such a change has been made by a president. Yes, people are facing difficulties, but when a patient is on his deathbed, bitter medicine and difficult procedures must be given. It is painful and difficult, but it works, and that\u2019s what Sri Lanka is like too. Thus, we have hope. So far, the President\u2019s medicine has turned our country towards betterment, we have now moved from the ICU to a normal room, but the people also have the power to put this patient back in the ICU and kill it\u201d, the Minister opined."
