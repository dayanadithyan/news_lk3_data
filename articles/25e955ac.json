    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 While commitments agreed to under an ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme require Sri Lanka to carry out hard and unpopular reforms, the public deserve transparency and accountability from leaders, US ambassador Julie Chung said.",
    "Speaking at a American Chamber of Commerce CXO Forum in Colombo on Wednesday January 31, the ambassador said the commitments required by the IMF as part of its Extended Fund Facility programme call for government reform measures in both tax compliance and combatting corruption.",
    "\u201cThese are hard steps, and not always popular. Sri Lanka has taken difficult measures to put the country on a long-term sustainable footing and comply with the IMF commitments. But the people of Sri Lanka deserve and continue to demand openness, transparency, and accountability from their leaders as the process of reforms moves forward,\u201d she said.",
    "The new higher value added tax (VAT) rates have been a hit on the average Sri Lankan and the country\u2019s businesses, she told the business leaders in attendance at the event",
    "\u201cWe understand that while there may be short term necessary pains, the public deserves to know that such measures are being taken looking at the wholeness of the problem and endemic issues that must be addressed in a structural, sustainable way, fair and transparent to all.\u00a0 That includes not just raising taxes but eliminating tax loopholes, addressing government inefficiencies, particularly in state owned enterprises,\u201d the diplomat said.",
    "\u201cIt means digitalising customs to raise revenue and reduce corruption.\u00a0 Creating predictable customs duties and streamlined processes would encourage importers, who want to import more to Sri Lanka but are worried about the uncertainty in the import process. \u00a0Unpredictable customs fees discourage importers and limit the amount of customs revenue the Sri Lankan government can collect.\u00a0 This shifts the burden of tax revenue further onto the shoulders of the people, who can\u2019t bear much more,\u201d she said.",
    "Chung said that in a recent meeting National Chamber of Exporters, business owners had relayed some of the obstacles they face, including red tape, regulatory challenges, and unpredictability.",
    "\u201cExports and private sector growth will be the engine of recovery, but they need the space and support to thrive.\u00a0 As the largest export market for Sri Lanka, the United States can help be part of the solution,\u201d she said. (Colombo/Feb01/2024)"
