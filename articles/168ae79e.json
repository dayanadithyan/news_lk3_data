    "(AP) \u2014 Hundreds of inmates fled Haiti\u2019s main prison after armed gangs stormed the facility in an overnight explosion of violence that engulfed much of the capital. At least five people were dead Sunday.",
    "The jailbreak marked a new low in Haiti\u2019s downward spiral of violence and came as gangs step up coordinated attacks in Port-au-Prince, while embattled Prime Minister Ariel Henry is abroad trying to salvage support for a United Nations-backed security force to stabilize the country.",
    "Three bodies with gunshot wounds lay at the prison entrance, which was wide open, with no guards in sight. Plastic sandals, clothing and electric fans were strewn across normally overcrowded concrete patios. In another neighborhood, the bloodied corpses of two men with their hands tied behind the backs laid face down as residents walked past roadblocks set up with burning tires.",
    "Authorities had yet to provide an account of what happened. But Arnel Remy, a human rights attorney whose nonprofit works inside the prison, said on X, formerly Twitter, that fewer than 100 of the nearly 4,000 inmates remained behind bars.",
    "Those choosing to stay included 18 former Colombian soldiers accused of working as mercenaries in the July 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Mo\u00efse. On Saturday night, several of the Colombians shared a video pleading for their lives.",
    "\u201cPlease, please help us,\u201d one of the men, Francisco Uribe, said in the message widely shared on social media. \u201cThey are massacring people indiscriminately inside the cells.\u201d",
    "On Sunday, Uribe told The Associated Press \u201cI didn\u2019t flee because I\u2019m innocent.\u201d",
    "In the absence of official information, inmates\u2019 family members rushed to the prison to check on loved ones.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know whether my son is alive or not,\u201d said Alexandre Jean as she roamed around the cells looking for any sign of him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d",
    "The violence Saturday night appeared to be widespread, with several neighborhoods reporting gunfire.",
    "There were reports of a jailbreak at a second Port-au-Prince prison containing around 1,400 inmates. Armed gangs also occupied and vandalized the nation\u2019s top soccer stadium, taking one employee hostage for hours, the nation\u2019s soccer federation said in a statement. Internet service for many residents was down as Haiti\u2019s top mobile network said a fiber optic cable connection was slashed during the rampage.",
    "In the space of less than two weeks, several state institutions have been attacked by the gangs, who are increasingly coordinating their actions and choosing once unthinkable targets like the Central Bank. After gangs opened fire at Haiti\u2019s international airport last week, the U.S. Embassy said it was temporarily halting all official travel to the country. As part of coordinated attacks by gangs, four police officers were killed Thursday.",
    "The epicenter of the latest violence Saturday night was Haiti\u2019s National Penitentiary, which is holding several gang leaders. Amid the exchange of gunfire, police appealed for assistance.",
    "\u201cThey need help,\u201d a union representing police said in a message on social media bearing an \u201cSOS\u201d emoji repeated eight times. \u201cLet\u2019s mobilize the army and the police to prevent the bandits from breaking into the prison.\u201d",
    "The clashes follow violent protests that turned deadlier in recent days as the prime minister went to Kenya to try and salvage a proposed U.N.-backed security mission in Haiti to be led by the East African country. Henry took over as prime minister following Moise\u2019s assassination and has repeatedly postponed plans to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, which haven\u2019t happened in almost a decade.",
    "Haiti\u2019s National Police has roughly 9,000 officers to provide security for more than 11 million people, according to the U.N. They are routinely overwhelmed and outgunned by gangs, which are estimated to control up to 80% of Port-au-Prince.",
    "Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, a former elite police officer known as Barbecue who now runs a gang federation, has claimed responsibility for the surge in attacks. He said the goal was to capture Haiti\u2019s police chief and government ministers and prevent Henry\u2019s return.",
    "The prime minister, a neurosurgeon, has shrugged off calls for his resignation and didn\u2019t comment when asked if he felt it was safe to come home."
