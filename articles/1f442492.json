    "The Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal furnished by the Minister of Tourism and Lands to import 750 vans with a seating capacity of 6 \u2013 15 (electric and hybrid) and 250 buses with seating capacity from 6 \u2013 30 which are small buses and larger buses with seating capacity of 30 \u2013 45 for transportation of tourists without any special tax relief.",
    "Although it is expected that vehicles engaged in the tourism industry for transportation of tourists should be less than 06 years old, it is apparent that the condition of the vehicles presently used\u00a0 for the transportation of tourists are not satisfactory and as a result\u00a0 the fame earned by Sri Lanka as a prominent tourist destination is being tarnished",
