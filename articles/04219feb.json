  "original_body_lines": [
    "In a move aimed at expanding solar power generation, the Cabinet of Ministers on Monday approved a proposal to call for Expressions of Interest (EoIs) from public-private partnerships (PPP) to install rooftop solar panels on 300 railway stations across Sri Lanka.",
    "Speaking at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing, Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardena highlighted that over 300 stations and buildings owned by Sri Lanka Railways have been identified as suitable sites for the project.",
    "He said the initiative is part of a broader effort to enhance the country\u2019s renewable energy capacity by leveraging the extensive infrastructure of the railway network.",
    "\u201cAreas in the North and East, as well as parts of the South like Hambantota, receive abundant sunlight. It would be advantageous for the Railways if we can generate a profit by installing rooftop solar panels on these stations,\u201d Gunawardena noted.",
    "The Minister also clarified that previous EoIs related to similar initiatives would be disregarded and fresh submissions will be called for under this new proposal.",
    "The proposal, submitted by Minister Gunawardena, received unanimous approval from the Cabinet of Ministers."
