    "Andoris my beggar friend from the previous story and I developed a friendship based on mutual respect. Andoris plied his trade mainly in and around the Colpetty market. He was a man of many parts. Apart from being a very good actor (a distinct advantage for one practicing his profession), he was both cunning and resourceful. Except for the fact that his body was extremely thin, there was nothing physically wrong with him.",
    "He was however \u2018double jointed\u2019 \u2013 an ability to bend the limbs at the joints to a much greater degree than is normally possible. He used his agility to perfect advantage. At certain times he would sit on the pavement outside the market with his knees together straight in front him and flat on the ground, with his lower legs and feet sticking out on either side. As the average human torso could not normally maintain this posture, people naturally assumed that the man was deformed. He enhanced this supposed deformity by bending one hand inwards till his thumb touched his lower arm \u2013 another impossible feat for the average person.",
    "Regular fits of coughing and gasping for breath, were additional embellishments to his act. \u201cMay you reach Nirvana by helping a poor man,\u201d was the chorus with which he filled the gaps in the coughing fits. He never ever verbally claimed that he was in any way disabled. If others thought so \u2013 well that was their prerogative! Their undoing too!",
    "By mid-afternoon Andoris found that it was more lucrative to abandon his seated posture and go into the market-square to act as a porter cum hailer of taxis. He seemed to change miraculously from the pathetic deformed figure prone to breathing difficulties to a man-of-action. The agility with which he pranced about on his thin stick-like legs never failed to amaze me. Veins bulged out of his upper arms as he lifted heavy shopping bags, and he seemed very much happier doing this than his morning work.",
    "I think he felt it was a more respectable form of activity to earn a living. As the saying goes, \u2018beggars cannot be choosers\u2019, he had to earn his way through life using every possible resource available to him and if he had to turn himself into a pathetic cripple in order to achieve this \u2013 so be it! After all he not only had to support himself but a family as well.",
    "Since Andoris and I became friends, he never failed to greet me with a beaming smile. Although I was aware of his prowess in acting, I could see the unmistakable stamp of sincerity in that smile. In fact, if he saw me even when he was in his \u2018deformed mode\u2019 he would still greet me with the most, cheery smile, not at all in keeping with the image he was trying to project. Often, he would abandon his \u2018deformed mode\u2019 and follow me into the market-square, not only to become my porter but also my friend and adviser.",
    "He knew each and every stall in that market, and also what the best bargains of the day were.",
    "\u201cThe best mangoes are in the stall next to the butcher\u2019s,\u201d or, \u201cI did not see any decent drumsticks today. They all look dry and over matured but the snake gourd in the front stall is good and the price also is cheap,\u201d he would advise as we entered the market square.",
    "He was too cunning to proffer such advice within earshot of the stallholders, for he could not afford to antagonize anyone. In fact, his work depended on people\u2019s goodwill. So, if I was about to make a foolish purchase, and Andoris was not in a position to warn me verbally, he would break into a cough or clear his throat meaningfully. He always volunteered advice in a friendly and concerned manner. I appreciated his advice and guidance very much.",
    "I was also often touched by his observations, which showed genuine concern.",
    "\u201cHow is your foot, Nona? It must be better now because you are not limping anymore.\u201d I was surprised that he had even noticed. \u201cYou must be careful when you walk on these pavements, Nona, because they are so uneven.\u201d",
    "Although he addressed me as \u2018Nona\u2019 his attitude was not ingratiating. It was more a manner of speaking. He was always respectful, of course, in the way one shows respect to a friend. With me he did not bow and scrape as I saw him do with some others; and I was glad. For such behaviour invariably acted as a barrier to true communication. He probably accepted that socially I was considered his superior, but he knew, that we both knew, that on a basic human level we were equal.",
    "\u201cDid you manage to buy all the books for Sunil with the money I gave you?\u201d I once asked Andoris. Sunil was his son and Andoris was very keen that he should be sufficiently educated, so that he would not be forced to follow his father\u2019s profession.",
    "\u201cYes, yes,\u201d he said, \u201cI even had money left over to buy two extra copy books for him,\u201d he said beaming. Had he told me that he had run short of money, I would have given him some more and he knew it. But he also knew that honesty was an important element in a good friendship.",
    "Once or twice when I did not have sufficient change to give Andoris for carrying my shopping, I said to him that I would recompense him when next I saw him. \u201cNo, no, Nona! That is quite all right. Don\u2019t you worry about it,\u201d he would reassure me shaking his head from side to side as if to say, \u201cWhat are a few rupees between two friends?\u201d",
    "One day Andoris came running towards me, excitement written all over his face. \u201cNona, I have some very good news to tell you. In fact, I was looking out for you for the last few days, but you didn\u2019t come this way.\u201d He was eager for me to ask him what it was.",
    "\u201cWe have arranged a marriage for my daughter. She is going to be married soon!\u201d",
    "\u201cWhy Andoris, you look so shy one would think that you were the one who is to be married!\u201d I joked.",
    "\u201cAiyo, Nona, you are always teasing me,\u201d he pretended to complain, but he thoroughly enjoyed the banter.",
    "I was very happy for Andoris. Marriage for his daughter had been an enormous weight on his mind. He had once told me that being a beggar was a distinct disadvantage when it came to finding a marriage partner for his daughter. Although she was fair and beautiful, all interested parties lost interest the moment they came to know how the prospective father-in-law made a living.",
    "\u201cSo does the bridegroom-to-be know about your line of work?\u201d I asked as tactfully as I could.",
    "\u201cWell,\u201d he said clearing his throat, with a cunning expression creeping into his face. \u201cI told him that I work in the market. That is not a lie, no?\u201d he replied, trying to justify himself. He looked at me for some support.",
    "\u201cOf course not,\u201d I backed him. \u201cYou work in and around the market and that is the truth!\u201d I knew that I would probably have done the same had I been in his position. It was so much easier to be honest when one\u2019s circumstances were not so desperate, and money was available to back up one\u2019s sense of honesty.",
    "\u201cAnyway,\u201d he said \u201cI know that the young man has taken a great liking to my girl and he won\u2019t change his mind in a hurry. In fact, when I told him that I wouldn\u2019t be able to give the girl a dowry because I have to educate my son, do you know what he said? \u2018I am not interested in any dowry. I have a very good job as a security guard!\u2019 So, Nona, I think the right time has come for my daughter. This match will definitely work.\u201d",
    "I was truly happy for Andoris. It was about time he had some luck! Since his wife died two years ago his biggest worry had been finding a husband for his daughter.",
    "\u201cWe are thinking of fixing the wedding for the end of next month,\u201d he said beaming again with excitement. \u201cIt will give me a little more time to collect some money for the wedding.\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll give you some money for the young couple \u2013 a wedding present,\u201d I said. \u201cI am sure there\u2019ll be lots of things they would need when they start a new life together.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat wedding presents!\u201d Andoris scoffed. \u201cI will need every cent for the wedding!\u201d",
    "\u201cBut Andoris, \u201cI replied, \u201cSurely you\u2019re not thinking of wasting money on a wedding reception! You should give whatever money you can afford to your daughter!\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat Nona! What are you saying! What sort of father would I be if I don\u2019t even give a wedding reception to my own daughter! It is going to be the most important day in her life and in mine also! Of course, I am going to give her a wedding and a grand one too!\u201d Andoris remonstrated with such vehemence that I was quite taken aback.",
    "\u201cAnd Nona you must also come to the wedding. I will tell you the moment the date is finalized. I will be going to see the astrologer next week to find a good nekath day.\u201d",
    "I was really touched that Andoris had invited me to the wedding. \u201cYes Andoris, I\u2019d love to come,\u201d I said, and meant it.",
    "He told me he lived in Wanathamulla; and warned me that it would not be easy finding his place; but he said he would give me clear instructions nearer the date.",
    "The next time I saw Andoris I gave him some money for the wedding, with which he seemed pleased.",
    "\u201cEveryone is being so generous!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cEven the stall holders have given me money.\u201d",
    "I imagined his wad of notes hidden in his waist pouch getting fatter by the day and I was very pleased for Andoris.",
    "My problems began when I told my family and friends about the forthcoming wedding and my intention to attend it. In the first place, they thought that I was quite eccentric to have struck up a friendship with a beggar; appalled at the circumstances that had led to this friendship and thought it absolute lunacy for me to attend the wedding.",
    "I well remember my mother\u2019s horror when I first told her that I had to borrow money from a beggar to pay for my taxi.",
    "\u201cFor goodness sake! Have you no self-respect? Borrowing money from a beggar!\u201d",
    "\u201cBut Amma, I had. no option! The taxi driver was getting quite irate and abusive!\u201d I remonstrated.",
    "\u201cOf course, you had options! You could have gone back for your purse; or come here and taken the money from me!\u201d",
    "I had been too embarrassed to admit that I had felt quite intimidated by the taxi driver. In any case, she would not have understood such things because she was not a person who could have been intimidated by anyone!",
    "\u201cAnd now,\u201d my mother said in an exasperated voice, \u201cThis business of wanting to go for the wedding! It is complete madness!\u201d And for once, my husband agreed with her totally.",
    "My dilemma became a much-discussed topic among family, friends and of course the servants in my mother\u2019s household, who were always in the know of everything going on.",
    "Her chauffeur Jamis \u2013 whom I had known all my life and never quite treated me as an adult, warned: \u201cDon\u2019t you ask me to drive you around to these mudukkus in Wanathamulla. Because I won\u2019t!\u201d He stated his position clearly and categorically.",
    "As my husband drove himself to work in our car, if I needed to go anywhere during the day, I had to rely on Jamis or taxis.",
    "I desperately turned to my friends for some sort of understanding and support but did not receive any. The general consensus being that, it was not very prudent to place myself in a vulnerable position in the shanties of Wanathamulla at a time when rumblings were being heard and tremors felt, of the growing dissatisfaction and anger of the \u2018have nots\u2019 against the `better offs\u2019 in society.",
    "In the end I caved in as one does in such circumstances, unless of course one was made of sterner stuff, which I was not.",
    "I felt sad and depressed at the thought of telling Andoris that I would not be able to attend his daughter\u2019s wedding, after all. I knew that I would have to resort to lies in order not to hurt his feelings, and this really appalled me. I felt I was downgrading our friendship. And yet what other option did I have?",
    "When I next met Andoris, I did not beat about the bush but told him straight that I would not be able to make it to the wedding. I said \u2013 lying through my teeth \u2013 that, I had to go out of Colombo that weekend and would not be able to be back in time for the wedding.",
    "\u201cAiyo Nona what a shame! It would have been so nice if you could have come!\u201d his disappointment was starkly apparent on his face.",
    "I felt terrible because I knew that I was letting him down badly. In order to ease my conscience, I pulled out a fifty-rupee note and held it out to him.",
    "\u201cNo, no!\u201d he said. \u201cI have more than enough money for the wedding now.\u201d",
    "I felt ashamed that I had offered him money. Money could not camouflage the fact that I had disappointed him. It was not money he wanted but my presence at his daughter\u2019s wedding \u2013 the most important day in her life and his also.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good wedding party,\u201d he said, \u201cI am sorry that you won\u2019t be able to come.\u201d He looked crestfallen.",
    "I despised myself for my weakness, and my willingness to bow down to convention so readily. The next time I met Andoris he welcomed me with a beaming smile. As he shook his head from side to side, he said, \u201cI knew I would see you today, Nona, because Saturday is your marketing day. The wedding went off very well!\u201d he exclaimed. Taking a little box wrapped in red and gold shiny paper, from his shirt pocket, he stretched out his hand towards me. \u201cI brought you a piece of wedding cake,\u201d he said shyly.",
    "\u201cOh, thank you Andoris, how nice of you to have remembered me,\u201d I said, accepting it with gratitude, while my face burned with shame.",
