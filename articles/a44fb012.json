  "original_title": "Scientists from Canada, Sri Lanka work together to address threat of antibiotic resistance in animals",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Two scientists whose connection was sparked in Saskatchewan are working together from different sides of the globe to improve animal health in Sri Lanka, in hopes of addressing a potential global health threat.",
    "\u201cLiterally right here is where we sat together,\u201d said Joe Rubin, looking around his lab at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada.",
    "It\u2019s the scene where an international friendship formed on the Prairies.",
    "Rubin is a professor of veterinary microbiology at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine in Saskatoon. He met fellow scientist Roshan Madalagama almost 11 years ago, when Madalagama came to Saskatchewan from Sri Lanka as a graduate student.",
    "\u201cI believe that my second home is in Canada,\u201d Madalagama told CBC from Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cAs a mentor, [Rubin] is one of the greatest people I\u2019ve ever met in my life. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d",
    "Rubin supervised Madalagama as the two studied antimicrobial resistance, or AMR \u2014 the same issue they\u2019re tackling today.",
    "\u201cAs a supervisor, there is nothing as gratifying as when your student kind of surpasses you,\u201d Rubin said with a laugh.",
    "\u201cDr. Madalagama has gone on to do really amazing things. He\u2019s been a really inspirational person in his country.\u201d",
    "Antimicrobial resistance is what happens when bacteria, fungus and parasites build up resistance to medication like antibiotics, making infections harder to treat and some procedures riskier. It can happen due to the overuse or misuse of those medications.",
    "The World Health Organization deems AMR a major global threat, and the rates are especially high in Sri Lanka.",
    "Up until last year, Madalagama said his country didn\u2019t monitor that resistance in animals \u2014 only humans.",
    "The immediate worry is if it goes unchecked, vets in Sri Lanka won\u2019t be able to treat illnesses in livestock \u2014 which many families depend on for income or food for their own families.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re really relying on it for their nutrition, so it\u2019s not the bigger-scale agriculture that we may be familiar with here in Saskatchewan,\u201d said Rubin.",
    "Madalagama says until last year, Sri Lanka only monitored antimicrobial resistance in humans, not animals. He hopes to create a national system to keep track of the resistance in animals, especially livestock. (Submitted by Joe Rubin)",
    "The overarching concern, however, is that resistance seen in animals could transfer to humans anywhere.",
    "\u201cAll the world is like one village \u2014 a global village,\u201d said Madalagama.",
    "\u201cSo because of that, we need to have a very collective effort.\u201d",
    "Madalagama has helped the WHO and Sri Lanka\u2019s government address antimicrobial resistance from a veterinary standpoint, but now he and Rubin are focusing on more grassroots work.",
    "Thanks to funding from the University of Saskatchewan, the two started a years-long effort to help rural vets in Sri Lanka detect issues faster, and improve training at the country\u2019s national veterinary lab.",
    "Their first endeavour was to create a lab manual, accessible from anywhere in the world. Rubin visited Sri Lanka in March, and plans on welcoming two vet technicians to Saskatoon this fall.",
    "Madalagama said he\u2019s excited his colleagues can learn from Rubin, just as he did.",
    "\u201cThey really like to have these kinds of very good opportunities to learn from a Canadian expert,\u201d he said."
