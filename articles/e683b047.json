    "The Colombo High Court rejected the bail application filed by the counsels representing the recently imprisoned Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera yesterday.",
    "Colombo High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige rejected the bail application, stating that the counsels had failed to present any special circumstances before the Court that would warrant the release of Gnanasara Thera on bail.",
    "The defence counsels urged the court to grant bail to Gnanasara Thera pending appeal, considering the extended delays in concluding appeal hearings at the Court of Appeal and his health condition as grounds for release.",
    "On 28 March, the Colombo High Court sentenced Gnanasara Thera to four years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 100 000 over a contentious statement made by him about Islam and Muslims in 2016.",
    "Despite the Buddhist monk\u2019s apology to the Muslim community in February, the Judge concluded that the defendant\u2019s remarks during the press conference were not accidental but intentional and malicious expressions of religious animosity.",
    "He is presently detained at Welikada Prison and undergoing treatment at the Prison Hospital due to complaints of chest and stomach pain."
