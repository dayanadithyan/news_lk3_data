    "Ambercycle\u2019s polyester material, cycora\u00ae, is made from post-consumer and post-industrial textile waste.",
    "Made through molecular regeneration technology, cycora yields the same quality as virgin-grade materials, but with lesser greenhouse gas emissions, the companies said in a statement.",
    "It reduces landfill and the need to incinerate end-of-life textiles.",
    "This circular method is in demand among large brands and manufacturers looking for new streams of high-quality next-gen materials made from recycling, or textile-to-textile regeneration as it is known in the industry.",
    "\u201cTogether with Ambercycle, MAS is enabling better access to regenerated next-gen material for our customer partners,\u201d MAS Holdings Director of Group Sustainable Business, Nemanthie Kooragamage said.",

    "The three-year offtake agreement allows MAS to reserve capacity to utilize Ambercycle\u2019s circular polyester material cycora\u00ae for their customer partners.",
    "It also enables Ambercycle to expedite efforts to reach commercial-scale production as quickly as possible, and supports Ambercycle\u2019s efforts in Asia, close to the value chain.",
    "\u201cSupply-chain partners play a crucial role in advancing our work to decarbonize fashion and minimize the impact of raw-material extraction on our environment,\u201d Ambercycle Co-founder and CEO Shay Sethi said.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to share our work with MAS as one of the premier manufacturing partners in the global apparel ecosystem. Together we share a strong commitment to diverting textiles from landfills and pioneering circularity at scale.\u201d",
