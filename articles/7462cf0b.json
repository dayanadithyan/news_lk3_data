    "Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A. Sumanthiran announced yesterday that the party will decide which candidate to support in the upcoming presidential election after holding discussions with all the main contenders.",
    "Speaking to the media, Sumanthiran said the party will evaluate the proposed programs of the candidates and engage in discussions with them. \u201cThe final decision will be made following these meetings,\u201d he said.",
    "When asked about reports suggesting the TNA might back SJB leader Sajith Premadasa at the Presidential elections, Sumanthiran denied the claim. He also mentioned that the party has not considered fielding a Tamil candidate in the election.",
    "Meanwhile, the Tamil National People\u2019s Front (TNPF), led by MP Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, has called for a boycott of the upcoming Presidential election by the Tamil community. The TNPF urged Tamils to abstain from voting until their aspirations are addressed.",
    "\u201cThe Sri Lankan Government views the Tamil homeland as hostile,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThey continue with Buddhization, militarization, and structural genocide in our homeland. As long as they maintain majority control, they will treat Tamils not as citizens, but as adversaries.\u201d",
    "The TNPF emphasised that boycotting the election would send a strong message to the Government, demonstrating that the Tamils reject participation under current conditions.",
    "The TNPF outlined two possible paths for resolving the island\u2019s ethnic conflict: either suppressing the Tamils and forcing them to abandon their pursuit of a political solution, or honestly addressing the situation and offering a permanent political resolution."
