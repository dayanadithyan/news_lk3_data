    "Street Burger started dishing out delicious burgers from a food truck and grew to become a popular eating joint in no time. But Tharique, Founder, Street Burger, had bigger plans. He had confidence in his product and wanted to take it to more Sri Lankans and expand operations. Scale and reach came with Uber Eats. As Sri Lanka\u2019s most popular food and grocery delivery app, it was a big support for the young brand to be available on Uber Eats and the orders grew as word went around. Today, Street Burger has grown from being a food truck to a restaurant chain with four outlets and continues to expand.",
