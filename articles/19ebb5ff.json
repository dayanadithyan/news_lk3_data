  "original_body_lines": [
    "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dissolved the influential War Cabinet tasked with steering the war in Gaza, Israeli officials said Monday, a move that comes days after a key member of the body bolted the government over frustrations surrounding the Israeli leader\u2019s handling of the war.",
    "The move was widely expected following Benny Gantz\u2019s departure earlier this month, which he said came after mounting frustrations over Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the war. Gantz\u2019s absence makes Netanyahu more dependent on his ultranationalist allies to govern and the dissolution of the War Cabinet underlines that shift is underway as Israel continues its eight-month-long war in Gaza.",
    "The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the change with the media, said that going forward Netanyahu would hold smaller forums with some of his government members for sensitive issues surrounding the war. That includes his security Cabinet, where far-right governing partners who oppose cease-fire deals and have voiced support for reoccupying Gaza, are members.",
    "The War Cabinet was formed in the early days of the war, when Gantz, a centrist opposition party leader, joined the coalition in a show of unity following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel. He had demanded that a small decision-making body steer the war, in a bid to sideline far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s government.",
    "It was made up of three members \u2014 Gantz, Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant \u2014 and together they made important decisions throughout the course of the war.",
    "Gantz\u2019s departure, while not posing a direct threat to Netanyahu\u2019s rule, rocked Israeli politics at a sensitive time. The popular former military chief was seen as a statesman who boosted Israel\u2019s credibility with its international partners at a time when Israel finds itself at its most isolated.",
    "Netanyahu\u2019s government is Israel\u2019s most religious and right-wing ever. In Israel\u2019s fractious parliamentary system, Netanyahu relies on a group of small parties to help keep his government afloat and without the support of Gantz\u2019s party, Netanyahu could be more beholden to the far-right allies who have repeatedly pledged to toppled the government if their demands are not met.",
    "Critics say Netanyahu\u2019s wartime decision-making has been influenced by the ultranationalists in his government. Netanyahu denies the accusations and says he has the country\u2019s best interests in mind."
