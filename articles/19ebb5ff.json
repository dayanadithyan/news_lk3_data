  "original_body_lines": [
    "Israeli officials said Monday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved the influential War Cabinet that was tasked with steering the war in Gaza.",
    "The War Cabinet was dissolved following the departure from the government of Benny Gantz, an opposition lawmaker who had joined the coalition in the early days of the war. He had demanded that a small Cabinet be formed as a way to sideline far-right lawmakers in Netanyahu\u2019s government. Gantz, Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were its members and made key decisions together throughout the war.",
    "The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the change with the media, said that going forward Netanyahu would hold smaller forums with some of his government members for sensitive issues.",
    "Gantz, a longtime political rival of Netanyahu\u2019s, joined the government as a show of unity after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. He left the government earlier this month, citing frustration with Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the war.",
    "Critics say Netanyahu\u2019s wartime decision-making has been influenced by ultranationalists in his government who oppose a deal that would bring about a cease-fire in exchange for the release of hostages. They have voiced support for the \u201cvoluntary migration\u201d of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and reoccupying the territory.",
    "Netanyahu denies the accusations and says he has the country\u2019s best interests in mind."
