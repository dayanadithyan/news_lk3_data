  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The fundamental rights of voters have been violated through the postponement of the 2023 local government elections, the Supreme Court has said, ordering the election commission to hold the postponed election immediately.",
    "Media reports said the apex court had ruled that the Minister of Finance and members of the election commission have violated the voters\u2019 fundamental rights in delaying the election.",
    "The verdict was issued upon hearing petitions\u00a0 filed by several parties including the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), the leftist National Peoples\u2019 Power (NPP) and the People\u2019s Action for Free & Fair Elections (PAFFREL).",
    "The election commission had originally scheduled the local government polls for March 9, 2023, but postponed them to April 25, 2023. The elections were not held, however, citing a lack of funds due to the country\u2019s ongoing recovery from the worst financial crisis in decades. (Colombo/Aug22/2024)"
