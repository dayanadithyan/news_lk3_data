  "original_body_lines": [
    "U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for Alexei Navalny\u2019s death and warned there could be consequences, saying he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d but \u201coutraged\u201d by the opposition leader\u2019s passing.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what happened, but there is no doubt that the death of Nalvany was a consequence of something that Putin and his thugs did,\u201d Biden said at the White House after Russian prison officials announced that Navalny had died.",
    "\u201cRussian authorities are going to tell their own story,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut make no mistake. Make no mistake: Putin is responsible for Navalny\u2019s death.\u201d",
    "He also said he was \u201ccontemplating\u201d additional steps to punish Russia in the aftermath of Navalny\u2019s death, paying tribute to the opposition leader for \u201cbravely\u201d standing up to Putin\u2019s government\u2019s \u201ccorruption\u201d and \u201cviolence.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re contemplating what else can be done,\u201d Biden said in response to questions from reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a whole number of options, that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say right now.\u201d",
    "Biden also told reporters that there was \u201cno nuclear threat to the people of America or anywhere else in the world with what Russia is doing at the moment,\u201d even as Russia considered deploying anti-satellite technology in space. Russia has previously denied the claim.",
    "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what possible steps against Russia were being evaluated.",
    "U.S. officials were still seeking more information about Navalny\u2019s death at a Russian penal colony north of the Arctic Circle, where he was dispatched less than two months ago.",
    "But the development, and Biden\u2019s reaction, has put a further chill into already bitter U.S.-Russian relations.",
    "The 47-year-old Navalny had been a leading critic of Putin, and Biden had said after meeting Putin in Geneva in June 2021 that Nalvany\u2019s death would risk devastating consequences for Putin.",
    "Biden and Putin remain deeply at odds over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine two years ago, over which Russia has been sanctioned by the United States and other Western nations, and Biden is urging Republican hardliners in the U.S. Congress to support additional funding to pay for more weaponry for Ukraine\u2019s military.",
    "Russia has figured prominently on the campaign trail as Biden seeks reelection in November.",
    "His expected Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, triggered bipartisan outrage last week by saying he would do nothing to defend NATO allies from Russia unless they paid a greater share for the common defenses.",
    "The top Republican in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, has not put a Senate bill including $95.34 billion in security assistance for Ukraine and Israel, international humanitarian aid and resources to help allies in the Indo-Pacific up to a vote.",
    "After Navalny\u2019s death, Johnson said the U.S. and its allies should use \u201cevery means available to cut off Putin\u2019s ability to fund his unprovoked war in Ukraine and aggression against the Baltic states.\u201d",
    "\u201cHistory\u2019s watching the House of Representatives. The failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten,\u201d Biden said.",
    "In Munich for a major security conference, Vice President Kamala Harris vowed that the U.S. would never retreat from its NATO alliance obligations put in place after World War Two, contrasting Biden\u2019s approach to global engagement with presidential election hopeful Trump\u2019s isolationist views.",
    "She also met with Alexei Navalny\u2019s wife Yulia on the margins of the conference and \u201cexpressed her sorrow and outrage\u201d over reports of her husband\u2019s death, a White House official said.",
    "Biden\u2019s presidential reelection campaign on Friday released a new minute-long advertisement blasting Trump for abandoning NATO. They planned to target the ad to 2.5 million American voters in the closely contested election states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania who trace their ancestry to the NATO states bordering Russia."
