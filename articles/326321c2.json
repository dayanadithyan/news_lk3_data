    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka confectioner Uswatte said it had resumed producing a potato chip snack after it had to be stopped due to a curb on potato imports by the government.",
    "\u201cPotato Chips are king among all categories of snack food around the world, and we are more than happy to be able to bring this beloved brand of potato chip back to Sri Lanka,\u201d Chairman of Uswatte Confectionery Works Pvt Ltd Quintus Perera said.",
    "\u201cThe reintroduction of the Chirpy Chip brand, provides us with an opportunity to create a premium potato chip brand, that meets international standards.\u201d",
    "Chirpy Chips were first introduced into the market in 1994 but were discontinued due to government polices at the time, that placed restriction on the import of high-quality potatoes to the country, the company said.",
    "The chips are available in three flavours, Cheese & Onion, Salted, and Hot N Spicy, and come in packs of 16g at 70 rupees, 24g at 100 rupees, 50g at 200 rupees and 73g at 300 rupees.",
    "Founded by the late Christy Perera in 1956, Uswatte manufactures popular savoury snacks Tipi Tip and Jumbo Peanuts, and confections like Glucorasa jujubes and jelly, and wafers. In 2018 it entered the crowded domestic biscuits market. (Colombo/Aug15/2024)"
