  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says regardless of the election sequence, SJB and its leader Sajith Premadasa is prepared to face any poll",
    "Stresses there are no legal impediments to holding both elections concurrently",
    "Accuses President Ranil Wickremesinghe of protecting Rajapaksas despite public disapproval",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Harshana Rajakaruna yesterday called on the Government to hold both the Presidential and General election on the same date.",
    "Addressing a press conference in Colombo, Rajakaruna noted that there were no legal impediments to holding both elections concurrently, and doing so would result in significant cost savings for the country.",
    "The MP remarked that regardless of whether the Presidential or Parliamentary election takes precedence, the SJB leader Sajith Premadasa, is prepared to face it. He further asserted that the SJB team is equally prepared for either scenario.",
    "\u201cThere has been speculation on political platforms regarding the possibility of a General election preceding the Presidential election. The SJB is ready for any forthcoming election,\u201d he said.",
    "Furthermore, the MP emphasised that while other political parties chose not to pursue legal action during discussions surrounding the postponement of the Local Government election, the SJB took proactive measures by petitioning the court. He said consequently, a court order was issued, compelling the continuation of the election process but the Government decided to ignore it.",
    "Rajakaruna asserted that the SJB boasts the most skilled team capable of contesting Parliamentary elections, steering the country\u2019s progress, spearheading economic initiatives, and possessing expertise across various sectors. \u201cThe majority of the country\u2019s populace will elect the SJB as the next Government,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOne faction within the Government advocates for holding Parliamentary elections first, while another faction proposes prioritising the Presidential election. We urge the Government to consider conducting both the Presidential and General elections simultaneously, if feasible. There are no legal impediments to this approach, and significant cost savings could be achieved,\u201d he noted.",
    "The MP stressed the crucial need for a President and a Parliament chosen by the people\u2019s votes. He highlighted that President Ranil Wickremesinghe, once defeated in the Parliamentary elections, is now acting as a guardian for the Rajapaksa family. Despite public disapproval, the MP noted, this Government continues to wield authority."
