    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana has stated that the current Value Added Tax (VAT) rate will need to be raised from 18% to 20-21% to meet the demands of the public servants who are on strike for a salary increase.",
    "He had made this observation during a meeting at the President\u2019s Office today (08), held under the patronage of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, according to the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD).",
    "It further said that the government is not prepared to fulfill this demand as it would impose an additional burden on the public.",
    "At the discussion chaired by President Wickremesinghe at the President\u2019s Office, to address the demands presented by the striking trade unions, it was emphasised that a salary increase this year is not possible.",
    "However, the 2025 Budget will consider revising public service salaries based on the expert committee\u2019s recommendations on salary disparities, the PMD reported."
