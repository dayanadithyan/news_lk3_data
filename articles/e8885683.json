    "\u201cThe whole point is that we introduce how we as Muslims break our fasts, and how we do things in unity, and to make sure that people realize and understand what Muslim faith is all (about) to just show the beauty of Islam through simple things like iftar,\u201d Zareena Akbarally, who is part of Soup Kitchen Sri Lanka, told Arab News.",
