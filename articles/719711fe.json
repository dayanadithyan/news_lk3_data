    "Bandula Chandrasekara: The Author of \u201cAsuwe Parapuren Sannaddawa\u201d- [\u0d85\u0dc3\u0dd6\u0dc0\u0dd9 \u0db4\u0dbb\u0db4\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc3\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0daf\u0dca\u0db0\u0dc0 ] A Journey of Courage and Pragmatism",
    "Bandula Chandrasekara \u2013 A name that symbolizes resilience, courage and relentless pursuit of one\u2019s beliefs.\u00a0 When I reflect on my school days, memories come flooding back of the boy who sat next to me at Royal College, wearing the iconic blue shorts that symbolized our junior school education.\u00a0 From those early days, Bandula stood out as a bright light, embodying the school motto of *\u201dLearn or Depart\u201d in every aspect of his life.",
    "His journey described in his book *\u201dAsuwe Parapuren Sannaddawa\u201d* speaks of his unwavering determination and dedication to his ideals.\u00a0 Although I am sad that I missed the book launch, I am proud to know that our 83 logo was represented there, along with notable figures like Keerthi, Panduka and Malinda Seneviratne, who started his\u00a0 political journey with Bandula and Patali\u00a0 Champika Ranawaka .",
    "I have yet to delve into the pages of \u201cAsuwe Parapuren Sannaddawa,\u201d and I am drawn to the stories and accolades that adorn its back cover. (\u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2 \u0db4\u0ddc\u0dad\u0da7 \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc4\u0dd0\u0db8\u0daf\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dad\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd2\u0da7 \u0d9a\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dd9\u0db8 \u0db6\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dd9) But beyond the book lies a deep admiration for the man behind it. Bandula, unlike many of our peers, refused to confine himself to the comforts of familiarity.\u00a0 Instead, he approached sports, politics and academia with a rare realism.",
    "Bandula\u2019s steadfastness in confronting social prejudices in the early 80s, despite personal threats, is a testament to his courage. His alignment with Patali Champika in a tumultuous political era showed a keen understanding of ideologies and a commitment to practical solutions. While I don\u2019t entirely agree with their political philosophy at that time, I do accept the rationale behind their stance at a time when extremism was on the rise.",
    "What makes Bandula different is not just his rhetoric but his actions. Undoubtedly Bandula\u2019s principles and insights.\u00a0 In a landscape where politicians often prioritize verbiage over substance, Bandula remains a paragon of restraint and \u201cpragmatism\u201d.",
    "As I ponder the substance of Bandula\u2019s book, I am reminded that understanding the author is essential to grasping the depth of his narrative. Anuruddha Pradeep Karnasuriya\u2019s controversial guest lecture on the book launch(as the lyrics of a modern day song so aptly puts it ,\u201dRama knows the book when Sita turning the page\u201d ,\u00a0 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd4\u0dc0 \u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbb\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0dc3\u0dd3\u0dad\u0dcf \u0db4\u0ddc\u0dad \u0daf\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf \u0dbb\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dcf ) divisive, underscores the social realities that Bandula seeks to address. It is this commitment to transparency and dialogue that makes \u201cAsuwa Parapuren Sannaddawa\u201d a compelling read for all.",
    "In a world where political discourse is often marred by polarization and dogma, Bandula Chandrasekara\u2019s journey stands as a beacon of hope for future politics in Sri Lanka, as he is a seasoned politician now.\u00a0 His book serves not only as a historical record but also as a manifesto for practical leadership and unwavering faith, urging us all to delve into the wisdom inscribed within its pages."
