  "original_body_lines": [
    "Namibia\u2019s President Hage Geingob, 82, died in hospital early on Sunday, the presidency said, weeks after he was diagnosed with cancer.",
    "Geingob had been in charge of the thinly populated and mostly arid southern African country since 2015, the year he announced he had survived prostate cancer.",
    "Vice President Nangolo Mbumba takes the helm in Namibia - a mining hotspot with significant deposits of diamonds and the electric car battery ingredient lithium - until presidential and parliamentary elections at the end of the year.",
    "A presidency post on social media platform X did not give a cause of death, but late last month the presidency said he had travelled to the United States for \u201ca two-day novel treatment for cancerous cells\u201d, after being diagnosed following a regular medical check-up.",
    "Born in 1941, Geingob was a prominent politician since before Namibia achieved independence from white minority-ruled South Africa in 1990.",
    "He chaired the body that drafted Namibia\u2019s constitution, then became its first prime minister at independence on March 21 of that year, a position he retained until 2002.",
    "In 2007, Geingob became vice president of the governing South West Africa People\u2019s Organisation (SWAPO), which he had joined as an agitator for independence when Namibia was still known as South West Africa.",
    "SWAPO has remained in power in Namibia unchallenged since independence. The former German colony is technically an upper middle-income country but one with huge disparities in wealth.",
    "\u201cThere were no textbooks to prepare us for accomplishing the task of development and shared prosperity after independence,\u201d he said in a speech to mark the day in 2018.",
    "\u201cWe needed to build a Namibia in which the chains of the injustices of the past would be broken.\u201d",
    "Geingob served as trade and industry minister before becoming prime minister again in 2012.",
    "He won the 2014 election with 87% of the vote but only narrowly avoided a runoff with a little more than half the votes in a subsequent poll in November 2019.",
    "That election followed a government bribery scandal, in which officials were alleged to have awarded horse mackerel quotas to Iceland\u2019s biggest fishing firm, Samherji, in exchange for kickbacks, according to local media reports. The resultant outcry led to the resignation of two ministers.",
    "The following year, Geingob lamented that Namibia\u2019s wealth still remained concentrated in the hands of its white minority.",
    "\u201cDistribution is an issue, but how do we do it?\u201d Geingob said in a virtual session at an event organised by international organisation Horasis.",
    "\u201cWe have a racial issue here, a historical racial divide. Now you say we must grab from the whites and give it to the Blacks, it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d he said.",
    "His comments came after the government rescinded as unworkable a policy that would have made it mandatory for white-owned businesses to sell a 25% stake to Black Namibians.",
    "Geingob died at Lady Pohamba Hospital in Windhoek, where he was receiving treatment from his medical team, the presidency said."
