    "Colombo, Jan 26 (Daily Mirror) - The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) today urged Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene to call for a party leaders' meeting to discuss the Online Safety Bill before endorsing it.",
    "SJB MP Harshana Rajakaruna who raised this matter during a media briefing said his party has decided to urge the Speaker to call for a party leaders' meeting to discuss the Online Safety Bill as the government has not accommodated some of the amendments recommended by the Supreme Courts.",
    "\u201cThe Speaker should not endorse the Online Safety Bill as some of the amendments recommended by the Supreme Courts have not been made. Therefore, we urge the Speaker to call for a party leaders' meeting to discuss the matter before endorsing the Bill,\u201d MP Rajakaruna said.",
    "\u201cThere will be a conflict between the Legislature and the Judiciary if the Speaker endorses the Bill before the relevant amendments are made,\u201d he added.",
    "However, the MP fell short of outlining the amendments that have not been accommodated.",
    "At the same time, MP Rajakaruna accepted the fact that there is nothing much that could be done even if the Speaker goes ahead and endorses the Bill.",
    "\u201cThe endorsement of the Bill by the Speaker before all amendments are made cannot be considered as contempt of court as the accepted scenario is that the Legislature is supreme. The Judiciary cannot interfere with the affairs of the Legislature,\u201d he said in this regard.",
    "TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran had also come up with the same issue earlier during a recent talk show on TV."
