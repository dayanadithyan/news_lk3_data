    "The once-powerful Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) waged war against the Sri Lankan state for over thirty years. The LTTE known popularly as the Tigers was the determining force in Sri Lankan politics for nearly two decades. The decline of the LTTE began in 2004 when its Batticaloa and Amparai district\u00a0 special commander Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan\u00a0 alias \u201cCol\u201d Karuna led an eastern tiger revolt against the LTTE supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran. Although \u201cCol\u201d Karuna - also\u00a0 known as \u201cKaruna\u00a0 Ammaan\u201d - was defeated militarily by the LTTE, subsequent events demonstrated that the Eastern split weakened the LTTE considerably and ultimately led to its downfall in 2009.",
    "Twenty years have passed since the Karuna-led Eastern tiger revolt in March-April 2004. This article is the fourth and final of a series focusing on the LTTE\u2019s eastern split. In the first article published on March 16, 2024 the background and reasons for the Eastern Tiger revolt were discussed in detail. In the second article published on March 23, 2024 the course of events leading to the\u00a0 conflict in the aftermath of \u201cCol\u201d Karuna\u2019s rebellion were recounted. The\u00a0 third article\u00a0 published on\u00a0 March 30,\u00a0 2024 narrated\u00a0 details of the Tiger vs Tiger confrontation that\u00a0 commenced 20 years ago on Good Friday. This fourth and final article is about how Karuna\u2019s eastern tiger revolt ended and how the \u201cKaruna faction \u201cof the LTTE\u00a0 turned into the TMVP.",
    "As stated last week, the mainstream LTTE had struck back effectively by launching the \u201cGood Friday\u201d attack. Karuna\u2019s fighters had been routed on multiple fronts. Though Karuna cadre retreated or withdrew from several areas in the East, there were still regions under Karuna\u2019s control. Karuna\u2019s political headquarters \u201cThenagam\u201d was at Karadiyanaaru and military headquarters \u201cMeenagam\u201d at Tharavai. His own jungle hide out \u201cMarutham\u201d was at Kudumbimalai. Karuna, therefore, was expected to entrench himself in this region and hold out.",
    "This however did not happen. Instead, Karuna threw in the towel unexpectedly. The decision to call it quits was heavily influenced by ground realities. The mainstream LTTE had militarily outmanoeuvred and politically outsmarted him. Protracted warfare would have debilitated him further and ended in abject failure, without extraneous assistance. It became clear to Karuna that a long drawn-out struggle would cause serious logistical difficulties. Continuous supply of food and ammunition was going to be a problem with the LTTE slowly returning in large numbers back to the East. It also appeared that the Sri Lankan armed forces and the Norwegian facilitators would not prevent further\u00a0 LTTE attacks against him.",
    "There was also a regional backlash, as parents of cadre did not want a fratricidal fight in which people from the East would have been casualties. The enemy was not the Sinhala army or even northern Tigers but their own kith and kin. Eighty-five to 90 per cent of the invading\u00a0 LTTE force consisted of Batticaloa cadres too.",
    "Since Karuna justified his revolt against the leadership on regional lines and objected to eastern cadres fighting and dying unnecessarily, he could not allow a massacre of eastern cadres on either side to happen on account of his revolt.",
    "So Karuna decided to call off the fighting and end the strife. Concerned persons in Sri Lanka and abroad were ready to act\u00a0 as mediators. The LTTE too appeared\u00a0 to be\u00a0 willing to end fighting because\u00a0 it\u00a0 seemed to have realised\u00a0 the pitfalls of protracted\u00a0 positional warfare.",
    "The LTTE which\u00a0 got the upper hand after the \u201dGood Friday\u201d fighting, had suspended further major operations. The mainstream LTTE\u00a0 also issued a statement saying that efforts are on to expel Karuna from \u201cTamil Eelam soil\u201d. The Tiger statement gave a sign of the envisaged settlement when it referred to sending Karuna out from Tamil Eelam soil. This indicated that the LTTE wanted Karuna to leave rather than stay and fight. This made the task of potential\u00a0 peacemakers easier.",
    "Verbal assurances were given on both sides. Karuna faxed a letter to Kilinochchi promising to disband and leave. It was made possible by the collective efforts of several people in Sri Lanka and abroad who tried to end the crisis in the best interests of the eastern people and the LTTE itself.",
    "The lives of LTTE cadres on both sides, the safe return of child conscripts to their homes, the safety and peaceful life of civilians and the overall impact on the East were the issues at stake.",
    "According to the arrangement worked out, Karuna was required to provide and deliver on certain undertakings. They were:",
    "to facilitate arrangements for the smooth handing over of military assets including arms, armaments and ammunition to the LTTE;",
    "to release all Tigers and supporters in Karuna\u2019s custody safely;",
    "to vacate \u201cthe soil of Tamil Eelam\u201d (Northeastern Province) immediately and never return to it again;",
    "to refrain from any direct or indirect military or political activity in the future;",
    "to maintain silence about all matters concerning the LTTE and avoid all related media publicity;",
    "In return the LTTE provided the following assurances to Karuna:",
    "will not demand the return of any money or things of value taken away by Karuna.",
    "will not harm all cadres under Karuna\u2019s control and allow them to return to a normal life.",
    "to reabsorb only those cadres willing to rejoin the movement;",
    "to refrain from punishing all senior cadre who stood by Karuna against the LTTE leadership;",
    "to permit them wherever possible to leave the East and/or Sri Lanka;",
    "to refrain from taking revenge on Eastern civilians who supported Karuna and engaged in acts like burning effigies, destroying LTTE offices and so on.",
    "The media publicity generated by the LTTE after its victory made out that Karuna was defeated militarily and, therefore, gave up. This was only part of the truth. The reality was that Karuna gave in more due to a desire to avoid further bloodshed. Many eastern citizens were happy that Karuna had avoided an East versus East fratricidal fight.",
    "After the deal was struck, Karuna disbanded his units and dispersed around 3,500 to 4,000 cadre, asking them to go home and resume normal lives. The weapons, uniforms, cyanide capsules, identity tags and so on were confiscated.",
    "Thus Sunday 11 and Monday 12 saw more than 3,500 cadres leaving the camps. The last to leave was about 400 girls at Meenaham. When Karuna assembled them and asked them to go home they refused thinking Karuna was testing their loyalty. To demonstrate his seriousness Karuna had to explode a few grenades and scatter his cadres.",
    "Thereafter Karuna, along with 20 trusted associates and some of their family members travelled by road in six vehicles to a Colombo suburb. He was accompanied by the then UNP Batticaloa district MP Ali Zaheer Moulana, a family friend. Karuna\u00a0 was expected to flee from Sri Lanka thereafter.",
    "Though an unpublicised arrangement\u00a0 arrived at with Karuna that he would not be harmed if he fled, the mainstream LTTE soon revised its stance. The LTTE was reportedly angry with Karuna\u00a0 because of a grave breach of the terms (Clause 5) agreed upon in the \u201cpeace deal\u201d.",
    "Karuna had released several LTTE men and supporters in his custody after striking the deal on April 11. On April 12, Karuna allegedly killed a senior Tiger in his custody before fleeing Batticaloa.",
    "The LTTE considered\u00a0 this act a serious offence and indicated\u00a0 that an intensive manhunt would\u00a0 be launched against Karuna despite the peace\u00a0 arrangement. The Tigers regarded the deal as invalid now.",
    "The person reportedly killed by Karuna was `Lt. Col\u2019 Neelan, a native of Aarayiampathy in Batticaloa. Neelan was the deputy chief of the intelligence wing led by the dreaded Pottu Amman. He was arrested on March 1 by Karuna after attending a meeting at the Tiger district political headquarters housed at \u201cThenagam\u201d in Karadiyanaaru. Neelan was involved in planning several assassinations in Colombo. The Tigers held Neelan in high esteem and\u00a0 organised a grand\u00a0 funeral for\u00a0 him.",
    "The LTTE leader Prabhakaran usually preferred\u00a0 to resolve issues militarily. Initially he\u00a0 had\u00a0 treated the Karuna rebellion the same way. Yet after gaining the whip hand militarily, he had been flexible enough to reach a peace deal with Karuna.Given the LTTE\u2019s reputation for untrustworthiness there\u00a0 was a strong possibility that\u00a0 the Tigers\u00a0 had an ulterior motive in making a peace deal with Karuna. The LTTE may have had a plan\u00a0 to pursue their vendetta despite the peace deal arrangement after removing Karuna from the East and isolating him.",
    "Whatever the truth, the killing of Neelan by Karuna provided the LTTE with the reason or pretext to\u00a0 dishonour the peace deal with Karuna and unleash violence against the eastern tigers who had been with Karuna. Among the\u00a0 major casualties in this respect were the senior deputies of Karuna. When it became obvious that Karuna was going to seek safety abroad in terms of the peace deal with the LTTE, many of Karuna\u2019s senior deputies who had revolted, now wanted to re-join the LTTE.",
    "Overtures were made in this regard by a highly respected religious dignitary in the east and a prominent\u00a0 pro-LTTE Tamil expatriate in a Western country who was influential in the LTTE hierarchy. The LTTE high command was seemingly amenable and a large number of tiger leaders who had supported Karuna went to the Wanni in good faith\u00a0 relying on the LTTE leader\u2019s\u00a0 assurance. These included seniors such as\u00a0 Rabat/Robert, Jim Kelly Thaathaa, Visu, Thurai, Nilavini and Premini. All of them surrendered to the LTTE upon receiving guarantees of safety and clemency\u00a0 but were ruthlessly exterminated in the Wanni. Nothing more has been heard about them.",
    "Despite the arrangement that ended the intra-Tiger fighting in the east,\u00a0 the so-called agreement was soon observed in the breach\u00a0 by the LTTE which began targeting Karuna loyalists in the East and in other parts of the country including Colombo and suburbs. Sadly even those\u00a0 eastern cadre who had opted to be\u00a0 neutral\u00a0 were also targeted. At one point Karuna\u2019s only brother Sivanesathurai alias Reggie was also killed in the east. Some of Karuna\u2019s top aides were killed at a safe house in Kottawa.",
    "This LTTE betrayal and consequential attacks\u00a0 led to Karuna and many of his remaining cadres seeking refuge with the state security apparatus. This act of self- preservation helped them to safeguard their lives. Hundreds of cadre loyal to Karuna sought\u00a0 refuge at the military camps of Minneriya, Welikanda and Punanai in the East.",
    "A\u00a0 large-scale massacre of Karuna loyalists was prevented only due to the covert role played by the Military intelligence then headed by Brig.Kapila Hendavitharane (Subsequently Maj-Gen). It was he who first extended protection and later \u201cturned\u201d the LTTE Karuna faction into a formidable military asset. When there were accusations\u00a0 by the LTTE that the Sri\u00a0 Lankan state was aiding the Karuna faction, the then Defence Secretary Cyril Herath\u00a0 denied those\u00a0 allegations and stated that they were not in contact with Karuna. The then\u00a0 Army Chief Lionel Balagalle, however, admitted to maintaining links with Karuna, in interviews with sections of the media.",
    "Eastern tigers loyal to Karuna being hunted down ruthlessly by the LTTE had the choice of flight or fight. Some chose to fight. Chief among these was Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthan alias\u00a0 \u201cPillayan\u201d. Initially\u00a0 Pillayan entertained hopes of rapprochement with the mainstream LTTE but the\u00a0 LTTE attacks changed his mind. Horrified by the massacre of Batticaloa tigers by the mainstream LTTE, Pillayan resolved that the eastern LTTE dissidents should form their own group and function independently under Karuna.",
    "The breakaway eastern tigers formed the Thamil Eelam Makkal Viduthalai Puligal (TEMVP) in 2004. It was later changed to Thamil Makkal Viduthalai Puligal (TMVP). Karuna was the TMVP leader and Pillayan was the deputy -leader. While Karuna remained in Colombo and later sojourned in Nepal and India, Pillayan holed up in the jungles along Polonnaruwa district borders. Pillayan led the TMVP in the field in the east.\u00a0 He was helped by seniors like Mangalam Master, IniyaBharathy and Sinnethamby.\u00a0 Soon there were sporadic clashes between the LTTE and TMVP. The casualties on both sides were largely Eastern Tamils. Karuna threw in the towel to avoid further bloodshed but ultimately a lot of blood was shed in the fratricidal fight.",
    "The TMVP was allegedly responsible for many human rights violations and crimes against humanity during the 2006-2008 period. It was also of great assistance to the armed forces who began re-establishing full territorial control over the east during this period. Soon Pillayan became more popular than Karuna with ex-tigers of the east. Sri Lankan intelligence officials handling the TMVP also found it easier to interact with Pillayan instead of Karuna.",
    "There was an internal coup within the TMVP aided by intelligence authorities. Karuna was displaced by\u00a0 Pillayan as TMVP chief. The TMVP\u00a0 collaborated actively with the security forces. Ultimately the LTTE was defeated. And Prabhakaran killed.",
    "In what was a scene of poignant irony, Karuna was taken to Mullaitheevu to identify his erstwhile leader\u2019s\u00a0 body lying on the shores of Nandhikkadal lagoon. Karuna\u00a0 may have lost the eastern battle but it was Prabhakaran who lost the Eelam war!"
