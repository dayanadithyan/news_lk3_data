    "Since gaining independence, Sri Lanka has navigated a turbulent political landscape, swinging between left and right-wing ideologies until the early \u201990s. Since then, the nation has largely sought a middle path. The prolonged\u00a0 war, spanning nearly three decades, hampered development and progress but benefitted a segment from the nature of war economy.",
    "However, 2009 marked a turning point with the war\u2019s end, heralding an era of peace and offering Sri Lanka a golden opportunity to ascend to the ranks of developed nations. Country missed the bus, not necessarily due to known reasons but also the refusal to accept the fact the universal law \u2018no one wins in a war\u2019 and \u2018All must benefit from peace\u2019. This is history now.",
    "Future potential thereafter has been overshadowed by a myriad of challenges.",
    "Mismanagement, greed, corruption, egoistic elitism, and an insatiable hunger for power have plagued the political landscape, defining the country\u2019s current status quo. While these factors are well-documented, another critical element often escapes scrutiny in the rush: the caliber of many ministers and parliamentarians holding positions post-2020 elections.",
    "The quality of leadership has been questioned on numerous occasions. One minister notoriously asked in an environmental meeting where the protection of mangroves was discussed, \u201cCan we eat oxygen?\u201d. Another, in response to a foreign currency shortage claimed, \u201cA ship with a load of USD currency is on her way to Colombo harbor.\u201d And another parliamentarian emphatically voiced\u00a0 in the parliament that an\u00a0 incoming Minister possessed \u201c7 brains,\u201d leaving many to use it today as fodder for humor.",
    "Another \u2018Sinhala Buddhist\u2019 slogan is emerging, with various factions being cited as being instrumental from deviating from \u2018original Buddhism\u2019 including a group that claims \u2018Jambudveepaya is Sri Lanka\u2018 meaning Sri Lanka is where Lord Buddha was born and lived.",
    "War has started and the underpinning message is that that only one patriotic party can save the country from a foreign invasion poised to destroy Buddhism. While these tactics may have once swayed public opinion, can they still do so effectively?",
    "Traditional approaches such as reducing prices, offering salary increases, or providing bottles of arrack and lunch packets during campaigns might seem like straightforward solutions to winning votes and they have\u00a0 started already. However, their efficacy in the current climate is questionable.",
    "Firstly, the COVID-19 pandemic and economic down turn\u00a0 brought immense suffering to the people, both health-wise and economically.",
    "Secondly, Sri Lanka\u2019s youth are increasingly IT-savvy and globally connected, making them more aware of the nation\u2019s challenges and potential solutions.",
    "Thirdly, women, often the backbone of families and communities, have borne the brunt of economic downturns and political instability. Their resilience and determination for a change cannot be underestimated, and their voices are becoming increasingly influential.",
    "Fourthly, the extravagant lifestyles of some politicians, funded by taxpayers\u2019 money, have not gone unnoticed by the public. This stark contrast between the rich and poor fuels resentment and mistrust, not because of the \u2018haves\u2019 hard-earned money, but due to their inability to declare where the money has come from.",
    "An affluent politician was once seen in a photo in front of a house in a foreign country, obviously trying to show he owns it. Whether such a portrayal of image can garner support from the people now is questionable.",
    "Lastly, the scarcity of politicians with clean records and the ability to understand and act on professional advice further erodes public confidence within the system now.",
    "Therefore, as Sri Lanka approaches another election year, the stakes are high. Those at risk of losing power, and with it their privileged positions and access to resources, may resort to desperate measures, as observed in the past.",
    "Majority is aware that it is crucial to address these challenges with diligence and foresight with awareness that\u00a0 Sri Lanka would otherwise risk plunging into a dark abyss from which recovery may be exceedingly difficult if not impossible.",
    "While age-old tactics of political manipulation and populism might yield short-term gains, they are unlikely to sustain in this election. The people of Sri Lanka are increasingly matured, informed, and discerning. Most demand accountability, transparency, and genuine progress.",
    "The question remains: how long can the people be fooled? The answer lies in the collective will and determination of the Sri Lankan people to demand better, to hold their leaders accountable, and to work towards a brighter, more prosperous future for all which seems to be the common mind set of masses.",
    "As they say, this is the last chance for the people of Sri Lanka to seek \u2018change.\u2019 The country needs statesmanship, not just leadership. Integrity should flow from the top down. This notion is surfacing in most household, while some politicians and their cronies tally their share of votes from stances like fake patriotism, alertness to protect Buddhism, and the offering of bottles of arrack and lunch packets during campaings.",
