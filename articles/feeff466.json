    "IMRA, derived from the Arabic word for \u2018woman\u2019 in Islam, embodies attributes such as power, strength, adventure, energy, curiosity, spirituality, and magnetism. These awards aim to celebrate and amplify the voices of Muslim women who embody these qualities and have excelled in their respective fields.",

    "In addition to the above awards, four Lifetime Achievement Awards were given to Anushya Coomaraswamy for her dynamics in the Finance Sector, Neetha Dhammachari Ariyaratne for her social work, Ferial Ashroff for her contributions to Sri Lankan politics and social activism, and Deshabandu Jezima Ismail for her service as an educator, broadcaster, social activist, and human rights advocate.",
    "\u201cIn all the categories chosen, Muslim women have had to overcome unique challenges to prove themselves,\u201d remarked Aziz. \u201cThe IMRA Awards aim to highlight and celebrate these achievements, inspiring future generations of Muslim women to reach greater heights. We extend our heartfelt appreciation to all nominees for sharing their achievements with us. While it\u2019s the inaugural awards event, we hope to continue this tradition bi-annually, inspiring and empowering future generations of Muslim women.\u201d",
    "Notably, all proceeds from the IMRA Awards will support the Denara Training Institute, benefiting the next generation of Muslim women. The institute, in collaboration with partners such as \u201cFarhath\u2019s Mehendi\u201d and Cuty Rose, offers courses in mehendi art, dressmaking, and embroidery, nurturing the talents of young women and fostering empowerment within the community."
