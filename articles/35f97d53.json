  "original_body_lines": [
    "AI will be so advanced that probably none of us will have a job, he says",
    "US-based tech billionaire Elon Musk isn\u2019t exactly assuaging fears about artificial intelligence (AI) just like the global lender-of-last-resort \u2014 International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "\u201cProbably none of us will have a job\u201d in the future, Musk predicted last Thursday.",
    "Despite his confidence in AI\u2019s role in the world\u2019s future, Musk described the technology as his biggest fear and was vocal about his concerns.",
    "\u201cIf you want to do a job that\u2019s kind of like a hobby, you can do a job,\u201d Musk said, speaking via webcam to a tech conference in Paris. \u201cBut otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.\u201d",
    "The end of labor would require a new societal system in which the government gives everyone \u201cuniversal high income,\u201d he also predicted.",
    "Governments, regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use AI responsibly and there are fears in many industries about its capacity to cause huge redundancies as many jobs are automated.",
    "Artificial intelligence is generally understood as the ability of computers and machines to handle tasks that require human intelligence.",
    "Machine learning, which is one of the most common applications of AI, involves training machines with large amounts of data to recognise patterns, analyse data, and run forecasts and algorithms.",
    "Experts largely believe that many jobs that require a high emotional intelligence and human interaction will not be replaced, such as mental health professionals, creatives and teachers.",
    "In January 2024, the BBC reported a story titled, \u201cAI to hit 40% of jobs and worsen inequality\u201d, quoting its source as IMF.",
    "\u201cAccording to an analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), artificial intelligence is set to affect nearly 40% of all jobs,\u201d it said.",
    "\u201cIn most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality,\u201d IMF\u2019s managing director Kristalina Georgieva had said taking a macroeconomic view of the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines",
    "Ms Georgieva added that policymakers should address the \u201ctroubling trend\u201d to \u201cprevent the technology from further stoking social tensions\u201d.",
    "The IMF said AI is likely to affect a greater proportion of jobs \u2013 put at around 60% \u2013 in advanced economies. In half of these instances, workers can expect to benefit from the integration of AI, which will enhance their productivity.",
    "\u201cIn other instances, AI will have the ability to perform key tasks that are currently executed by humans. This could lower demand for labour, affecting wages and even eradicating jobs,\u201d the IMF said.",
    "Meanwhile, the IMF projected that the technology would affect just 26% of jobs in low-income countries.",
    "Ms Georgieva said \u201cmany of these countries don\u2019t have the infrastructure or skilled workforces to harness the benefits of AI, raising the risk that over time the technology could worsen inequality among nations\u201d.",
    "More generally, higher-income and younger workers may see a disproportionate increase in their wages after adopting AI. Lower-income and older workers could fall behind, the IMF believes.",
    "\u201cIt is crucial for countries to establish comprehensive social safety nets and offer retraining programmes for vulnerable workers,\u201d Ms Georgieva said. \u201cIn doing so, we can make the AI transition more inclusive, protecting livelihoods and curbing inequality,\u201d she had said.",
    "Elon Musk recently launched his Starlink service (a cluster of satellite unit services) on Indonesia\u2019s resort island of Bali as the country aims to extend internet to its remote areas. Millions of people in Indonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, are not currently hooked up to reliable internet services.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe met with Elon Musk in Bali on 19 May 2024 and discussed Sri Lanka being connected to the starlink network. This meeting took place when Wickremesinghe went to Bali to attend the 10th World Water Forum at the invitation of Indonesian President Joko Widodo.",
