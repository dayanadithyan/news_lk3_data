    "Southbeach Weligama (SBW), Weligama makes its debut at the Galle Literary Festival 2024 to be held from the 25th to the 28th of January as a Silver Sponsor. Heralded as \u2018The World\u2019s No 1 Literary Festival\u2019 by Harper\u2019s Bazaar as one of the most exciting arts-focused events in South Asia, SBW weighs in with author Alexander McCall Smith and a panel discussion that discusses the rise of Sri Lankan cuisine. This discussion brings together multi-award winner \u2013 British food writer and restaurant critic Tom Parker Bowles, co-founder of award-winning restaurant Smoke & Bitters Lahiru Perera and restaurateur and award-winning author of the cookbook \u2018Rambutan\u2019 Cynthia Shanmugalingam.",
    "In tandem with the Festival, SBW will place a contemporary installation running the length of Hall de Galle, a venue central to GLF and where Alexander McCall Smith will be speaking on \u2018One Hundred Books and Counting\u2019 on the 27th of January. The installation is reflective of SBW\u2019s inherent persona \u2013 contemporary and avant-garde with a touch of the abstract that embraces the chic canvas of modern beachfront living.",
