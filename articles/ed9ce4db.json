  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka offered a revised restructuring proposal to sovereign bond holders sources said, as the country tries to wrap up debt restructuring by the middle of the year and a holdout investor sues to force payment on one series of bonds.",
    "A US court had stayed proceedings of case by holdout investor Hamilton Reserve for six months, which has the required volumes of bond with a \u2018single series\u2019 collective action clause to file action following request which was supported by the US, UK and France.",
    "An extension of at least three months may be sought to help wrap up the debt restructuring, sources said.",
    "Sri Lanka is expecting to sign memoranda of understanding with Paris Club, within weeks, according to official sources.",
    "Courts had earlier granted the stay saying Hamilton had the option of renewing case for summary judgement once it is lifted.",
    "Sri Lanka rejected a proposal by bondholders to exchange a \u2018downside\u2019 bond linked to gross domestic product which will have a 20 percent hair cut with additional haircuts if GDP growth is low as forecasted by the International Monetary Fund.",
    "Bondholders believe that the growth projections in an IMF debt sustainable analysis is too pessimistic",
    "However bondholders are very keen on the structure, and it may be tough to convince them to accept a \u2018plain vanilla\u2019 type of solution, according to sources familiar with their thinking.",
    "Bondholders also do not want a value recovery instrument detached from the underlying bond which is not \u2018index eligible\u2019. Earlier VRI\u2019s used in debt re-structures have been upside instruments.",
    "Bondholders had earlier expressed their unhappiness at what they said was \u201cno progress\u201d in negotiations.",
    "Some bondholders were also of the view that the first ask by Sri Lanka from bondholders was deeper than the in-principle re-structure given by bilateral creditors. (Colombo/Feb22/2024)",
    "A US court had stayed proceedings of case by holdout investor Hamilton Reserve for six months, which has the required volumes of bond with a \u2018single series\u2019 collective action clause to file action following a request from the US government among others.",
    "An extension of at least three months may be sought to help wrap up the bond restructuring, sources said. It is not clear whether courts will grant the extension.",
