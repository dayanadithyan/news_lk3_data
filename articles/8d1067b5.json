    "The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Ashley de Silva today issued a clarification regarding the matter pertaining to the visa application submitted by Sri Lankan cricketer Kusal Mendis in order to take part in the upcoming ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup in the US.",
    "Responding to a question during a press conference held in Colombo this afternoon (17), the SLC CEO assured that: \u201cKusal\u2019s visa has not been rejected, but there is a process which we have to go through, and that the US Embassy in Sri Lanka is right now in touch with him\u201d.",
    "\u201cHopefully we should get the visa within another day or two\u201d, he added.",
    "Speaking further, the CEO of SLC said: \u201cSo, I think the information which has been gone out saying that his visa has been rejected is not right. His visa is not rejected. It is in the process of issuing, but they have asked for more information related to an issue, which I think the public knows.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe sent the team about two weeks in advance, in order to get acclimatized to the condition there. So there is no delay as such\u201d, he added.",
    "Meanwhile, he also emphasized that the SLC is hopeful that Mendis will join the team by the time when the tournament commences and that he will play the two warm up games as well.",
    "\u201cHopefully he will join the time when the tournament commences and definitely he should be able to play the two warm up games as well\u201d, de Silva expressed."
