  "original_body_lines": [
    "Government statistics indicate that the local vehicle assembly industry has generated over 3,200 direct and indirect employment opportunities in the past few years and that it\u2019s a US $ 3 million worth industry, Director, Engineering Division, Industrial Development Board (IDB), Nishantha Weerathunge said.",
    "\u201cThe industry has provided 5,000 employment opportunities in companies involved in the motor vehicle business and over 20,000 indirect employment opportunities, providing support services for these companies, said Weeratunaga at an event hosted recently by the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of Sri Lanka (SLACMA).",
    "Weerathunge added: \u201cIn Sri Lanka, talk of a manufacturing economy often begins only when the country is in economic trouble. The promotion of industry as a government policy was very slow due to the lack of a commitment by the authorities and the lack of knowledge among the people.",
    "\u201cAs a result, the automobile manufacturing/assembly and automotive component manufacturing industry that sprang up, faltered.",
    "\u201cAlthough the history of the industry goes back to the 1980s, the industry was not fully supported until the end of 2020. It was that year that the Ministry of Industries along with other ministries and departments introduced a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) related to the assembly/manufacturing of automobiles and manufacturing of automotive components.",
    "\u201cBased on the government\u2019s policy of taking Sri Lanka to a manufacturing economy, the Ministry of Industries has been entrusted with the lead role in the development of the country by developing the local manufacturing industry sector.",
    "\u201cFor this purpose, 20 manufacturing industries have been identified, among which automobile assembly/manufacturing and automobile component manufacturing take a leading role.",
    "\u201cA Consultative Committee on the production and assembly of automobile components related to this industry has also been established by the Ministry of Industries with members representing the industrialists engaged in this industry.",
    "\u201cVehicle assembly/production took place in Sri Lanka from time to time. However, with the aim of regulating and promoting the industry, a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was prepared only in 2020, incorporating the opinions of experts in the field and in accordance with international standards and received Cabinet approval on 11/1/2021.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, chairman, Ideal Group, Nalin Welgama said: \u201cThe government\u2019s initiative to develop local vehicle assembly has been a lifeline for these companies and their employees during the economic crisis in the absence of completely built motor vehicle imports.",
    "\u201cThe main factors that led to the implementation of the standard operating procedure is the large amount of foreign exchange that goes out of the country for the import of vehicles and the need to ensure a minimum vehicle requirement for the country, following the suspension of vehicle imports due to the Covid epidemic.",
    "\u201cThe local assembly companies are not allowed to add imported components bought from the local market and try to prove that they have added more than 20 values and have around 100 registered such companies in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cIf Sri Lanka could supply standards components to the Indian vehicle sector, it will enable Sri Lanka to reap huge benefits. The Indian automotive industry is worth US $ 70 billion, which is equivalent to Sri Lanka\u2019s economy.\u201d",
