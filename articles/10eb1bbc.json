    "Harrison asserted that numerous parties from both the Government and the opposition have pledged their allegiance to Wickremesinghe\u2019s alliance.",
    "\u201cMembers from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) are expressing their readiness to support President Wickremesinghe. Similarly, Duminda Dissanayake and his associates from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) have publicly announced their willingness to assist him. Notably, prominent figures like C. Vigneswaran from the north and east, as well as Jeevan Thondaman and others from the estate sector, have declared their full support for the president,\u201d Harrison said during his address.",
    "He further predicted a significant realignment in opposition circles once the Presidential election is officially announced, suggesting that half of those supporting Sajith Premadasa would join Wickremesinghe\u2019s alliance. \u201cThe moment the election commissioner announces the election, half of Sajith Premadasa\u2019s supporters will flock to sign the alliance formed by President Wickremesinghe,\u201d Harrison claimed.",
    "Asserting Wickremesinghe\u2019s leadership as pivotal for the nation\u2019s development, Harrison dismissed concerns about election postponement. \u201cThere are no alternatives. President Wickremesinghe is the only leader capable of advancing the country,\u201d he affirmed, expressing confidence in the timely conduct of the election. \u201cThe election will definitely be held before 17 October, I\u2019m very confident of that,\u201d he added.",
    "Harrison also disclosed Wickremesinghe\u2019s intention to emerge as the common candidate, with no rival from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). \u201cThe SLPP will not field a candidate, and the SLFP will also not have a different candidate. They stand united with Ranil Wickremesinghe,\u201d he assured, predicting Wickremesinghe\u2019s victory with over 10 million votes."
