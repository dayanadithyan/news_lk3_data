  "original_body_lines": [
    "Comrade Dr. Vickramabahu Karunaratne\u2019s legacy deserves recognition through thoughtful analysis. In response to my recent article titled \u201c41 Years to Black July \u2013 Our Voices Towards Meaningful Reconciliation,\u201d I propose addressing a critical issue.",
    "Comrade Karunaratne\u2019s political journey began within the Lanka Sam Samaja Party (LSSP). However, in 1972, he parted ways with the LSSP when it joined forces with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). The 1972 republican constitution, drafted by the SLFP, inadvertently transformed Sri Lanka into a Sinhala Buddhist state, marginalising the Tamil community. Subsequently, the 1978 Constitution, enacted during Prime Minister JR Jayewardene\u2019s regime (with current President Ranil Wickremesinghe as a cabinet minister), further entrenched Sinhala separatism, further alienating Tamil speakers.",
    "Comrade Karunaratne\u2019s principled stance against the 1978 constitution led to his dismissal from the academic position he held at the University of Peradeniya\u2019s Faculty of Engineering. His commitment to addressing Sri Lanka\u2019s national question\u2014rooted in fairness, justice, and recognition of rights\u2014exposed him to death threats. In 1988, the Deshapremi Janatha Vyaparaya (DJV) targeted him for advocating on behalf of Tamil people subjected to state terror.",
    "Despite political shifts later in life, Comrade Karunaratne consistently championed national unity based on equality, autonomy, and self-determination. Even posthumously, he faces criticism from fervent nationalists. As we reflect, let us recognize the consequences of shortsighted policies adopted by our political leaders throughout Sri Lanka\u2019s post-independence history.",
    "In 1956, when Mr. SWRD Bandaranaike pledged to make Sinhala the official language of Ceylon, he included a proviso: Tamil would have administrative status. As a twelve-year-old, I listened to Mr. KMP Rajaratne, a fervent Sinhala nationalist, on Radio Ceylon advocating for extreme measures like skinning Tamils to make shoes. Meanwhile, Tamil politicians\u2014though I had not heard their live speeches\u2014reportedly made similar statements about the Sinhalese.",
    "The torch of Sinhala nationalism, ignited by Mr. Bandaranaike and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), led to the enactment of the Sinhala Only Bill in 1956. Both the SLFP and the United National Party (UNP) supported this legislation, while the Lanka Sam Samaja Party (LSSP), the Communist Party of Ceylon (CPC, later the Communist Party of Sri Lanka), the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi, and the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress opposed it. The repercussions of this decision continue to shape Sri Lanka\u2019s political landscape even after 68 years.",
    "It is important to remember that a Sinhala Maha Vidyalaya operated in Jaffna during colonial times. Some Tamils learned Sinhala and respected Sinhalese traditions. However, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) disrupted this trend, preventing the school\u2019s operation after security forces set the Jaffna Public Library ablaze in May 1981. The subsequent anti-Tamil pogrom in July 1983, orchestrated by the UNP regime under President JR Jayewardene, exacerbated tensions.",
    "The 1978 Constitution reinforced the supremacist provisions of the 1972 constitution adopted during the Bandaranaike regime. The Sinhala Only policy, established by the Official Language Act (No. 33 of 1956), further divided our once-unified, pluralistic society. Each constitution deepened the alienation of non-majoritarian communities. This process began in 1948 when the DS Senanayake regime disenfranchised Malaiyaha workers and escalated with state violence against Tamil youth.",
    "Interestingly, students who attended colleges in Jaffna excelled in education without discrimination. For instance, Mr. KB Ratnayake, a Sinhala student at Hartley College, captained the cricket team and later became the Speaker of Parliament. Similarly, Mr. Maithripala Senanayake, who studied at St. John\u2019s College, Jaffna, held several cabinet portfolios and served as Acting Prime Minister.",
    "The Sinhala Only policy, implemented in 1956 by Mr. SWRD Bandaranaike, had significant consequences for public servants in Sri Lanka. In areas where Tamil-speaking populations were prevalent, Sinhala public servants were not required to learn Tamil. However, Tamil public servants\u2014even those working in Tamil-majority regions\u2014were compelled to learn Sinhala. As a result, the number of Tamil public servants in the state sector declined sharply.",
    "Statistics reveal the impact: In 1956, Tamils constituted 30% of the Civil Service, 50% of the clerical service, 60% of engineers and doctors, and 40% of the armed forces. By 1970, these numbers had plummeted to 5% of the Civil Service, 5% of the clerical service, 10% of engineers and doctors, and a mere 1% of the armed forces.",
    "In the 1960s, the government failed to provide documents or application forms in Tamil for the native Tamil-speaking population. Protests by Tamil communities eventually led to a slight relaxation of language policies. The Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987 recognized Tamil as an official language, while Sinhala remained the country\u2019s official language. Despite the 13th Amendment, which aimed to address these language disparities, full implementation remains elusive.",
    "Consider the challenges faced by Sinhala-speaking security forces personnel posted in Tamil-majority areas. Their lack of competent Tamil language skills hinders effective communication with both the government and the local population. I personally raised this issue with President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe during their tenures.",
    "Had the JVP Policy Declaration from 1972 been consistently followed, the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord might have recognized both Sinhala and Tamil as national languages. The JVP also advocated for English as a national language, although it ultimately it became the link language. Devolution of land, police, and financial powers to provinces remains a contentious issue, with the incomplete implementation of the 13th Amendment allowing external interventions, notably from India.",
    "Recognising the shortsightedness of past Sinhala nationalists is crucial. The Sinhala Only policy did not benefit Sinhalese, Tamils, or Muslims. Fortunately, recent shifts\u2014possibly influenced by multicultural exposure\u2014have eased some language restrictions.",
    "As a Sri Lankan Australian, I must briefly mention Australia\u2019s language policy. While lacking coherent principles initially, a National Policy on Languages emerged in 1987. It emphasized English proficiency for all, support for Indigenous languages (including bilingual education), and recognition of languages other than English.",
    "Australia\u2019s groundbreaking multilingual policy, endorsed by both sides of the political spectrum, aimed at cultural enrichment, social justice, vocational opportunities, and global trade promotion. As the world\u2019s first comprehensive multilingual policy, it has become an influential landmark internationally. Over time, Australia\u2019s increasing cultural diversity has made multilingualism an integral part of its social fabric, driven in part by economic imperatives to engage with Asia and diversify exports.",
    "Notably, this policy explicitly outlines values to guide language decisions\u2014a departure from the past. In Australia, English remains dominant, spoken by 72% of the population. Mandarin (3%), Arabic (about 1.5%), and Vietnamese (about 1.3%) reflect the country\u2019s multicultural tapestry. Importantly, an employee\u2019s pay cannot be influenced by their language or origin.",
    "Visitors to Australian cities encounter a vibrant linguistic landscape: English, Mandarin, Arabic, Cantonese, Hindi, Italian, Greek, and more. In Central Australia, Indigenous languages like Warlpiri, Arrernte, and Pitjantjatjara thrive.",
    "Contrastingly, in Sri Lanka\u2014except for Colombo\u2014the prevalence of Sinhala and Tamil speakers remains uncertain. Drawing lessons from Australia\u2019s inclusive language policy, Sri Lanka can foster peace, human rights, and social cohesion through equitable language education."
