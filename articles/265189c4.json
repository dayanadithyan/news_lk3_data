    "A volcano began erupting in southwestern Iceland early Thursday, sending lava jets as high as 80 meters, the country\u2019s weather office said.",
    "\u201cAt 5:30 this morning an intense seismic activity started north-east of Mt. S\u00fdlingarfell. Around 30 minutes later, a volcanic eruption started at the site,\u201d the Icelandic Met Office said.",
    "Images taken by an Icelandic Coast Guard surveillance flight appeared to show the eruption taking place at a location near the Dec. 18 eruption, official said.",
    "Another eruption nearby on Jan. 14 sent lava flowing into Grindavik, a small town that had been evacuated prior to the eruption.",
    "The latest eruption began at about 6 a.m. local time on Thursday, after a series of earthquakes rumbled the region for a half-hour, Met officials said.",
    "The fissure was about 3 km long, stretching from Mount Sundhn\u00fakur towards the eastern part of Mount St\u00f3ra-Sk\u00f3gfell, the office said.",
    "\u201cLava flows mostly towards west at the moment and the flow seems to be slightly less than at the start of the 18th of December eruption,\u201d the office said.",
    "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the town of Grindavik, where homes had been destroyed by the most recent eruption, was at risk from Tuesday\u2019s fissure. But it appeared it may be spared, a local politician said.",
    "\u201cThis time a bit further North than December eruption and further away from town of Grindavik,\u201d Gisli Olafsson, an MP, said on social media.",
    "The nearby geothermal spa Blue Lagoon had closed on Thursday, according to its website.",

    "He said flight to and from Iceland had not been affected by Thursday\u2019s eruption.",
    "\u201cAs before, our thoughts are with the people of Grindav\u00edk who cannot reside in their beautiful town,\u201d he said. \u201cThis too shall pass.\u201d"
