    "Two climate change activists hurled soup at the protective glass in front of the world-famous \u201cMona Lisa\u201d painting in Paris\u2019 Louvre museum on Sunday.",
    "Video footage showed two women flinging red soup at Leonard da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece, to gasps from onlookers.",
    "\u201cWhat is more important? Art or the right to have a healthy and sustainable food system?\u201d shouted the activists, speaking in French. They had ducked under a security barrier to get as close as they could to the painting and were led away by Louvre security guards.",
    "The activists represented the French organisation \u201cRiposte Alimentaire\u201d (Food Response), which issued a statement saying the protest sought to highlight the need to protect the environment and sources of food.",
    "In recent years, many activists have targeted art to raise awareness about climate change.",
    "The glass in front of the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d was smothered in cream in a protest in May 2022.",
    "Other attempts have included throwing soup at Vincent Van Gogh\u2018s \u201cSunflowers\u201d at London\u2019s National Gallery in October 2022, and in the following month campaigners glued themselves to Goya paintings in Madrid\u2019s Prado museum."
