    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has held a discussion with the founder of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa last night (21), where attention was drawn to the upcoming elections and the future political affairs.",
    "This meeting comes after President Wickremesinghe had informed the Cabinet of Ministers to make preparations for the presidential election first.",
    "Thus, Basil Rajapaksa has communicated to the President the SLPP\u2019s stance with respect to the upcoming elections, political sources said.",
    "Nevertheless, it has been decided to continue discussions regarding the matter further, since no final agreement was reached between the two parties at yesterday\u2019s meeting.",
    "It is also understood that a crisis situation has been emerged within the SLPP due to the two contradictory opinions held by the party members regarding the presidential election. A spokesperson of the SLPP, however, expressed hopes of unifying all party members under one opinion after holding extensive discussions with the President."
