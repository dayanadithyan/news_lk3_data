    "Iran\u2019s new president Masoud Pezeshkian was sworn in on Tuesday, after winning an election earlier this month by promising to improve ties with the world and ease restrictions on social freedoms at home.",
    "\u201cWe will pursue constructive and effective interaction with the world based on dignity, wisdom, and expediency,\u201d Pezeshkian, a relative moderate, told a parliament session attended by foreign dignitaries and broadcast live on state television.",
    "His victory has lifted hopes of a thaw in Iran\u2019s antagonistic relations with the West that might create openings for defusing its nuclear standoff with world powers.",
    "But Pezeshkian takes office at a time of escalating Middle East tensions over Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas in Gaza and cross-border fighting with Iran\u2019s ally Hezbollah in Lebanon.",
    "Iran, which backs the groups which describe themselves as the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d to Israel and U.S. influence in the Middle East, has accused the United States of supporting what it calls Israeli crimes in Gaza.",
    "\u201cThose who supply weapons that kill children cannot teach Muslims about humanity,\u201d Pezeshkian said to chants of \u201cDeath to America,\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d.",
    "Leaders of Iran\u2019s Palestinian allies Hamas and the Islamic Jihad as well as senior representatives of Yemen\u2019s Tehran-backed Houthi movement and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah attended the ceremony.",
    "Pezeshkian, who is expected to name his cabinet within two weeks, replaces hardline Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May.",
    "As the ultimate authority in Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has the final say in all state matters, including foreign and nuclear policy.",
    "He must also approve Pezeshkian\u2019s selections for key cabinet posts, such as the foreign, oil and intelligence ministers.",
    "As well as mounting pressure from the West over Tehran\u2019s fast-advancing nuclear programme, Pezeshkian faces the huge task of breaking Iran free of the crippling U.S. sanctions, reimposed after Washington ditched Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with major powers.",
    "Indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to salvage the nuclear accord with six major powers have stalled since 2022, with both sides accusing the other of unreasonable demands.",
    "\u201cMy government will never succumb to bullying and pressure ... Pressure and sanctions do not work ... and the Iranian people should be spoken to with respect,\u201d said Pezeshkian."
