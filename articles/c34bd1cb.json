    "Sony successfully concluded its first-ever Kando Trip Southeast Asia, a landmark event held from 14 to 16 August in the stunning backdrop of Bali, Indonesia. This invite-only event brought together over 130 creators from across nine countries, including seven outstanding Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) from Sri Lanka, supported by CameraLK, the country\u2019s leading camera retailer and Sony\u2019s authorised dealer in Sri Lanka and Maldives.",
    "Representing Sri Lanka at this prestigious event were Thilina Kaluthotage, Lakshitha Karunarathna, Priyantha Bandara, Arantha Sirimanne, Ravee Ranasinghe, and the popular internet personalities Janai Priyai. These talented creators had the unique opportunity to collaborate, learn, and push the boundaries of their creative visions using the latest Sony Alpha gear during the three-day immersive experience.",
    "Sony\u2019s Kando Trip, named after the Japanese word \u201cKando,\u201d which evokes a sense of awe and emotion when experiencing something beautiful and amazing for the first time, reflects the company\u2019s core philosophy of inspiring creativity and fostering community among creators. Originally launched in North America in 2017, the Kando Trip has quickly become one of the most anticipated events in the global creative community.",
    "The 2024 Kando Trip Southeast Asia featured an array of engaging photography and videography challenges, along with mentorship sessions from renowned Alpha creators. Participants were introduced to Sony\u2019s latest innovations, including the newly released ZV-E10 II and the professional Cinema Line cameras, which they tested at Experience Demo Zones led by acclaimed creators ZY Cheng and Bagoes Tresna Adji.",
    "Day two saw the creators\u2019 journey to Penglipuran Village, where they captured the vibrant cultural essence of Bali through their lenses. Sri Lankan KOLs, alongside their peers, engaged in activities like portrait photography of batik artists, dynamic gamelan performances, and traditional Balinese dances. The Video Creators, including Sri Lanka\u2019s representatives, explored the art of storytelling through motion, creating mini-documentaries that showcased the intricate process of batik-making and the picturesque beauty of Bali\u2019s village life. The event culminated at Kommune Beach Club, where creators were challenged to capture fast-action scenes, editorial fashion shoots, and cinematic beachside moments, pushing the limits of their creative and technical skills.",
