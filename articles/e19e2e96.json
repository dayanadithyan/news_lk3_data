    "The Gypsies is one band that has the ability, and the talent, to cater to the musical tastes of a wide and varied audience and they proved it in a mega way during their recent tour of Australia, taking in Perth, Sydney and Adelaide.",
    "Surprisingly, Melbourne wasn\u2019t included, and that\u2019s a happening place where Sri Lankans are concerned, but leader Piyal Perera has a valid explanation.",
    "\u201cWe didn\u2019t take in Melbourne because we were there in February, this year, and we generally like to keep a gap of about one year before we return.\u201d",
    "The concerts in Perth, Sydney and Adelaide were well patronised \u2013 in fact, it was \u2018sold out\u2019 at all three venues.",
    "On social media, this came up regarding the band\u2019s concert in Perth:",

    "And, it turned out to be a memorable happening for the Gypsies, and also for a former member of the band who now resides in Perth with his family \u2013 Arith Ratnawibhushana.",
    "Arith was associated with the Gypsies many years ago; he played keyboards for most of Piyal\u2019s original songs, initially, including the \u2018Ojaye\u2019 cassette.",
    "Says Arith: \u201cI was also involved in Piyal\u2019s first English original song \u2018Happy Birthday To You\u2019, and also \u2018You Are The Best.\u2019",
    "Arith was there for the Perth concert and was called on stage, by Piyal, for old times\u2019 sake.",
    "\u201cI did one song with the band. There was an amazing response for the Gypsies in Perth \u2013 a sell-out concert and dance \u2013 and it certainly brought back nostalgic memories to me.\u201d",
    "Arith went on to say that the Perth concert was organised by Rostrata Events and that they did a fantastic job as the event was sold out one month in advance.",
    "The feedback, regarding the concert, was stupendous, with one group of fans saying they enjoyed the Gypsies show more than the Coldplay concert!",
    "The Sydney show, too, was a huge success and this was one of the comments that showed up on social media:",
    "\u201cGYPSIES \u2013 Thank you for the music. The legendary band from Sri Lanka, with a history of half a century, proved to SYDNEY fans again, you\u2019re still number one and going strong as ever\u203c",
