    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) yesterday demanded President Ranil Wickremesinghe to hand over the UNP headquarters Sirikotha to the SJB.",
    "Addressing the media, the party\u2019s election manager Sujeewa Senasinghe said that SJB has a right to claim Sirikotha.",
    "\u201cWe have a right to claim Sirikotha as we are former UNPers,\u201d he said.",
    "Expressing concerns about UNP\u2019s current plight, Senasinghe also said \u201cWe hope that UNP leader will work according to his conscience and handover the Sirikotha to us. He should do so, for the sake of the remaining UNPers. Some of his sins would be forgiven if he hands over Sirikotha to us,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe were compelled to form SJB as we were not able to remove Wickremesinghe from the UNP leadership,\u201d he added.",
    "In the meantime, Senasinghe referred to the remark made by UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara who called for a referendum to extend the terms of the President and Parliament where he said it is unbelievable as to how he could had become pro-Wickremesinghe. \u201cRange Bandara was one of the staunch anti-Wickremesinghe figure in the UNP those days.",
    "He was at the forefront with us to change the UNP leadership during that time. I am the one who stopped him from crossing over to the 52-day government formed in 2018. He was offered a ministerial portfolio by SLPP during that time,\u201d Senasinghe said."
