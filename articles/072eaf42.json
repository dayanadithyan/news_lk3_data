  "original_body_lines": [
    "Generally, the growth of a country\u00a0is intricately linked\u00a0to the standard of education it provides to its citizens. Education indeed imparts knowledge, critical thinking, and moral values\u00a0whereas\u00a0it inculcates potential skills and aptitude\u00a0empowering\u00a0them to navigate challenging circumstances with confidence, resilience, and courage.\u00a0Besides, it shapes a\u00a0person\u2019s\u00a0attitude, perception, and\u00a0behaviour\u00a0which\u00a0ensures\u00a0the creation of a disciplined society equipped with commendable values, a broader idea of citizenship, patriotism, social cohesion, a pluralistic mind, social harmony, and a sense of social responsibility and accountability.\u00a0It is no wonder that a well-educated and disciplined populace contributes to innovation, productivity, peace, stability, and overall societal progress. As such, proper education serves as a catalytic force driving the growth of a country and fostering human capital development. Therefore, education is\u00a0a\u00a0strategic necessity for the sustainable development of a country. \u00a0But, it is still obscure how far these objectives have been met through the present education system in our country. We are well aware that in the wake of Covid \u2013 19 pandemic, the\u00a0country\u00a0gradually plunged into a severe economic crisis and struggled to survive. This crisis taught us to distinguish between needs and wants or what is essential and\u00a0what is\u00a0lavish.",
    "Nowadays, experts and educationists demand comprehensive systemic reforms in education reviving our energies to march forward to sustainable growth. Here, I deem it appropriate to share the research findings of the Gurian Institute of USA in anticipation of adding weight to this demand. Of course, it is the third root cause related to the crisis in\u00a0boys\u2019\u00a0education following the crises in understanding the\u00a0boys\u2019\u00a0energy and then nurturing them in line with their natural tendencies. Those researches\u00a0simply\u00a0indicate that the contemporary\u00a0system of education\u00a0entirely\u00a0favours\u00a0girls and helps to bring out their potential alone by the time it fails to recognize\u00a0boys\u2019\u00a0energy and their wonderful world\u00a0enabling\u00a0them to be sparkling stars in schools and subsequently in their lives. In this system, many boys feel that they are isolated or they have been\u00a0labeled\u00a0as failures due to developmental delay, learning difficulties, many processing issues, low academic performance, disparities, and lack of motivation, etc.",
    "Many statistics at the national level have witnessed the\u00a0stipe\u00a0decline in\u00a0boys\u2019\u00a0education by the time girls have outperformed in their exams. Most of the\u00a0students,\u00a0who are not succeeding in their\u00a0exams,\u00a0are boys.\u00a0 Similarly, most students who require extra academic help are boys. Compared to girls, boys are more likely to go through disciplinary issues not only in the school but also in the society. It has\u00a0been proven\u00a0that due to mismatch, boys turn off their minds at school\u00a0seeing\u00a0nothing of interest in school. Of course, it causes developmental disadvantages in early schooling. In the end, they are\u00a0labeled\u00a0or diagnosed with learning disabilities or troublemakers. This perception compels them to drop their education or fall behind. We cannot blame any individual for this plight.\u00a0It is because of the\u00a0failure of the system\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a0completely peculiar to\u00a0boys\u2019\u00a0nature.\u00a0 Therefore, the crisis will prevail unattended. The aim of this article is not to degrade the dignity of one gender and glorify another but to create awareness of the challenges boys encounter in their education and avoid blatant mismatches. Based on research, we can identify the major pitfalls of this system.",
    "When it comes to\u00a0the upbringing of a boy, the ancestral system of education, which\u00a0was passed down\u00a0through generations, is considered of paramount significance.\u00a0As articulated,\u00a0this bio-anthropological system was built\u00a0up\u00a0on family cohesion, bonding with authorities, and subsequent adaptation of male-friendly approaches in nurturing their boys. These authorities are none other than the\u00a0boy\u2019s\u00a0grandparents,\u00a0neighbours, tribes, and natural environment, and extended family members such as uncles, aunties, cousins.",
    "This ancestral system was unlike regular practice in the modern system of education\u00a0but\u00a0it\u00a0had a unique way of teaching and empowerment mechanism, which were\u00a0completely\u00a0different from that of modern industrialized and\u00a0regimented\u00a0systems. It is a drive beyond just teaching. It had never depended on a unilateral structure applicable for boys and girls evenly.\u00a0 Instead, it was a heritage-guided way of upbringing that was meticulously crafted by our forefathers based on their respective environment, culture, nature, and\u00a0child\u2019s\u00a0individual aptitude, skills, and natural tendencies. Moreover, it deeply cared about gender differences\u00a0as well as\u00a0individual disparities\u00a0even\u00a0among boys.",
    "The core aspects of this system were primarily creating a bond between a child and his authorities or mentors\u00a0paving\u00a0the way for more attachment, intimacy, and perfect understanding of a particular child and his natural tendencies\u00a0then\u00a0paying individual attention to empower him in his desired field. As said, those lovable mentors had realized that creating a bond between a boy and his authorities was inevitable for nurturing their boys. Therefore, they harnessed all mechanisms and opportunities to sow the seeds of bond and attachment. As such, they would persistently observe the gradual development of a particular boy, his natural tendencies, and his temperament from his early childhood period, and then identify the exact methodology and\u00a0ways,\u00a0that would perfectly fit him.\u00a0Hence, the skills and potentials of each son\u00a0were identified\u00a0by their respective authorities and nurtured carefully and systematically.",
    "Here,\u00a0what\u00a0we can initially realize in this ancestral system\u00a0is\u00a0that their\u00a0sons\u2019\u00a0primary teachers\u00a0hadn\u2019t\u00a0been unknown individuals standing in the classroom but\u00a0always\u00a0their most lovable mentors who truly and deeply loved their children.\u00a0It is no wonder then that those mentors would discover the full potential of the particular\u00a0boy;\u00a0pay utmost attention to\u00a0him;\u00a0motivate him\u00a0highly\u00a0to trigger his\u00a0good\u00a0stress, and foster his hidden energy with meticulous care. Retrospectively, we can observe another significant fact that in this system, boys were never reluctant or scared to learn and\u00a0as\u00a0such\u00a0never encountered confusion and demon of self-doubt or any form of\u00a0bad\u00a0stress,\u00a0rather, they would feel secure and more comfortable with the way they had\u00a0been taught. Through this system, boys learned what they needed to know\u00a0for their lives.\u00a0Those sons acquired\u00a0not only knowledge but also\u00a0learned discipline, traditions, and culture of their respective civilizations.\u00a0They were never blindly instructed to adopt any strange tradition and peculiar culture or even ideologies unless it was beneficial to their core lives or modified according to their lifestyle. They learned everything for their lives through\u00a0\u2018doing\u2019\u00a0not\u00a0\u2018memorizing\u2019\u00a0given notes. Then, the\u00a0boys enjoyed their respective mentorship since this bio-anthropological system had always been innovative and adventurous and fulfilled their learning aspirations in many ways.",
    "Besides, they had indeed encountered boyish issues while raising their sons, however, they sorted out everything in an appropriate manner. Hence, there was neither educational rollercoaster ride of parenthood nor sedentary time. Back then, the learning place was unlike current crammed classrooms with unknown individuals but\u00a0mostly\u00a0open space or under the breeze with their lovable mentors. They\u00a0were trained\u00a0physically and empirically. So, the knowledge was imparted to their children using experiential learning, constant observation, reasoning, and stimulating their inquisitive minds rather than convoluted theories. History has witnessed remarkable successes of this system.\u00a0For instance, the ancient Egyptians developed their\u00a0knowledge of mathematics\u00a0which\u00a0enabled\u00a0them to construct impressive pyramids.\u00a0As such, Mayans\u00a0were able to\u00a0construct\u00a0amazing\u00a0stone buildings and pyramids and create sophisticated calendars and astronomical systems with accurate arithmetic and excelled in architecture, mathematics, astronomy, etc.\u00a0using\u00a0empirical knowledge but not structured classroom teachings with prescribed curriculum. Similarly, our forefathers built sophisticated irrigation systems before the advent of colonial powers. It positioned us as a pioneer in agriculture that ensured food security and self-sufficiency.",
    "This bio-anthropological system never taught agriculture to their sons by dictating notes\u00a0instead\u00a0they were sent to paddy fields to learn about cultivation\u00a0and\u00a0they sensed varieties of crops by touching them. They learned zoology while hunting and engaging in animal husbandry and\u00a0also learned\u00a0oceanology while embarking on voyages.\u00a0Similarly,\u00a0knowledge of architecture and indigenous medicine,\u00a0etc.\u00a0was imparted\u00a0through direct experience, experimentation, and legacy of\u00a0inquisitive\u00a0mind and\u00a0also by\u00a0fostering\u00a0deeper\u00a0understanding and retention of knowledge.\u00a0This experiential learning approach instilled struggle, careful observation, problem-solving, outstanding aptitude, and perfect analysis skills in them. For the noble cause, they highly regarded the role of those authorities that\u00a0had been carefully preserved\u00a0for centuries.\u00a0Unfortunately, we\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0give prominence to this bio \u2013bio-anthropological system and therefore failed to\u00a0preserve\u00a0its legacy\u00a0which\u00a0was then able to establish civilizations. Nowadays, kids are to live by the bell inside packed rooms and learn to follow instructions as in the factories. Boys are nowadays at risk of industrialized systems of education. In this greedy system, the role of those authorities\u00a0particularly\u00a0the role of grandparents, extended family members, tribal apprenticeship, and love of\u00a0nature\u00a0are obsolete.",
    "Another significant pitfall of the modern education system\u00a0as\u00a0delineated in research is gender plasticity. It means melting\u00a0boys\u2019\u00a0energy to fit them into a system that is inimical to their nature and aspirations from all aspects. Generally, any\u00a0system of education\u00a0should always care about the learning style of any brain and its potential energy and engage accordingly in enhancing its potential aptitude.\u00a0But,\u00a0unfortunately, these objectives are not met at all within the present\u00a0system of education\u00a0when it comes to\u00a0boys\u2019\u00a0education. Today, boys are educated and nurtured through an industrialized system, which undermines the male learning style and\u00a0in\u00a0turn\u00a0creates potential mismatches and disparities.\u00a0Certainly, this system\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0fit them\u00a0anyway,\u00a0because it does not care much about how boys naturally learn,\u00a0what their inbuilt skills are, what their intuitions are, and what their learning aspirations are.",
    "Generally, boys learn through their potential learning energies.\u00a0As we discussed in the previous article,\u00a0boys\u2019\u00a0energy predominantly depends on more experiential,\u00a0more spatial, and more physical activities than more\u00a0verbal practices.\u00a0To put it into perspective, male brains always prefer\u00a0\u2018fewer talks and more doings\u2019\u00a0and anticipate learning to be adventurous, innovative, and dynamic. Therefore, they generally use their gross motor skills during their learning process.\u00a0 Brain science reveals that the female brain shows greater involvement in the fine motor\u00a0centre\u00a0whereas the male brain emphasizes greater reliance on the gross motor\u00a0centre\u00a0such\u00a0as running, jumping, swimming, climbing, kicking a ball, riding a tricycle, etc.\u00a0Meantime, some boys can develop fine motor skills without much encouragement\u00a0but\u00a0most need extra help to develop\u00a0their fine motor skills.\u00a0The female brains tend to link with fine motor activities\u00a0predominantly\u00a0verbal activities\u00a0better\u00a0than the male brains do.",
    "The contemporary system\u00a0has a greater emphasis on\u00a0verbal illustration or fine motor skills for imparting knowledge and skills instead of experimental and doable methods which stimulate gross motor skills.\u00a0In this system, boys are compelled to memorize the textbooks within a limited time and\u00a0are not allowed to\u00a0think beyond the box. Above all, it promotes a\u00a0\u2018sit and learn\u2019\u00a0culture instead of involving physical and experimental activities.\u00a0Here,\u00a0boys\u2019\u00a0dynamism\u00a0is perceived\u00a0as a barrier or troublemaking that disturbs classroom teaching and\u00a0therefore\u00a0requires\u00a0disciplinary actions.",
    "The worst part of this system is that it tries to fix or convince the minds of boys and girls against their natural tendencies where boys, whose brains work one way, are told they are not\u00a0okay\u00a0whereas girls whose brains work another way are also sometimes\u00a0told\u00a0that they are not\u00a0okay. It is all because of the absence of tailoring boys and girls by their nature. The brevity is that we neglected the biological factors of boys\u00a0and\u00a0above\u00a0all\u00a0we have been\u00a0blindly\u00a0engaging in gender plasticity\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a0completely\u00a0a catastrophe. Of course, this system perfectly matches\u00a0with\u00a0the female brain since it has a\u00a0larger\u00a0inclination to fine motor skills.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0why girls outperform better in their studies than boys since this system\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0foster\u00a0boys\u2019\u00a0potential learning skills\u00a0rather\u00a0it overlooks them and engages in melting their energies to fit into the predefined system\u00a0which\u00a0promotes more reading and writing in which girls are good.\u00a0It\u00a0is said\u00a0that practical\u00a0people look for practical ways to spin their webs or stretch their limbs and fly.\u00a0There is no doubt that many of our sons can\u00a0indeed\u00a0learn in nearly any environment if their education is well cared for in the way it should be.",
    "We are at a crucial juncture\u00a0when it comes to\u00a0the economic recovery process.\u00a0Nowadays, experts and educationists are seriously\u00a0thinking of\u00a0reforming the education system\u00a0aiming\u00a0to attain sustainable development.\u00a0Experts suggest that reforming the education system is far more significant than economic and political reforms since education is the foundation for all. Experts suggest that the country is deliberately in need of a comprehensive educational philosophy matching both genders respectively as well as drastic change in the education system instead of shallow reforms addressing surface-level issues.",
    "Initially, educational goals should be altered and designed much broader than just getting employment. We perceive education as a comprehensive process of nurturing, which goes beyond classroom teaching and training.\u00a0Meantime, we believe that we cannot generalize a system of education to both genders as opposed to the universal truth that boys and girls are not equal biologically and\u00a0therefore\u00a0they learn differently. One system for two differently learning brains is unfair and unscientific\u00a0too\u00a0in\u00a0the age of science and technology.\u00a0Therefore, a unique system of education for boys to flourish their energy and potentialities should\u00a0be designed\u00a0while retaining the present system for girls since the contemporary system of education is\u00a0largely\u00a0favourable\u00a0to girls.",
    "Against this backdrop, two significant perspectives are considered\u00a0when\u00a0it comes to\u00a0reforming the education system.\u00a0One is a boyish system and the second is\u00a0the way we are nurturing\u00a0our boys.\u00a0The system\u00a0should be reformed\u00a0in line with biological factors and gender differences amalgamating both skills namely gross motor skill and fine motor skills with due proportionate.\u00a0 I would say, it is high time to return to a\u00a0\u2018moderated ancestral system of education without engaging in gender plasticity. Then, we should also think of mechanisms beyond institutional education for nurturing our boys. It is just like a process beginning at home and perhaps ending at universities so that we can protect our sons from falling behind in their lives.",
    "Essentially, we must plan how we should alter our home, pre-schools, school, and classroom environments for those boys to create a comfortable, conducive, and boy-friendly atmosphere and fulfill their educational aspirations.\u00a0By this\u00a0time, we should be aware\u00a0of the fact\u00a0that boys aspire\u00a0more\u00a0emotionally connected way of teaching built upon family cohesion and family apprenticeship which cherish individual attention and creating a bond similar to\u00a0that of\u00a0bonds in the ancestral system.\u00a0It is a bitter truth that current educational culture gets rid of individual bonds due to the industrialized way of education, demonic interest and existence of unscrupulous elements.\u00a0Additionally, in the present context, the concepts of\u00a0\u2018finding a home in the school\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018home-schooling\u2019\u00a0would be ideal and should be developed in the view of scientific factors and viable practices to add weight to the education system."
