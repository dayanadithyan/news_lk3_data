    "Colombo, May 1 (Daily Mirror) - Apart from organizing a debate between Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and NPP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, let us publicly reassure the Sinhalese people, perhaps in a solemn ceremony, that they will not allow the Northern and Eastern regions to gain the right to self-determination, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijerathne urged today.",
    "Addressing the media, he said certain political parties attempting to violate the sovereignty of the country, but that the association has an issue with the President for not revealing this to the country.",
    "\"The way the government and the Ministers are heading to is not correct. No decision was taken during the past one-and-a-half years by the subject Minister for the development of the public transport sector of the country. The President too does not interfere with the development of the transport sector.",
    "\"We know that the President is not working in violation of the sovereignty of the country. But we have a serious problem with some political party leaders. We love our country,\" Wijerathne said."
