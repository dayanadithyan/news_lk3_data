    "Sri Lanka with a rich biodiversity, is home to over 248 species of exotic butterflies, with over 76 facing extinction.",
    "Recognizing the urgency of conservation, Spa Ceylon took action from as early as 2017 partnering up with the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Society. Over the years they created a Butterfly reserve in Wasgamuwa, which managed to naturally invite over 52 species, including 8 endemic butterflies to make their settlements around the reserves. This initiative was a continuation of that effort, and they are currently working together to build butterfly gardens in Weheragala forest reserves through habitat enrichment and restoration. They aim to build advocacy on increasing local knowledge of butterflies and the important ecological role of butterflies especially as pollinators that benefit farming communities.",
