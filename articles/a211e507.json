    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam yesterday disclosed that party members have been directed by party leader Mahinda Rajapaksa to abstain from expressing their personal opinions regarding the party\u2019s presidential candidacy and potential candidates.",
    "\u201cHe explicitly requested that party members refrain from publicly expressing their personal opinions on the Presidential candidacy until the party\u2019s\u00a0 executive council and politburo convene and reach a formal decision,\u201d he said.",

    "Meanwhile at the meeting, led by party leader Mahinda Rajapaksa and founder Basil Rajapaksa, SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa was appointed as the party\u2019s National Organiser.",
    "Rajapaksa, addressing the media subsequent to his appointment, clarified the party\u2019s stance on prioritising Parliamentary elections before a Presidential poll.",
    "\u201cConstitutionally, a Presidential election must precede. However, we believe that to ensure political stability in the country, it requires a President with a clear mandate,\u201d he articulated.",
    "Citing opposition to privatisations and supported by the argument that the current President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, lacks a mandate to carry out such actions, Rajapaksa emphasised the importance of obtaining the necessary mandate first."
