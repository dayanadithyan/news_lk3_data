    "The UN\u2019s food agency on Tuesday said that its aid convoy had been turned away by Israeli forces at a checkpoint to northern Gaza, after which it was looted by \u201cdesperate people\u201d.",
    "The World Food Programme said the 14-truck food convoy waited at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint, inside southeast Gaza, for three hours before being turned away by the Israeli army.",
    "It was the first convoy attempted since the agency halted deliveries to the north of Gaza on February 20, after its convoy of trucks faced gunfire and looting.",
    "At the time, the agency described the situation in northern Gaza as \u201ccomplete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order\u201d.",
    "In Tuesday\u2019s incident, after the trucks were rerouted they were stopped by \u201ca large crowd of desperate people who looted the food\u201d, taking about 200 tons, the WFP said in a statement.",
    "The agency said that it was exploring all ways to bring food to northern Gaza, but that roads were the only way to transport large quantities of food needed to avert famine.",
    "An airdrop earlier on Tuesday, in conjunction with Jordan\u2019s air force, dropped six tons of food, enough for 20,000 people, it said.",
    "\u201cAirdrops are a last resort and will not avert famine. We need entry points to northern Gaza that will allow us to deliver enough food for half a million people in desperate need,\u201d the agency\u2019s deputy executive director Carl Skau said.",
    "Skau told the UN Security Council last week that a famine was imminent in northern Gaza if conditions remain unchanged.",
    "The UN estimates that 2.2 million people -- most of Gaza\u2019s population -- are on the brink of famine, particularly in the north where Israeli forces block aid from entering.",
    "On Tuesday, the WFP said hunger had reached \u201ccatastrophic levels\u201d in the north.",
    "\u201cChildren are dying of hunger-related diseases and suffering severe levels of malnutrition,\u201d it said, calling for more entry points into Gaza, including the north.",
    "Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, Gaza has been plunged into a food crisis, with outside aid severely restricted."
