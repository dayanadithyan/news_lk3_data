    "\u201cWe will focus on deep-sea diving in Arugam Bay and Trincomalee as a form of bringing Marine Tourism in the country.\u201d",
    "Trincomalee and Arugam Bay in the island\u2019s Eastern Coast has sunny weather around August, as the beach tourism hotspots in the South and Western coasts are struck by Moonsoon rain.",
    "Sri Lanka expects 2.3 million tourists for the year 2024 while striving to attract high-end tourists.",
    "\u201cCurrently our average spender is 180 dollars but we are looking to attracting 30 percent or 20 percent of our arrivals to spend up to 300 to 400 dollars next year,\u201d Fernando said.",
