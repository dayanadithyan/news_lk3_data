    "Loneliness has been declared a public health emergency in a Californian county that includes part of Silicon Valley.",
    "San Mateo County is the first in the US to make such a declaration.",
    "About 17% of US adults questioned by Gallup in February last year said they had experienced loneliness the day before.",
    "In San Mateo, however, about 45% of residents are struggling with isolation, according to David Canepa from the county\u2019s board of supervisors.",
    "Across the US there is an \u201cepidemic of loneliness and isolation\u201d, US Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy has said.",
    "It is an \u201cunderappreciated public health crisis\u201d which has \u201charmed individual and societal health\u201d, he added.",
    "Concerns in San Mateo are not confined to one demographic, Mr Canepa said.",
    "Teenagers and young adults spend a long time on social media, he pointed out, while Silicon Valley\u2019s high-achieving atmosphere may put stress on those still in education.",
    "Many older residents became especially isolated during the pandemic, he added.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a perfect storm for older adults right now,\u201d said Jennifer Steele, CEO of Meals on Wheels San Francisco.",
    "\u201cPeople don\u2019t live close to their loved ones anymore. Sometimes people have outlived their loved ones.",
    "\u201cYour social circle shrinks after retirement,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s harder for people to make friends. We\u2019re often the only people they may see in a week.\u201d",
    "Mr Canepa said the decision to declare a crisis was influenced by the UK and Japan, where ministers for loneliness, a condition that has been linked to heart disease, strokes and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, have been introduced.",
    "In 2016 the then prime minister, Theresa May, introduced the first cross-government strategy to tackle loneliness.",
    "At the time, three-quarters of GPs said in a survey they were seeing between one and five people a day who were feeling isolated.",
    "Mr Canepa has written to Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, calling for a state-wide minister for loneliness.",
    "There are several ideas to improve social connections in San Mateo, including changes to infrastructure to make it easier to walk around neighbourhoods, and partnering with social media platforms based in the state to encourage residents to join community groups."
