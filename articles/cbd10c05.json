    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Alliance of Health Trade Unions has issued a stark ultimatum to the Sri Lankan health authorities, warning of a nationwide strike set to begin tomorrow morning unless their demands are addressed.",
    "The strike, involving members of 72 healthcare professions, is a culmination of months of frustration over unresolved issues, including the controversial allowance disparity between doctors and other healthcare workers.",
    "Speaking on behalf of the AHTU, its joint-convener Ravi Kumudesh stressed the urgency of the situation.",
    "\"The health authorities still have a chance to find solutions to the professional problems we face, particularly the allowance issue,\" he said. \"But if proper intervention is not taken today, our members will be forced to walk out at 6.30 am tomorrow.\"",
    "The strike stems from a long-standing grievance regarding a recent policy granting a 35,000 rupee stipend to doctors.",
    "While acknowledging the additional burdens faced by doctors, other healthcare professionals argue that they too deserve similar recognition and financial support.",
