  "original_body_lines": [
    "They say birds of a feather! This is how the nation felt when President Ranil Wickremesinghe was speaking in the Parliament recently issuing an apology for the then Gota\u2019s decision to enforce forced cremation during the COVID-19 pandemic, while also subtly (and shamefully) justifying that policy on palpably inaccurate contention, ignoring the context, stating \u2018a committee appointed to look into the matter at the time recommended cremation, a decision which was upheld by the supreme court. So the government had to follow that. There was no choice at that stage\u2019. Gota in his recent book titled \u201cThe conspiracy to oust me from the Presidency\u201d passed on the blame to members of the expert committee, in particular one member, for insisting on cremation only for COVID victims. He however did not issue an apology or express any remorse for this massive blunder which earned him the ire of the entire nation. It thus appeared that Ranil was trying to bring closure to those affected by this controversial decision of Gota\u2019s regime, but his apology seems more like an attempt to whitewash the sins of the Gota\u2019s regime\u00a0 instead of a genuine statement of apology.",
    "Gota regime\u2019s dismal failed attempt to stage a tragicomedy by imposing an unwanted burial ban was\u00a0 thankfully later openly exposed as a racist diversion tactic, with no basis in science. The burial issue grew beyond Muslim circles and there was more solidarity and consciousness, and this discontent added to the public activism gaining momentum, to hold the government to account for many other crises befitting Sri Lanka \u2013 rule of law and impunity, economic mismanagement, and chronic corruption.",
    "This contentious stoke of policy was widely considered as arbitrary, racist and Islamophobic, disregarding\u00a0 the religious beliefs particularly of the Muslim community, sans any scientific or medical evidence and contrary to the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the disposal of bodies of those who fell victim to the coronavirus. Early this year, Minister Jeevan Thondaman extended an apology to the Muslim community for the pain inflicted on many families by the enforced cremation policy. He alongside Minister Ali Sabry announced plans to submit a Cabinet paper seeking a formal government apology for the harm caused. \u00a0He explained that since assuming office as the subject Minister he had requested officials to conduct an independent study to determine the truth about allegations of groundwater contamination through COVID burials. \u201cThe findings of this study have now proven to us that the concerns regarding water contamination were misguided and the decision to forcefully cremate those who succumbed to COVID-19 was not based on any science.\u201d",
    "Actually, the real apology should come from those who were behind it, and this includes the members of the so-called \u201cexperts committee\u201d who brought shame on the entire country. It was interesting to hear Prof Jayasumana, an Islamophobic who went at lengths to implicate Dr Shafi in a case of forced sterilization of Sinhala women ( which was later proven to be false), on this issue . In an interview with Daily Mirror in April 2024, on this issue, he stated \u201cFrom the beginning, I was of the opinion that cremation, disregarding religious beliefs, was not appropriate or acceptable. At the same time, there was no scientific evidence to support the claim that the virus could spread through COVID-infected burials and contaminate groundwater. It\u2019s impossible, and is basic biological knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0a senior official responsible for intelligence services made a statement asserting that the burial of Muslim bodies could cause tensions between ethnic groups. \u201cThe particular official said that if Muslims were allowed burials, extremist groups may exhume the bodies and cremate them. But it was obvious that during a pandemic, nobody would take the risk of exhuming bodies.\u201d The Task Force was never empowered to take a decision on the burial issue. Prof. Jayasumana added that if anyone should apologise, it should be the expert committee that recommended the cremation of bodies and not the subject Minister of Water Supply. \u201cThe government has some responsibility, but the ones who took this decision should be the ones who must apologise.\u201d",
    "Prof. Deepika Udagama, who served as the Chairperson of HRCSL during this period, too stated if the Government had provided internationally accepted credible evidence of groundwater contamination through COVID-infected burials, the Commission would have accepted the decision.\u00a0\u201cHowever, in the absence of such evidence, we wanted to understand the rationale behind the authorities\u2019 refusal to permit burials. We were unaware of who the scientific authorities that the government relied on. There was some indication that it was the University of Sri Jayewardenepura that commissioned a report. I cannot recall what the outcome was. If the government had scientific evidence, they should have presented it to the public categorically. My recollection is there was no such evidence.\u201d",
    "She correctly summed up the feelings and stance of the Muslim community on this issue thus, \u201cIf the apology is sincere and is issued officially by the government, then it is a step in the right direction for a country that is not used to apology or accountability. Of course, the community affected has to decide on whether an apology is sufficient, because it was an extremely painful ordeal. From these painful episodes of our history, we have to learn lessons for our future.\u201d However, the apology which President Ranil made in the parliament, lacked sincerity and instead tried to whitewash Rajapaksa sins as he is popularly known to be famous for\u00a0 since he took office thanks to Rajapaksa\u2019s ruling party support.",
    "MP Mujibur Rahman OF SJB\u00a0 too criticised\u00a0President Ranil for allegedly attempting to justify the forced cremations of bodies.He explained that there were two committees during that period: a technical committee made up of certain political appointees and an expert committee which was appointed following the request made by the Muslim community.\u00a0 \u201cThe technical committee, comprised of political appointees appointed by the former President, insisted that bodies must be cremated. However, the expert committee, headed by the Dean of the University of Colombo\u2019s Medical Faculty, Prof. Jennifer Perera, recommended against cremation, aligning with the findings of the World Health Organisation (WHO). The Government led by Rajapaksa ignored the expert committee\u2019s recommendations and continued with forced cremations based on the technical committee\u2019s advice. So, this cannot be justified. The entire Cabinet of Ministers must be held responsible,\u201d he added. Even the SLMC dismissed Thondaman\u2019s apology and said \u201cThe apology must come from the Cabinet of Ministers in place at the time under the leadership of [former President] Gotabaya Rajapaksa. It looks like a gimmick to get votes.\u201d",
    "The grieved families of the 300+ Covid-19 Muslim deaths in Sri Lanka, forcibly reduced to ashes against their religious dictates, with no funeral rights or family nearby, only to later discover later that it was all a racist hoax played upon them for petty political gains, need some plausible answers. Who will take responsibility for this tragic and wilful negligence? Who can transform their ashes to flesh and bones, so that that bitter past can be rewound and their remains be buried whole in dignity, and not in urns? The fact of the matter and the reality was that there were no feasible medical reasons for the Covid burial ban then and obviously none now. Both the medical fraternity and the scientific community, local and global were pointing this out in plain and simple language, which unfortunately did not strike a chord with the racist agenda of the Gotabaya government. If this was not State sanctioned racist discrimination and raw racism, then what was? Thankfully, the successful resistance to the policy of enforced cremation saw it reversed in early 2022, which was the product of an unusual and inspiring coalition of activists, religious institutions and citizens from all of Sri Lanka\u2019s communities, working in tandem with international bodies and Sri Lankan diaspora groups. My book on \u2018Dying While Muslim in Masked Sri Lanka\u2019 outlined the whole failed episode of Gota\u2019s government\u2019s forced cremation policy.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s COVID response was proof that demonization of particularly the Muslims was normalised. In an article in Human Rights Pulse, titled \u2018Discrimination against Sri Lanka\u2019s Muslim community during the pandemic: a chilling foreshadow\u2019 (21/12/20), Esther Hoole says, \u2018The government\u2019s stance is, at best, careless of the rights and requests of the Muslim community. At worst, it is deliberately discriminatory and cruel. Neither of these attitudes is a new phenomenon. From the outset of the current government\u2019s entry into power in a landslide vote by the Sinhalese majority, the Sri Lankan government has\u2014both subtly and overtly\u2014highlighted its disregard for minority communities, of which the Muslim community is one. Within this majoritarian structure, there has also been growing hatred particularly against the Muslim community, continuing the trajectory of the past few years\u2019.",
    "In February 2021, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) tweeted, \u201cNo physician is racist, so how can there be structural racism in health care?\u201d\u00a0 Hitler\u2019s words and legacy remind us of the massive historical and contemporary importance of racism to public health and medical care. Thus, as we engage in the continuous project of identifying and responding to the ways racism impacts health and health care, we must also hold our institutions, our political leaders, and ourselves to account for the harms of interpersonal and structural racism. So \u00a0there is an imperative need to hold accountable the top rungs in Gota\u2019s government and its public health official stooges including the so-called technical committee led by the likes of Dr Channa Perera and Prof Methikaa Vithanage, who brazenly advocated and implemented the racist, discriminatory forced cremation policy, which wreaked havoc on the social fabric, and harmony of this nation. Dr Channa Perera, Consultant Forensic Pathologist \u201cattached to Sri Lanka\u2019s Ministry of Health\u201d told the BBC World Service: \u201cthe government has nothing against Muslims but they have a small fear about whether the virus can be used for unauthorised activities. Maybe an unwanted person could get access to a body and it could be used a biological weapon.\u201d This was an unnecessarily anti-Muslim statement that created unwarranted divisiveness when the need to fight this pandemic together was then felt more urgent than ever.",
    "President Ranil if he is sincere enough, should realise that repercussions of Gota\u2019s\u00a0 decision on mandatory cremation which defeated the \u2018purpose\u2019 and unleashed a fresh wave of Islamophobia within the majority community, upon the heels of an earlier wave of Islamophobia in the wake of the Easter Sunday attacks. The government\u2019s discriminatory approach was also aided by the dog-whistling television coverage, and the social media chatter too. The mandatory cremation of Muslim COVID-19 victims sadly polarized the country at a time it should be unified against the invisible enemy. Hopefully sanity prevailed thanks to the strong local public activism and international outrage and the government was forced to review its clearly discriminatory \u2018Emperor\u2019s clothes like\u2019 position on the mandatory cremation policy. Those who made these decisions at the highest levels, did not assess the wider social consequences, leading those mistakes making Sri Lankans to regret in the years to come.",
    "Thus, the real culprits\u00a0 should be held to account, in addition to an unconditional apology which should come from those who were behind it including Gota, and this includes the members of the so-called \u201cexperts committee\u201d who brought shame on the entire country. Just mouthing an apology and whitewashing the culprits is not justice to the victims but an insult. In a way, this is how the cookies crumble in impunity crisis laden Sri Lanka."
