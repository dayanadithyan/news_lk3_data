    "Invites MPs\u00a0 Harsha de Silva, Thalatha Atukorale, Eran Wickramaratne and Kabir Hashim to strengthen President\u2019s efforts in rebuilding SL",
    "Claims SJB leadership is marginalising these MPs after control has shifted to SLPP aligned group",
    "United National Party (UNP) General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara issued an open invitation to several prominent Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MPs yesterday to rejoin the UNP ahead of the upcoming polls.",
    "Addressing a press conference, Range Bandara accordingly invited SJB MPs Harsha de Silva, Thalatha Atukorale, Eran Wickramaratne and Kabir Hashim to rejoin the age-old party.",
    "\u201cWe are aware of the way MPs skilled in economic affairs such as Harsha de Silva and Eran Wickramaratne, as well as Ratnapura district MP Thalatha Atukorale, who led women\u2019s movements, have been treated,\u201d the UNP General Secretary said.",
    "He pointed out that control of the SJB has shifted to a group affiliated with the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), resulting in the marginalisation of these MPs. \u201cSJB leader Sajith Premadasa no longer prioritises MPs like Harsha, Kabir, Thalatha, and Eran. Why should they remain in an environment where they are not valued?\u201d he questioned. The UNP General Secretary said he was therefore extending a sincere invitation to Harsha de Silva, Thalatha Atukorale, Eran Wickramaratne, and Kabir Hashim to rejoin the UNP and work together with its leader, President Ranil Wickremesinghe.\u00a0 \u201cJoin Ranil Wickremesinghe in strengthening efforts to rebuild the country,\u201d he urged. He added that rejoining their former party is the most appropriate decision at this time."
