    "Feb 8 (CNN) - Pope Francis has hit back at those criticizing his decision to allow blessings for same-sex couples, saying the critics are guilty of hypocrisy.",
    "\u201cNo one is scandalized if I give a blessing to an entrepreneur who perhaps exploits people: and that is a most serious sin,\u201d the Pope said in an interview in the latest edition of Italian magazine Credere, to be published on Thursday, February 8.",
    "\u201cWhereas they are scandalized if I give it to a homosexual\u2026 This is hypocrisy! We all have to respect each other. Everyone! The heart of the document is welcome.\u201d",
    "Last year, the 87-year-old Pontiff authorized priests to offer informal blessings of couples in \u201cirregular\u201d unions in a landmark document issued on December 18, 2023. It is the first time the Vatican has allowed for such blessings, having previously forbidden any such move.",
    "But the decision has sparked contrasting reactions inside the church. While those in Western churches have largely welcomed the decision, a body representing bishops in Africa said they would not be offering blessings because they \u201cdo not consider it appropriate for Africa,\u201d adding that it \u201cwould cause confusion and would be in direct contradiction to the cultural ethos of African communities.\u201d",
    "The Pope has described the criticism of blessings in Africa as a \u201cspecial case\u201d influenced by culture, while the African bishops, despite the disagreement, have maintained their loyalty to the Pope.",
    "Criticism has also been voiced among a vocal section of conservatives inside the church, many of them in the United States and parts of Europe, and which Pope Francis has previously said \u201cbelong to small ideological groups.\u201d",
    "In his interview with Credere, which CNN received an advanced copy of, the Pope appeared to be referring to the \u201cideological groups\u201d who are selective in their application of church teachings and single out homosexuality.",
    "The Vatican has insisted that the blessings for same-sex couples are not of the \u201cunion\u201d but for the people who request them.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t bless a \u2018same-sex marriage,\u2019 I bless two people who love each other and I also ask them to pray for me,\u201d he told priest Don Vincenzo Vitale, who conducted the interview.",
    "\u201cAlways in confession, when these situations come, homosexual people, remarried people, I always pray and bless. Blessing should not be denied to anyone.\u201d",
    "He added that he was talking about people who are eligible to be baptized and wish to be part of the church.",
    "Francis\u2019 authorizing of blessings for same-sex couples is part of his broader efforts to shift the church\u2019s tone and approach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, although this has been met with resistance from some sections within Catholicism.",
    "Addressing questions about his health and reduced mobility, Francis said the church is \u201cgoverned with the head, not with the legs,\u201d and he reiterated his desire for church leaders to be close to their people.",
    "He said that \u201cwe clerics sometimes live in comfort\u201d and need to understand \u201cthe work, the suffering of people.\u201d"
