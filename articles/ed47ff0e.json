  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former President Maithripala Sirisena has informed the court that there is no need for him to make a statement in court with regard to his recent remarks on 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks as he has already provided one to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).",
    "He communicated this through a motion submitted to the Maligakanda Magistrate\u2019s Court through his legal counsels on Wednesday (03).",
    "On March 28, the Maligakanda Magistrate ordered the former president to make a statement in court on 04 April pertaining to his comments that raised eyebrows.",
    "However, the CID on March 25 obtained a five-hour-long statement from Sirisena after Public Security Minister Tiran Alles ordered an immediate investigation into the matter.",
    "On March 22, Sirisena, who was the incumbent when the coordinated bombings happened, stirred controversy when he claimed he was aware of the true masterminds of the carnage.",
    "He had also expressed readiness to disclose the relevant information and that at the same time, it is the responsibility of the judges to keep the information strictly confidential.",
    "Sirisena soon received backlash with some accusing the former President of allegedly willfully concealing crucial information about the heinous bombings that claimed the lives of more than 250 people.",
    "Amidst the controversy, however former President Sirisena had later claimed that his statement was based on certain information he had received three weeks ago."
