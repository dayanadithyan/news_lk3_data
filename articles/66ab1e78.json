    "Facilitated by GLX Alchemist Arj Wignaraja, it offered participants a deep dive into the genesis of the canvas, its critical importance as a way of breaking the cyclical nature of the economic, social and environmental crisis we are facing locally and globally, combined with an in-depth exploration of each of the nine pillars the canvas consists of. The session was at full capacity with 30 participants and these attendees were offered insights into practical strategies for implementing these pillars across diverse industries.",

When there\u2019s increased focus in the world around \u201csustainability\u201d, GLX is committed to go further. Regenerative models and practices are designed to restore systems that meet social and economic needs, and preserve the integrity of nature for generations to come.\u201d",
