  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says Govt. has no authority to delegate processing of visas to a third party according to Immigration Act",
    "Claims any such handover will necessitate amendments to be made to the relevant legislation",
    "Likens Sri Lanka\u2019s on-arrival visa processing fiasco to the Central Bank scam",
    "Questions if process was handed over to third party to secure funds for upcoming polls",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member MP Prof. G.L Peiris asserted yesterday that entrusting Sri Lanka\u203as visa-issuing process to a foreign entity is entirely illegal.",
    "Addressing a press conference, Peiris likened the situation to the Central Bank scam. He declared it the second Central Bank scam to take place in the country.",
    "\u201cThe parallels between the two incidents are striking, with similar motives at play. Nine years ago, in 2019, the current President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, then serving as Prime Minister of the Good Governance Government, orchestrated the brazen daylight robbery of the Central Bank to secure funds for elections. With another presidential election looming, various tactics are being employed to finance it,\u201d he said. The visa crisis, according to Peiris, is a calculated scheme to syphon funds from the public.",
    "Peiris also said that according to the Immigration Act, there is no authority to delegate the processing of visas to a third party in Sri Lanka. He emphasised that if such delegation were to occur, the Immigration Act would need to be amended accordingly.",
    "Peiris further mentioned that through the transfer of the visa issuance process to the company known as GBS Technology Services & IVS Global, the company stands to receive $ 46 million annually. The MP noted that the Immigration Department had efficiently handled visa issuance previously and there was no necessity for changes. \u201cHowever, the Government abruptly altered the visa program, leading to the onset of the visa crisis,\u201d he said.",
    "He accused the Government of devising a method for GBS Technology Services & IVS Global to reap substantial profits through this scheme. The MP said SLT Mobitel should have also been given the opportunity to bid for the contract.",
    "According to him, handing over the deal has four main cons for Sri Lanka. He explained that increasing the visa fee for tourists visiting Sri Lanka could impede the tourism industry\u203as growth as the current complexities surrounding visa acquisition create inconvenience for tourists, exacerbating challenges for the tourism sector.",
    "\u201cMoreover, the security of the country is significantly compromised. The Secretary of the Ministry of Public Security has appointed an evaluation committee which concluded that the company would gain access to sensitive information,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP emphasised that the visa issuance process is entirely illegal, as the Government has engaged in a program that contravenes Sri Lanka\u203as laws. He said according to the Immigration Act, third parties have no authority to process foreign passports. Should such actions occur, an amendment to the Immigration Act would be necessary, he added.",
    "Peiris stated that the Government is threatening Government officials with punishment if they voice their opinions on the visa issue. He alleged that the Government plans to implement a program to suppress dissent and facilitate corruption. Peiris also assured that the opposition would support officials who expose the Government\u203as fraudulent activities that squander public funds in this manner."
