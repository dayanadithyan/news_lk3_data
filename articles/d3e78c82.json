    "Union Assurance, Sri Lanka\u2019s premier Life Insurer, is proud to announce the launch of its flagship CSR programme, Suwamaga, aimed at enriching community well-being. Driven by its purpose of protecting lives and enriching the well-being of all, the Company will provide nationwide support under Suwamaga, a programme focused on reducing diabetes incidence in Sri Lanka. This comprehensive programme is built on four strategic pillars: raising awareness about diabetes, promoting healthy lifestyles, supporting early detection and risk management, and fostering community engagement.",
    "The urgency of Suwamaga stems from the alarming rise in the country\u2019s diabetes and pre-diabetes over the past three decades. According to the International Diabetes Federation, Sri Lanka reported a diabetes prevalence rate of 9.8% among adults in 2021, placing the nation at a heightened risk within the South Asian region. This issue affects a significant portion of the population, with increasing cases among younger individuals due to modern sedentary lifestyles, inadequate exercise, and rising stress levels. The consequences are severe, including rising morbidity rates and complications such as cardiovascular diseases, blindness, kidney failure, and amputations.",
