  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 With just months to go to Sri Lanka\u2019s presidential polls, President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party (UNP) has extended an open invitation to four prominent members of the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to join the UNP.",
    "UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara invited SJB MPs Thalatha Athukorale, Kabeer Hashim, Harsha de Silva, and Eran Wickramaratne to join the UNP, the latter three of whom make up the SJB\u2019s economic council.",
    "Bandara claimed the SJB, which broke off from the UNP in the run-up to the 2020 parliamentary elections, is now controlled by a faction of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). He implied that the SJB leader Sajith Premadasa has been ignoring the four MPs the UNP is now trying to woo to its side.",
    "\u201cToday this party has gone completely to the hands of a faction of the SLPP,\u201d he said. Does Sajith Premadasa pay any heed to Thalatha, Harsha, Eran or Kabir? Why stay where you\u2019re not wanted?\u201d",
    "\u201cI ask you to join in good faith in this new year,\u201d said Bandara, at a press conference held three days after the traditional Sinhala Tamil New Year.",
    "\u201cJoin hands with President Wickremesinghe and strengthen the country that\u2019s now being developed,\u201d he said.",
    "The former MP added that the wise course of action for SJB members is to return to the familiar fold of the UNP and continue their work.",
    "Responding to these comments, SJB MP Chandima Weerakkody insisted that no one is going anywhere.",
    "\u201cEveryone is going to join with the SJB. If there\u2019s a parliamentary election, there will be an SJB government, if a presidential election, Sajith Premadasa will be president.",
    "\u201cNo matter who might be seen going here or there, that is the final result,\u201d he said.",
    "Weerakkody contested the last parliamentary polls on the SLPP ticket, but joined the SJB recently.",
    "\u201cThey said 25, 30 or 40 would come. Then that they would come to the meeting in Kuliyapitiya. Nobody went. They won\u2019t come,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Apr17/2024)"
