    "Urges unions and plantation workers not to fall prey for cheap election tactics",
    "Main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Palani Thigambaram voiced scepticism regarding the recent plantation sector daily wage hike announced by President Ranil Wickremesinghe during the May Day rally, alleging it was another tactic by the Government ahead of elections.",
    "\u201cWe have doubts about the sincerity of the wage increase announced. We feel that it is just another tactic and a conspiracy by the Government and the employers of the Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) used to sway voters in the lead-up to elections,\u201d he claimed. Thigambaram asserted that any legal action taken by the RPCs challenging the Government gazette would likely prolong the process, taking at least another two years to reach a final verdict.",
    "\u201cI urge the unions and plantation sector workers not to be deceived by these \u2018cheap election tricks\u2019 orchestrated by the Government and RPC employers,\u201d he added."
