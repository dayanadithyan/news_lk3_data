    "Accuses President Ranil Wickremesinghe of indirectly urging UNP supporters to vote for AKD",
    "Claims Wickremesinghe is deliberately attempting to undermine SJB leader Sajith Premadasa\u2019s chances",
    "Alleges Wickremesinghe and AKD have arrived at a pact behind closed doors",
    "Challenges NPP to prove they did not accept any benefits under Wickremesinghe\u2019s Govt. in 2016",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S.M. Marikkar has accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of covertly urging United National Party (UNP) supporters to back National People\u2019s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake in the upcoming Presidential election.",
    "Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Marikkar claimed that Wickremesinghe is deliberately attempting to undermine SJB leader Sajith Premadasa\u2019s chances, knowing he himself is unlikely to win. Marikkar argued that this is why Wickremesinghe is suggesting that Dissanayake will win, to motivate his supporters to vote for him.",
    "Marikkar further alleged that Wickremesinghe\u2019s statements indicate a secret pact between Wickremesinghe and Dissanayake made behind closed doors. \u201cAll sides have begun attacking Premadasa because they know he will win,\u201d Marikkar said.",
    "He also challenged Dissanayake and other NPP leaders to disclose whether they accepted car permits and housing designated for MPs under the 2016 Government led by Wickremesinghe. \u201cAnura, if you are clean, then reveal this information publicly. I challenge you,\u201d Marikkar demanded.",
    "He claimed that SJB members have not accepted any benefits from Wickremesinghe, including bar permits, State vehicles, or land allocations.",
    "Addressing a recent viral video showing him in conversation with Wickremesinghe, Marikkar dismissed it, stating that such videos would not derail Premadasa\u2019s campaign in Colombo.",
    "\u201cNeither Ranil nor Anura can prevent Premadasa\u2019s victory in the Colombo district,\u201d he asserted."
