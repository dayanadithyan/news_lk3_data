    "Indonesia and Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign ministers called on the European Union to be consistent in its approach to the conflict in Gaza as it has with Ukraine, as ministers from Europe, the Indo-Pacific and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations gathered for meetings in Brussels on Friday.",
    "\u201cASEAN and the EU should be at the front line in respecting values and principles of international law, the respect should also be applied to Palestine, to Gaza,\u201d Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told a forum of Indo-Pacific and European ministers.",
    "\u201cI do believe that the EU and all of us, as firm supporters of upholding international law, will also have a consistent position when it comes to Gaza,\u201d she added.",
    "Ali Sabry, Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign minister, echoed the sentiment, telling reporters, \u201cWe represent the sentiment of the Global South, that there\u2019s double standards when it comes to the Middle East.\u201d",
    "\u201cThere is this ongoing debate when it comes to Palestinian people\u2019s plight and the plight of Ukrainians. People are asking, \u2018you have to be true to your heart and do the right thing by everybody because all human beings matter,\u2019\u201c Sabry said.",
    "He noted younger European politicians understand that \u201cthe credibility of the Western world is at stake unless you treat all of them equally.\u201d",
    "Ministers from over 70 countries and regional bodies of the Indo-Pacific and Europe gathered for the 3rd EU-Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum in the morning, followed by the 24th EU-ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in the afternoon.",
    "Although the agenda of both meetings ranged from collaboration and sustainability to security, Israel\u2019s continuing offensive in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and kidnappings in Israel overshadowed the events.",
    "In a news conference, European High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell acknowledged that \u201cevery time we have a meeting with our international partners... this is a permanent issue.\u201d",
    "Some countries in the 27-member bloc strongly support a cease-fire while others do not, meaning the EU is only able to have a \u201cminimum common position\u201d to support humanitarian pauses in fighting and the release of hostages, Borrell said.",
    "\u201cMy role is to try to put together different approaches, there is no double standard but there are different positions,\u201d Borrell said.",
    "He said he had told a recent European Council meeting that \u201cthe perception around the world is, in some cases, different from ours,\u201d and said he will raise the issue again.",
    "A joint statement following the EU-ASEAN meeting sought to emphasize common ground.",
    "\u201cWe agreed to condemn all attacks against civilians and we noted the call of some of us for a durable cease-fire,\u201d it said.",
    "There were common positions on \u201crapid, safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to all those in need,\u201d for all parties to protect civilians and abide by international law, and \u201cthe immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe took note, and some of us underlined the importance of, the order on provisional measures issued by interim ruling by the International Court of Justice,\u201d it stated, referring to the Jan. 26 orders for Israel to prevent genocide in Gaza and take immediate steps to ensure humanitarian assistance reaches civilians.",
    "The EU is seeking to deepen engagement with the fast-growing economies of the Indo-Pacific in a multitude of areas, including environment, security and international rule of law.",
    "Dharmendra Kanani, chief spokesperson of Brussels-based think tank Friends of Europe, said \u201cmore political clout and measurable actions\u201d need to come out of the Indo-Pacific forum, \u201cif we\u2019re not to be too late in addressing an increasingly fragile and unstable region with far-reaching global security issues.\u201d",
    "While he welcomed some \u201cimportant outcomes\u201d such as coordinated maritime presence in the Indian Ocean, including joint naval exercises and strengthening the safety of port infrastructures in South and Southeast Asia, most of the outcomes \u201chave been about reaching agreements but not practical measures,\u201d he said.",
    "China and the U.S. did not take part in the Indo-Pacific forum, though the U.S. attended last year\u2019s forum.",
    "\u201cThere is still no strategy to link [the EU\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy] more forcefully to the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy and of course no connection to the Quad, it\u2019s just very much in the air,\u201d said Alicia Garcia Herrero, senior research fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. The Quad refers to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, made up of the U.S., Japan, India and Australia.",
    "\u201cUnless there is a triangular approach with [the U.S. and India], Europe can\u2019t go anywhere with this,\u201d she said.",
    "An EU spokesperson declined to comment on whether Beijing was invited, but told reporters on Tuesday that there are other events, such as the EU-China summit in December, where the EU engages with China \u201cfully and completely.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard China talk about the Indo-Pacific as a concept they would like to engage with,\u201d the spokesperson said."
