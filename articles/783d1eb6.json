    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 State-owned SriLankan Airlines has dropped pepper and salt packs from its food dishes served for economy class passengers since late last year and made it on demand, witnesses and officials say.",
    "However, the airline has been continuing the supply of the both products to the business class, they say.",
    "Known as the \u201cking\u201d of spices, the island nation\u2019s black pepper has higher piperine content which gives it a superior quality and pungency, compared to the spice produced in other countries.",
    "Earlier, SriLankan Airlines served pepper and salt in small packs branded with the carrier\u2019s logo. However, the airline has decided to drop the salt and pepper from its dishes given only to economy class passengers.",
    "\u201cAccording to an internal survey, we found that the majority\u00a0of the passengers travelling on economy class do not use the pepper and salt,\u201d a SriLankan Airlines\u2019 source told EconomyNext when asked for the reason to drop one of the top most export spice.",
    "\u201cAs a result we were compelled to throw the unused packets as a waste,\u201d the source said.",
    "\u201cOn the other hand, the food dishes that are served in the economy class especially Sri Lankan food contain salt and pepper. So any passenger travelling on economy class is provided salt and pepper if they ask for it. If not, we do not serve them.\u201d",
    "\u201cFor passengers travelling on business class, the pepper and salt are served.\u201d (Colombo/June 10/2024)"
