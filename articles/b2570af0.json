    "Delivering the opening remarks, Mr. Duminda Hulangamuwa, Chairman of The Ceylon Chamber emphasized that \u2018the current issues can be resolved with the implementation of reforms that will benefit the common people\u201d. Speaking at the event, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe affirmed that \u201cthere are positive signs of 3% growth.

    "Presenting the Outlook report, Sanjaya Ariyawansa \u2013 Economist, Ceylon Chamber, emphasised that Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth is poised for a modest recovery in 2024. This follows a challenging period in 2023, marked by economic contraction, only to witness a positive growth of 1.6% in the third quarter.

    "In terms of monetary policy, the Central Bank shifted to a more accommodative stance in 2023 to support economic recovery and manage inflation.

The report also highlighted the potential disruptions to domestic economic recovery, including a slowdown in exports due to global economic slowdown.",
    "Despite the proposed elections in 2024, Mr. Ariyawansa emphasised the government\u2019s continued focus on implementing key structural reforms to support economic recovery. This includes enhancing governance, improving public sector efficiency, and fostering a conducive environment for private sector growth. Such reforms are deemed essential to avoid repeated reliance on external financial support.",

Mr. Jafferjee stated that \u2018the sooner we reform the SOEs, the sooner we reap the benefits\u2019, with Dr. Perera expressing similar sentiments, stating that \u2018structural reforms will complement the tight monetary and fiscal policies.\u2019 Mr. Weerasinghe meanwhile referenced the imperative for the Digital ID, emphasizing the \u2018need to resume the Digital ID Project as soon as possible. This is essential for increasing our tax revenue\u2019.",
    "Referencing overall economic growth, Mr. Subasinghe stressed that \u2018we need to pursue a growth strategy that is inclusive and equitable. Everyone should benefit from the expansion of the corporate sector.\u201d Mr. Sangani also echoed this viewpoint, emphasizing that \u2018the key factor is how we execute the plans.
