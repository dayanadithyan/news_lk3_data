    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings has upgraded the national long-term rating of Habib Bank Limited \u2013 Sri Lanka Branch to \u2018AA-(lka)\u2019, from \u2018A(lka)\u2019. The outlook is stable, Fitch Ratings said.",
    "This follows the improved credit profile of the bank\u2019s head office \u2013 Habib Bank Limited, Pakistan\u2019s largest bank \u2013 following the upgrade of Pakistan\u2019s sovereign rating.",
    "Fitch Upgrades Habib Bank Limited \u2013 Sri Lanka Branch to \u2018AA-(lka)\u2019; Outlook Stable",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 12 Aug 2024: Fitch Ratings has upgraded Habib Bank Limited \u2013 Sri Lanka Branch\u2019s (HBLSL) National Long-Term Rating to \u2018AA-(lka)\u2019, from \u2018A(lka)\u2019.",
    "Stronger Head Office Support: The upgrade of HBLSL\u2019s National Rating reflects the improved credit profile of the bank\u2019s head office \u2013 Habib Bank Limited (HBL), Pakistan\u2019s largest bank \u2013 following the upgrade of Pakistan\u2019s sovereign rating.",
    "This reflects the greater ability of the head office to provide extraordinary support to the Sri Lankan branch.",
    "Fitch upgraded Pakistan\u2019s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating to \u2018CCC+\u2019, from \u2018CCC\u2019, on 29 July 2024.",
    "The head office\u2019s credit profile remains constrained by the sovereign rating due to its high interconnectedness with the state.",
    "HBLSL\u2019s rating reflects Fitch\u2019s expectation of support, if required, from the head office.",
    "The rating is underpinned by HBLSL\u2019s status as a branch of HBL and part of the same legal entity as HBL. HBLSL is therefore subject to any regulatory constraints on HBL remitting money from Pakistan into Sri Lanka.",
    "Our assessment also takes into consideration HBLSL\u2019s strong operational integration with HBL and the small size of the branch, which made up 0.3% of HBL\u2019s total assets at end-1Q24.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "HBLSL\u2019s National Rating would be downgraded if there are material changes to Fitch\u2019s expectation of support from HBL, such as a change in the branch\u2019s legal status or the branch being divested.",
    "A downgrade of Pakistan\u2019s \u2018CCC+\u2019 Long-Term Issuer Default Rating, or weakening ability of the parent relative to the Pakistan sovereign, or any other developments that affect the branch\u2019s ability to service its obligations, could also lead to a multiple-notch downgrade of HBLSL\u2019s National Rating.",
    "A change in the relativities among the credit profiles of issuers based in Sri Lanka could also prompt a downward revision in the rating.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "HBLSL\u2019s National Rating could be upgraded should HBL\u2019s credit profile improve, reflecting a greater ability to provide extraordinary support to the Sri Lankan branch.",
    "This assumes our expectation of the parent\u2019s propensity to support remains unchanged.",
    "REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING",
    "The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.",
    "HBLSL\u2019s rating is linked to HBL\u2019s credit profile, based on its legal status as a branch of HBL."
