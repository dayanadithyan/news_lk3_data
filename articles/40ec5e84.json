    "The year 2024 is expected to be one of prosperity for Asia with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expecting the region to maintain its momentum in delivering two-thirds to global growth.",
    "Providing a snapshot of the regional economic outlook, Krishna Srinivasan,\u00a0Director of the IMF\u2019s Asia and Pacific Department\u00a0noted that the region's prospects for a soft landing have improved.",
    "\u201dThe good news is that we have revised growth upward for both 2023 and 2024,\u201d he\u00a0said addressing a press conference this week.",
    "For 2023, the IMF estimates\u00a0growth at 4.7 percent, compared to the\u00a04.6 percent projection in October. China and India account for most of the upward revision. In China, growth was supported by higher spending on disaster reconstruction and resilience projects. In India, strong domestic demand underpinned another increase in our growth estimate.",
    "The Fund has also\u00a0upgraded the\u00a0regional growth forecast for 2024 to 4.5 percent, from 4.2 percent in October.",
    "Srinivasan\u00a0justified the upward projection stating that a positive dynamic from last year carries over into 2024.\u00a0A\u00a0more supportive external environment, notably robust growth in the United States, reinforces domestic resilience, he\u00a0said. Further, demand for technology\u2014computers, electronics, and optical products\u2014has picked up in recent months, which benefits economies such as Korea and Singapore.",
    "Also, countries like China and Thailand have announced sizeable policy stimulus, which is positive.",
    "In Japan, the IMF\u00a0expected\u00a0growth to remain above potential but to slow from about 2 percent in 2023 to about 1 percent in 2024, as one-off factors that supported activity last year fade\u2014including a depreciated yen, strong tourism, and a recovery in business investment.",
    "Growth in India, on the other hand, is expected to remain strong at 6.5 percent in both 2024 and 2025.",
    "\u201cFor 2025, we project growth in the region to decelerate mildly to 4.3 percent, reflecting to a large extent China\u2019s growth slowdown,\u201d said Srinivasan",
    "On inflation, the news has also been mostly positive,\u00a0which improves the prospects for a soft landing, he\u00a0added."
