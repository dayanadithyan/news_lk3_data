The chief guest, Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanathan, along with public and private sector representatives, participated in the proceedings. On the first day, politicians, civil servants, and private sector stakeholders were introduced to the concept of \u201cSANASA Way Forward\u201d. The second day focused on informing the general public, a crucial group for driving a productive economy, about the initiative. Approximately 500 SANASA members and non-members attended the event, where Dr. Kiriwandeniya provided a detailed introduction to the structure of \u201cSANASA Way Forward\u201d.",
    "Addressing the attendees, Dr. Kiriwandeniya shared his vision for \u201cSANASA Way Forward\u201d, a concept designed to foster a manufacturing-based economy that transcends the limitations of a service-oriented model. He explained that this initiative, which spans from the leadership of the SANASA Group to ordinary citizens, aims to address the country\u2019s economic challenges by embracing a more productive economic model. He emphasised that through collective effort and unity, Sri Lankans of all ethnic backgrounds, be they Sinhala, Tamil, or Muslim, can work together to build a brighter future for the nation.",
