    "Colombo, Feb 27 (Daily Mirror) - Rats were found on board a SriLankan Airlines aircraft on Sunday, forcing the authorities to delay flight, SriLankan Airlines Chairman Ashok Pathirage said yesterday.",
    "\u201cWe had to spray a chemical to an aircraft in which rats were found and ground it for one day as per the international standards,\u201d Mr. Pathirage told a discussion which was held at Ports, Shipping and Aviation Ministry.",
    "Two other aircraft had to be delayed due to technical defects,\u201d he added.",
    "Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala then questioned as to whether any investigation was done to determine as to how the animals managed to creep into the aircraft.",
    "It was also revealed that the absence of 15 ground handling staff also caused the delay. Three members of staff have applied for leave on Sunday, while the remaining 12 have kept away from work casually. \u201cSack those who kept away from work without applying for leave,\u201d the angry minister said.",
    "Mr. Pathirage said there are only 20 aircraft in the Srilankan Airlines fleet while three aircraft have been grounded. \u201cWe are to purchase five A 330 Aircraft, but that has become an issue with the global demand for airlines and because of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic situation,\u201d he said."
