    "The Online Safety Act has been published in the government gazette, enacting it as the Online Safety Act, No. 9 of 2024.",
    "Accordingly, the Act will provide for the establishment of the Online Safety Commission, safety from prohibited statements made online and prevention of the use of online accounts and inauthentic online accounts for prohibited purposes.",
    "It is also expected to make provisions to identify and declare online locations used for prohibited purposes in Sri Lanka and suppress the financing and other support of communication of prohibited statements and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.",
    "The legislation which seeks to regulate online content was passed in Parliament, with amendments on 24 January, amidst objections from opposition politicians and activists who allege the new law will muzzle free speech.",
    "The controversial Bill garnered not only the attention of local activists and organisations, but also that of diplomats and large international organisations, claiming that the Bill had numerous problematic aspects."
