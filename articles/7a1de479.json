  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s consumers should be more aware and vigilant when purchasing goods through online platforms and e-marketing methods, the Consumer Affairs Authority has said.",
    "\u201cThere can be any number of laws in the country but it will be useless if consumers aren\u2019t aware of the legal recourse,\u201d Janaka Prasad, Assistant Director of the Consumer Affairs Authority said.",
    "The methods of consumers purchasing goods and services have evolving faster than a country can enact laws, Prasad told reporters Friday, adding that this was a global challenge.",
    "\u201cThe consumer plays and important role in navigating a fast evolving marketplace.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe have a literacy rate of 90-95 percent, but this is not enough. The ability to read is not sufficient. Consumers have to be able to comprehend. That cognizance is lacking in Sri Lankan consumers when you compare with the rest of the world.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s consumers must make sure to protect their money. \u201cMost of the complaints we receive are not about essential items. People scrolling on their phones decide impulsively that they want to buy something.\u201d",
    "\u201cConsumers have to do due diligence of what they buy, consider the specifications, the country of manufacture, the product\u2019s history, read reviews (of course some companies pay for reviews), so consumers must consider all of this.\u201d",
    "Laws are enacted over time in response to various challenges presented at various times, the CAA official pointed out. \u201cWe cannot change the law daily or weekly in pace with the changing marketplace.",
    "\u201cIf you look at the 19th and 20th centuries the pace of change was slow. But in the last 20 years alone things have changed drastically. A phone you buy today could be outdated in a week. 20 years ago a tv would last you some time, but now LED and LCD tvs don\u2019t last that long.",
    "\u201cQuality, durability and technological use of goods have evolved. So consumer demand must be aware of these, factor in these considerations.\u201d",
    "The CAA receives a lot of complaints Prasad said. \u201cThere are actions we can take within the legal framework we have now. But we have to amend and bring the law up-to-date with the changes in the online purchasing, then we can ensure a far safer online marketplace.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe have to develop consumer awareness. Only then we can reduce this problem.\u201d (Colombo/May17/2024)"
