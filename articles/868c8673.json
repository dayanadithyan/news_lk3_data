    "The presidential candidate of the \u201cSarvajana Balaya\u201d alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera, says that they have planned to implement a new program called \u201cHithe Haiya\u201d instead of the various welfare schemes that have been provided to the people thus far.",
    "He made these remarks while participating in a rally held in Monaragala.",
    "\u201cThe welfare schemes that have been deceiving you all along first came as \u2018Janasaviya.\u2019 Then came \u2018Samurdhi.\u2019 Then came \u2018Aswesuma.\u2019 But now your eyes are open. We have presented the \u2018Hithe Haiya\u2019 program,\u201d he said.",
    "Jayaweera stated that the \u2018Hithe Haiya\u2019 program is designed to end those programs that turned people into \u2018beggars\u2019 and made them dependent on politicians.",
    "\u201cWe declare that your household\u2019s minimum income should be Rs. 100,000, and we firmly state that Rs. 100,000 will be provided,\u201d he said.",
    "He further explained that a specific schedule has been outlined in this program, and they have also prepared a plan to encourage and uplift \u2018Samurdhi\u2019 officers, in order to double their income.",
    "\u201cThere is only one thing left to do. You\u2019ll be given a pencil and paper. My name is the tenth in the ballot paper. Mark an \u2018X\u2019 in front of it. A day victorious for you all will come. A star will shine in the sky. To become a star, vote for the star,\u201d he said."
