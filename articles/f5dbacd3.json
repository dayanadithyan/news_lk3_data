    "Colombo, June 1 (Daily Mirror) Claiming that he never meant to call billionaire businessman Elon Musk an economic hit-man, NPP Economic Council member Sunil Hadunnetti said today he expresses his regrets to Elon Musk.",
    "Speaking during a Business Forum, Hadunnetti said his reference to economic hit-men was to James Packer and George Soros who were brought into the country during the previous Ranil Wickremesinghe government.",
    "\"I was misquoted on what I said about Elon Musk. I didn't mean to call Elon Misk an economic hit-man. What I explained was that world renowned investors never come to Sri Lanka due to its instability, political interventions in the economy, lack of discipline and lawlessness. My reference to economic hit-men was not to Elon Musk but to James Packer and George Soros. We do not call them honest entrepreneurs but economic hit-men. I never meant to call Elon Musk an economic hit-man. I offer my regrets to Elon Musk as I never meant to call him an economic hit-man,\" Hadunnetti said."
