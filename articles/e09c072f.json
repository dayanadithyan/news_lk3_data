    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lankans building their new home should focus on the direction of the sun, and not just auspicious directions, officials at a Sectoral Oversight Committee on Energy have said.",
    "Many Sri Lankans consult astrologers and mystics before building anything new, who advise on which direction a building must not face (ma-ru si-ti-na di-sha-va).",
    "But house owners should also focus on the direction of the sun (hi-ru si-ti-na di-sha-va), officials of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) said.",
    "\u201cWhen building, constructors should consider a place to install solar panels in a new house,\u201d a statement by the Department of Government Information quoted the officials as saying.",
    "The officials pointed out that although people are concerned about the \u2018direction of death\u2019 based on occult science, they are not concerned about the direction of the sun. This has become a problem in the installation of solar panels, they said.",
    "The committee pointed out the need to conduct awareness programs and encourage people to install solar panels.",
    "The use of LED light bulbs to reduce electricity consumption must also be encouraged, they said. SEA officials said that considering the savings from LED bulbs, if the government were to provide LED bulbs free of charge, it could recoup the amount it spends in two months. (Colombo/Feb14/2024)"
