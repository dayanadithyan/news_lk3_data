    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 United National Party (UNP) General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara has defended his call for postponing Sri Lanka\u2019s presidential election by two years, claiming that his proposal was not undemocratic nor unconstitutional.",
    "Speaking to reporters at the UNP headquarters Monday June 03 morning, Bandara also claimed that neither opposition leader Sajith Premadasa nor National People\u2019s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake have spoken against his proposal.",
    "\u201cI have made no statement that\u2019s undemocratic. My statement was in line with provisions of the constitution,\u201d the former UNP parliamentarian said.",
    "He quoted Section 86 of Chapter XIII of the constitution which says: \u201cThe President may, subject to the provisions of Article 85, submit to the People by Referendum any matter which in the opinion of the President is of national importance.\u201d",
    "Sections 87.1, 87.2 also elaborates on the matter and describes the parliament\u2019s role, said Bandara.",
    "\u201cI spoke of a referendum and parliament\u2019s duty. Neither of this is antidemocratic or unconstitutional. As per the constitution, priority should be given to ensuring people\u2019s right to life,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSome parties may be against what I proposed. They may criticse me. But what I ask them is to come to one position as political parties and make a statement on whether they\u2019re ready to continue the ongoing economic programme,\u201d he added.",
    "Bandara claimed that, though thee has been much criticism of his proposal for a postponement of the presidential election, President Wickremesinghe\u2019s rivals Premadasa and Dissanayake have yet to remark on the matter.",
    "\u201cI suggested that [Premadasa] make this proposal in parliament and for [Dissanayake] to second it. But I don\u2019t see that either Premadasa nor Dissanayake is opposed to it. To date, I have not seen nor heard either of them utter a word against this. I believe they have no objection to my proposal which was made for the betterment of the country,\u201d he said.
