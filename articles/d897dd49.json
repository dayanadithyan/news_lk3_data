    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka does not look at the real effective exchange rate, but allows the rupee to move on demand and supply, based on the flexible inflation targeting framework, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee had been allowed to appreciate from March 2023, amid deflationary monetary policy, in contrast to earlier stabilization programs, where the depreciated rupee has been prevented from strengthening despite and reserves were collected only at the depreciated rate.",
    "\u201cWe do not look at the real effective exchange rate,\u201d Governor Weerasinghe said. \u201cThis is market driven, demand and supply.\u201d",
    "\u201cThese days there is a lot of supply, as a result we have been building our position.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe exchange rate is determined, mostly based on the market, short term demand and supply. And long term mainly on market fundamentals, current account deficit. And the long term is mainly market fundamentals, the current account deficit.",
    "\u201cLast year we had a current account deficit. Last year the current account was a surplus. This year we also expect a\u00a0 smaller surplus than last year.",
    "\u2018So I do not expect a lot of pressure on market conditions.\u201d",
    "The central bank has collected reserves and the government has also repaid loans to multilateral lenders amid lower domestic private credit. Private banks had also built-up dollar positions or repaid credit lines.",
    "Governor Weerasinghe said he did not want to comment on exchange rate predictions made by various persons.",
    "\u201cThere are always projections, that is ok,\u201d Governor Weerasinghe said. \u201cThe exchange determination is as we announced under the flexible inflation targeting regime. It is a market driven exchange rate. There is no exchange rate target.\u201d",
    "Related Sri Lanka rupee expected to reach 280 to US dollar by June: President",
    "Econometricians have devised various statistical methods through which exchange rates can be shown to be simultaneously \u2018overvalued\u2019 (based on REER) and \u2018undervalued\u2019 (IMF\u2019s EBA-lite for example).",
    "Based on published central bank REER data, the rupee is now sharply below 100.",
    "Some of the models to calculate \u2018equilibrium\u2019 exchange rates were developed from around 1970 as Western central banks also lost a credible anchor for their operating framework, and money lost a fundamental attribute of being a store of value, analysts say. (Colombo/Mar27/2028)"
