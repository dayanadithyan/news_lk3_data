    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will resume a student insurance scheme called Suraksha, which it stopped in 2022 due to the economic crisis, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "Coverage will extend across all types of schools and includes students from low-income families earning less than 180,000 rupees annually, he said.",
    "\u201cSuraksha student insurance will cover 4.5 million students, offering health, accident, and life insurance. Health benefits include up to Rs. 300,000 for inpatient care, Rs. 20,000 for outpatient services, and critical illness coverage up to Rs. 1.5 million,\u201d the president said on social media platform X (twitter).",
    "\u201cAccident insurance ranges from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 200,000, covering disabilities. Life insurance provides Rs. 75,000 per child if a parent passes away, with a maximum of Rs. 225,000 per family.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe implemented the Suraksha student insurance in 2017 when he was Prime Minister.",
    "It ran until 1 December 2022, when it had to be stopped due to the country\u2019s economic constraints.",
    "2 billion rupees was allocated in the 2024 budget to revive the student insurance programme, starting from the first week of June.",
    "\u201cNelson Mandela said, I quote, \u201cThere can be no keener revelation of a society\u2019s soul than the way in which it treats its children.\u201d I too believe in a world that cares for and protects children\u2019s rights, providing them with a safe and happy environment in which to grow.\u201d (Colombo/May22/2024)"
