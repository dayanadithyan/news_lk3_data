    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s power grid has been hit by 300,000 outages as heavy winds brought down trees, restoring supply has been delayed by unfilled vacancies of breakdown staff, a union statement said.",
    "Despite electricity being declared an essential service, vacancies have not been filled, the CEB Engineers Union said.",
    "\u201cIn this already challenging situation, the Acting General Manager of CEB issued a circular on May 21, 2024, abolishing several essential service positions, including the Maintenance Electrical Engineer in the Area Engineer Offices, Construction Units, and Distribution Maintenance Units,\u201d the Union said.",
    "\u201cThis decision, made without any scientific basis, significantly reduces our capacity to provide adequate services to the public during this emergency.",
    "\u201cOn behalf of all the staff of CEB, we express our deep regret for the inconvenience caused to our valued customers.\u201d",
    "High winds had rains have brought down trees across power lines and transformers, the statement said.",
    "In the past few day over 300,000 power outages have been reported nationwide, with some areas experiencing over 30,000 outages within an hour.",
    "\u201cOur limited technical staff at the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) are making extraordinary efforts to restore power as quickly as possible,\u201d the union said.",
    "\u201cWe deeply regret that due to the high volume of calls, there are times when we are unable to respond to all customer inquiries.",
    "\u201cWe kindly ask consumers to support our restoration teams and to report any fallen live electrical wires or devices to the Electricity Board immediately without attempting to handle them.",
    "The union said there were not enough workers to restore power quickly when such a large volume of breakdowns happens.",
    "\u201cWe want to clarify that the additional groups mentioned by the minister have not yet been received by the CEB,\u201d the union said.",
    "\u201cDespite the government\u2019s designation of electricity as an essential service, neither the government, the minister in charge, nor the CEB board of directors have taken adequate steps to fill the relevant vacancies or retain current employees.",
    "\u201cWe believe they should be held directly responsible for the delays in addressing the power outages due to the shortage of staff.\u201d"
