    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch affirmed licensed non-bank lender UB Finance Company Ltd\u2019s national long-term rating at \u2018BB(lka)\u2019. The outlook is stable.",
    "The rating is driven by Fitch\u2019s expectation of extraordinary support from Union Bank of Colombo PLC, which owns 89.9 percent of UB Finance.",
    "\u201cUBF\u2019s rating is constrained by our view that any support required may be more of a burden relative to UB\u2019s modest balance sheet size, compared with other Fitch-rated financial leasing companies owned by larger banks,\u201d Fitch said in its assessment.",
    "The rating agency expects the proposed rights issue to bridge UBF\u2019s regulatory capital shortfall. \u201cHowever, the capital buffer could be thin against the regulatory minimum capital of LKR2.5 billion and may fall below the regulatory requirement should there be any unforeseen losses.\u201d",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 26 Apr 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed UB Finance PLC\u2019s (UBF) National Long-Term Rating at \u2018BB(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable.",
    "Shareholder Support Underpins Rating: UBF\u2019s National Long-Term Rating is driven by our expectation of extraordinary support from Union Bank of Colombo PLC (UB, BBB- (lka)/Stable) to UBF, if required. Our view is based on UB\u2019s 89.9% ownership of UBF, its record of ordinary support, board representation and common branding between the bank and UBF.",
    "Relative Size a Constraint: UBF\u2019s rating is constrained by our view that any support required may be more of a burden relative to UB\u2019s modest balance sheet size, compared with other Fitch-rated financial leasing companies owned by larger banks. UBF\u2019s assets accounted for 7% of UB\u2019s consolidated assets and 14% of equity as of end-2023. UB\u2019s smaller capital base also limits the amount of funding it can provide to UBF in times of need due to the regulatory limit on the bank\u2019s single-borrower lending. At end-3QFY24 UBF held no debt from UB, with only modest historical borrowings on record.",
    "Limited Importance to Group: We rate UBF two notches below its parent\u2019s rating given its limited importance to the UB group. UBF\u2019s main products, including leasing and gold lending, account for 5.3% of the group\u2019s gross loans and are not core products of the group due to limited scale, in Fitch\u2019s view. Furthermore, synergies are limited between the bank and UBF, given minimal overlap between UB\u2019s and UBF\u2019s target customer profiles. UBF\u2019s low contribution to group profitability due to a weak performance record, despite the 13% contribution in 2023, also limits its importance to the group.",
    "Weak Standalone Profile: We believe UBF\u2019s intrinsic credit profile is weaker than its support-driven rating. UBF has a small franchise, with market share of below 1% as of end2023. Fitch views UBF\u2019s risk appetite as high while its poor asset quality, weak earnings, thin capital buffers and significant deposit concentration underpin its weak financial profile.",
    "Thin Capital Buffers: We expect the proposed rights issue to bridge UBF\u2019s regulatory capital shortfall. However, the capital buffer could be thin against the regulatory minimum capital of LKR2.5 billion and may fall below the regulatory requirement should there be any unforeseen losses. UBF\u2019s debt/tangible equity stood at 2.9x at end-3QFY24 and we expect this to increase in the medium term as UBF pursues aggressive growth.",
    "Loan Book to Expand: We expect UBF to pursue rapid growth in the near to medium term, supported by improving economic activity and easing interest rates. We believe vehicle financing and gold-backed lending, which contributed 75% of loans at FYE23, to remain UBF\u2019s core product offerings, while its legacy property exposures (11% of FYE23 loan book) is likely to decline.",
    "Asset Quality to Improve: We expect UBF\u2019s gross stage 3 loan ratio to moderate in the near to medium term, due to higher loan growth, increasing recovery efforts and less pressure on the existing borrowers due to improved economic conditions and declining interest rates. The gross stage 3 loan ratio marginally improved to 30% as of end-3QFY24 (FYE23: 33%) due to declining stage 3 loans, but remains considerably higher than the industry average of 18%.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "UBF\u2019s rating is sensitive to changes in UB\u2019s credit profile, as reflected in UB\u2019s National Long Term Rating as well as Fitch\u2019s opinion around UB\u2019s ability and propensity to extend timely extraordinary support. Developments that could lead to a negative rating action include:",
    "\u2013 a material increase in UBF\u2019s size relative to the parent that makes extraordinary support more onerous for the parent;",
    "\u2013 further reduction in the parent\u2019s ownership, control or influence that could weaken its propensity to support UBF;",
    "\u2013 prolonged weak performance of UBF that we believe will weaken the parent\u2019s propensity to support the subsidiary;",
    "\u2013 a notable decline in UBF\u2019s capital buffers, indicating reduced timeliness in financial support to support growth or meet regulatory norms;",
    "\u2013 insufficient or delayed support from UB relative to UBF\u2019s needs, which hinders UBF\u2019s ability to meet its obligations in a timely manner.",
    "Such developments could significantly reduce shareholder support prospects and, if severe, may lead to a multi-notch downgrade.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "An upgrade would most likely result from a positive rating action on UB\u2019s National Long Term Rating, which would reflect its strengthened ability to support UBF.",
    "A significant increase in UBF\u2019s strategic importance to UB along with closer integration with UB across broader functional areas may lead to positive rating action. However, we do not expect such a change in the near term.",
    "A temporary deposit cap of LKR7.5 billion was imposed on the company starting from December 2023, due to the unimpaired core capital falling marginally below the Central Bank of Sri Lanka\u2019s threshold of LKR2.5 billion. This cap is anticipated to be lifted upon the completion of the proposed rights issue of LKR 0.25 billion, aimed at augmenting the core capital of the company. The rights issue is scheduled to conclude in June 2024.",
