Israel\u2019s military said it was targeting Islamic Jihad militants.",
    "Israel\u2019s air, sea and ground offensive has reduced much of densely populated northern Gaza to rubble. The military told Palestinians to move south, but as many as 300,000 people are believed to have remained.",
    "Roughly one in six children under 2 in the north suffer from acute malnutrition and wasting, \u201cthe worst level of child malnutrition anywhere in the world,\u201d Carl Skau, deputy executive director of the World Food Program, said this week. \u201cIf nothing changes, a famine is imminent in northern Gaza.\u201d",
