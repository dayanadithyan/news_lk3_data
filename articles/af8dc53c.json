  "original_body_lines": [
    "Donald Trump chose Ohio U.S. Senator J.D. Vance to be his vice presidential running mate, as the Republican Party officially nominated the former president to run again for the White House today at the start of the party\u2019s national convention in Milwaukee.",
    "\u201cAs Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.",
    "The four-day convention opened in downtown Milwaukee\u2019s Fiserv Forum two days after Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, and hours after he secured a major legal victory when a federal judge dismissed one of Trump\u2019s criminal prosecutions.",
    "Trump is due to formally accept the party\u2019s nomination in a prime-time speech on Thursday and will challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election.",
    "Vance, 39, was a fierce Trump critic in 2016 but has since become one of the former president\u2019s staunchest defenders, embracing his false claims that the 2020 election was marred by widespread fraud.",
    "Soon after Trump\u2019s announcement, Vance emerged on the convention floor with his wife Usha, shaking hands with and hugging delegates who swarmed the couple. He smiled widely as he was formally nominated to be vice president and is scheduled to address the convention on Wednesday.",
    "Vance is deeply popular with Trump\u2019s core supporters, but it remains to be seen whether he can broaden the ticket\u2019s appeal. He shares Trump\u2019s aggressive approach to politics, and his conservative statements on issues such as abortion could turn off moderate voters.",
    "Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland that Vance is \u201ca clone of Trump on the issues.\u201d",
    "Opinion polls show a close race between Trump, 78, and Biden, 81, though Trump leads in several swing states that are likely to decide the election. Trump has not committed to accepting the results of the election if he loses.",
    "The head of the main fundraising super PAC supporting Trump\u2019s campaign, Taylor Budowich, said on X that MAGA Inc had raised more than $50 million on Monday.",
    "After the assassination attempt, Trump said he was revising his acceptance speech to emphasize national unity, rather than highlight his differences with Biden.",
    "\u201cThis is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would\u2019ve been two days ago,\u201d Trump told the Washington Examiner.",
    "U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon\u2019s decision on Monday to throw out federal charges against Trump for retaining classified documents after leaving the White House was the latest in a string of legal wins for the former president, who is due to be sentenced in New York in September for trying to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in the weeks before his 2016 election victory.",
    "His other two indictments on federal charges in Washington and state charges in Georgia \u2013 both related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat \u2013 are mired in delays and could be significantly limited after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July that he had immunity for many of his official acts as president.",
    "\u201cThis dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social on Monday, also referencing the prosecutions of hundreds of his supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
    "The shooting attempt on Trump\u2019s life immediately altered the dynamics of the presidential campaign, which had been focused on whether Biden should drop out due to concerns about his age and acuity following a halting June 27 debate performance.",
    "Nearly two dozen of Biden\u2019s fellow Democrats in Congress have called on him to end his reelection bid and allow the party to pick another standard bearer.",
    "Having consolidated party control, Trump could seize on the opportunity to deliver a unifying message or paint a dark portrait of a nation under siege by a corrupt leftist elite, as he has done at times on the campaign trail.",
    "Trump has frequently turned to violent rhetoric in campaign speeches, labeling his perceived enemies as \u201cvermin\u201d and \u201cfascists.\u201d",
    "Biden has cast Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy, comments that some Republicans say helped foster an atmosphere that prompted the shooting even though authorities have yet to determine the motive for the assassination attempt. The gunman himself was shot dead.",
    "Following Saturday\u2019s shooting, Biden sought to lower the temperature after months of heated political rhetoric.",
    "\u201cThere is no place in America for this kind of violence,\u201d Biden said in an address from the White House on Sunday.",
    "In an excerpt of an interview with NBC News set to air later on Monday, Biden said it was a \u201cmistake\u201d to tell donors last week it was \u201ctime to put Trump in a bull\u2019s eye\u201d but noted that Trump has often used incendiary words.",
    "Biden ordered an independent review of how the gunman, who killed a spectator, could have come so close to killing Trump. Congressional investigators also sought to question the head of the U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting the former president."
