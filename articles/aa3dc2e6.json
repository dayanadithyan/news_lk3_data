    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has raised concerns pertaining to the recent surge in fatalities in the country involving the police.",
    "In a statement issued on Monday (22 Jan.), the BASL called on the relevant authorities to conduct an independent inquiry into the matter.",
    "The BASL urged for the said investigation, recalling the recent death of a lorry driver in the Damepelessa area in Narammala, after a Police Sub-Inspector\u2019s firearm had allegedly \u2018accidentally\u2019 discharged during a vehicle inspection, after the lorry driver had failed to comply with a police checkpoint.",
    "Further, the BASL also highlighted that the Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles has \u2018expressed determination to persist with the ongoing anti-crime operations\u2019 despite the escalating criticism regarding their execution.",
    "While acknowledging the necessity of law enforcement action against individuals engaged in drug-related activities, the BASL urged that such operations be conducted in manner strictly adherent to legal protocols.",
    "With regards to the Minister\u2019s statements suggesting that certain Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and lawyers had corresponded with overseas entities and triggered subsequent public statements, the BASL accused the Minister of making statements that are \u2018irresponsible\u2019, \u2018misleading\u2019 and \u2018detrimental to the crucial role lawyers play in serving public interest\u2019.",
    "\u201cThe justice system provides a vital check and balance and should not be attacked for the sake of political point-scoring\u201d, the statement reads.",
    "Attached is the full statement released by the BASL in this regard:",
