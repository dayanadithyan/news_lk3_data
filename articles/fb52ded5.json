    "The presidential candidate of the \u2018Sarvajana Balaya\u2019 alliance, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera, emphasized the need to establish a National Strategic Planning Authority to help the country progress.",
    "He expressed these views during the \u2018Derana 360\u00b0\u2019 programme, aired on TV Derana last night (16).",
    "Jayaweera stated that the country is burdened with immense debt due to the decisions made by individual ministers.",
    "To prevent this, he suggested that before any ministry takes important decisions, they should be discussed, making a case for the formation of a National Strategic Planning Authority comprising scholars and experts.",
    "\u201cWe are proposing a National Strategic Planning Authority through which decisions will be made.\u201d",
    "\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been much dialogue about this. We propose that the country\u2019s scholars and experts be included in this authority,\u201d he said.",
    "Jayaweera further suggested that any decisions made by ministries should be thoroughly discussed with representatives from all ministries, considering financial, environmental, and societal impacts, including those affecting children.",
    "\u201cThis National Strategic Planning Authority is essential if we are to move this third-world country even an inch forward, no matter who is in power. We remain stuck in this massive debt because we allow ministers to make decisions on their own,\u201d he added."
