    "\u201cWith 1.2 million users, ComBank Digital is already a significant element of our sustainability roadmap, but there are still demographic as well as geographic gaps in terms of usage, which we are addressing by providing users the option to choose to perform transactions in Sinhala or Tamil,\u201d Mr Banduwansa said. \u201cThis will make usage easier for some customer segments and encourage larger numbers to register on the platform.\u201d",
