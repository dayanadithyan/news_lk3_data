    "Ratnayake expressed that since the rupee is appreciating very slowly, what needs to be done now is to take steps to increase the income of the people.",
    "\u201cThe price of goods has been brought to the lowest possible point. The prices of some goods like vegetables, fluctuate frequently. However, in terms of foreign exchange, the prices of goods have reached the lowest point\u201d, he said.",
    "\u201cFurther appreciation of the rupee is happening very slowly. All we have to do now is to increase the income of the people. Otherwise, we have to make the income of people match the tripled prices of goods.\u201d",
