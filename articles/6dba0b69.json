  "original_body_lines": [
    "Pope Francis on Sunday called for a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine that would lead to a just and lasting peace, as the second anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion was marked a day earlier.",
    "\u201cSo many victims, wounded, destruction, anguish, and tears in a period that is becoming terribly long and whose end is not in sight. It is a war that not only devastates that region but also unleashes global waves of hate and fear\u201d, Pope Francis said during his weekly Angelus message.",
    "\u201cI plead for that little bit of humanity to be found to create the conditions for a diplomatic solution in search of a just and lasting peace\u201d, he said.",
    "Heads of the Group of Seven major democracies on Saturday pledged to stand by war-weary Ukraine, and Western leaders travelled to Kyiv to show solidarity on the second anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion.",
    "Francis said he was also concerned about escalating violence in the east region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
    "Last week, violent clashes escalated between the DRC\u2019s army and Rwandan-backed M23 Tutsi-led rebels in eastern Congo, killing scores and displacing hundreds of thousands.",
    "\u201cI join the bishops in their call to pray for peace, hoping for an end to the clashes and a search for genuine and constructive dialogue\u201d, he said.",
    "Francis reiterated his prayers for Israel, for Palestinians and for \u201cthe many war-torn peoples\u201d."
