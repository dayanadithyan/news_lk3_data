    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Opposition was like informal gambling den operators at village funerals, who want the funeral to continue so they can earn on gambling (bu-ru-wa), the State Minister of Finance said.",
    "\u201cIn our villages when there is a funeral, there is a group that comes, cries and talks a bit and then get to their main business; which is running a gambling game (su-du-wa) on the side,\u201d Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said in Parliament on Wednesday.",
    "\u201cThey like it if the funeral goes on for many days because they can earn on the side. I\u2019m asking our opposition to not be like that,\u201d Siyambalapitiya said, \u201cDon\u2019t cry crocodile tears.\u201d",
    "In reply to the accusation Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa merely asked: \u201cSo who created the funeral house?\u201d"
