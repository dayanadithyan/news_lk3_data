  "original_body_lines": [
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed W. K. D. Wijerathne as the Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) said.",
    "The appointment was made in accordance with the provisions of the new Anti-Corruption Act.",
    "Wijerathne has held the same position before, but this new appointment is under the new Anti Corruption Act, which was passed in the Parliament in September last year with wide powers.",
    "The new Act gives CIABOC broader ability to investigate and prosecute incidents of bribery and corruption. The commission has previously examined claims of bribery and corruption but has failed to meet expectations because most complaints have not resulted in prosecution."
