  "original_body_lines": [
    "Ottawa police admit they made mistakes last week when communicating key information about the city\u2019s worst mass killing in recent history.",
    "Six people, including a mother, her four young children and a family acquaintance, were found dead inside a townhouse in the south Ottawa suburb of Barrhaven on March 6. The woman\u2019s husband and father of the children remains in hospital.",
    "A 19-year-old man who was living with the family is in custody facing six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.",
    "According to police, they began receiving calls at 10:52 p.m. Wednesday and responded minutes later. In court, prosecutors said the accused was in custody around 11 p.m.",
    "The day after the tragedy, the Ottawa Police Service (OPS) called the killings a \u201cmass shooting\u201d when no guns were involved, repeatedly misspelled the victims\u2019 names and misidentified the accused.",
    "On Thursday morning during a live, nationally broadcast interview on CBC, OPS Chief Eric Stubbs mistakenly called the killings a \u201cmass shooting.\u201d",
    "During a news conference that afternoon, Stubbs misidentified the man in custody as \u201cFrank D\u2019Souza.\u201d Later that day Febrio De-Zoysa, a 19-year-old Sri Lankan national who had come to Canada as a student, was officially charged.",
    "After the news conference on Thursday, OPS issued five separate emails to correct the victims\u2019 names they\u2019d provided earlier that day.",
    "Their first attempt contained errors in three of the six names. The second email contained different errors in the same three names.",
    "A third email corrected two names and the age of a victim. After CBC flagged more errors, OPS replied with yet another correction. Then, at 3 p.m., they issued a final version.",
    "In a statement to CBC, OPS admitted the mistakes and said homicides are \u201cvery complex files to investigate and quickly evolving.\u201d",
    "In the case of the Barrhaven killings, police said there were \u201cmultiple credible sources consulted in the collating of names, and some information we received was wrong,\u201d OPS said.",
    "\u201cWe also made mistakes when we communicated key information about the tragic deaths. That is an inherent risk of the fast paced and timely communications we strive to deliver to Ottawa residents.\u201d",
    "The statement said responding officers and investigators diligently collect information in a process involving contacting \u201cmultiple sources, including involved persons (victims/suspects), witnesses, family members and of course official government/databases.\u201d",
    "\u201cErroneous information is sometimes communicated to police and we can also make mistakes when communicating with the community and media,\u201d OPS said. \u201cWhen that happens, we correct it as soon as possible.\u201d",
    "Christopher Schneider, a professor of criminology at Brandon University in Manitoba, said communications by Ottawa police were \u201cincredibly problematic\u201d in this case.",
    "\u201cOften one\u2019s competence is judged by their communicative performance,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cIf the police are not communicating effectively through traditional media, social media, with the community, that leads to the public perception of police incompetence.\u201d",
    "That in turn \u201ccould possibly extend to an erosion of confidence and trust in policing,\u201d he said.",
    "Schneider said ineffective communication from police is magnified when it involves immigrant, refugee and racialized communities, including Indigenous ones.",
    "\u201cThese community groups, they talk among themselves and they see this when it comes out in media, they see that the police are not effectively communicating in a tragic, outrageous circumstance like this,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThis leads to a continuing rotation and distrust in police and policing.\u201d",
    "Darryl Davies, a professor of criminology at Carleton University, said Ottawa police and other first responders would have faced \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d as they arrived at the crime scene.",
    "\u201cThat probably contributed to the lack of information and consistency of information that subsequently came out,\u201d Davies said, noting their priority would be locating victims and hunting for the suspect.",
    "\u201cThey were probably, understandably, totally caught off guard, and the shock and the horror of witnessing something like that would have unbelievable ramifications on the individuals who are there.\u201d",
    "Davies said that trauma \u201cprobably more than anything overshadowed any consistency or communication to the public, because it would have just been so horrific.\u201d",
    "He said even officers prepared with the best possible training would face a \u201chorrific challenge\u201d just trying to process the information.",
    "\u201cThe Ottawa police did the best they could under the circumstances, given the horrific nature of the events and how they unfolded.\u201d",
    "But Davies also said police need better training in communicating the details of such tragedies to the public.",
    "\u201cPolice as a whole need to have people who are specialized in communications. I think they should be trained in how to deal with these situations,\u201d he said."
