    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will have to manage and balance all the global powers to achieve its economic growth and thus the island nation\u2019s foreign policy should aim for economic diplomacy instead of political diplomacy, State Foreign Minister Tharaka Balasuriya said.",
    "Analysts say Sri Lanka has become the center of proxy geopolitical war between the country\u2019s neighbour India and the World\u2019s second largest economy China.",
    "China\u2019s increasing influence in Sri Lanka has raised security concerns to India and that has already led Colombo to suspend the arrival of Chinese research vessels to the island nation.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe government has promised a non-aligned foreign policy which was not followed by his predecessors. Successive Colombo governments\u2019 foreign policy had leaned towards either China or the West in the past.",
    "\u201cWe need to deal with everybody,\u201d Balasuriya told reporters last week when asked over the foreign policy on international issues like the war in Ukraine and Palestine.",
    "He said the country will strictly follow the non-aligned foreign policy.",
    "\u201cAs India being our neighbour, we have to make sure that India\u2019s security concerns are addressed. India is not the old India where they went and put dhal to Sri Lanka,\u201d he said referring to a 1987 Indian intervention in the Northern war zone.",
    "In June 1987,\u00a0Indian Air Force planes, escorted by fighter jets, flew over Sri Lanka and dropped nearly 25 tons of relief supplies including dhal to ethnic Tamil residents, which later led the then Sri Lankan government to suspend its military offensive against Tamil rebels in the region.",
    "The move came in defiance of Sri Lanka\u2019s refusal to accept a unilateral Indian aid mission to the Tamils, which Sri Lankan later protested as \u201ca naked violation of our sovereignty . . . and territorial integrity.\u201d",
    "However, India later assisted Sri Lanka along with other international powers to end a nearly three-decade war in 2009.",
    "\u201cIn two or three year time, India will be the third largest economy in the world. India has been a true friend. India stepped in when the IMF should have helped us, he said referring to a $4 billion assistance including an Indian credit line when Sri Lanka declared sovereign default in 2022.",
    "\u201cChina is a very important investment partner of Sri Lanka. We want to further deepen our relationship with China when it comes to investing in Sri Lanka. We want to align ourselves with the global supply chain.,\u201d he said.",
    "China became the island nation\u2019s top lender and foreign investor after the end of the war. However, the West later blamed China for dragging Sri Lanka into debt trap by lending for infrastructure projects which never gave Sri Lanka return on investment.",
    "\u201cWhen it comes to political matters such as the UN Human Rights Council, Russia and China have always backed Sri Lanka. So, we also have to reciprocate. If we don\u2019t reciprocate, other countries will not be backing us.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic location in the Asia Pacific region has attracted many world powers.",
    "Balasuriya said Sri Lanka must work closely with the Western powers like Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States as they are the island nation\u2019s biggest export markets.",
    "\u201cSo, we need to work closely with the European countries also and our values are very much in line with the European values when it comes to things like human rights, when it comes to things like democracy.\u201d",
    "He said most of the country\u2019s dollar remittances come from the Middle East while Sri Lanka wants to build relations with emerging regional powers like Indonesia, Iran, and Nigeria as well as with African countries.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka as a small country does not have global political ambitions. We are not going to invade a country,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSo, our foreign policy should be based on making sure that Sri Lanka achieves economic growth. We want to shift our foreign policy more towards economic diplomacy than towards political diplomacy.\u201d (Colombo/Feb 05/2024)"
