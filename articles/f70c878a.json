  "original_body_lines": [
    "A full-scale Israeli military operation in Rafah would deliver a death blow to aid programs in Gaza, where humanitarian assistance remains \u201ccompletely insufficient,\u201d the UN chief warned Monday.",
    "Speaking before the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Antonio Guterres said that Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, where more than 1.4 million Palestinians are crowded together in tent cities, was \u201cthe core of the humanitarian aid operation\u201d in the Palestinian territory.",
    "\u201cAn all-out Israeli offensive on the city would not only be terrifying for more than a million Palestinian civilians sheltering there; it would put the final nail in the coffin of our aid programs,\u201d he said.",
    "His comments came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday reiterated that his country was intent on a ground invasion in Rafah, in its bid for \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas, whose October 7 attack triggered the war.",
    "He said that once a ground invasion happens, victory would be just \u201cweeks away,\u201d and that a potential ceasefire, being discussed in Doha, would only delay the operation.",
    "The war that has been raging for more than four months broke out after Hamas\u2019s unprecedented October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.",
    "Hamas militants also took about 250 Israeli and foreign hostages, 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 31 presumed dead, according to Israel.",
    "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 29,692 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest tally issued Sunday by the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.",
    "Guterres stressed Monday that \u201cnothing can justify Hamas\u2019s deliberate killing, injuring, torturing and kidnapping of civilians, the use of sexual violence -- or the indiscriminate launching of rockets towards Israel.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people,\u201d he said.",
    "Amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis, UNRWA, the main UN aid agency for Palestinians, has urged political action to avert famine in Gaza.",
    "But Guterres stressed that \u201chumanitarian aid is still completely insufficient.\u201d",
    "\u201cI repeat my call for a humanitarian ceasefire and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages,\u201d he said.",
    "He lamented that despite his urgent calls for the UN Security Council to take all measures to \u201cend the bloodshed in Gaza and prevent escalation,\u201d it had failed to act.",
    "As one of five permanent members of the 15-member council, the United States -- Israel\u2019s biggest ally -- has a veto that it has wielded three times so far to bar the body from calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.",
    "Guterres warned of the consequences of the council\u2019s lack of action on Gaza, and its failure, due to a Russian veto, to act on the war in Ukraine.",
    "This inaction \u201chas severely -- perhaps fatally -- undermined its authority,\u201d he cautioned.",
    "\u201cThe council needs serious reform to its composition and working methods.\u201d"
