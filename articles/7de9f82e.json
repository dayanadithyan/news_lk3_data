    "Kenya\u2019s President William Ruto says he will withdraw a finance bill containing controversial tax hikes after deadly protests which saw parliament set ablaze on Tuesday.",
    "In an address to the nation, he said it was clear that Kenyans \u201cwant nothing\u201d to do with the bill.",
    "\u201cI concede,\u201d he said, adding that he would not sign the bill into law.",
    "At least 22 people were killed in Tuesday\u2019s protests, according to the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNHRC).",
    "Mr Ruto said he would now enter into dialogue with the young people, who were at the forefront of the biggest protests to hit the country since he was elected in 2022.",
    "The bill was passed by parliament on Tuesday, despite nationwide demonstrations against it.",
    "Protesters broke into parliament, vandalising the interior and setting parts of the complex on fire. The ceremonial mace, symbolising the authority of the legislature, was stolen.",
    "He ordered the military to be deployed, saying \u201cviolence and anarchy\u201d would not be tolerated.",
    "But he climbed down on Wednesday, following an extraordinary demonstration of people power.",
    "\u201cRuto bows to Gen Z pressure, withdraws Finance Bill,\u201d read the headline on Kenya\u2019s Citizen TV.",
    "In his second address to the nation in less than 24 hours, Mr Ruto laid out a very clear rationale for why he thought the tax increases were necessary.",
    "The proposed legislation was part of efforts to cut the country\u2019s massive debt burden of more than $80bn (\u00a363bn), which costs the country more than half of its annual tax revenues to service.",
    "Mr Ruto added that his government had made progress and was on course to \u201cassert sovereignty\u201d by repaying its debts.",
    "He said the provisions would have benefitted farmers, students and teachers, but he admitted the people were not behind him.",
    "\u201cI also lead people,\u201d he said, \u201cand the people have spoken.\u201d",
    "It is unclear clear how his climbdown will affect plans to resume the protests, which have largely been organised via social media, on Thursday.",
    "Chatter on social media suggested that it would still go ahead.",
    "The stated purpose of the demonstrations was to force the president not to sign the bill.",
    "But the protesters have begun demanding that he step down, with the slogan \u201cRuto must go.\u201d",
    "Mr Ruto rose to the presidency after defeating his main rival Raila Odinga by a narrow margin in the 2022 election.",
    "Mr Ruto won after portraying himself as a \u201chustler\u201d who was challenging an attempt by two dynasties - the Odingas and Kenyattas - to hang on to power.",
    "He promised a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach to the economy to tackle the high unemployment rate among young people, and to improve the lives of those less well off."
