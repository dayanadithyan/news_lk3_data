    "A momentous event to mark this historic occasion was held at the Sri Lanka Insurance head office on Feb 1, following traditional Sri Lankan customs. At the ceremony, the Chairman of Sri Lanka Insurance President Counsel Ronald C Perera presented the business registrations to the Group CEO Chandana L Aluthgama, symbolizing the establishment of two distinct entities: Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Life Limited and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation General Limited.",

    "Chandana L. Aluthgama, Group Chief Executive Officer of Sri Lanka Insurance stated, \u201ceven though the legal segregation commenced on Feb 1 the Life and General business of SLIC has functioned as distinctive entities with its separate profit and loss statements, financial operations, and strategic focuses.
