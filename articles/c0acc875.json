    "PARIS (AP) \u2014 President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the lower house of France\u2019s parliament in a surprise announcement sending voters back to the polls in the coming weeks to choose lawmakers, after his party was handed a humbling defeat by the far-right in the European elections Sunday.",
    "The legislative elections will take place in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.",
    "The announcement came after the first projected results from France put the far-right National Rally party well ahead in the European Union\u2019s parliamentary elections, handing a chastening loss to Macron\u2019s pro-European centrists, according to French opinion poll institutes.",
    "Marine Le Pen\u2019s anti-immigration, nationalist party was estimated to get around 31%-32% of the votes, a historic result more than double the share of Macron\u2019s Renaissance party, which was projected to reach around 15%.",
    "Macron himself wasn\u2019t a candidate in the EU elections and his term as president still runs for three more years.",
    "He said the decision was \u201cserious\u201d but showed his \u201cconfidence in our democracy, in letting the sovereign people have their say.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn the next few days, I\u2019ll be saying what I think is the right direction for the nation. I\u2019ve heard your message, your concerns, and I won\u2019t leave them unanswered,\u201d he said."
