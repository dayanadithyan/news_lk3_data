  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s government will no longer earn 50 dollars from a tourist visa but 20 percent would to VFS Global, a private contractor hired without tender to run an electronic visa website, opposition legislator S M Marikkar charged.",
    "Sri Lanka jacked up the price of a standard visa, which was double entry, to 75 dollars from 50 dollars with the advent of the VFS deal, and the firm\u2019s own charges pushed up the cost to 100.77 dollars shocking tourists.",
    "Following intervention by Tourism Minister Harin Fernando, a new single-entry visa was promised for 50 collars.",
    "But an opposition legislator alleged that Sri Lanka would lose 10 dollars out of 50 dollars to VFS Global group and the contract was still in place.",
    "\u201cThe government has thrown sand on the face of the people (mooneter weli gahala), trying to convince everyone that things are back to normal now that a 50 dollar visa is now available,\u201d Marikkar charged in pithy Sinhalese.",
    "\u201cDoesn\u2019t\u2019 10 dollars from that go to the company? Someone should make that clear.",
    "\u201cWe will continue fight against this robbery,\u201d Marikkar said. \u201cWe will expose more details relating to this robbery.\u201d",
    "Under the original deal IVS-GBS-VFS Global, the private contractor stood to make 841 dollars over a 10-year contract period, he said",
    "Discussions on travel forums like Tripadvisor.com showed that tourists who were finding it difficult to fill out the forms in the VFS Global website were opting to get a visa on arrival at the airport. Older tourists were having a specially hard time.",
    "Sri Lanka earlier had a website which was widely acclaimed by tourists and travel portals like Lonely Planet and Tripadvisor as perhaps the best or one of the most user friendly e-visa site in the world."
