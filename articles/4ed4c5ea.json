    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Businessman Dhammika Perera has said it is up to the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) to decide who its presidential candidate should be and, until such time, he would continue his campaigning.",
    "Speaking to reporters at an SLPP event, Perera said 44 percent of the country have yet to decide whom to vote for.",
    "\u201cNo matter how big anyone talks on stage, no one talks about\u00a0 how to develop the economy. I\u2019m ready for the presidential election, but Sri Lanka\u2019s biggest political party should decide who the candidate should be. I\u2019m watching and waiting. Until then I\u2019m doing what needs to be done to win the election,\u201d said Perera.",
    "\u201cBesides that, the biggest thing I have to do is, if I get on stage, I have to talk about developing the economy. I\u2019m formulating that programme now. It is up to the SLPP to decide who will contest,\u201d he said.",
    "The business tycoon said that he has already finalised his programme for education reforms.",
    "\u201cFor us, 60 days will be enough to explain how to develop the economy and get the undecided voters to this side as well. I\u2019m an SLPP member and an SLPP MP. I have fulfilled all obligations,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile, SLPP leader and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa told reporters that the party has yet to decide on whether or not to field its own candidate at the presidential election.",
    "\u201cAs a party we still haven\u2019t discussed together. There is time. We\u2019re discussing the candidate. We have not decided yet on whether to field a candidate or not. We\u2019ll do it on time,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jul05/2024)"
