    "Ukraine\u2019s prime minister has told the BBC there will be a \u201cThird World War\u201d if Ukraine loses its conflict with Russia, as he urged the US Congress to pass a long-stalled foreign aid bill.",

    "\u201cIf we will not protect... Ukraine will fall,\u201d he added. \u201cSo the global, the global system of security will be destroyed... and all the world will need to find... a new system of security.",
    "\u201cOr, there will be many conflicts, many such kinds of wars, and in the end of the day, it could lead to the Third World War.\u201d",

    "Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Russia won the conflict, it could next invade Poland, triggering World War Three.",

    "Months of congressional impasse have already had profound effects on the battlefield.",
    "Ukraine has found itself outmanned and outgunned and forced into retreat because of ammunition rationing and falling morale.",
    "In February, it retreated from Avdiivka, a town near occupied Donetsk that it had held since the conflict began in 2014.",
    "Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a general overseeing the withdrawal, cited a 10-to-one artillery ammunition advantage for his enemies and said pulling back after months of fighting was \u201cthe only correct solution\u201d.",
    "President Zelensky blamed an \u201cartificial deficit of weapons\u201d as he made urgent appeals for more military aid to avoid a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d situation.",

    "General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UK\u2019s Joint Forces Command, recently stated he feared that Ukraine could face defeat this year unless it was given the weapons and ammunition it needed to secure its lines.",
    "\u201cWe are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cUkraine may come to feel it can\u2019t win. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die?\u201d",
    "Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battles but mounting casualties have left Ukraine, unlike Russia, with a shortage of manpower.",
    "The government earlier this month lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 in an effort to raise hundreds of thousands of new recruits.",
    "President Zelensky has said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 2022. US officials, however, believe at least 70,000 have died and many more are injured.",
    "A BBC investigation calculates that at least 50,000 Russian troops have been killed. Tens of thousands are believed to have been injured.",
