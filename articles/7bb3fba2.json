    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is looking to establish a public private partnership at the National Ayurveda Teaching Hospital located at Cotta Road, Borella due to a lack of funds, State Minister of Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody, has said.",
    "\u201cWe have 180 rooms in Borella and we wish to go for a private-public partnership. However, there is a political party \u2013 trade union that does not let us sign such an agreement,\u201d Jayakody said on Thursday.",
    "In the past, staff have protested saying the understaffing made it almost impossible to function. They also said the hospital lacked funds to provide medicines, and meals for patients who were admitted there.",
    "\u201cThere are a lot of shortages. This is why we want to have paying wards,\u201d Jayakody said. \u201cSick people are willing to pay.\u201d",
    "Jayakody said that Western medical services receive the majority of government funding with Ayurveda medicine receiving only 2 percent of funding. (Colombo/Apr5/2024)"
