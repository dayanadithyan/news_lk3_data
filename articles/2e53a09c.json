    "Sabry addressed the high-level segment of the 55th Session of the Council through a pre-recorded video statement on  Tuesday.",
    "\u201cIn my address to HRC55 via a video message, I underlined Sri Lanka\u2019s continuing focus and tangible steps taken in the interest of national unity and reconciliation, reaffirmed Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to engaging in constructive Human Rights processes while rejecting politicized and unilateral measures that infringe upon the sovereignty of Member States,\u201d Sabry said on X (twitter).",
    "\u201cI stressed the fact that the  manner in which the Council approaches the humanitarian crisis in Gaza will be a litmus test to its credibility as the foremost international human rights body, and reiterated the importance of avoiding double standards being practiced in the pursuit of political agendas.\u201d",
    "The Foreign Minister reiterated Sri Lanka\u2019s rejection of the HRC resolutions 46/1 and 51/1 and the external evidence gathering mechanism established by these resolutions, saying that such mechanisms are counterproductive, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.",
