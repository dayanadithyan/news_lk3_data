    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The Maldives could take reciprocal action after Sri Lanka\u2019s new system of outsourcing its visas, which requires the payment of \u201cprocessing\u201d and \u201cconvenience\u201d charges of 26 dollars, even though the government does not collect any fees.",
    "Maldivian authorities have reminded Sri Lanka of the long-standing bilateral agreement under which their citizens could travel freely between the two neighbours without any charges or bureaucratic barriers.",
    "Maldivians, who consider Sri Lanka their second home, often spend more than a month in the larger country, but are now required to pay 26 dollars to VFS Global, which has controversially been contracted to handle Sri Lankan visas.",
    "\u201cThe Sri Lankan government will not charge a fee, but Maldivians still have to pay VFS after applying online for a visa,\u201d a Maldivian government official said in the capital, Male. \u201cThis violates the spirit of our agreement.\u201d",
    "He said the new administration of President Mohamed Muizzu was taking up the issue with Sri Lankan authorities in both Male and Colombo.",
    "In a worst-case scenario, the Maldives will be compelled to reciprocate the new cost of a Sri Lankan visa and charge Sri Lankans traveling to the archipelago. There are also expat Sri Lankans in the Maldives.",
    "There are only a handful of countries to which Sri Lankan passport holders can travel without any visa restrictions.",
    "Singapore is another country which could take action against Sri Lanka if the bilateral deal is found to be violated, according a source said.",
    "Opposition parties have said in parliament that outsourcing the visa handling to VFS Global and their partners was a bigger corruption scandal than the bond scam of 2015 and 2016, when billions of rupees were stolen through insider deals. (COLOMBO/May 28, 2024)"
