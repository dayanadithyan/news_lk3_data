    "Four officers were fatally shot as a U.S. marshals task force was serving a warrant at a home Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina, officials said. A suspected shooter was also dead.",
    "A marshal and two local officers working with the fugitive task force were killed in the gunfire around 1:30 p.m. Gov. Roy Cooper said that \u2018two state Department of Adult Correction officers\u2019 had died.",
    "The city\u2019s police chief announced Monday night that a Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer who had been wounded, Joshua Eyer, had also died.",
    "\u2018It was just last month I was in this very room congratulating Officer Eyer for becoming officer of the month in April,\u2019 Police Chief Johnny Jennings said. \u2018And he certainly dedicated his life and gave his life to serve our citizens.\u2019",
    "The secretary of the state Adult Corrections Department identified two of the other people killed as Samuel Poloche and William \u2018Alden\u2019 Elliott, both of whom had been with the department for 14 years and were on the marshals task force.",
    "The deadly violence happened as a fugitive task force was serving a warrant on a suspect in possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.",
    "Jennings said the fallen officers were \u2018heroes that were just simply trying to keep our community safe.\u2019",
    "As the task force attempted to serve the warrant, the subject of the warrant, who was not publicly identified, began shooting with a high-powered rifle, Jennings said. Task force members returned fire and killed the suspect in the home\u2019s front yard, he said.",
    "A Charlotte-Mecklenburg police sergeant was on the task force but was not struck by gunfire, Jennings said. The sergeant called for backup, and that\u2019s when the four responding Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers were shot, Jennings said.",
    "Police were eventually able to clear the home, Jennings said. Two people inside, one of them 17 years old, were detained as persons of interest.",
    "Officials believe two people fired at law enforcement, Jennings said.",
    "Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, who spoke at Monday\u2019s news conference, said the community must honor the deputy marshals who lost their lives and the wounded officers.",
    "\u2018These are people that cared deeply about what they\u2019ve done for our profession, and now today, we have to say to them how much we are grateful for what they have done,\u2019 Lyles said. \u2018Three people lost their lives today. And the most I can ask the community is that we honor and respect them for all the work they\u2019ve done.\u2019",
    "Cooper, the governor, called the incident \u2018tragic\u2019 and said the state is offering assistance.",
    "He later offered his condolences to the families and co-workers in the \u2018brutal attack.\u2019",
    "President Joe Biden said Monday night of the slain officers: \u2018They are heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice, rushing into harm\u2019s way to protect us.\u2019",
    "\u2018We mourn for them and their loved ones. And we pray for the recoveries of the courageous officers who were wounded,\u2019 the president said in a statement. He also called for more funding for law enforcement and for Congress to do more to combat gun violence.",
    "Eyer, the CMPD officer whose death was announced Monday night, is survived by his wife and a 3-year-old son, the police chief said.",
    "Poloche is survived by a wife and two children, and Elliot and his wife were parents to one child, state Adult Correction Secretary Todd Ishee said in a statement."
