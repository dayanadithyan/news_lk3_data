    "Marking a significant milestone in the history of Sri Lanka\u2019s plantation sector, the Planters\u2019 Association of Ceylon (PA) will host its 170th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Saturday, 14 September at 7 p.m. at the Galadari Hotel, Colombo.",
    "Hayleys PLC Chairman and Chief Executive Mohan Pandithage will preside over this prestigious occasion as the Chief Guest, addressing key stakeholders in the industry.",
    "The AGM will also witness the appointment of the Chairman and Executive Committee for the 2024/2025 term who will steer the Association and the plantation sector through the next phase of its journey, playing a pivotal role in supporting the industry\u2019s progress amid evolving challenges. The AGM serves as a key event in the Association\u2019s illustrious history of unwavering service to Sri Lanka\u2019s plantation industry. Established in 1854, the PA being one of the oldest and most prestigious institutions in the country, has continuously represented and safeguarded the interests of the plantation community. This year\u2019s AGM is expected to reflect on the Association\u2019s legacy while charting the future course for the sector in the coming year.",
    "As one of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest foreign exchange earners, the plantation industry, primarily known for its globally renowned Pure Ceylon Tea, also includes other key crops such as rubber, coconut, spices, and palm oil. The sector plays an instrumental role in Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, not only through exports but also by providing employment to approximately 125,000 individuals in Regional Plantation Company (RPC) estates and supporting nearly 1 million people residing in plantation communities.",
    "Since privatisation in 1992, Sri Lanka\u2019s plantation industry has undergone major transformations, with RPCs leading the charge in crop diversification, environmental sustainability, and worker welfare. The privatised management has significantly increased the industry\u2019s operational efficiency, reducing the Government\u2019s financial burden while contributing substantially to national economic growth. As the Association looks forward, the focus remains on productivity enhancements and innovative diversification strategies, whilst highlighting the industry\u2019s continued commitment to ethical practices and sustainable growth that have allowed Sri Lanka\u2019s plantation products to be recognised globally for their premium quality."
