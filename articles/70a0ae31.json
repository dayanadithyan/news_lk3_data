    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013\u00a0The United States government on Thursday (25th) expressed its concern over the controversial Online Safety Bill that was passed by parliament on Wednesday.",
    "US Ambassador Julie Chung, in a message on X (formerly Twitter) said: \u201cThe United States remains concerned about the potential impact of Sri Lanka\u2019s Online Safety Bill, which passed yesterday without incorporating important input from key stakeholders, including civil society and tech companies who say that this legislation threatens freedom of expression, innovation, and privacy. In addition to jeopardizing democratic values, vague and overly restrictive legislation can hinder investment and the development of a digital economy, undermining the economic growth that Sri Lanka needs. The U.S. urges Sri Lanka to prioritize transparency and ensure any legislation does not stifle the voices of its people.\u201d",
    "The bill was roundly cricitised by free speech advocates, as well as opposition lawmakers. The world's major internet and social media companies also warned of the detrimental effects of the new law.",
