  "original_body_lines": [
    "Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected Hamas\u2019s proposed ceasefire terms - saying \u201ctotal victory\u201d in Gaza is possible within months.",
    "He was speaking after Hamas laid out a series of demands in response to an Israel-backed ceasefire proposal.",
    "Mr Netanyahu said negotiations with the group were \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d and described their terms as \u201cbizarre\u201d.",
    "\u201cThere is no other solution but a complete and final victory,\u201d Mr Netanyahu told a news conference on Wednesday.",
    "\u201cIf Hamas will survive in Gaza, it\u2019s only a question of time until the next massacre.\u201d",
    "Israel was expected to take issue with Hamas\u2019s counter-offer, but this response is a categorical rebuke, and Israeli officials clearly see an effort by Hamas to end the war on its terms as utterly unacceptable.",
    "Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told the Reuters news agency that Mr Netanyahu\u2019s remarks \u201care a form of political bravado\u201d, and show he intends to pursue the conflict in the region.",
    "An Egyptian official source told the BBC that a new round of negotiations, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, is still expected to go ahead on Thursday in Cairo.",
    "Egypt has called on all parties to show the necessary flexibility to reach a calm agreement, the source said.",
    "And Mr Netanyahu\u2019s rejection of a \u201cdelusional\u201d plan are in stark contrast to remarks from Qatar, which described Hamas\u2019s response as \u201cpositive\u201d.",
    "Hamas put forward its counter-offer to a ceasefire proposal on Tuesday.",
    "A draft of the Hamas document seen by Reuters news agency listed these terms:",
    "\u2022 Phase one: A 45-day pause in fighting during which all Israeli women hostages, males under 19, the elderly and sick would be exchanged for Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza, and the reconstruction of hospitals and refugee camps would begin.",
    "\u2022 Phase two: Remaining male Israeli hostages would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and Israeli forces leave Gaza completely.",
    "\u2022 Phase three: Both sides would exchange remains and bodies.",
    "The proposed deal would also see deliveries of food and other aid to Gaza increase. By the end of the 135-day pause in fighting, Hamas said negotiations to end the war would have concluded.",
    "Around 1,300 people were killed during the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October last year.",
    "More than 27,700 Palestinians have been killed and at least 65,000 injured by the war launched by Israel in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "Mr Netanyahu also confirmed on Wednesday that Israeli forces have been ordered to prepare to operate in the southern Gaza city of Rafah - where tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled in order to escape the fighting.",
    "Expanding the conflict into Rafah would \u201cexponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare\u201d in the city, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned.",
    "\u201cWe are afraid of the invasion of Rafah,\u201d one displaced person at the Rafah Crossing, near the border with Egypt, told BBC Arabic.",
    "\u201cWe sleep in fear and sit with fear. There is no food, and the weather is cold.\u201d",
    "The Israeli leader\u2019s comments are a blow to a sustained push by the US to reach a deal that its top diplomat, Antony Blinken, described as \u201cthe best path forward\u201d - even though he cautioned there was \u201cstill a lot of work to be done\u201d.",
    "During a news conference on Wednesday, Mr Blinken said there were \u201csome clear non-starters\u201d in Hamas\u2019 counter-proposal. But, he added: \u201cWe do think it creates space for an agreement to be reached, and we will work at that relentlessly till we get there.\u201d",
    "Sharone Lifshitz, whose parents were among those kidnapped in southern Israel on 7 October and taken to Gaza, told the BBC\u2019s Newshour programme that Mr Netanyahu\u2019s rejection of the Hamas ceasefire terms was \u201calmost certainly a death sentence to more hostages\u201d.",
    "Ms Lifshitz\u2019s 85-year-old mother, Yocheved, was subsequently released but her father, Oded, remains in captivity.",
    "\u201cMy own father is 83, he\u2019s frail, he cannot last longer,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know if the prime minister thinks about him, or if he already accounts for him as somebody who would return in a coffin.\u201d",
    "Mr Netanyahu\u2019s stance also highlights the continuing, fundamental mismatch between the US and Israel\u2019s plans for Gaza\u2019s future.",
    "He is insisting on an entity where Israel maintains overall security control, and Gaza is run by local bodies with no connection to Hamas or any other group.",
    "Washington\u2019s vision of the future includes a horizon with a Palestinian state.",
    "The urgent question now is whether something can be salvaged to keep these talks going to achieve another exchange of hostages and prisoners, and a desperately needed humanitarian pause, to allow more aid into the Gaza Strip."
