    "Sri Lanka and Iran will sign five Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) today, in a bid to bolster the bilateral relations between the two nations.",
    "The signing of the agreements will coincide with the one-day visit of Iranian President Dr. Ebrahim Raisi, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) said.",
    "The Iranian president is set to arrive in Sri Lanka today after wrapping up his three-day visit to neighbouring Pakistan. This is the first visit of an Iranian President to Sri Lanka since former President Dr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s visit in April 2008.",
    "During his brief visit to the island nation, Dr. Raisi, together with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, will participate in a public ceremony to mark the inauguration of the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project (UOMDP).",
    "Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Police has implemented special traffic plans in Colombo and Mattala ahead of the Iranian president\u2019s arrival. The vehicular movement will be restricted on many roads including the Colombo-Katunayake expressway and the main road from Mattala to Uma Oya.",
    "UOMDP, following the Mahaweli Development Project, is one of the largest irrigation projects in Sri Lanka. Its primary objective is to alleviate water scarcity in the southeastern dry region of the country by redirecting an annual average of 145 million cubic meters (MCM) of excess water from the Uma Oya basin to the Kirindi Oya basin, the PMD said."
