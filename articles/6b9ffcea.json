    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Operations at the Jaya Container Terminal in Colombo Port were partially disrupted last morning as employees staged a protest against the recent appointment of eight women as trainee gantry crane operators.",
    "The workers, represented by the All Ceylon General Port Employee Union, allege that these appointments were politically motivated and bypassed established recruitment procedures.",
    "The protest involved employees abstaining from their duties for approximately an hour, causing minor delays in terminal operations.",
    "The All Ceylon General Port Employee Union General Secretary, Niroshan Gorakane, emphasized their stance at a press conference, stating, \"We say that the port should recruit fairly. What we are saying is that you should not choose one area and do it for political interests.\"",
    "Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva, defended the appointments, citing a World Labor Organization (ILO) project aimed at promoting gender equality in the workplace through skills development for women.",
    "Minister de Silva expressed his disappointment with the trade union stance, stating, \"This is very tragic. This is how we treat women in this country. I decided to train them against this unfair trade union action.\"",
