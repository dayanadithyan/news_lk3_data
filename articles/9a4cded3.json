    "Colombo, May 9 (Daily Mirror) - Another court case with regard to Diana Gamage is on the cards as anyone could file another court case calling the Supreme Court to declare whether Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MPs could remain in Parliament as per yesterday\u2019s judgement, Minister Kanchana Wijesekera told Parliament yesterday.",
    "\u201cOne could question whether Gamage who has been declared as a non-citizen of this country could register a political party. One could also question whether the MOU signed by SJB General Secretary with Ms.Gamage is legally valid.",
    "Further the validity of nomination papers signed by Gamage for certain MPs is also questionable,\u201d the Minister said.",
    "\u201cSome SJB MPs whom I chatted with at the House canteen informed me that they were worried about yesterday\u2019s judgment of the Supreme Courts which ruled that Gamage cannot function as an MP as she is not a citizen of Sri Lanka.",
    "They are concerned since they may have to give up their MP posts,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cBe prepared for a legal battle to save your MP posts,\u201d he told SJB MPs",
    "SJB MP Thushara Indunil who responded said there won\u2019t be any question on MP posts of his group as the Supreme Court in 2020 had held that Ms. Gamage has nothing to do with the SJB. \u201cThis verdict was given by the UNP led by Ranil Wickremesinghe when they filed a petition requesting the courts to cancel nominations of SJBers just before the 2020 general elections,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBesides Ms. Gamage has not signed our nomination papers therefore there will not be any issue,\u201d he added."
