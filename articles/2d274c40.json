    "In his Vesak message, the President said, \"We must remember the advice of Lord Buddha, 'Sabbattha Sammanaso' to treat everyone equally and ensure we put it into practice as a country. This is the greatest offering we can present to the Buddha on this Vesak day.",
    "\"The Vesak festival is a profoundly sacred day for Buddhists worldwide, commemorating the Buddha\u2019s birth, enlightenment and passing away.",
    "Buddhists in Sri Lanka, along with their brethren around the globe, celebrate Vesak with deep devotion. They spend this period engaging in religious observances and venerating the Buddha with fervent devotion.",
    "\"At this challenging moment, we as a nation should cultivate the same great zeal for enlightenment that Buddha exemplified, inspired by his sermon, 'Maththasukha parichchaga- pass\u00e9 che vipulan sukhan' \u2013 to sacrifice today for a better tomorrow.",
    "\"The principles of Lichchavi Raja Dharmaya will guide us in this endeavour.",
