    "The United Nations has found \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to conclude that Hamas committed sexual violence during its Oct. 7 attack in Israel, and said there are indications such violence continues to be carried out against those being held hostage by the group.",
    "A UN team that investigated the allegations against Hamas, which is designated a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, received what it called \u201cclear and convincing information\u201d that women and children held in captivity were subjected to rape, torture and inhumane treatment.",
    "The team reviewed more than 5,000 photos and 50 hours of footage of the attacks, as well as conducting interviews with dozens of Israeli officials. It said the true prevalence of sexual violence during the attack and afterward \u201cmay take months or years to emerge and may never be fully known.\u201d",
    "\u201cAcross the various locations of the 7 October attacks, the mission team found that several fully naked or partially naked bodies from the waist down were recovered \u2014 mostly women \u2014 with hands tied and shot multiple times, often in the head,\u201d according to the report Monday led by Pramila Patten, the UN\u2019s special representative on sexual violence in conflict. \u201cAlthough circumstantial, such a pattern of undressing and restraining of victims may be indicative of some forms of sexual violence.\u201d",
    "Regarding hostages, the mission team said it \u201cfound clear and convincing information that some have been subjected to various forms of conflict-related sexual violence including rape and sexualized torture. It also has reasonable grounds to believe that such violence may be ongoing.\u201d",
    "Negotiations for a cease-fire in exchange for the release of some of the hostages have bogged down, putting a damper on hopes for an imminent deal. The war erupted when Hamas, an Iran-backed group, rampaged through southern Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 and capturing 250. More than 30,000 have been killed in the Gaza Strip by Israel\u2019s retaliatory air and ground assault, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "Patten and her team of technical experts visited Israel and the West Bank for two weeks starting Jan. 29. The UN mission didn\u2019t request to visit the Gaza Strip, where several other UN entities operate but did receive information alleging forms of sexual violence against Palestinians by Israel \u201cin detention settings, during house raids and at checkpoints,\u201d according to the report. It said it hasn\u2019t verified those claims.",
    "A separate report by the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel found last month that the sexual violence committed by Hamas was systematic and deliberate, and not a \u201cmalfunction\u201d or an isolated incident.",
    "Hamas\u2019 practices were \u201cdesigned to destroy and inflict sadistic terror,\u201d author Carmit Klar-Chalamish wrote in the report. \u201cThe manner in which these assaults were carried out aimed to reinforce their impact on the victims and their communities.\u201d"
