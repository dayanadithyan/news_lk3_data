    "Vinivida Foundation\u2019s secretary Attorney-at-Law Nagananda Kodituwakku has put forward the motion pertaining to a petition filed against the Election Commission\u2019s decision to reject the registration of \u2018Vinivida Foundation\u2019 as a political party.",
    "Kodituwakku claims that the registration of NPP, which is part of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), as a political party is completely against the law.",
    "Pursuant to Article 103(2) of the Constitution, registering different branches of one party as separate political parties is in violation of the election laws, he alleges.",
    "It also violates the right to free and fair elections guaranteed by the Constitution, Kodituwakku pointed out further, seeking permission from the Supreme Court to make submissions in this regard."
