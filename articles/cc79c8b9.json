    "Notorious underworld figure Nadun Chithaka Wickremeratne, alias \u2018Harak Kata\u2019, has been further remanded until 26 April over his failed escape attempt from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).",
    "The relevant order was issued by the Colombo High Court Judge Damith Thotawatte.",
    "Accordingly, \u2018Harak Kata\u2019 will be detained at the old prison complex in Tangalle, which currently operates as a detention centre.",
    "Earlier today (11 March), \u2018Harak Kata\u2019 was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate\u2019s Court, after which he was produced before the Colombo High Court following a request made by the CID.",
    "On 10 September 2023, \u2018Harak Kata\u2019, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers, had reportedly laced the officers\u2019 teas with poison during his questioning, with the help of a Police Constable.",
    "During the questioning, \u201cHarak Kata\u201d had allegedly requested to go to the washroom and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his accomplice \u2013 the police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspect\u2019s protection.",
    "Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officer\u2019s firearm leading to a scuffle.",
    "A group of other CID officers were quick to arrive at the scene, upon hearing the commotion and managed to detain \u201cHarak Kata\u201d in their custody."
