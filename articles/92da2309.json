  "original_body_lines": [
    "Russia has listed Estonia\u2019s Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, a staunch backer of Ukraine, as a \u2018wanted\u2019 person.",
    "According to the Russian Interior Ministry\u2019s database, Kallas is now wanted in connection with criminal charges, along with Estonian State Secretary Taimar Peterkop and Lithuanian Culture Minister Simonas Kairys.",
    "The Interior Ministry did not initially specify which charges they faced.",
    "But later, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Kallas and the other two Baltic ministers had been designated as wanted due to alleged \u201cdesecration of historical memory.\u201d",
    "The charges specifically relate to the \u201cdestroying monuments of Soviet soldiers,\u201d according to a source cited by the Russian state-owned TASS agency.",
    "\u201cThis is yet more proof that I am doing the right thing - the EU\u2019s strong support to Ukraine is a success and it hurts Russia,\u201d she wrote on X on Tuesday.",
    "\u201cThe Kremlin now hopes this move will help to silence me and others \u2013 but it won\u2019t,\u201d Kallas added. \u201cThe opposite. I will continue my strong support to Ukraine. I will continue to stand for increasing Europe\u2019s defense.\u201d",
    "Putting Estonia\u2019s leader on the wanted list marks a further escalation in tensions between Russia and the West.",
    "Kallas is considered one of Ukraine\u2019s staunchest allies in the 27-country EU bloc.",
    "She has consistently called for scaling up military support to Ukraine and suffocating Russia with further sanctions.",
    "Turmoil hit Kallas in August 2023 after it was revealed her husband\u2019s company was continuing to operate in Russia.",
    "Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez took to social media to tell Kallas that \u201cthe Spanish people and Europe\u201d stood behind her.",
    "\u201cPutin\u2019s move is another proof of your courage and Estonia\u2019s leadership in defending democracy and freedom,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
    "The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, also shared a message of solidarity.",
    "\u201cKaja Kallas, you can wear this listing on Russia\u2019s \u201cwanted\u201d list as a badge of honour for your relentless defense of the values and principles on which the European Union was founded,\u201d he said on X.",
    "\u201cWe will not be intimidated by the Kremlin\u2019s warmongering. A****nd we stand with you in solidarity,\u201d Michel continued.",
    "During a summit of EU leaders in February, Kallas called on countries to do more to provide Kyiv with the ammunition it needs to withstand Russia\u2019s offensive.",
    "She said that the EU\u2019s failure to hit its target of providing Ukraine with one million rounds of artillery within a year was a \u201cwake up call to do more.\u201d",
    "Just months after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Kallas announced her government would remove up to 400 Soviet monuments from public spaces.",
    "In August, Estonia removed a Soviet tank from the city of Narva, near the Russian border."
