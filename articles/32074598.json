  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Fitch Ratings has confirmed an \u2018A(lka)\u2019 rating of state-run People\u2019s Bank, saying the economic environment has stabilized, bad loans has reduced, but it has large exposures to the government and a public utility.",
    "However, Peoples\u2019 Bank only had a small exposure to defaulted sovereign dollar bonds.",
    "\u201cPB\u2019s large exposure \u2013 estimated at around 60 percent of assets \u2013 to the sovereign\u2019s fragile credit profile continues to weigh on the bank\u2019s risk profile assessment,\u201d Fitch said.",
    "\u201cThis includes credit extended to a state-owned entity that has been transferred to the government since end-2022 and its modest holding of defaulted sovereign bonds (1 percent of assets), which are presently under restructuring negotiations.",
    "\u201cThese exposures have made the bank vulnerable to the sovereign\u2019s repayment capacity and liquidity position.\u201d",
    "The bank\u2019s core asset quality metric \u2013 impaired (stage 3) loans ratio had improved through focused recoveries to 15.4 percent by end- 2023, down from 17.4 percent in 2022.",
    "The ratio would be significantly higher if PB\u2019s foreign-currency loan exposure to the state and state-owned entities is included, Fitch said.",
    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 06 Jun 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the National LongTerm Rating on People\u2019s Bank (Sri Lanka) (PB) at \u2018A(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable.",
    "Intrinsic Profile Drives Rating: PB\u2019s National Long-Term Rating is driven by its intrinsic financial strength and is highly influenced by the bank\u2019s large exposure to the Sri Lankan sovereign\u2019s weak credit profile (Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating: RD) and the ongoing sovereign debt restructuring, which has exerted pressure on PB\u2019s financial profile, particularly capitalisation and funding. It also reflects the bank\u2019s strong domestic franchise as Sri Lanka\u2019s second-largest bank.",
    "Restructuring Delays Hinder Progress: Sri Lankan banks\u2019 operating environment (OE) continues to show signs of stabilisation, supporting the recovery in banks\u2019 operational flexibility. There are sustained improvements in reported headline macro variables, but persistent delays in the completion of the sovereign debt restructuring exercise could impede the progress made thus far, in Fitch\u2019s view.",
    "Capital Impairment Risks: The ongoing restructuring of the debt of state-owned enterprises that has been assumed by the government raises significant risks to PB\u2019s capital, as reflected in the allocation of LKR450 billion by the government for the recapitalisation of the state banks, including PB. This is in addition to the risks to capital stemming from its holdings of defaulted sovereign bonds where the bank has already absorbed a provision of around 50%, although the adequacy of such impairment is unknown.",
    "Sovereign Exposure Strains Risk Profile: PB\u2019s large exposure \u2013 estimated at around 60% of assets \u2013 to the sovereign\u2019s fragile credit profile continues to weigh on the bank\u2019s risk profile assessment. This includes credit extended to a state-owned entity that has been transferred to the government since end-2022 and its modest holding of defaulted sovereign bonds (1% of assets), which are presently under restructuring negotiations.",
    "These exposures have made the bank vulnerable to the sovereign\u2019s repayment capacity and liquidity position.",
    "Asset Quality Pressures Persist: PB\u2019s asset quality metrics remain highly linked to the sovereign\u2019s credit profile due to the bank\u2019s large sovereign exposure via its loans, offbalance sheet liabilities and securities holdings. The bank\u2019s core asset quality metric \u2013 impaired (stage 3) loans ratio \u2013 improved through focused recoveries to 15.4% by end2023 (2022: 17.4%). However, we estimate that this ratio would be significantly higher if PB\u2019s foreign-currency loan exposure to the state and state-owned entities is included.",
    "Continued Funding and Liquidity Risks: Fitch believes PB\u2019s funding and liquidity profile, particularly in foreign currency, is susceptible to the sovereign\u2019s weak credit profile, making it prone to sudden changes amid already weak creditor sentiment, similar to its peers. Stress on foreign-currency liquidity has eased somewhat, as reflected in the liquidity coverage ratio, but PB\u2019s access to foreign-currency wholesale funding remains constrained by the default status of the sovereign.",
    "Risks to Profitability Manageable: Fitch expects risks to profitability to be manageable despite the potential for a loss following the restructuring of foreign-currency loans to a state-owned entity, which we expect to be one-off. PB\u2019s operating profit/risk-weighted asset ratio declined to 1.7% in 1Q24 (2023: 2.4%, 2022: 3.2%) due to thinner net interest margins and higher operating costs, despite significantly lower credit costs.",
    "Economic Conditions Support Business Profile: Fitch expects Sri Lanka\u2019s stabilising economic environment to support PB\u2019s ability to generate and defend business volumes, but its business profile remains highly susceptible to the elevated risks in the operating environment. Net settlements from state exposures amid improved financial performance, as well as muted credit demand from the private sector underpin the sustained reduction in the share of net loans in assets (1Q24: 57%, 2022: 61%), a trend that is likely to reverse in the near to medium term as private sector credit expands.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade",
    "The bank\u2019s National Rating is sensitive to a change in the bank\u2019s creditworthiness relative to other Sri Lankan issuers.",
    "A deterioration in PB\u2019s key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers would also lead to increased downward pressure on the bank\u2019s rating, which is driven by its intrinsic financial strength.",
    "Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade",
    "Positive rating action on the sovereign may lead to an upgrade in the bank\u2019s rating. A sustained improvement in the bank\u2019s key credit metrics beyond our base-case expectations relative to peers, could also lead to an upgrade of the bank\u2019s ratings.",
