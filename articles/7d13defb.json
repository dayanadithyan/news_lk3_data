    "Criticism of Adani projects is not new in Sri Lanka. For the first time now, a public interest litigation has been filed in the Supreme Court against Adani Green Energy.",
    "Last week, the Bishop of the Diocese of Mannar along with three prominent environmentalists, filed a public interest litigation in the Sri Lankan Supreme Court, challenging the proposed 250 MW Mannar Wind Power Project.",
    "In February 2023, Sri Lanka\u2019s Board of Investment approved the development of the $442-million wind power project by Adani Green Energy. Wind power plants were to be built in Mannar and Pooneryn in Northern Sri Lanka.",
    "Indian billionaire Gautam Adani\u2019s Adani Group is also developing a $700-million container terminal at the strategically located Colombo Port. While Adani\u2019s projects have faced setbacks and criticism previously, the litigation against Adani Green Energy is the first legal challenge facing the formidable Adani Group in Sri Lanka.",
    "The legal petition in the Supreme Court has challenged the procurement process and construction of the project by Adani Green Energy.",
    "It names 67 respondents, including the Cabinet of Ministers, the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA), the Central Environmental Authority (CEA), the Board of Investment, the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Public Utilities Commission Sri Lanka, and the Attorney General. In addition to raising concerns about the credibility of the project\u2019s environmental impact assessment (EIA) and the role of the SLSEA, the petition highlights procedural issues in the awarding of the contract and questions the characterization of the project as a\u00a0government-to-government deal.",
    "The petition challenges the basis for the negotiated tariff. It argues that the\u00a0tariff of $0.0826, or 8.26 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for 20 years would lead to\u00a0financial losses\u00a0for the country and burden consumers.",
    "It was\u00a0reported\u00a0that a Technical Evaluation Committee appointed by Sri Lanka to negotiate the Adani project had recommended to the government that a unit of electricity should be bought for $0.05 per kWh. Independent Sri Lankan energy experts have\u00a0pointed\u00a0out that Adani is selling power to the Indian state at\u00a0less than $0.04 per kWh.",
    "The petitioners also say that despite the project\u2019s national importance, the two sides have not made data available for public scrutiny. The petition requested the Court to order the release of all files and records, including bids for the Mannar and\u00a0proposed 234 MW Pooneryn plants; deliberations and negotiations; Cabinet decisions; unit price discussions; and criteria for project assessments.",
    "The petition argues that like most EIA reports on major projects in the past decade, the EIA on the Mannar wind power project is mere eyewash. The EIA was manipulated to award the project to Adani, it says.",
    "The petitioners also wondered why the Power and Energy Minister acted as the project\u2019s approving authority when there is a designated body \u2014 the CEA \u2014 for such tasks.",
    "There is no transparency regarding the lease of 202 hectares on Mannar Island for the project, nor information on compensation for affected landowners. The EIA also did not adequately evaluate alternative sites \u2014 Ambewela, the South East coast, Kalpitiya, and Jaffna \u2014 or provide a rationale for choosing Mannar Island.",
    "The petition emphasizes the importance of Mannar Island as a focal point of the Central Asian Flyway, making it crucial for conservation and tourism. In March this year, Prof. Sampath S. Seneviratne of the University of Colombo\u2019s Department of Zoology and Environment Sciences\u00a0told\u00a0The Island that around 15 million birds migrate to Sri Lanka from 30 countries each year. \u201cWe are going to establish 52 windmills that have 96-metre rotor blades that rotate at about 100 km per hour in the path of these birds,\u201d he said.",
    "The petitioners seek a declaration from the Supreme Court that their fundamental rights and those of the citizenry have been violated and that the decisions to award the project to Adani are wrongful and should be declared illegal. The petition aims to further the national interest by preserving and protecting public property, the environment, flora and fauna, public finances, and the rights and freedoms of the general public and future generations of Sri Lanka.",
    "The Adani Group has\u00a0emerged\u00a0as a\u00a0major player\u00a0in Sri Lanka\u2019s renewable energy sector in recent years, entering the country amidst increased Indian geostrategic presence in the Indian Ocean island, especially after India\u00a0provided\u00a0$4 billion worth of credit during the country\u2019s financial crisis in 2022.",
    "However, the Group\u2019s presence in Sri Lanka has been fraught with controversy. Most Sri Lankans believe that giving Adani a number of large and strategic projects is the Ranil Wickremesinghe government\u2019s way of repaying the debt. The Adani Group\u2019s transformation from a medium-scale enterprise to an economic powerhouse over the past two decades is closely linked to the owner\u2019s relationship with Prime Minister Modi.",
    "In\u00a0June 2022, M.M.C. Ferdinando, chairman of the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board, informed Parliament\u2019s Committee on Public Enterprises that the Sri Lankan government had faced pressure from Prime Minister Modi to award renewable energy project tenders to the Adani Group.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition parties view\u00a0the government\u2019s agreements with Adani as \u201cback door\u201d deals. Environmentalists and civil society organizations too have protested the social-environmental impact of these agreements. What these groups often lack is the financial resources and institutional backing necessary for a prolonged battle with a powerful multinational company.",
    "Anti-Adani sentiments in Sri Lanka can be expected to grow in the coming years, and the concerns of those who oppose agreements with the Adani Group will be validated by the petition filed recently by Sri Lanka\u2019s powerful Catholic Church.",
    "The Catholic Church has shown that it can be\u00a0persistent\u00a0in pursuit of its objectives and this, coupled with the high possibility of the election of a less pro-India government in Sri Lanka later this year would make Adani\u2019s operations in the island more difficult.",
