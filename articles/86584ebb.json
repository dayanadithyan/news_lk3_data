    "It is common for short clips of statements by public figures, often taken out of context, to go viral",
    "Few things on social media go as viral as short clips of statements by public figures, often taken out of context. In platforms designed to capitalise on our shrinking attention spans, users rarely have the time or patience for context. Even if some may wish to trace a circulating video clip to its original, longer video source, it would have likely gone viral by then, prompting journalists to play catch up, although we may not report on it.",
    "While it is hard to pin motivations based on short clips, the instant reactions they trigger can be interesting and telling. Among other things, they show us how an intended message and its interpretation can be very different while consumed on social media. A case in point is a remark made by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Mumbai, last month.",
    "\u201cMy first advice to you would be, the next time you want to take a holiday, go to Sri Lanka,\u201d he said, in the now popular clip. Many social media users in both countries understood this as a fillip for Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry. Several Sri Lankans, including politicians, cheered the Indian Foreign Minister\u2019s \u201cpitch for Sri Lankan tourism\u201d and eagerly re-shared the clip.",
    "Except, Mr. Jaishankar appeared to convey something else, as the longer clip shared on his own X timeline showed. Following his remarks on India\u2019s role on the global stage, Mr. Jaishankar took questions from the audience. A participant asked him if the \u201cobserved shift\u201d in the geopolitical alignment of India\u2019s long-standing regional partners such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and recently the Maldives, towards China, is indicative of \u201ca perceived failure\u201d of India\u2019s \u2018Neighbourhood First\u2019 policy.",
    "It was in response to this specific question that Mr. Jaishankar advised the young man to go to Sri Lanka on his next holiday. \u201cMix with the normal person in Sri Lanka and ask them \u2018what do you think about India?\u2019 You will feel yourself grow with that answer,\u201d he said, in the longer clip. He elaborated on how when the rest of the world \u201cturned its back\u201d on Sri Lanka during the island nation\u2019s economic crisis in 2022, India was the only country to come forward, committing $4.5 billion, considerably more than what the ongoing International Monetary Fund package entails.",
    "In essence, Mr. Jaishankar was encouraging the audience member to visit Sri Lanka to better understand perceptions of India\u2019s crucial outreach. It was more a hat tip to his own government\u2019s \u2018Neighbourhood First\u2019 policy than about adding to Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism numbers, which Indians are anyway doing.",
    "\u201cAfter you have done your Sri Lanka holiday, please go to Nepal. The export of electricity to India is an enormously rewarding transaction for Nepal,\u201d he added soon after. But those points didn\u2019t go half as viral, and the part that did could not have hurt New Delhi\u2019s interests in this instance.",
    "Meanwhile, Sri Lanka\u2019s Tourism Minister Harin Fernando had a novel interpretation of Mr. Jaishankar\u2019s comment, and his video clip too went viral. Speaking at a roadshow addressing travel agents in Mumbai recently, Mr. Fernando said: \u201cI think he mentioned if you are travelling somewhere, travel to Sri Lanka because Sri Lanka is a part of India actually\u201d.",
    "His comment drew flak for \u201cdisrespecting Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty\u201d. In a country where Sinhala nationalists have fiercely opposed Indian intervention in the past, and remain sceptical of Indian interests, Mr. Fernando\u2019s remark did not go down well. A political rival went to the extent of saying his statement was punishable by death. Forced to give an explanation, the flustered minister told parliament: \u201cI humbly thanked India for saving Sri Lanka through the last 13-14 months, giving us maximum number of tourists\u2026I went on to elaborate the connection that Sri Lanka has with India \u2013 not only in history, [but also in] our words, music, film industry, food. In Kerala, you call it aappam (for hoppers), we call it aappa\u2026\u201d",
    "He sought to give examples of India and Sri Lanka\u2019s cultural connect, perhaps hoping that his explanation too would get airtime. But social media had moved on to the next viral clip.",
