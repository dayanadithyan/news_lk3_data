The 19-member team received a warm welcome from SriLankan Airlines, ensuring that their entire journey was on form from start to end. For many of the members, this was their first visit to Sri Lanka. SriLankan Airlines guaranteed that their first experience of the country began right onboard the flight, offering them the best of Sri Lankan hospitality and the island\u2019s culinary traditions.",
