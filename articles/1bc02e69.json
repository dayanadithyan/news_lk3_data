    "ECONOMYNEXT\u00a0 Sri Lanka\u2019s National Water Supply and Drainage Board is considering to go with smart water meters to cut down expensive wage paid for 1,100 manual water readers, Water Supply Minister Jeevan Thondaman said.",
    "\u201cThey are paid 150,000 rupees a month. It is higher than my salary of 76,000 rupees. They work almost four days in a month,\u201d the Minister told a Foreign Correspondent Association (FCA) Forum in Colombo late on Wednesday.",
    "\u201cSo now we are considering to fix 600,000 smart water meter within the next two years.\u201d",
    "He said smart meters will give accurate and clear data while reducing the room for corruption.",
    "Thondaman\u2019s new move comes as the government is in the process of rationalizing all the expenditures on state-owned enterprises.",
    "Under President Ranil Wickremesighe\u2019s government, the NWSDB\u2019s monthly loss of 2.3 billion rupees has turned into the same amount of monthly profit, Thondaman said.",
    "The NWSDB \u00a0is still in the process of optimising its human resources and had brought down the total employees to around 8,000 from 12,300 when Minister Thondaman was handed over the Water Board, he said.",
    "\u201dWe can manage this with only 6,500 employees,\u201d he said adding that some people had been recruited based on political affiliation in the past,\u201d he said. (Colombo/July 11, 2024)"
