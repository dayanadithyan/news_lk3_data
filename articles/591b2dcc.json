    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says that the upcoming presidential election will determine the country\u2019s success or failure, rather than personal victories or defeats, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) reported.",
    "The Head of the State made this remark during a policy reform discussion held in Battaramulla this morning (12), according to the PMD.",
    "During the event, the President was asked whether there will be anyone to take the lead in continuing the current program if he somehow loses the next election.",
    "In response to this, President Wickremesinghe said: \u201cIt is not my victory or defeat that will be decided in this election. It will be decided whether the country will lose or not.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe have currently negotiated with the International Monetary Fund and presented an economic program. To implement it, the Economic Transformation Bill has been brought. If it collapses, we will lose foreign exchange again. We will have to suffer in queues without medicines, petrol and gas.\u201d"
