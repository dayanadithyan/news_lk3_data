    "Colombo, Feb 22 (Daily Mirror) - An appeal application filed by a British woman instagrammer Kayleigh Fraser challenging the authorities' decision to deport her from Sri Lanka has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.",
    "Kayleigh Fraser who had been documenting Sri Lanka\u2019s anti-government protests on social media filed this appeal challenging the legality of the Court of Appeal decision to dismiss her writ petition. In her writ petition, the appellant sought an order to quash the decision of the Department of Immigration and Emigration to deport her in an arbitrary manner.",
    "The Attorney General had raised preliminary objections against the appeal on the basis that there is no proper affidavit before court and that the appellant has suppressed material facts and misrepresented facts to court.",
    "The Department of Immigration and Emigration had decided to terminate the visa issued to Fraser for violating visa conditions and had informed her to leave the country by 15 August 2022."
