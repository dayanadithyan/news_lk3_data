    "The Supreme Court on July 18 concluded considering the FR petitions filed challenging the appointment of Tennakoon as the IGP.",
    "Accordingly, the court had then announced that the decision as to whether or not the petitions will be taken up for hearing will be delivered today (24).",
    "The court is also expected to announce today as to whether an interim order will be issued preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from functioning as the IGP.",
