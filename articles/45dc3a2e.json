  "original_body_lines": [
    "Pakistan is planning to ban former Prime Minister Imran Khan\u2019s political party and move the country\u2019s top court to press treason charges against him, the information minister said on Monday.",
    "The move to ban Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was based on the proven charge of the party receiving foreign funds from sources that are illegal in Pakistan, as well as rioting by the supporters last year that targeted military installations, Minister Attaullah Tarar said.",
    "\u201cThe federal government will move a case to ban the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf,\u201d he said, adding that the plan will be taken up before the cabinet, which was empowered to take a decision.",
    "The government will also file a legal reference against Khan and former President Arif Alvi for treason charges under the country\u2019s constitution before the Supreme Court, Tarar said.",
    "Khan\u2019s aide Zulfikar Bukhari said the decision was a move towards \u201csoft martial law\u201d. \u201cThis is a sign of panic as they have realised the courts can\u2019t be threatened and put under pressure,\u201d he said.",
    "PTI candidates contested the Feb. 8 election as independents after it was barred from the polls.",
    "The Supreme Court had last week ruled that the party was eligible for more than 20 extra reserved seats in parliament, ramping up pressure on the country\u2019s weak coalition government.",
    "It was not immediately clear what impact the planned ban would have on the court\u2019s decision to grant reserved seats.",
    "Tarar said the government would seek a legal review of the reserved seats issue.",
    "He said PTI lobbying in Washington to get the U.S. House of Representatives support for a resolution against Pakistan\u2019s elections, as well as writing to the IMF to demand an election audit before helping the country were also reasons behind the decision.",
    "Jailed since August, Khan was on Saturday acquitted, along with his third wife, on charges that they married unlawfully but he will not be freed after authorities issued new orders to arrest him.",
    "Khan came to power in 2018 and was ousted in 2022 after falling out with Pakistan\u2019s powerful military."
