    "Sampath Bank set forth on a mission to support the nation\u2019s farming community through the \u2018Wewata Jeewayak\u2019 Programme. The programme aims to strengthen local harvesting by reviving traditional irrigation systems that can be restored to increase agriculture for farmers. Through the \u2018Wewata Jeewayak\u2019 programme, the Kohombagas Tank at the Mahakumbukkadawala Divisional Secretariat of Puttalam District has been revived and handed over to the local farmers which brought renewed hope and opportunities to them.",
    "The Kohombagas Tank supports the cultivation of 64 acres, serving over 76 farming families and around 150 nearby families who rely on it for their daily needs. However, a malfunctioning irrigation system has complicated their daily tasks. Key components like the feeder canal, tank bund, spill and irrigation canal have not been renovated for a long time, preventing the Tank from retaining water. As a result, farmers have struggled to cultivate their crops even for one season. In response to a heartfelt plea from local farmers, Sampath Bank initiated the renovation of the Kohombagas Tank under the \u2018Wewata Jeewayak\u2019 programme. This initiative has empowered farmers to effectively pursue agriculture, ensuring abundant harvests during both the yala and maha seasons.",
