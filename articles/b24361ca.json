  "original_body_lines": [
    "Minister and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) member Bandula Gunawardena confirmed yesterday that MPs who have announced their support for President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the upcoming Presidential polls did so after seeking the blessings of former President and SLPP leader Mahinda Rajapaksa.",
    "Responding to queries posted at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday, he stated that a group of SLPP Ministers and State Ministers had a discussion with Rajapaksa at the Parliament complex, securing his approval before making their support public.",
    "Following this meeting, the group insisted at a separate party meeting that it was in the best interest of the SLPP to back Wickremesinghe rather than fielding a new candidate for the presidential election.",
    "\u201cThere is no division within the SLPP camp. All we do is support the national framework to overcome the ongoing economic crisis under Wickremesinghe\u2019s leadership,\u201d Gunawardena elaborated.",
    "He highlighted that President Wickremesinghe has introduced crucial reforms, which have been long overdue and has successfully put the economy back on track. Among these reforms are five key legislations, including a law aimed at combating corruption. Gunawardena described these laws as the \u2018panchaayudaya\u2019 (five weapons) of the new economy.",
    "He pointed out that although people can take names and do the usual blame game in politics, they cannot run a Government like that."
