    "Accuses Rienzie Arsecularatne PC of amplifying remarks by Prof. Agalakada Sirisumana Thera that have no bearing on party\u2019s stance",
    "Reaffirms that SJB leader Sajith Premadasa\u2019s promises, both written and verbal, to the Archbishop would not change",
    "Condemns Arsecularatne\u2019s letter, accusing it of being politically motivated and aimed at damaging SJB\u2019s voter base",
    "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), through its General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara, yesterday reiterated the party\u2019s and its leader Sajith Premadasa\u2019s unwavering commitment to ensuring justice for the victims of the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks.",
    "This reassurance follows a letter by President\u2019s Counsel Rienzie Arsecularatne to Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, which cast doubts on Premadasa\u2019s dedication to this cause.",
    "Arsecularatne\u2019s letter gained widespread media attention after he referenced a statement by Professor Agalakada Sirisumana Thera, a petitioner in the ongoing case against the Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennekoon, which seemed to question SJB\u2019s commitment to justice for the victims.",
    "In response, Madduma Bandara accused Arsecularatne of amplifying remarks that have no bearing on the party\u2019s stance. He reaffirmed that Premadasa\u2019s promises, both written and verbal, to the Archbishop and the victims\u2019 families would not change. \u201cThe SJB remains steadfast in its call for an unbiased investigation conducted according to international standards, to ensure those responsible for the attacks are held accountable,\u201d he said.",
    "Madduma Bandara also highlighted the party\u2019s track record on the matter, noting that the SJB facilitated two Parliamentary debates on the Easter attacks, revealing all available information to the public. Additionally, SJB lawyers had submitted proposals on how future investigations should proceed, with Premadasa\u2019s commitment to justice explicitly outlined in his election manifesto.",
    "The SJB condemned Arsecularatne\u2019s letter, accusing it of being politically motivated and aimed at damaging the party\u2019s voter base. The letter, they claimed, was also an attempt to disrupt religious harmony in the country. Madduma Bandara criticised the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) for not actively addressing the Easter attack investigation and for remaining silent on the appointment of Tennekoon",
    "Madduma Bandara also accused online media outlets aligned with the NPP of spreading a report that falsely claimed the Archbishop had expressed doubts about Premadasa\u2019s commitment to delivering justice for the Easter attacks. However, despite the SJB\u2019s assertion, the news reports in question only referenced Arsecularatne\u2019s letter and did not attribute any such statement to the Archbishop."
