    "The group convened with Minister Harin Fernando at a meeting in Battaramulla yesterday to deliberate on their next steps.",
    "After the meeting, Chief Government Whip Prasanna Ranatunge told the media that until late Tuesday, Dhammika Perera was expected to be announced as the party\u2019s candidate.",
    "\u201cPerhaps the announcement of Namal Rajapaksa\u2019s candidacy was made simply to fulfil the need for an announcement. However, it does not align with the party\u2019s needs or the desires of its grassroots supporters,\u201d he remarked.",

    "Meanwhile, SLPP Kalutara District MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said the people of his district are urging party leaders to maintain their support for Ranil Wickremesinghe. \u201cWhen I consult with them, they are requesting that we allow the leader we brought in to continue his work,\u201d he said.",
    "State Minister Piyal Nishantha said he decided to support Wickremesinghe because the party leadership had previously indicated that Dhammika Perera would be the candidate. Nishantha said that if Namal Rajapaksa had been announced as the candidate earlier, many MPs might have chosen to stay with the SLPP and support him."
