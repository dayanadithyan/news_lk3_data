    "Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who was appointed as the Acting Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) yesterday amidst internal turmoil has vowed to reconcile all factions within the party.",
    "Addressing the media outside the SLFP headquarters on Darley Road, Rajapakshe asserted his commitment to uniting the divided factions. \u201cOnce we stabilise the situation, they will all join us,\u201d he affirmed.",
    "Responding to queries from journalists about his plans to rejuvenate the SLFP, Rajapakshe expressed confidence, citing his track record of success in previous challenges. \u201cEvery challenge I\u2019ve taken up, I\u2019ve succeeded in. Every election I\u2019ve faced, I\u2019ve won,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile tension flared at the party headquarters as Rajapakshe and his supporters including SLFP members Daham Sirisena, Sajin Vass Gunawardena, Uditha Lokubandara and others sought entry to the office, despite the premises being sealed by police following its declaration as a crime scene.",
    "Despite assurances from Wijeyadasa that they would avoid the section under police investigation, law enforcement officials barred their entry, citing ongoing investigations. The SLFP office was sealed after a complaint by pro-Sirisena faction\u2019s Acting General Secretary Sarathi Dushmantha Mitralapala on 5 April alleging missing documents.",
    "Wijeyadasa condemned the police for allegedly bowing to external influence and preventing their entry. He accused the police of acting unlawfully by obstructing their access. He emphasised that the auditorium, where they intended to go, was on the fifth floor, whereas only the first floor was closed off for investigation. \u201cThe complaint alleging document theft was filed on April 5th. Today is the 21st, and the police have taken no action thus far,\u201d he criticised. Wijeyadasa announced that his faction intends to petition the Supreme Court regarding the actions of the police."
