    "He said this will provide room for a potential revision of the Value-Added Tax (VAT) percentage, which was increased from 15% to 18% with effect from the outset of 2024. Acknowledging that the VAT hike poses a burden for many people, the President said the government is systematically addressing this issue.",

    "Speaking further on the economic reforms undertaken by the government to ride out the crisis situation, Wickremesinghe emphasized that the country is now experiencing tangible growth, which is evident in the current social discourse.",
    "\u201cNot long ago, conversations cantered around the challenges posed by power cuts, demanding uninterrupted electricity. Today, the discourse has shifted to electricity bills. Previously, concerns were raised about the exorbitant black market price of petrol, with talk of spending days in fuel queues. Now, the focus is on new oil companies investing in Sri Lanka. Issues related to the scarcity of vegetables have transformed into discussions about prices of carrots. The prior scarcity of paper for book printing is now replaced by discussions about VAT.\u201d",
    "Further, the President expressed optimism about achieving economic growth of 2% to 3% this year, with efforts underway to increase it to 5% by 2025, based on predictions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).",

    "Wickremesinghe said this journey to economic recovery progressed methodically: \u201cIn the 2022 interim budget, I highlighted the country\u2019s critical situation at that time, aiming to avert an economic collapse. Through the 2023 budget, several proposals were presented to guide the economy towards stability, showcasing a step-by-step approach to our overarching goals. The 2024 budget proposals mark the initial stride in essential reforms aimed at propelling economic development.\u201d",

It will take a considerable period of time to settle this debt.\u201d",
    "He stressed on the need to source the funds locally in order to pay off the country\u2019s debt. \u201cIt is imperative that we generate this income; otherwise, we risk falling into the debt trap once again.\u201d",
    "As a result of debt restructuring, Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would be able to reduce the annual payment. Nevertheless, even under such a situation the country will still have to pay around USD 3 billion per year, he said adding that we need to create a balance between income and expenditure. \u201cOur budget deficit is at an acute stage. This year government revenue stood at Rs. 4,127 billion and expenditure was Rs. 6,978 billion. Out of this Rs. 2,651 billion is for debt repayment. This clearly indicates our debt burden.\u201d",

    "The President extended an invitation to the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to collaborate with him in the nation-building endeavours.",
    "\u201cIn the interest of the nation\u2019s welfare and the prosperity of our youth, the majority of the Podujana Peramuna have set aside past animosities and reached a consensus. Likewise, longstanding political allies have aligned with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, including those whom I personally introduced to the political arena. If the Podujana Peramuna can unite for the greater good, why can\u2019t the Samagi Jana Balawegaya follow suit?",
