    "Inaugural episode explores global economic stability with Dr. Howard Nicholas",
    "The Research Intelligence Unit (RIUNIT), a London-based research and consulting firm, has launched a new podcast series on global economic topics, using a nonconventional approach to identify opportunities and challenges.",
    "The inaugural episode, released on 27 May features a panel discussion titled \u201cWhy Isn\u2019t the Global Economy in Crisis?\u201d The panel includes renowned Economist Dr. Howard Nicholas, The Economic Training and Information Services Company Co-founder and COO Bram Nicholas, and RIUNIT Founder and CEO Roshan Madawela.",
    "Dr. Nicholas examines global recession trends, Government budgets, national debt, and the IMF\u2019s role. He argues that a significant credit expansion is unsustainable due to the existing credit overhang. Bram Nicholas adds to the discussion with compelling data, emphasising that industrialisation is crucial for economic development and highlighting the importance of manufacturing for Sri Lanka\u2019s economic future. Roshan Madawela offers insights into Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis from a real estate perspective, comparing the property market to gold as a safe asset during uncertain times.",
    "The podcast is available for free on the RIUNIT website and YouTube channel. For more information, visit www.riunit.com."
