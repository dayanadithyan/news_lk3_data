    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has stated that his primary objective is to ease the burden on the lives of the people.",
    "Speaking during a public rally held in Horana, he emphasized the importance of upholding the agreements made with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and moving forward with them. The President noted that it is not feasible to alter these agreements, contrary to the claims made by Sajith and Anura.",
    "Additionally, President Wickremesinghe pointed out that Sajith and Anura\u2019s proposals lack the approval of the IMF, noting that the IMF\u2019s support is firmly behind the government\u2019s current program.",
    "Furthermore, Wickremesinghe elaborated: \u201cMy primary goal is to ease the burden on people\u2019s lives. We must continue to uphold our agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as we have no other source of support. The IMF has facilitated aid from 18 countries and provided us with a $10 billion advantage in managing our debt interest payments,\u201d he said.",
    "He further said that they need to transition to an export-driven economy and cannot sustain borrowing indefinitely, especially when their import expenses exceed their export income.",
    "\u201cTo keep our economy strong, we must focus on building an export economy and modernizing our economic practices. Providing subsidies alone will not advance our country; we need to develop a robust economy together,\u201d he added.",
    "The President criticized Sajith and Anura\u2019s promises of offering everything for free, stating that \u201cSajith and Anura are promising everything for free, but this is not feasible. They are misleading people to secure votes. Despite their claims of negotiating with the IMF, no such discussions have taken place.\u201d",
    "He further stated that the IMF has emphasized the importance of achieving the objectives of their current program to help Sri Lanka emerge from its severe economic crisis.",
    "\u201cThey have stressed the need to continue implementing economic reforms, which means I must carry on with the program I initiated. I am the only one capable of advancing this program\u201d, he added."
