    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Dr. Rajitha Senaratne says that he is yet to take a final decision as to whether he will support he incumbent President at the upcoming Presidential Election.",
    "The former Minister emphasized that he believes the economic programmes being carried out by the President and the government should be continued.",
    "Senaratne expressed these views during the \u2018Derana 360\u2019 programme, aired on TV Derana last night (15).",
    "Asked about when he plans on officially declaring his support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and join him on stage, he responded, \u201cI have not taken any such decision. There is no such date to take the stage. I could have gone back then if I wanted to.\u201d",
    "He clarified that he has not yet had any discussions with the President about extending his support, stating, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t even talked to me about it yet. Now what would have happened to Prabhakaran if he had revised these things without supporting Mahinda Rajapaksa in the same way back then?\u201d",
    "However, Senaratne said that any potential announcement regarding his support would be carefully timed, saying, \u201cIf I have an announcement, the time to announce it will also be checked.\u201d",
    "He further noted his cautious approach by stating, \u201cI still haven\u2019t decided that I will climb on Ranil\u2019s stage. I have to first check who else is on that stage.\u201d"
