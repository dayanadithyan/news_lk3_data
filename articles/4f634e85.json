Named \u2018South Asia Strategic Planner of the Year - 2021\u2019 and a \u2018Global Strategic Planning Leader \u2013 Finalist\u2019, Shehan has played a pivotal role in Triad being recognised as \u2018South Asia Independent Agency of the Year \u2013 2021.\u2019 Shehan\u2019s global perspective and strategic acumen have seen him serve on juries at local, regional, and global award shows, including representing Sri Lanka at the Cannes Lions APAC CMO Growth Council.

We have no doubt that, with them at the helm, Triad is poised to reach new heights, reinforcing our reputation as a trailblazer in integrated communications solutions in Sri Lanka.
