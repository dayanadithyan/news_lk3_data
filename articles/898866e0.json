    "It said the event in question had been organized with a \u201cdress-code: white\u201d theme by a group of entrepreneurs. According to unconfirmed data, however, the Embassy stated that the main promoter and the bar owners who had agreed to accommodate the party have been identified as Russian citizens.",
