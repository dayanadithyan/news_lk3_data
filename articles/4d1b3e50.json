    "Commenting on the initiative, State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath said, \u201cI want to applaud Uber for their outstanding efforts in recognising startups in Sri Lanka. As a global technology leader that began as a startup themselves, Uber\u2019s commitment to nurturing Sri Lankan innovation is truly commendable. I am also deeply grateful to the Government of Telangana for extending a special invitation to these startups to attend the Telangana Global AI Summit. This exposure to cutting-edge knowledge will be invaluable. Congratulations to the selected startups \u2013 KReader Ltd., ManKiwwa by Deegenics Ltd., and Megic Inc. I wish you the utmost success in maximising the opportunities provided by the Government of Telangana and Uber.\u201d",

Budding start-ups that have the hunger and drive to inspire change will benefit immensely from meeting Uber teams in India and hearing from them directly. We hope this will be a beginning to a thriving start-up ecosystem in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Uber continues to stay committed to start-ups in Sri Lanka. The company hosted the Uber Entrepreneurship Challenge a couple of years ago.
