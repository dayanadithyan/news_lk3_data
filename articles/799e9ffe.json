  "original_body_lines": [
    "Opener Pathum Nissanka broke Sanath Jayasuriya\u2019s 23-year old record for the highest score by a Sri Lankan in ODI cricket, also becoming the country\u2019s first double centurion.",
    "Nissanka cracked eight sixes and 20 boundaries to remain unbeaten on 210, scoring more than half of Sri Lanka\u2019s runs, as they finished their 50 overs on 381 for 3.",
    "Contributions from Avishka Fernando (88) and Sadeera Samarawickrama were dwarfed by Nissanka\u2019s stellar knock, as the opener became just the tenth batsman in the game to score an ODI double century."
