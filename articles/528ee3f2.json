  "original_body_lines": [
    "The \u2018March 12 Movement\u2019, a collective of election watchdogs and the civil society, has issued a statement strongly denouncing the passage of the Online Safety Bill, emphasising that it poses a grave threat to the fundamental rights enshrined within the Constitution of Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cThe current government\u2019s adamant pursuit of this legislation is a clear indication of its intention to silence dissent and suppress civic activism during this critical time of economic reform and upcoming elections\u201d, the statement read.",
    "The March 12 Movement further accused the government of violating the \u201cconstitutionally guaranteed right to pre-enactment judicial review of legislation\u201d, in addition to introducing the undemocratic law.",
    "They also revealed that the Supreme Court\u2019s recommendations in relation to amendments appropriate for the Bill were \u201ccompletely overlooked\u201d during its passage, adding that the although the relevant legislation was debated in Parliament using standing orders, its passage potentially undermines the \u201cestablished Westminster-model parliamentary tradition\u201d.",
    "\u201cWhile the citizens silently suffer amidst escalating cost of living and unmanageable hunger, it is crucial for the rulers to recognize that this silence does not equate to obedience\u201d, the statement further read, warning that such an assumption is the \u201cprecursor to a major backlash against the government\u2019s coercive rule\u201d.",
    "Thus, the March 12 Movement urged the Speaker to ensure that the amendments outlined in the recommendations listed by the Supreme Court are fully incorporated into the Online Safety Bill, adding that \u201cfollowing due process when passing laws, and respecting the judiciary and the sovereignty of citizens, is essential to promote clean politics and reinforce democracy in Sri Lanka\u201d."
