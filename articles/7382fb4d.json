    "Chairman of the Lanza\u2019s New Alliance MP Anura Priyadarshana Yapa told reporters after the meeting that he expects some 70 MPs to join the new political formation.",
    "\u201cToday, the voter is disillusioned with the parties they had voted for.\u00a0 We\u2019re all part of the same political stream. We have a duty to create a refuge for them,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNext month, we intend to form a new political alliance,\u201d he added.",
    "Asked if this brand new alliance will back the candidacy of President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the upcoming presidential election, the MP said that it\u2019s still early days.",
    "\u201cTo make that decision, the election date has to be announced and candidates have to come forward. We\u2019ll leave that aside for now; the plan is to bring most people who are of the same political views to one side,\u201d he said.",
    "No name has been proposed for the new formation yet, said Yapa.",
    "Asked about leadership, he said \u201cThere is no need to discuss that yet. We\u2019re are all here with common purpose. We will reveal who is what in due course.\u201d",
    "SLFP stalwart Duminda Dissanayake who is with the Nimal Siripala faction of the party and is opposed to the chairmanship of former president Maithriapala Sirsiena said the SLFP has always said it plans to bring together all independent groups in parliament under one alliance.",
    "\u201cWe held the first discussion today on that with independent MPs and party representatives. To take the country forward at this juncture, we must unite irrespective of party differences and think about the country,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI think all parties are of that same view, but some leaders may not be,\u201d he added.",
    "Dissanayake said that neither the SLFP or any party who entered discussions with them has decided on a presidential candidate yet.",
    "\u201cBut we have one message: Whoever the next president is, this group will be at the forefront of creating that president,\u201d he said.",
    "Among others who attended Tuesday\u2019s meeting were MP Nimal Lanza, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha, Trade Minister Nalin Fernando,\u00a0 Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna, State Minister Suren Raghavan and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva.
