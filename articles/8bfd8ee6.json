    "Says any party with sound judgement will not form a national Govt. with group which bankrupted country",
    "Accuses Govt. of attempting to attract Opposition MPs to join its fold",
    "Claims under the guise of forming a national consensus Govt. is attempting to direct public opposition against it with Opposition",
    "Says Govt. and President, lacking a mandate, are employing various tactics to stay in power",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Deputy General Secretary Mujibur Rahman said the party is unwilling to enter into a national Government with the present administration which bankrupted the country, asserting that anyone with sound judgement would refrain from taking such a course of action.",
    "During a press conference at the Opposition Leader\u2019s office over the weekend, Rahman noted that the Government is trying to attract Opposition MPs and, under the guise of the term \u201cnational consensus,\u201d share the public\u2019s opposition against the Government with the Opposition.",
    "He accused the Government of delaying the Local Government elections and impeding the people\u2019s ability to express their choice. However, he said the President will not be able to postpone the Presidential election of 2024, and it must be held before October.",
    "He asserted that the Government and the President, lacking a mandate, are employing various tactics to stay in power.",
    "\u201cBefore the Presidential election, the Government is planning to restrict democracy, limit the expression of opinions, curtail the right to access information, incarcerate anti-Government activists, and initiate a significant crackdown through the Terrorism Act,\u201d he claimed.\u00a0 \u201cFeeling that their last moments in power have arrived, they are attempting to suppress the people\u2019s right to access information, the right to express their opinions, and the democratic rights of the people. Wickremesinghe and the Rajapaksas have acknowledged that the conclusion of their rule is imminent. Consequently, they are endeavouring to prolong their authority by stifling the media and the people of the country,\u201d Rahman remarked.",
    "\u201cIn a period where the Government lacks the people\u2019s mandate, it is attempting to attract Opposition members by emphasising the term \u201cnational consensus.\u201d The Government\u2019s demise is imminent. The SJB is unwilling to participate in any national consensus or national Government,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe attempt to form a national Government is for the survival of the ministers in the current Government. The usage of the term \u201cconsensus\u201d is merely an attempt to direct objections against Government ministers to the Opposition. The SJB disagrees with this approach, as there is no agreement with those who have contributed to the country\u2019s deterioration,\u201d he added."
