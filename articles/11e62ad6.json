    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s president has said that he will discuss initiatives for long-term archaeological endeavours in the Anuradhapura city with visiting UNESCO Director General Audrey Azoulay.",
    "Azoulay will visit Sri Lanka from July 16-19 and take part at the celebration of the 75th Anniversary of Sri Lanka\u2019s membership of UNESCO at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre in Colombo.",
    "She will also travel to UNESCO World Heritage Sites around the island, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.",
    "\u201cI have invited the Director General of UNESCO to visit Sri Lanka and discuss initiatives for long-term archaeological endeavours in the Anuradhapura city. Several universities overseas have shown interest in supporting us for these activities, and we are moving forward with their collaboration,\u201d Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "\u201cAnuradhapura boasts a rich history spanning over a millennium, once renowned as a hub of trade and economics. Preserving and exploring this ancient city\u2019s archaeological treasures remains a significant endeavour.\u201d",
    "\u201cNew archaeological efforts in the Anuradhapura district are now imperative,\u201d Wickremesinghe said during a ceremony to inaugurate a 150-kilowatt solar power system installed by the LTL Group at the Sri Maha Bodhiya premises in Anuradhapura on Saturday (13).",
    "Wickremesinghe pointed out that UNESCO has undertaken extensive archaeological projects in Angkor Thom in Cambodia, and Luang Prabang in Laos.",
    "\u201cHowever, we have not taken the necessary steps to implement these activities in Anuradhapura city. Therefore, I have advised both the Department of Archaeology and the Cultural Triangle to undertake these initiatives.\u201d",
    "These efforts are part of a comprehensive program aimed at establishing Anuradhapura as a globally renowned city, Wickremesinghe said.",
    "While Sigiriya has gained international fame, Sri Lanka has not adequately highlighted Anuradhapura\u2019s historical significance as a major trade and economic center in the past, the president pointed out.",
    "\u201cCities like Tanjore (Thanjavur), Madurai, and Sanchipuram are often discussed, yet Anuradhapura, the fourth city, has been overlooked. Therefore, it is crucial to develop Anuradhapura city.\u201d",
    "As part of these initiatives, preparations are underway to establish new hotels in Anuradhapura, which will contribute significantly to its development, Wickremesinghe said. (Colombo/Jul13/2024)"
