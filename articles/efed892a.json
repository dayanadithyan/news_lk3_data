    "Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for the obliteration of Rafah, Deir al-Balah, and Nuseirat.",
    "In the dark ages one could, to an extent excuse bloodlust and calls for the eradication of an entire race of a particular people. People of that day and age were primitive. Bloodthirsty men of the cloth called for the eradication of particular peoples whom they saw as their enemies. They used God\u2019s name as a cover for their hatred.",
    "The fear of so-called \u2018Holy men\u2019 who had private discourses with the deities led them to follow the dictates of those crazed characters.",
    "So it is quite surprising, to hear modern-day rulers of Israel spout blood-thirsty calls for the killing of an entire people -in today\u2019s context the Palestinians- because of what some misguided old men called for in bygone ages.",
    "Israel\u2019s Finance Minister was referencing passages in Israel\u2019s \u2018Holy\u00a0 Book\u2019 where early religious leaders called for the total destruction of\u00a0 the Amalek people.",
    "The Middle East Eye, citing an unnamed senior Western official has reported Israel is setting up a complex system of checkpoints that will prevent men of \u201cmilitary age\u201d from fleeing Rafah in preparation for its (Israel\u2019s) offensive on the Southern Gaza border city.",
    "According to the report, \u201cThe checkpoints are designed to allow some women and children to leave Rafah ahead of an expected offensive, but unarmed, civilian Palestinian men will likely be separated from their families and remain trapped in Rafah during the assault.\u201d",
    "Addressing Netanyahu, Smotrich said, \u201cDon\u2019t wave a white flag. Don\u2019t let\u00a0 Yahya Sinwar humiliate us again and win the war. A government that\u00a0 submits to international pressure and stops the war in the middle will,\u00a0 at that moment, lose its right to exist.",
    "Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Tuesday that the Israeli army will move ahead with a ground invasion into Rafah, \u201cWhether or not there is a [ceasefire] deal\u201d",
    "Israel\u2019s extremist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, reportedly warned Netanyahu that if the Rafah invasion did not happen it would mean the dissolution of the prime minister\u2019s government. On Tuesday he was pleased with Netanyahu\u2019s statement.",
    "Ben-Gvir said he had \u201cwarned the prime minister [of the consequences] if, God forbid, Israel does not enter Rafah.If God forbid, we end the war. If, God forbid, there will be a reckless deal.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe prime minister heard my words, promised that Israel would go into Rafah, promised that the war would not end and promised that there would be no reckless deal. I welcome these things. I think the prime minister understands very well what it will mean if these things do not take place,\u201d he added.",
    "Ben-Gvir\u2019s colleague, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, called for the \u201ctotal annihilation\u201d of Gaza on Tuesday, adding that Israel\u2019s war Cabinet should not agree to political concessions in any ceasefire negotiation.",
    "The Middle East Eye, citing an unnamed senior Western official has\u00a0 reported Israel is setting up a complex system of checkpoints that will\u00a0 prevent men of \u201cmilitary age\u201d from fleeing Rafah in preparation for its\u00a0 (Israel\u2019s) offensive on the Southern Gaza border city.",
    "Addressing Netanyahu, Smotrich said, \u201cDon\u2019t wave a white flag. Don\u2019t let Yahya Sinwar humiliate us again and win the war. A government that submits to international pressure and stops the war in the middle will, at that moment, lose its right to exist.",
    "Smotrich added \u201cWe must obliterate Rafah, Deir al-Balah, and Nuseirat.",
    "The memory of the Amalekites must be erased. No partial destruction will suffice; only absolute and complete devastation.\u201d",
    "Israel\u2019s Finance Minister was referencing passages in Israel\u2019s \u2018Holy Book\u2019 where early religious leaders called for the total destruction of the Amalek people.",
    "In the Book of Exodus, where in Deuteronomy (25, 19) God supposedly says (Exodus17,14) \u2013 \u201cI will\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0utterly wipe out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven\u201d.",
    "Israelis believe in the Book of Deuteronomy (25, 19).It is a commandment incumbent upon the people of Israel to wipe out the memory of Amalek \u2013 \u201cYou shall wipe out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven\u201d.",
    "This commandment has been widely misunderstood, as a commandment to exterminate the Amalekite people.",
    "Jeffrey Radon, a teacher of Jewish studies and the author of the internet site - www.orthopraxjudaism.com - comments:",
    "This is indeed the way that Samuel the prophet understands the command in telling Saul, the first king of Israel (1Samuel 15, 3) \u2013 \u201cNow go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass\u201d.",
    "In the Book of Samuel (1 Samuel 15, 2), though, it is written that Samuel says that God has commanded the extermination of the Amalekites \u2013 but, the Book of Samuel does NOT say that God has so commanded.",
    "It was not very long ago, another madman -Adolph Hitler by name- called for the extermination of the Jewish people. Sadly many people from Germany believed in the reasons Hitler put forward blaming Jews for the problems that affected Germany in that day.",
    "Resultantly millions of innocent Jewish people suffered horrors and died in concentration camps during World War II.",
    "Sadly, we are witnessing today, the Jewish state and people attempting to do the Palestinians, what Hitler tried to do to them during World War II -exterminate them as a people.",
    "Hitler had as his acolytes Himler and Eichman who activated his murderous \u2018Final solution\u2019 to the Jewish problem. Today as the world watches, the Israeli triumvirate -Netanyahu, Gavir and Smotrich- are attempting a similar genocidal massacre in Rafa",
    "During World War II, the so-called great powers did nothing to stop the slaughter of the Jews by Hitler and his henchmen. Today these same great powers are doing nothing to stop the slaughter of innocent Palestinian men women and children by the state of Israel and its military machine.",
    "Just as at the end of the World War German leaders were charged, found guilty and punished at War Tribunals, today the same fate awaits the present leadership of Israel, its \u2018Israeli Defence Force\u2019 and other armed civilians who are committing genocide and other war crimes atrocities against the Palestinian people."
