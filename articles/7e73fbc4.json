    "National People\u2019s Party (NPP) member Wasantha Samarasinghe recently highlighted the unjust acts committed by the Sri Lanka Police during the ongoing \u2018Yukthiya\u2019 operation to allegedly combat drugs and eradicate underworld activities.",
    "Samarasinghe relating a recent incident said a public transport bus had been stopped by a group of Special Task Force (STF) personnel in the Kahatagasdigiliya area for a random check.",
    "He noted that during a search of the bus, the STF personnel discovered two parcels of cannabis on board, but were unable to identify the individual responsible for bringing it onto the bus.",
    "\u201cUnable to identify the suspects, the STF personnel proceeded to arrest the bus driver and conductor for transporting an illegal substance. Subsequently, they informed the bus owner of the arrests. The owner disclosed the presence of CCTV cameras installed on the bus, unknown to the driver and conductor and noted the suspects can potentially be identified through the footage,\u201d he explained.",
    "Samarasinghe revealed that two individuals who had placed the parcel were identified, and it was later revealed that they were, in fact, police officers in civvies.",
    "\u201cThis incident serves as a clear example of the injustices occurring under the so-called \u2018Yukthiya\u2019 (Justice) operation. Enforcing the law is adequate to combat drugs; there is no need for these theatrical performances if there is a genuine interest,\u201d he remarked."
