    "The petition was taken up before a three-member Supreme Court bench comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Yasantha Kodagoda and Shiran Gunaratne.",
    "However, the court decided to dismiss the petition in a majority decision by the judge bench, Ada Derana reporter said.",
    "The petition, filed by the former chairman of the Weligama Urban Council Rehan Jayawickrema, had accused\u00a0 Gamage of contempt for the comments made by her during a press conference following the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment disqualifying her from holding the position as a Member of Parliament."
