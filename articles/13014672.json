    "The protest was ignited after news of the alleged sexual abuse spread, with hundreds of people gathering to demand swift action against the accused and justice for the victims.",
    "In response to the growing unrest, the Maharashtra government announced the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the incident.",
    "State Cabinet Minister Girish Mahajan, who attempted to pacify the protesters, assured them of strict action against those responsible, stating, \u201cThe accused person will face the most severe punishment.\u201d",
    "Mahajan, a close ally of Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, revealed that immediate orders had been issued for the suspension of three police officials at the Badlapur police station after the family members of the victims were reportedly made to wait for 11 hours to register the FIR.",

    "\u201cAtrocities are committed on a three-and-a-half-year-old girl and a four-year-old girl, and at the police station, their parents are made to wait for 11 hours when they seek to file a complaint\u2026 Is there any sensitivity left? I spoke to the police commissioner and told him that the woman police officer responsible for this delay must be suspended immediately,\u201d Wadettiwar added."
