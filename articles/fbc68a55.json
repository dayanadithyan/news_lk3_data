    "Claims other parties have followed NPP\u2019s lead to focus on increasing women\u2019s involvement in politics",
    "Stresses women must actively participate in politics to reform existing system",
    "Notes NPP women\u2019s summits serve a greater purpose than merely bringing NPP into power",
    "Urges women abroad to support these efforts by informing and educating their friends and family in SL",
    "National People\u2019s Power (NPP) MP Dr. Harini Amarasuriya recently declared that the NPP dedicated to fostering significant social change in Sri Lanka, stands out as the most appropriate political platform for women.",
    "Speaking at the NPP\u2019s inaugural international women\u2019s summit in London on 16 March, Amarasuriya reminisced about how NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake had assented to the party\u2019s women\u2019s wing\u2019s plea for 50% representation in the forthcoming General Election as early as 2019.",
    "\u201cThough we initially requested 50% representation, we soon recognised the formidable challenge for women to actively participate in politics. Even those of us already engaged in political spheres hesitated to step forward as candidates, highlighting the immense obstacles ahead,\u201d she remarked. Amarasuriya remarked that alongside the NPP, other political parties have also started to focus on increasing women\u2019s involvement in politics.",
    "\u201cWomen must actively participate in politics to reform the existing system. We have stepped forward to challenge the violent and reprehensible nature of politics that we find unacceptable. There\u2019s a pressing need to transform the political culture and infuse it with new purpose. It\u2019s increasingly clear that the NPP provides the most conducive environment for women to drive political progress and instigate social change. We don\u2019t seek a politics that merely shuffles parliamentary seats during elections. The NPP has demonstrated that it is the ideal platform for women to lead and enact meaningful transformations,\u201d she maintained.",
    "She highlighted that since 2021, the NPP has established electorate committees in 11,000 Grama Seva Divisions, with a stipulation that 30% of the membership should comprise women. \u201cNevertheless, we encountered challenges in encouraging women to participate in these committees initially. Subsequently, we decided to establish women\u2019s committees, and remarkably, women began to join these committees in significant numbers,\u201d she explained.",
    "The NPP MP observed that the responsibilities of women in their workplaces, homes, and society have become increasingly burdensome and complex, prompting many to take to the streets in protest.",
    "She said that the women\u2019s summits, which commenced on 30 December, required months of grassroots efforts to ensure their success. \u201cThe women\u2019s committees persist in their efforts and are growing stronger,\u201d she said, adding that the process is one far greater than merely one put in place to bring the NPP to power.",
    "\u201cThis journey is about achieving significant social change,\u201d she emphasised. The MP urged Sri Lankan women living abroad to lend their support to these efforts, even though they may not currently reside in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cTake the initiative to inform and educate those closest to you, whether through a phone call or a social media message. Let us make sure that this year marks the beginning of a significant change in the country,\u201d she urged."
