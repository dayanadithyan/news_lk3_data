    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka could face severe implications if it reverses current International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed policy reforms, a top Central Bank official said amid the island nation\u2019s opposition politicians\u2019 vow to amend the IMF deal.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s IMF-backed economic reform policies have helped to see some stabilization in the economy from contractions for 10 successive quarters amid an unprecedented economic crisis and sovereign debt default in 2022.",
    "However, his policies are criticized by both the main opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and Marxists leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka.",
    "Both Premadasa and Dissanayaka, who are top contenders in the presidential election along with Wickremesinghe, have pledged to revise the agreement with the IMF.",
    "\u201cThinking of reversal of the current policies, it would be unthinkable. That could result in deviating from the IMF programme,\u201d Chnadranath Amarasekara, Central Bank Assistant Governor and the Secretary to the Monetary Policy Board told reporters at a media briefing on Friday (16).",
    "\u201cI think the entire world is looking at us and the entire world is intending on the IMF programme for Sri Lanka to place their trust,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThere could be adjustments within the programme within the policies that are there at the moment. But any major derailment through fiscal policy stance or even the monetary policy stance, with that there will be severe implications for Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "The central bank is not considering any policy reversal after the elections in its forecasts, he said.",
    "\u201cEven we don\u2019t project something like this because we can\u2019t project something on policy reversal.\u201d (Colombo/August 16/2024)"
