  "original_body_lines": [
    "Declares establishment of new development bank, Economic Commission to boost industrial growth at inauguration of \u2018International Industry Expo 2024\u2019",
    "Insists development of country cannot be achieved via constant litigation",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday announced a host of initiatives to empower small and medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) and boost the industry sector.",
    "Speaking at the inauguration of the first \u2018International Industry Expo\u2019 organised by the Industrial Development Board (IDB), the President announced the establishment of a new development bank with the opportunity to obtain loans at low interest rates aimed at providing financial support to industrialists in Sri Lanka.",
    "He also revealed plans to set up an Economic Commission to oversee these activities, along with the creation of a new institution called \u2018Enterprise Sri Lanka\u2019 to empower small and medium entrepreneurs.",
    "The International Industry Expo 2024, is the first event of its kind with over 1,000 international industrial entrepreneurs from various countries, along with local large-scale and medium-scale industrialists, who are participating in the event running till 23 June at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike International Conference Hall.",

    "Wickremesinghe also stressed on the importance of transitioning from an import-based economy to an export-oriented one. \u201cGiven that we are primarily an import-based economy, we continually need foreign exchange to cover these imports. Without sufficient foreign exchange reserves, we are compelled to resort to taking loans, which can potentially lead to another economic crisis within the next 15-20 years. Hence, our current focus is on transitioning to an export-oriented economy.\u201d",
