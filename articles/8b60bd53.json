  "original_body_lines": [
    "Adani Green Energy\u2019s wind energy project, coming up in Sri Lanka\u2019s northern Mannar and Pooneryn districts, has been challenged in the island\u2019s apex court on grounds of potential environmental impact and \u201clack of transparency\u201d.",
    "The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS), one of Sri Lanka\u2019s oldest environmental organisations set up over a century ago, on May 16 filed a Fundamental Rights petition at the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, with the aim of \u201cprotecting the unique ecosystem of Mannar Island\u201d.",
    "The Society\u2019s petition argues that the project \u201cposes a severe threat to the island\u2019s unique biodiversity and pristine landscapes,\u201d especially in Mannar. Mannar is the \u201csouthernmost point of the Central Asian Flyway used by innumerable migratory species\u201d, while also being home to several indigenous water bird and bat species, the WNPS said, contending that Sri Lankan authorities\u2019 decision approving the project disregarded Mannar\u2019s \u201csingular positioning as a biodiversity hub\u201d.",
    "The petition also notes that while the project has been portrayed as a \u201cGovernment-to-Government initiative with India\u201d, no details of contributions, grants, or loans from the Indian government have been disclosed.",
    "Further, the petition questioned the credibility of the Environmental Impact Assessment carried out by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Sri Lanka (SEASL) before the project was cleared, and the pricing formula finalised for the sale of power from the project. Sri Lanka recently agreed to purchase power at $0.0826, or 8.26 cents, per kWh from Adani Green Energy.",
    "While the company\u2019s renewable energy project in Sri Lanka has earlier faced criticism for the absence of due process and its likely environmental cost, this is the Adani Group\u2019s first legal challenge in the island.",
    "In February 2023, Sri Lanka\u2019s Board of Investment approved the $442-million wind power project of Adani Green Energy. The Adani Group has also committed to investing close to $700 million to build a container terminal at the strategically located Colombo Port."
