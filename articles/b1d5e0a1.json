    "\u2018Climate Challenge SL \u2013 Creative Data Solutions for Resilience\u2019 is designed to help mitigate climate change related issues faced by the agriculture and fisheries sectors. Climate change results in compounding effects on the two economic sectors, previously hampered by COVID-19 restrictions and the macroeconomic crises. The two sectors in focus provide livelihoods for over 30% of the population, contribute to the country\u2019s economic growth, and are critical for national food security. \u2018Climate Challenge SL\u2019 will open an innovators space for data professionals from across the country to incubate ideas and solutions for grassroots application in climate resilience practices.",
    "With the call for applications open from 5 September-31 October via www.liin.lk, LIIN will reach out through workshops/webinars and social media platforms to target 400 potential teams of data professionals from across the country for the hackathon. The LIIN, USAID, and CCF will select 20 diverse and inclusive teams from these applicants.",
    "Through a series of workshops and webinars, these teams will be provided with an opportunity to access real-world data and to work together to address the challenges posed by climate change, utilising advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), big data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT).",
    "\u2018Climate Challenge SL\u2019 will also offer these teams valuable mentorship support from industry experts to help fast-track the creation of innovative data-driven solutions to climate change issues faced by the agriculture and fisheries sectors. The top 10 teams will also have the exclusive opportunity to further develop or scale-up their innovations by pitching their groundbreaking ideas and models to impact investors.",
    "The USAID, through the Climate Adaptation Project, and LIIN commit to promote youth-led, context-specific innovative solutions to foster a climate resilient future. This is underscored by the \u2018Climate Challenge SL\u2019 which aims to harness the power of data to enhance the climate adaptation capabilities of the agriculture and fisheries sectors in Sri Lanka. USAID Mission Director for Sri Lanka Gabriel Grau said: \u201cThe United States is committed to helping Sri Lanka tackle climate change head-on. \u2018Climate Challenge SL\u2019 is about sparking fresh ideas to strengthen the country\u2019s agriculture and fisheries sectors. The USAID is inviting a diverse group of data professionals from all over Sri Lanka to join us in this climate hackathon and develop innovative solutions for a more sustainable future.",
