    "The Vehicle Importers\u2019 Association insists on the necessity of a proper regulatory framework for vehicle imports in Sri Lanka.",
    "President of the association Indika Sampath Merinchige emphasized the need for the government to establish a committee inclusive of their association\u2019s representatives to make decisions on this matter.",
    "\u201cWhen importing vehicles to Sri Lanka in the past few years, specifically in 2017, 2018, and 2019, 85% of the vehicles imported were used vehicles with only 15% new vehicles were imported. Out of that, 95% of the vehicles were sourced from Japan\u201d, he added.",
    "\u201cIn the future, it is imperative to prioritize the preferences of the people when importing vehicles. If the agents prioritize matters that are not aligned with the requirements of the people, there will likely be a decline in demand\u201d, Merinchige said."
