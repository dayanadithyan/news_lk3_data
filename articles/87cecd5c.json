    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s planned water tariff formula is ready, and the government will implement it this year only if the formula\u2019s tariff is lower than the current price, Water Supply Minister Jeevan Thondaman said.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s government has been implementing IMF-led pricing policies on utilities and the Water Supply Ministry has already come up with a formula.",
    "\u201cThere is a water tariff formula in place right now and we are waiting for it to be drafted and seek approval from the cabinet,\u201d Thondaman told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo on Monday.",
    "\u201cOnce this water tariff formula is in place, there will be an annual revision with an option of biannual review.",
    "The formula has been developed with the help of the Asian Development Bank. The formula includes electricity and exchange rate among many others as components like the fuel formula.",
    "The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB) increased the water tariff in August 2023, claiming that the operating cost had been increased owing to high interest payment for bank loans and increased electricity prices.",
    "The last year revision saw the consumers paying 30-50 percent increase from the existing water bill.",
    "Minister Thondaman said he will implement the new formula this year only if there is a reduction.",
    "\u201cWe will have to wait to see what the formula is. If the formula shows us there needs to be a reduction in the water tariff, we can implement it. But if there is an increase, why should we burden the people when we are on a road to recovery?\u201d he said.",
    "He said a group of experts including University Professors are working on the formula and the numbers.",
    "\u201cOnce they come with the number, we will have to take\u00a0a decision on whether we are going to impose on the people or not,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe have already spoken to the Asian Development Bank and informed them we have established the formula. But according to the ADB requirement of this policy-based loan, the implementation period is only in 2025.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut right now, you want to take the approval for the formula for sustainability.\u201d",
    "The Energy Ministry is considering a drastic slash in electricity tariff soon. Thondaman said the exact numbers will be decided on after the finalized electricity tariff.",
    "However, he said that as per the formula, there has to be a up to 10 percent increase in the water tariff as of now.",
    "\u201cGiven the current formula set up, there must be around a 9-10 percent increase. It was actually at 14 percent. What we have done is since it is at 14 percent, we also did a calculation to see how we can do a cost cutting,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSo, despite our cost cutting measures, there will be an increase of 9 or 10 percent. But we will not be imposing it as of now because this year is meant to be policy sector reforms. Next year is meant to be the implementation.\u201d",
    "\u201cAs per August 2023 water tariff hike, we are able to come close to sustainable. So right now, there is no issue in the water sector. But a formula eventually needs to be established.\u201d (Colombo/Feb 26/2024)"
