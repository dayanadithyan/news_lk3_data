    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Majority members of ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is backing current President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the upcoming presidential poll, State Urban Development and Housing Minister Arundika Fernando said.",
    "Analysts expect an imminent split in the SLPP if its leaders do not support Wickremesinghe after his success in the economic recovery with IMF-led reforms following an unprecedented economic crisis.",
    "Most SLPP members voted in Wickremesinghe as the president through a parliament vote after his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in the face of mass protests and resigned.",
    "Wickremesinghe later appointed most SLPP legislators into his cabinet and some others as state ministers to run the bankrupt nation.",
    "Sri Lanka reached a deal with bilateral agreement last week while it has also agreed on a settlement for sovereign bond holders, which has to be endorsed by the IMF and the Official Credit Committee (OCC).",
    "The government expects to declare the country\u2019s recovery from bankruptcy soon.",
    "President Wickremesinghe\u2019s leadership has helped SLPP MPs to visit their constituency after hiding in fear following the May 2022 attacks over most legislators\u2019 properties and murder of an MP, some SLPP members have said.",
    "\u201cHe has proven and taken the country to a certain level from where it was,\u201d State Minister Fernando told reporters at a media briefing at Wickremesinghe\u2019s Presidential Campaign office in capital Colombo.",
    "\u201cGiven the current crisis, we all including capitalists and socialists have to get united and march forward. What matters for us is not his personal or past policies, but the way now he works and consensus among us.\u201d",
    "Fernando\u2019s statement comes when SLPP\u2019s national organizer Namal Rajapaksa and its Secretary have stated contradictory statements.",
    "Namal Rajapaksa, who has been aspiring to succeed his father Mahinda Rajapaksa to lead the SLPP has said some actions taken by President Wickremesinghe do not align with SLPP policies and the party disagrees with some of his policies.",
    "SLPP General Secretary and MP Sagara Kariyawasam said this week that the party will consider granting the Presidential candidacy to Wickremesinghe if he takes party membership.",
    "\u201cAs SLPP, various people can say various opinions,\u201d Fernando said.",
    "\u201cOur expectation is gather all the political forces who have clarity on this president and back him at the presidency,\u201d he said adding that majority of the party members see him as the best candidate for the moment.",
    "Fernando said opinion of the majority SLPP MPs is to get support of all the party members plus an endorsement from former leader Mahinda Rajapaksa and get the maximum support of other political parties to back Wickremesinghe.",
    "President Wickremesinghe has yet to officially declare his candidature for the presidential poll which is likely to be scheduled between September 17 and October 16 and is the leader of center-right United National Party (UNP) which backs liberal policies. The SLPP is a nationalistic and left-minded party.",
    "\u201cWe know that Ranil Wickremesinghe is a representative and leader of a party that is for capitalism. We know the UNP is such kind of a party. But from there, they have come to a flexible point,\u201d Fernando said.",
    "\u201cWe (SLPP) also have come to a flexible point. The whole country is not in a position to go with socialism policies.\u201d (Colombo/July 04/2024)"
