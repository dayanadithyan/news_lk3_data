    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will see a \u201cdefinite reduction in water tariff\u201d possibly towards end of this week after several variables in the water pricing formula including electricity cost have fallen, Water Supply Minister Jeevan Thondaman said.",

    "President Ranil Wickremesighe is expected to contest in an independent coalition. He became unpopulour after he implemented reforms including raising utility prices to a lever without incurring any losses in line with the commitments Sri Lanka agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after an unprecedented economic crisis in 2022.",
    "Thondaman said the water tariff will come down because electricity is one of the key component in the water pricing.",
    "The Cabinet this week approved a water tariff formula to be implemented from 2025.",
    "\u201cWhen water tariff formula was approved, the emphasis was there only because of the fact that the formula, end of the day, needs to unburden the people. It should not be a burden on the people,\u201d the Minister said.",
    "\u201cWe have nine variables in the formula. My team is calculating as we speak. As far as the variables o some of the primary variables are energy, fuel, interest rates, and dollar rate. Those have already come down.\u201d",
    "\u201cSo I can assure you that the water tariff will be coming down. But we are looking at what the range is going to be.\u201d",

    "Though the Water Board is now making operational profits, it is not making cash flow to settle loans. (Colombo/July 17/2024)"
