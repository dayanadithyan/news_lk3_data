    "Addressing the media at the Presidential Media Centre, he also highlighted ongoing efforts to facilitate the safe return of Sri Lankans currently stranded in Myanmar.",
    "In addition to these repatriation efforts, Minister Sabry noted that a team of officials is reviewing a Cabinet paper regarding Sri Lanka\u2019s potential membership in the BRICS intergovernmental organisation.",
    "\u201cRecently, I attended the BRICS Foreign Ministers\u2019 Conference in Russia, representing Sri Lanka. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has submitted a Cabinet paper to explore the possibility of Sri Lanka joining the BRICS organisation. A team comprising officials from the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Treasury, Finance Ministry and the Central Bank has been tasked with studying this proposal. The Cabinet is expected to receive their report later this month,\u201d he explained.",

    "Minister Sabry said these diplomatic and economic efforts highlight Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to addressing both domestic and international challenges, fostering international cooperation and driving national development."
