    "More than 300 people gathered in the suburban Ottawa neighbourhood of Barrhaven Saturday for a community vigil following what police have called one of the worst mass killings in the region\u2019s recent history.",
    "Ottawa Police Service said Thursday that the homicide unit was called in after six people \u2014 four children and two adults \u2014 were found dead inside a home in the city\u2019s west-end suburb on Wednesday night, the Global News reported.",
    "\u201cMy daughter played with their kids a lot\u2026 On New Year\u2019s at the temple they were all playing together so it\u2019s really hard to see that this happened,\u201d said one neighbour, Mirissa Kumar, through tears.",
    "One of the victims was a woman, Darshani Dilanthika Ekanayake, and her two-and-a-half-month-old baby.",
    "Police allege 19-year-old Febrio De-Zoysa murdered Ekanayake, her four children and a family acquaintance.",
    "The father, Dhanushka Wickramasinghe, suffered serious but not life-threatening injuries.",
    "De-Zoysa, who had been boarding with the Wickramasinghe family, is facing six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s High Commission in Ottawa confirmed to Global News that the two adult victims are Sri Lankan nationals.",
    "Neighbours and friends gathered in reflection and fellowship at a community park Saturday afternoon, just a block away from the home where the Wickramasinghe family were building their new life in Canada.",
    "On and around benches, community members laid heartfelt notes, teddy bears, bouquets of flowers and balloons among other items to pay their respects.",
    "Naradha Kodituwakku from the Buddhist Congress of Canada, spoke to the crowd.",
    "\u201cOttawa Sri Lankan community, I know you\u2019re hurting and we are hurting with you,\u201d he said as his voice cracked with emotion.",
    "A number of attendees at the vigil knew the mother, Dharshani, and her four children personally. Some brought photos and shared memories with others in the community.",
    "Neighbours of the family struggled with the senseless violence, including Rochelle LaChance, who lives just a few houses down from where the homicides occurred.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s been weighing heavy on a lot of us\u2026 it\u2019s nice to see everyone together and have this space to grieve. I know this is going to take a long time and I really feel for the family and all the friends involved,\u201d she told Global News.",
    "\u201cWhat the kids went through, for me, is the hardest thing to be honest. And I have young kids as well,\u201d he told Global News.",
    "Neighbour Wilson Lo said: \u201cI\u2019m still thinking of the kids at the school who may not fully understand why two of their friends won\u2019t be there anymore.\u201d",
    "The surviving father, Dhanushka, is currently recovering in hospital from two surgeries for wounds suffered in the attack that killed his family. Once he\u2019s released, those at the Buddhist temple where Dhanushka and his family prayed say they are ready to take him in and care for him.",
    "\u201cI know it may take some time for him to\u2026 feel some freedom from this suffering,\u201d said Monk Bhante Suneetha from the Hilda Jayewardenaramaya Buddhist Monastery at the vigil.",
    "Arrangements are also being made to bring other remaining family members in Sri Lanka, such as Dhanushka\u2019s brothers, to Ottawa.",
    "Kodituwakku said at the vigil that Ottawa Police Chief Eric Stubbs confirmed that two autopsies have been completed, meaning funerals could be held early next week.",
    "Stubbs, who was also at the vigil, said it was important to him and his team to be there with the community.",
    "The accused aunt Anusha De-Zoysa told Global News Friday that Febrio came to Canada two years ago and was a \u201cquiet\u201d and \u201cgood student.\u201d However, she noted that his behaviour recently started to change.",
    "She says De-Zoysa stayed with relatives in Ottawa, before moving in with the Wickramasinghe family, but says he recently cut off his relatives.",
    "Police have yet to identify a possible motive for the killings, and none of the allegations against De-Zoysa have been proven in court. But those who attended the vigil Saturday to comfort and console their neighbours and friends still struggle with a key question: Why did this happen?",
    "Stubbs says his team is working on getting answers to the public as soon as possible.",
    "\u201cWhen there\u2019s something this impactful, there\u2019s a large appetite to find out why\u2026 But it\u2019s important that we be very measured in what we release to the public,\u201d he said.",
    "Stubbs says Ottawa police will continue to be there to support community leaders as the investigation goes on.",
    "\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, there\u2019s a lot of negativity and a lot of darkness with this, but I\u2019m seeing a lot of positivity as well\u2026 The people coming together and supporting each other is so important, and we\u2019re seeing that here now,\u201d he said."
