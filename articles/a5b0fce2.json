    "CH17 Loyalty CEO/Founder Jumar Preena with Food Studio Head of Commercial Louzanne Perera",
    "CH17 Loyalty inked a deal with Food Studio\u00a0 for privilege dining experiences for CH17 cardholders at two of the FS managed food courts in the city\u2019s most popular malls - One Galle Face & the Colombo City Centre mall.",
    "CH17 Loyalty plans to offer bigger discounts for selected card schemes to reward cardholders who have been loyal members of CH17 for a long period of time. \u201cWe thank all those who have been with us in our 11-year journey that has made CH17 the most sought after loyalty program provider in the country today,\u201d CEO/Founder Jumar Preena said.",
    "\u201cWe want to be different, by being attractive to the customer, purposeful to the retailer and unique in business. No charges are levied either from the vendor or the customer. We help the retailer\u2019s business by promoting them to our large customer base, and in return, they offer attractive discounts which are passed on in full to the customer.\u00a0 We are different to the loyalty or discount schemes most of the customers are used to, we offer privilege facility for 7 days of the week continuously for a period of 12 months (although limited to 3 months with Food Studio). Where else could you get these kinds of benefits? queried Jumar.",
    "\u201cWe have also developed a unique process for card authentication, which was developed at the request of Food Studio. This is to ensure 100% accuracy, absolutely no room for misuse or abuse of promo codes, which are widespread in other existing formats,\u201d he added.",
    "He also said the tie-up with Food Studio gives cardholders an opportunity to enjoy good food within a great ambiance.",
    "Food Studio Head of Commercial Louzanne Perera said:\u00a0 Engaging with and retaining our customers and giving them highest value has always been a top priority at Food Studio. We have found CH17 Loyalty to be a great service which will no doubt help us build greater relationships with our existing customers, whilst motivating a larger base to try out our food and beverage offerings. We are excited to see where this partnership will lead us.\u201d"
