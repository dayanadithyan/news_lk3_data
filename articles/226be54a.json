    "Colombo, April 29 (Daily Mirror)- Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said today President Ranil Wickremesinghe invited her on several occasions to take up a position and support the government.",
    "Ms Kumaratunga told reporters that she refused the invitation, claiming that she could not take up any position until thieves were there in politics.",
    "She said she was invited to take up the chairmanship of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and that she refused it too.",
    "\u201cI don't like to do politics with current politicians. I will not take up any key position in the party. But, I may take up some responsibility. I will support the party behind the scenes. The SLFP is gradually coming to the correct path,\u201d she said.",
    "Ms Kumaratunga said there was no truth in the reports that she was supporting the UNP and added that she had no intention of supporting any party.",
    "Responding to a question, she said the SLFP was not in a position to field a candidate for the upcoming presidential election. \u201cIt is too late. The SLFP is completely destroyed. It will take several years to rebuild the party,\u201d she said."
