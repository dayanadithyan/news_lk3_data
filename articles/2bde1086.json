    "A Russian military transport plane carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, six crew and three people accompanying them crashed on Wednesday morning in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region near Ukraine, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said.",
    "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what caused the crash, which occurred around 11 a.m. It was also not known if anyone survived.",
    "The authorities were investigating the cause of the crash, and a special military commission was on the way to the crash site, the Defense Ministry said.",
    "Earlier Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a major Russian missile attack that apparently was devised to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s air defenses had killed 18 people and injured 130. Ukraine is marking the 700th day since the full-scale invasion by Kremlin\u2019s forces started.",
    "The barrage employing more than 40 ballistic, cruise, anti-aircraft and guided missiles early Tuesday hit 130 residential buildings in three Ukrainian cities, \u201call ordinary houses,\u201d Zelenskyy said on X, formerly Twitter.",
    "Russia\u2019s onslaught, which included targets in the capital Kyiv and second-largest city Kharkiv, was the heaviest in weeks and lent weight to Zelenskyy\u2019s appeals for Western allies to provide more military aid.",
    "\u201cThis year, the main priority is to strengthen air defense to protect our cities and towns, as well as defend frontline positions,\u201d Zelenskyy said on X late Tuesday.",
    "With the 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) front line largely static amid icy weather and as both sides seek to replenish their weapons stockpiles, the war recently has focused on long-range strikes. Analysts say Russia stockpiled missiles to pursue a winter campaign of aerial bombardment, while Ukraine has sought to strike inside Russia with new types of drones.",
    "Russia may have employed decoy missiles in Tuesday\u2019s attack in an effort to open up holes in Ukraine\u2019s air defenses, a U.S. think tank said.",
    "The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Moscow is likely trying to acquire more ballistic missiles from foreign countries, including Iran and North Korea, because they may be more effective in some circumstances.",
    "A further barrage of Russian S-300 missiles struck residential districts of Kharkiv late Tuesday, injuring nine people and damaging residential buildings, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said.",
    "Russia denies its forces strike civilian areas, although there is substantial evidence to the contrary.",
    "The Russian Defense Ministry said that air defenses shot down four Ukrainian drones over the Oryol region of western Russia early Wednesday.",

    "Another Ukrainian drone was downed early Wednesday over the Belgorod border region, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov. He said there were no casualties or damage.",
    "Ukraine\u2019s allies have promised to keep sending military aid packages, even though their resources are stretched. Help from the United States, by far Ukraine\u2019s single biggest provider, has also hit political snags.",
    "The German defense ministry announced Wednesday that it plans to send six SEA KING Mk41 multi-role helicopters from Bundeswehr stocks to Ukraine.",
    "Since the beginning of the war military deliveries from Germany have amounted to around 6 billion euros ($6.52 billion), including substantial anti-aircraft and air defense systems, the government said.",
    "There were 63 people on board, Russian media reported. All of them died",
