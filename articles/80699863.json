    "PARIS (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday for the first time publicly apologized to Ukraine for a monthslong congressional holdup in American military assistance that let Russia make gains on the battlefield.",
    "The apology came as Biden met in Paris with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who appealed for bipartisan U.S. support going forward \u201clike it was during World War II.\u201d",
    "A day earlier, the two had attended ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, where Biden had drawn common cause between the allied forces that helped free Europe from Nazi Germany and today\u2019s effort to support Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion and Zelenskyy had been greeted with a rapt ovation.",
    "\u201cI apologize for those weeks of not knowing what\u2019s going to happen in terms of funding,\u201d Biden said, referring to the six-month holdup by conservative Republicans in Congress to a $61 billion military aid package for Ukraine. Still, the Democratic president insisted that the American people were standing by Ukraine for the long haul. \u201cWe\u2019re still in. Completely. Thoroughly,\u201d he said."
