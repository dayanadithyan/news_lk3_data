    "Colombo, Jan 20 (Daily Mirror) - Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa in a letter addressed to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene has requested him to postpone the debate on the Online Safety Bill which is to be taken up for debate next week.",
    "\u201cThe proposed Bill if enacted in its present form will provide provisions for the Online Safety Commission and the Subject Minister dictatorial powers. This will violate people\u2019s right to express themselves. This will also help the government in power to fulfill its political aspirations,\u201d Premadasa said in his letter.",
    "\u201cAll parties which support the Bill will have to bear responsibility for the consequences which internationally reputed online service providers will suffer as a result of the legislation. Therefore, we request you to postpone the debate and provide sufficient space of time for all stakeholders to have a further discussion on the Bill. This is a procedure which a number of countries have followed when introducing similar legislation,\u201d he added."
