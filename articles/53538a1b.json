    "Colombo, Feb 23 - The United States remains committed to the economic growth and prosperity of Sri Lanka, Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Richard Verma told government, civil society and economic leaders during his February 23 to 24 visit to Sri Lanka.",
    "Verma met President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Minister Ali Sabry to discuss the progress on Sri Lanka\u2019s IMF programme, including inclusive economic and governance reforms aimed at keeping Sri Lanka on the path to sustainable economic growth.",
    "Deputy Secretary Verma stressed the vital need to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression. They also explored opportunities to deepen defense and maritime cooperation between the United States and Sri Lanka, including strengthening the Sri Lanka Navy\u2019s capabilities to safeguard national security and promote a more stable Indo-Pacific region.",
    "On February 23, aboard the SLNS Vijayabahu, one of three former U.S. Coast Guard cutters transferred by the United States to Sri Lanka, Deputy Secretary Verma said, \u201cI am pleased to announce that the Department of State has notified Congress of our intent to transfer a fourth medium endurance cutter to Sri Lanka.\u00a0 The Department obligated $9 million in Foreign Military Financing to support this effort.\u00a0 We look forward to offering the cutter, pending the completion of Congress\u2019 notification period.\u00a0 If completed, this transfer would further strengthen defense cooperation between the United States and Sri Lanka.\u00a0 The ship would increase Sri Lanka\u2019s ability to patrol its Exclusive Economic Zone, monitor its search and rescue area, and provide additional security for ships from all nations that transit the busy sea lanes of the Indian Ocean.\u201d",
    "Participating in the announcement at Colombo Port were Sri Lanka State Minister of Defense Premitha Bandara Tennakoon, Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, and U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung, who remarked, \u201cThe United States has previously transferred three cutters to the Sri Lankan Navy, which deploys these ships for maritime operations and law enforcement missions, countering human trafficking and drug trafficking, while supporting humanitarian assistance and disaster response efforts. The eventual transfer of a fourth vessel would be just one more point in a long history of cooperation between Sri Lanka and the United States in preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\u201d",
    "Deputy Secretary Verma also visited the site of the West Container Terminal (WCT), a deepwater shipping container terminal in the Port of Colombo. The WCT, currently being constructed by Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) Private Limited with $553 million in financing from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, will provide critical infrastructure for the South Asian region. Operating near capacity since 2021, the Port of Colombo\u2019s new addition will be the port\u2019s deepest terminal and aims to boost Colombo\u2019s shipping capacity, expanding its role as a premiere logistics hub connecting major routes and markets, boosting prosperity for Sri Lanka without adding to its sovereign debt.",
    "Richard R. Verma serves as the Deputy Secretary of State for Management & Resources. In this role, he acts as the Chief Operating Officer of the Department, and leads the Department\u2019s efforts on modernization, foreign assistance, and a wide range of workforce and strategic issues. Deputy Secretary Verma previously served as the U.S. Ambassador to India, where he led one of the largest U.S. diplomatic missions and championed historic progress in bilateral ties."
