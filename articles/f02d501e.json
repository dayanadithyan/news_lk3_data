    "\u201cI challenged this move in the Cabinet and was able to get some of the visa fees reduced. However, I had to carry out my duty of maintaining the collective responsibility,\u201d he said.",
    "Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa who also joined the crosstalk in the House said Dr. de Silva has been subjected to death threats by some MPs if he continues to probe the visa issue.",
