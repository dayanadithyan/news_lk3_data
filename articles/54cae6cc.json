  "original_body_lines": [
    "Stresses SL must achieve an economic growth of 4-5% beyond IMF\u2019s 3% forecast",
    "Says\u00a0 targeted incentives for growth sectors critical - a negotiation SL has to undertake",
    "Points out SL can\u2019t expect revenues to go up by simply increasing VAT to 18 percent on every possible product",
    "Sri Lanka may need to consider a targeted stimulus package to boost growth in productivity sectors upon\u00a0completion of the on-going debt restructuring exercise, Sri Lanka Banks\u2019 Association Chief said.",
    "SLBA Chairman and Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Bingumal Thewarathanthri asserted that it remains critical for Sri Lanka to at least achieve an economic growth of 4-5 percent beyond IMF\u2019s forecasted 3 percent over the next few years.",
    "\u201cThe real challenge is whether the IMF forecasted growth of 3 percent is enough or should we look at 4-5 percent growth? We need to seriously look at where growth is coming from and we might have to look at a targeted stimulus. I am not talking about giving incentives to everybody, but targeted incentives for growth sectors would be critical.\u00a0 That\u2019s a negotiation we have to undertake,\u201d he said.",
    "Thewarathanthri made these observations addressing a panel discussion under the theme \u2018Sustaining Stability\u2019 organised by Central Bank last Thursday.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s something for policymakers to sit and understand where we can stimulate a little bit and let the growth come. This would be critical for any government,\u201d he added.",
    "Thewarathanthri also pointed out that the country\u2019s economy would not be able to cope if the skilled migration continues to keep up at the current levels.",
    "\u201cWe all agree there is a massive brain drain in the country. It\u2019s a staggering number; we have lost thousands of people in the banking sector along with every sector. Can we go on like this for another two years? I don\u2019t think so. Especially, the lower end of executive cadre, they are really suffering with taxation and inflation that we have gone through last two years,\u201d he added.",
    "On the other hand, he stressed that Sri Lanka\u2019s tax structure and investment facilitation should also be competitive with other emerging markets to attract investments.",
    "\u201cNew companies will look at opportunities at other markets as well, because you are competing with other emerging markets. We should not think that companies will come with all the conditions we have,\u201d he said.",
    "Thewarathanthri opined that policymakers should take up these ground realities with the IMF to come up with solutions.",
    "\u201cWe are agreeable for a larger part of the programme, but on certain things, we should be open- minded to negotiate.",
    "We can\u2019t expect the revenues to go up by simply increasing the VAT to 18 percent on every possible product. it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
    "He cautioned against the dire consequences of granting subsidies and fiscal incentives in an ad-hoc manner at the request of certain industry groups.",
    "\u201cWe should be data-driven, carefully thought through; we shouldn\u2019t give stimulus packages just because particular business communities are complaining, as we have done in the past. We had given subsidies for everyone; we should never get into that,\u201d he said.",
    "Having said that, Thewarathanthri asserted the only path for Sri Lanka not to fall into another default is to continue with the current IMF programme.",
    "\u201cThe reality is that we have to stay with the programme. Argentina is a classic example, we can relate a little bit.\u00a0 Moving away from policies and moving away from the path continuously along with political changes are things we shouldn\u2019t do. So staying on the path and IMF will be critical,\u201d he added."
