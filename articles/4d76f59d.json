    "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s approach to the war in Gaza is a \u201cmistake,\u201d U.S. President Joe Biden said in an interview published on Tuesday, offering further criticism of Israel\u2019s handling of the conflict.",
    "\u201cI think what he\u2019s doing is a mistake. I don\u2019t agree with his approach,\u201d Biden said in comments to Univision, a U.S. Spanish-language TV network.",
    "Biden has also previously called Israel\u2019s bombing in Gaza \u201cindiscriminate,\u201d and its military actions \u201cover the top.\u201d",
    "The White House said last week that the president, in a call with Netanyahu, threatened to make conditional, U.S. support for Israel\u2019s offensive on it taking concrete steps to protect aid workers and civilians. That call followed an Israeli airstrike that killed seven staff of the aid group World Central Kitchen.",
    "\u201cWhat I\u2019m calling for is for the Israelis to just call for a ceasefire, allow for the next six, eight weeks, total access to all food and medicine going into the country,\u201d Biden said in Tuesday\u2019s interview.",
    "Israel\u2019s military assault on Gaza, has been the subject of mounting international criticism. Domestically, Biden has also faced months of protests, from anti-war activists, Muslims and Arab Americans across the country, who have demanded a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and restrictions on U.S. military assistance for Israel.",
    "Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack, on Israel killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel\u2019s subsequent military assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has killed over 33,000, according to the local health ministry, displaced nearly all of its 2.3 million population and led to genocide allegations that Israel denies. The coastal enclave also suffers widespread hunger.",
    "Israel has received more U.S. foreign aid than any other country since World War II, although annual assistance has been dwarfed for two years by funding and military equipment sent to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion.",
    "The United States has traditionally shielded Israel in the U.N. Security Council and vetoed three draft resolutions on the war in Gaza. It abstained last month when the Security Council demanded an immediate ceasefire."
