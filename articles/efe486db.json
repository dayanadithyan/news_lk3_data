    "Forty countries from the Asia and Pacific region today agreed that transforming agrifood systems was imperative to providing food security for their children\u2019s generation and beyond, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reported today.",
    "The summation was delivered at today\u2019s close of the 37th Session of the FAO Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific (APRC37) in Colombo. The conference was hosted by the Government of Sri Lanka.",
    "Forty countries of Asia and the Pacific attended the APRC, with the vast majority attending in-person, including some 20 government Ministers.",
    "It was the first time since 2018 that a large in-person gathering of the region\u2019s food and agriculture Ministers and other policymakers was convened by FAO, and is seen as emblematic of the attention needed to recover from the pandemic and disruptions caused to food production and distribution that has plagued many countries in the region ever since.",
    "The global pandemic, coupled or followed closely with a shortage of food, feed fuel, fertilizer and access to finance, caused food price to jump significantly. Lessons were learned and many called it a \u2018wake-up call\u2019 to ensure that food affordability and availability and agricultural production must be a global priority.",
    "\u201cFood and agriculture are now at the centre of the global development agenda and this is an opportunity for all of us, including civil society and private sector organizations to decisively reimagine and reshape agrifood systems for global economic, social and environmental benefits,\u201d said Jong-Jin Kim, FAO\u2019s Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Asia and the Pacific. \u201cThis transformation will be important for you to maintain a sustainable environment and increase biodiversity, while providing opportunities for decent jobs for people. That is the added value of modern farming,\u201d Kim said to the delegates at the end of the four-day conference.",
    "Kim called on the FAO Member Nations gathered to address these issues holistically. \u201cWe must do this together with all relevant key partners, not only with the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, but also with Ministers for Welfare, Women, Children, Environment, Science, Education, Trade Investment and Finance. These are their duties too. So, we must work together as a team.\u201d",
    "\u201cScience and Technology are constantly evolving. In the agrifood sector, we should lead,\u201d said Kim. \u201cAgriculture, food and nutrition are at the core of humanity\u2019s needs \u2013 and the world casts its eyes towards Asia and the Pacific region for leadership. As the Director-General said \u2013 we are the Agents of Change,\u201d Kim added, referring to the opening statement to the conference by the FAO Director-General, Dr QU Dongyu.",
    "Conclusions and recommendations going forward \u2013 Better Production, Better Nutrition, Better Environment and a Better Life \u2013 leaving no one behind.",
    "In the final report to the APRC \u2013 FAO\u2019s regional governing body \u2013 it acknowledged several important points for further action by FAO and other actors.",
    "It noted \u2018the main challenges facing the region relate to its ability to sustainably increase productivity and innovation, particularly in the face of resource limitations, climate change risks and the region\u2019s growing population as the medium- and long-term outlook highlights\u2019 and emphasized the importance of transparent, predictable, open and fair markets, underpinned by an effective multilateral trading system, for food security.\u2019",
    "The report went on to recognize \u2018the importance of digital innovations and blended finance, engaging the private sector in mobilizing resources for resilient, inclusive and sustainable agrifood systems transformation. It also highlighted the need to focus on specific issues including local food systems, low carbon, resilient and sustainable practices, and water issues; strengthen efficient, inclusive and resilient value chains and markets; boost initiatives under the Paris Agreement; and develop global standards for biosecurity and food safety, important for agrifood systems, early warning systems and anticipatory action.\u2019",
    "Transforming capture fisheries and aquaculture towards sustainability in Asia and the Pacific region",
    "The report highlighted the Asia-Pacific \u2018region\u2019s leadership in capture fisheries and aquaculture, contributing with over 70 percent of global production; the aquaculture sector is projected to grow by over 20 percent by 2030. It also acknowledged that when managed and developed sustainably, aquatic food systems, in both marine and freshwaters, including aquaculture and fisheries of the region, contributed significantly to improving food and nutrition security and livelihoods, specifically enhancing women\u2019s participation along the value chain.\u2019",
    "The Conference welcomed FAO\u2019s Blue Transformation vision in the context of Asia and the Pacific region \u2018to increase the contribution of fisheries, aquaculture and aquatic foods value chains to provide a more significant proportion of nutritious food and resilient livelihoods in the region, while recognizing that Blue Transformation promotes sustainable aquaculture intensification, effective management of all fisheries and upgraded value chains to ensure the social, economic and environmental viability of aquatic food systems.\u2019"
