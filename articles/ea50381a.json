  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Sri Lankan Speaker\u2019s Office has deemed recent reports surrounding the much-disputed Online Safety Bill as \u2018ill-informed and baseless\u2019, while rejecting claims that the Bill was passed in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s determination.",
    "Issuing a clarification to the public in response to allegations regarding the passing of the Bill, the Speaker\u2019s Office highlighted that due to the legislative process of the Parliament involving both, the Attorney General\u2019s Department and the Legal Draftsman\u2019s Department, it is unlikely that a Bill would be passed in violation of the determination of the Supreme Court.",
    "\u201cThere is no opportunity to act in a manner that is not in accordance with a Supreme Court determination regarding a Bill or in violation of the Constitution\u201d, the statement read in this regard.",
    "The Speaker\u2019s Office provided a detailed explanation of the due process followed when passing a Bill and its process of enactment in a bid to \u2018set the record straight\u2019 and to prevent the public from being \u2018duped\u2019.",
    "Thus, The Speaker\u2019s Office assured that while the Online Safety Bill was passed in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s determination, those parliamentarians who still claim otherwise are urged to \u201cspecifically mention what recommendations were ignored\u201d, so that the relevant authorities could respond to these allegations accordingly.",
    "\u201cThe Speaker has no discretion on such matters\u201d, the statement further read, emphasising that the Parliament Speaker has no discretion to enact laws and make amendments to Bills."
