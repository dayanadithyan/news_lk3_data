  "original_body_lines": [
    "Scientists have discovered a previously undocumented species of giant anaconda in the Amazon which they say can grow up to 7.5m and weighing close to 500kg, making it the largest and heaviest snake yet known in the world.",
    "Until now, four species of anacondas were known, with the largest one \u2013 the green anaconda \u2013 inhabiting tropical parts of South America such as the basins of the Amazon, Orinoco, and Esequibo rivers, as well as some smaller watersheds.",
    "These anacondas, found in the rivers and wetlands of South America, are well known for their lightning speed and ability to squeeze the life out of prey by coiling around, asphyxiating them, and swallowing them whole.",
    "A newly published decades-long study has now found that the green anaconda is genetically two different species.",
    "Researchers working with the indigenous Waorani people captured and studied several specimens of the newly named northern green anaconda (Eunectes akayima) in the Bameno region of Baihuaeri Waorani Territory in the Ecuadorian Amazon.",
    "The species was found during filming for National Geographic\u2019s Disney+ series Pole to Pole with Will Smith.",
    "Scientists documented several anacondas belonging to the new species \u201clurking in the shallows, lying in wait for prey\u201d as they paddled canoes down the Amazonian river system.",
    "\u201cThe size of these magnificent creatures was incredible \u2013 one female anaconda we encountered measured an astounding 6.3 metres long,\u201d study co-author Bryan Fry from the University of Queensland said in a statement.\u201dThere are anecdotal reports from the Waorani people of other anacondas in the area measuring more than 7.5 metres long and weighing around 500 kilograms,\u201d Dr Fry said.",
    "The new species, described in the journal Diversity, diverged from the previously known southern green anaconda about 10 million years ago, differing genetically from it by 5.5 per cent.",
    "To put this in perspective, humans differ from chimpanzees by only about 2 per cent.",
    "The finding, according to researchers, is pivotal for the conservation of anacondas, which are apex predators and vital to maintaining balance in their ecosystems.",
    "A healthy anaconda population means their ecosystems are vibrant with ample food resources and clean water, while declining numbers of the snake may indicate environmental distress, scientists say.",
    "\u201cSo knowing which anaconda species exist, and monitoring their numbers, is crucial,\u201d researchers write in The Conversation.",
    "The anacondas and their habitats are under increasing threat from land fragmentation caused by industrialised agriculture, forest fire, drought, climate change, as well as heavy metal pollution linked to spills from oil extraction activities.",
    "\u201cOf particular urgency is research into how petrochemicals from oil spills are affecting the fertility and reproductive biology of these rare snakes,\u201d Dr Fry said."
