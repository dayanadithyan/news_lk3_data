  "original_body_lines": [
    "US President Joe Biden has angrily criticised an investigation that found he mishandled top secret files and said he struggled to recall key life events.",
    "In a surprise news briefing on Thursday evening, Mr Biden insisted: \u201cMy memory is fine.\u201d",
    "He slammed a claim that he could not recollect when his son died, saying: \u201cHow the hell dare he raise that?\u201d",
    "The inquiry found Mr Biden \u201cwilfully retained and disclosed\u201d classified files, but decided not to charge him.",
    "Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Hur determined Mr Biden had improperly kept classified documents related to military and foreign policy in Afghanistan after serving as vice-president.",
    "The scathing 345-page report, released earlier in the day, said the president\u2019s memory had \u201csignificant limitations\u201d.",
    "Mr Hur interviewed the 81-year-old president over five hours as part of the inquiry.",
    "The special counsel, a Republican appointed to the role by Biden attorney general Merrick Garland, said Mr Biden could not recall when he was vice-president (from 2009-2017), or \u201ceven within several years, when his son Beau died\u201d (2015).",
    "At Thursday night\u2019s news conference, an emotional Mr Biden lashed out at the passages casting doubt on his recollection of events.",
    "\u201cFrankly, when I was asked the question I thought to myself, was none of their damn business,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to remind me when he [Beau Biden] passed away.\u201d",
    "He said he was \u201cvery occupied... in the middle of handling an international crisis\u201d when he was interviewed by the special counsel from 8-9 October last year - just as the Israel-Gaza war erupted.",
    "The inquiry also said Mr Biden had shared some of the sensitive material from hand-written notebooks with a ghostwriter for his memoir, a finding that the president denied from the podium.",
    "The special counsel concluded it would be difficult to convict the president of improper handling of files because \u201cat trial, Mr Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\u201d.",
    "Opinion polls indicate the president\u2019s age is a concern for US voters ahead of November\u2019s White House election. But Mr Biden told reporters on Thursday he was the most qualified candidate.",
    "\u201cI am well-meaning,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd am elderly. I know what the hell I\u2019m doing. I put this country back on its feet.",
    "However even as he sought to rebut reporters\u2019 questions about his age and mental acuity, he inadvertently referred Egyptian leader Abdul Fattah al-Sisi as the \u201cpresident of Mexico\u201d.",
    "Asked to comment on the latest in the Israel-Gaza war, he said: \u201cI think as you know initially, the president of Mexico, Sisi, did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in.\u201d",
    "Asked whether he took responsibility for having classified documents in his home, Mr Biden blamed his staff.",
    "He said he didn\u2019t know they had put sensitive memos in his garage, where the special counsel says they were located next to a dog bed.",
    "A BBC reporter at the White House\u2019s Diplomatic Reception Room described the atmosphere as tense.",
    "When one journalist said the American people were concerned about his age, Mr Biden raised his voice in reply: \u201cThat is your judgement, that is your judgement.\u201d",
    "He insisted that his memory is \u201cfine\u201d and \u201chas not gotten worse\u201d during his presidency.",
    "Mr Biden\u2019s legal team also criticised the special counsel\u2019s remarks about Mr Biden\u2019s apparent memory lapses.",
    "\u201cThe report uses highly prejudicial language to describe a commonplace occurrence among witnesses: a lack of recall of years-old events,\u201d wrote White House lawyer Richard Sauber in a letter attached to the report.",
    "The top secret files were found at Mr Biden\u2019s house in Wilmington, Delaware, and former private office from 2022-23.",
    "The discovery came after a separate investigation charged former President Donald Trump, 77, with mishandling classified documents following his departure from the White House. He faces a trial in that case this May.",
    "The Hur report distinguishes between both cases, saying Mr Biden handed over the documents to government archivists, while Mr Trump \u201callegedly did the opposite\u201d.",
    "\u201cAccording to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it,\u201d the report says about Mr Trump.",
    "Mr Trump, in response, said his classified files trial should be cancelled by the justice department prosecutor.",
    "\u201cIf Special Counsel Jack Smith wants to do good for our Country, and help to unify it, he should drop all Litigation against Joe Biden\u2019s Political Opponent, ME, and let our Country HEAL,\u201d the Republican White House frontrunner posted on his platform, Truth Social."
