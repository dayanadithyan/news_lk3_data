    "SMMTs became most visited place of purchase for 22% of\u00a0 lower-middle-income consumers",
    "Small groceries remained as most visited place of purchase\u00a0 among 44% lower-middle-class consumers",
    "The Small Medium Modern Trade (SMMT) outlets are\u00a0 rapidly capturing the attention of Sri Lanka\u2019s middle class,\u00a0 with the traditional retailers swiftly adapting to this shifting\u00a0 retail landscape.\u00a0 A recent survey by Colombo-based independent research agency\u00a0 Sparkwinn Research indicated that this trend is driven by the changing\u00a0 consumer behaviour patterns, influenced by the soaring cost of living. According to the findings of the survey, the SMMTs became\u00a0 the most visited place of purchase for 22 percent of lower-middleincome (Rs.50,000-100,000 monthly income) consumers, up from 15\u00a0 percent three months ago.",
    "The small groceries remained as the most\u00a0 visited place of purchase among 44 percent of the lower-middleclass consumers, down from 50 percent three months ago, while the\u00a0 share of the lower-middle-class shoppers in the supermarket chains\u00a0 remain unchanged.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the SMMTs became the most visited place of retail\u00a0 shopping among 24 percent of the upper-middle-class segment\u00a0 (Rs.101,000-200,000 monthly income), up from 18 percent three\u00a0 months ago. At the same time, there was a noteworthy decline in\u00a0 the upper-middle-class consumer choosing the supermarket chains\u00a0 as their preferred place of shopping, with only 25 percent of these\u00a0 consumers stating the supermarket chains as their most visited place\u00a0 of retail shopping, down from 32 percent three months ago. \u201cThe SMMT and wholesale stores are preferred by the middleclass consumers for better deals and discounts, budgeted purchases\u00a0 and satisfactory customer service. The Small/Medium Modern\u00a0 Outlets will be future of retail, as the traditional retailers are gradually\u00a0 upgrading themselves to provide an enhanced shopping experience,\u201d\u00a0 Sparkwinn noted.\u00a0 However, the supermarket chains continued to gain traction among\u00a0 the high income (above Rs.201,000 monthly income) consumers, with\u00a0 nearly two-thirds of the segments choosing the supermarket chains as\u00a0 their preferred choice of retail shopping.\u00a0 According to some surveyed middle-class consumers, close proximity,\u00a0 deep discounts, low price, product availability and customer service\u00a0 attracted them to the SMMTs, compared to the large supermarket chains.\u00a0 As the consumers put more focus on preserving their limited\u00a0 financial resources, the survey revealed that they have prioritised\u00a0 cutting down expenses, along with the adoption of different\u00a0 coping mechanisms.",
    "Focus on \u2018Putting Food on Table\u2019\u00a0 drives consumer buying patterns",
    "With the price hikes of food items\u00a0 becoming the single largest concern\u00a0 among all consumer segments, the\u00a0 consumer focus has shifted to \u2018Putting\u00a0 Food on the Table\u2019, while preserving\u00a0 their limited financial resources. This\u00a0 also reflects low levels of confidence\u00a0 on the current personal finance and\u00a0 local economy.\u00a0 In particular, for the middle class,\u00a0 the higher transportation cost,\u00a0 better discounts and higher prices\u00a0 at their usual place of shopping\u00a0 drove them to shift from their\u00a0 current place of shopping. In addition, the middle-class\u00a0 consumers have shifted their buying\u00a0 habits, in terms of frequency, in\u00a0 order to stretch their rupee as far\u00a0 as possible.",
    "\u201cThe consumers who previously\u00a0 purchased groceries on a monthly\u00a0 basis are now shopping weekly or\u00a0 twice a month. This includes staples\u00a0 like rice, which used to be purchased\u00a0 on a monthly basis but in current\u00a0 times being bought more frequently. When the groceries are purchased\u00a0 more often (weekly basis) than in\u00a0 bulk, the consumers are able to better\u00a0 budget their money throughout the\u00a0 month, thus, ensuring they have\u00a0 enough cash on hand to cover the\u00a0 other expenses,\u201d it elaborated. Interestingly, the report highlighted\u00a0 the visits to the traditional \u201cPola\u201d\u00a0 markets and smaller grocery shops\u00a0 are decreasing. \u201cThe reason is, the \u201cPola\u201d sellers\u00a0 often set their own prices and require\u00a0 minimum purchases, while the smaller\u00a0 shops may have higher prices overall,\u00a0 compared to the supermarkets and\u00a0 wholesale stores,\u201d it stated. Retrospectively, the consumers\u00a0 continue to visit the supermarkets\u00a0 to buy vegetables and fruits, due\u00a0 to the convenience of standardised\u00a0 pricing and the option to purchase\u00a0 small quantities."
