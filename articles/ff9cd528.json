    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Colombo Port City, which will soon be renamed as the International Financial and Technological City, is awaiting Central Bank clearance for its banking regulations, Saliya Wickramasuriya, a member of its regulatory commission said.",
    "The Colombo Port City is a multi-currency special economic zone (dollarized) that will be free of exchange controls. Some of the laws in the country, such as the Employment Termination Act, do not apply to the special economic area.",
    "In several other listed laws it has to recommend exemptions which have to be approved by the Minister or President.",
    "The Port City Commission has to work with the relevant agency in charge of the law, like the Central bank in relation to banking, the Department of Immigration for visas or Customs in preparing special regulations to apply within its jurisdiction.",
    "Banks operating within the special economic zone will be licensed by either the central bank or the country it is incorporated in.",
    "\u201cThere was a meeting yesterday between some of our members and the Central Bank,\u201d Wickramasuriya told a public forum at the central bank.",
    "\u201cI understand that those regulations have now been discussed and pretty much finalised.\u201d",
    "Authorised Persons \u2013 or businesses approved to operate in the area \u2013 have to bring capital from abroad.",
    "Foreign exchange controls will not apply to the area. But no rupees are supposed to be used there, except in some retail shops.",
    "\u201cThere were some concerns that the central bank had around preventing a leakage of money that is, here,\u201d he explained.",
    "Initially a separate financial regulatory authority was proposed which would come under the central bank\u2019s monetary board, operating under a different set of regulations.",
    "\u201cWhy? The objective of one is, simply put, to attract money that is not here into Sri Lanka for the purpose of development and investment,\u201d he said",
    "\u201cOne of the objectives of the Central Bank, apart from its other policy responsibilities, is to prevent leakage of money that is here, outside.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s highly possible, in my humble opinion, that these two cannot be done by the same regulation.",
    "\u201cBecause one is designed to prevent and the other one is designed to attract. And right now, we are still, I believe, in the process of unravelling this, this confusion about what is more important.",
    "\u201cIs it more important to prevent money from here, going somewhere else? Or is it more important to bring money that is not here, from somewhere else, here?\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s monetary instability started with the setting up of the central bank in 1950 and worsened from 1978 after International Monetary Funds\u2019s Second Amendment left it without a credible anchor, analysts have pointed out.",
    "Foreign exchange controls exist in the rest of the country since the central bank prints money to narrowly target a policy rate through inflationary open market operations and easy standing facilities while operating a de facto pegged exchange rate (trying to collect foreign reserves).",
    "There have been calls to bring legal restraints against the central bank\u2019s ability to mis-target rates (independent monetary policy), trigger forex shortages, currency depreciation, capital flight, high inflation, social unrest and impoverishment through debasement.\u00a0 (Colombo/Mar14/2024)"
