  "original_body_lines": [
    "Israel on Sunday hailed its successful air defenses in the face of an unprecedented attack by Iran, saying it and its allies thwarted 99% of the more than 300 drones and missiles launched toward its territory. But regional tensions remain high, amid fears of further escalation in the event of a possible Israeli counter-strike.",
    "U.S. President Joe Biden said he would convene a meeting of the Group of Seven advanced democracies on Sunday \u201cto coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran\u2019s brazen attack.\u201d The language indicated that the Biden administration does not want Iran\u2019s assault to spiral into a broader military conflict.",
    "Iran launched the attack in response to a strike widely blamed on Israel on an Iranian consular building in Syria earlier this month which killed two Iranian generals. Israel said Iran launched 170 drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles early Sunday.",
    "By Sunday morning, Iran said the attack was over and Israel reopened its air space.",
    "The two foes have for years been engaged in a shadow war marked by incidents like the Damascus strike. But Sunday\u2019s assault, which set off air raid sirens across Israel, was the first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel, despite decades of enmity dating back to the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
    "Israel has over the years established \u2013 often with the help of the United States \u2014 a multilayered air-defense network that includes systems capable of intercepting a variety of threats including long-range missiles, cruise missiles, drones and short-range rockets.",
    "That system, along with collaboration with the U.S. and other forces, helped thwart what could have been a far more devastating assault at a time when Israel is already bogged down in its war against Hamas in Gaza and engaged in low-level fighting on its northern border with Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militia. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran.",
    "Israeli and U.S. officials lauded the response to the aerial assault.",
    "\u201cIran launched more than 300 threats and 99% were intercepted,\u201d said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman. \u201cThat is a success.\u201d Asked if Israel would respond, Hagari said the country would do what was needed to protect its citizens.",
    "Hagari said that none of the drones and cruise missiles reached Israel and that only a few of the ballistic missiles got through. He said that of the cruise missiles, 25 were shot down by the Israeli air force.",
    "Hagari said minor damage was caused to an Israeli airbase, but he said it was still functioning. Rescuers said a 7-year-old girl was seriously wounded in southern Israel, apparently in a missile strike, though they said police were still investigating the circumstances of her injuries.",
    "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a short message on X, formerly Twitter: \u201cWe intercepted. We blocked. Together, we will win.\u201d",
    "Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also celebrated the results, thanking the U.S. and other countries for their assistance. He said Israel needs to remain vigilant and prepare for any scenario, but called the interceptions a \u201cgreat success.\u201d",
    "Israel announced it reopened its airspace, loosening one restriction it had imposed ahead of the strike, although schools remained closed around the country. Neighboring Jordan also reopened its airspace.",
    "Gen. Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, said the operation was over, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.",
    "\u201cWe have no intention of continuing the operation against Israel,\u201d he was quoted as saying.",
    "Israel may be particularly proud of the success of its defense because it stands in sharp contrast to the failures it endured during Hamas\u2019 attack on Oct. 7. Facing a far less powerful enemy in Hamas, Israel\u2019s border defenses collapsed and the military took days to repel the marauding militants \u2013 an embarrassing defeat for the Middle East\u2019s strongest and best-equipped army.",
    "While thwarting the Iranian onslaught could help restore Israel\u2019s image, what it does next will be closely watched both in the region and in Western capitals.",
    "In Washington, Biden said U.S. forces helped Israel down \u201cnearly all\u201d the drones and missiles and pledged to convene allies to develop a unified response.",
    "Biden, who had cut short a weekend stay at his Delaware beach house to meet with his national security team at the White House on Saturday afternoon, spoke with Netanyahu later in the day.",
    "\u201cI told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks \u2013 sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel,\u201d Biden said.",
    "In a statement Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. does \u201cnot seek escalation,\u201d and would hold talks with its allies in the coming days.",
    "The U.S., along with its allies, has sent direct messages to Tehran to warn against further escalating the conflict. Leaders from the G7 will hold a video conference on Sunday early afternoon to discuss the Iranian strikes against Israel, according to Italy, which holds the presidency of the group of developed countries, which includes the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, and Canada.",
    "Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard issued a new threat against the U.S. \u201cThe terrorist U.S. government is warned any support or participation in harming Iran\u2019s interests will be followed by decisive and regretting response by Iran\u2019s armed forces,\u201d said a statement carried by IRNA.",
    "Iran had vowed revenge since the April 1 airstrike in Syria, for which Tehran held Israel responsible. Israel hasn\u2019t publicly commented on it.",
    "Israel and Iran have been on a collision course throughout Israel\u2019s six-month war against Hamas militants in Gaza, triggered by the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. On that day, militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, also backed by Iran, killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others.",
    "An Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,000 people, according to local health officials.",
    "Negotiations underway, meant to bring about a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the hostages, appeared to hit a setback Sunday. Netanyahu\u2019s office said that Hamas rejected the latest proposal for a deal, which had been presented to Hamas a week ago by mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States.",
    "A Hamas official said the group wants a \u201cclear written commitment\u201d that Israel will withdraw from the Gaza Strip during the second of a three-phase cease-fire deal. The deal presented to the sides calls for a six-week cease-fire in Gaza, during which Hamas would release 40 of the more than 100 hostages the group is holding in the enclave in exchange for 900 Palestinian prisoners from Israel\u2019s jails, including 100 serving long sentences for serious crimes.",
    "Hamas welcomed Iran\u2019s attack, saying it was \u201ca natural right and a deserved response\u201d to the strike in Syria and urged the Iran-backed groups in the region to continue to support Hamas in the war against Israel.",
    "Almost immediately after the war erupted, Hezbollah began attacking Israel\u2019s northern border. The two sides have been involved in daily exchanges of fire, while Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen have launched rockets and missiles toward Israel."
