    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The benchmarks, revenue and expenditure figures agreed to with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cannot be changed, Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "At a Q&A with heads of media organisations held on Wednesday August 07, Wickremesinghe said the IMF has not changed their position on benchmarks agreed to with any country.",
    "\u201cWe have entered an agreement with the IMF, and we have to implement it. If we implement it as we go along, there won\u2019t be a problem for Sri Lanka,\u201d he said.",
    "Wickremesinghe was responding to a question about statements made by opposition parties that they would renegotiate the terms of Sri Lanka\u2019s IMF agreement.",
    "\u201cNow others are coming up with various proposals, that they want to change. Then they must tell what they\u2019re going to do. One thing about the IMF is that the benchmarks will not be changed. They have never changed it for any country,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe benchmarks are there. For instance, you want to give something free from some place and you want to increase VAT to 25 percent. If the numbers are agreeable, they will say yes. But you can\u2019t change the benchmarks and the revenue figures and the expenditure figures,\u201d he said."
