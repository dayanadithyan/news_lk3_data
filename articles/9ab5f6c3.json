    "Sajith Premadasa, the presidential candidate of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), pledged to usher in a transformative era for Sri Lanka\u2019s healthcare system after September 21.",
    "Speaking at a health conference held in Colombo, Premadasa outlined: \u201cAfter the 21st, we will have the opportunity to address the critical issues that have long plagued our health system.\u201d",
    "He further emphasized that transforming Sri Lanka\u2019s healthcare infrastructure cannot rely solely on traditional public investment and funding. Instead, he advocated for a fresh approach that includes a robust foster care system for every Medical Officer of Health (MOH) division and hospital across the country.",
    "Premadasa proposed the introduction of a charity system to supplement government funding. \u201cWhile various stakeholders often highlight allocations as a percentage of GDP, we need to recognize that government investment alone is insufficient to revitalize our health system,\u201d he noted.",
    "The SJB candidate also highlighted the importance of preventive healthcare programs. He acknowledged the existing preventive initiatives under the MOH divisions and pledged to enhance these efforts to ensure healthier lives for all Sri Lankans."
