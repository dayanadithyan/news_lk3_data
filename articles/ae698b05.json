    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Opposition parties the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and National People\u2019s Power (NPP) maintained a strong lead in a Sri Lanka parliamentary election voting-intent poll for May conducted by an independent research institute.",
    "The Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) carried out by the Institute for Health Policy (IHP) found little changes in voting intention amongst all adults surveyed in May 2024. Support for the SJB remained unchanged at 34 percent while support for the NPP dipped by 1 percentage point to 34 percent as well.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party (UNP)\u2019s position also remained unchanged at 6 percent, somewhat behind the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) which enjoyed 13 percent support (dropping just one point) in May.",
    "Despite the UNP\u2019s poor showing, however, a separate poll on presidential election voting intent, also carried out by IHP, showed that support for Wickremesinghe increased to 15 percent in May, though still lagging behind his rivals.",
    "Support for Sri Lanka president grew in May but remained far behind rivals: pollSee more",
    "IHP said in a statement on Thursday July 04 that the May estimates for the parliamentary election voting intent poll are provisional and are associated with a margin of error of 1\u20135 percent for the four leading parties.",
    "\u201cThe voting intent results for previous months have changed in this update as more data was collected after the last release. Compared to IHP\u2019s May release, estimates of NPP support in April 2024 were revised by +1 point. These estimates are for all adults and not for likely voters. They are based on the 01/ 2024 revision of the IHP SLOTS Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) model,\u201d the institute said.",
    "\u201cIHP is working on improving its likely voter model and will resume the release of voting intent in likely voters in a future update. It should be noted that differences in voting intent shares between all adults and likely voters have typically been 1\u20132 percent for most estimates in the past two years,\u201d it said.",
    "According to IHP, the May 2024 update is based on 17,751 interviews conducted across Sri Lanka since October 2021, including 503 interviews carried out in May 2024. The institute said that its SLOTS MRP methodology first estimates the relationship between a wide variety of characteristics about respondents and their opinions \u2013 in this case, \u2018If there was a General Election today, which party would you vote for?\u2019\u2013 in a multilevel statistical model. It then uses a large data file that is calibrated to the",
    "national population to predict voting intent each month since October 2021, according to what the multilevel model says about their probability of voting for various parties (\u2018post-stratification\u2019) at each point in time. The multilevel model was estimated 100 times to reflect underlying uncertainties in the model and to obtain margins of error, said IHP. (Colombo/Jul04/2024)"
