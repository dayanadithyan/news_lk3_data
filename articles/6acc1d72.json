    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Tensions within the crisis-riddled Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) continue with the party\u2019s acting general secretary now accusing party stalwarts of attempting to \u201cbetray\u201d the party to its traditional rival the United National Party (UNP).",
    "MP Dushmantha Mithrapala told reporters that the SLFP, as one of the country\u2019s leading centre-left parties, must continue to exist. He vowed to never allow the destruction of the party.",
    "\u201cSome groups are trying to pin the SLFP on the UNP elephant\u2019s tail, but the party members aren\u2019t there. This leftist party should continue to exist in the country. A few people are trying to betray the SLFP to the UNP to retain their privileges,\u201d he said.",
    "SLFP members who left the party to join the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and the party\u2019s wider membership countrywide now have the opportunity to regroup and \u201crise strong as a party\u201d, said Mithrapala.",
    "Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said once his faction has control of the SLFP, it\u2019ll become a party that can form a government.",
    "\u201cBefore a month, we\u2019ll turn this party into one with 40 to 50 MPs after we take over. In the recent past, there has been not even a village level organisation and no party members either. We will turn this into a party that can form a government,\u201d he said.",
    "The SLFP last week appointed its incumbent vice president Nimal Siripala de Silva as the party\u2019s acting chairman, amid much controversy. The appointment was made at a politburo meeting held Monday April 08 morning after the the Colombo District Court issued an interim order the previous week preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from serving as SLFP chairman.",
    "Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, whose father S W R D Bandranaike founded the party in the 1950s, also hit out at Sirisena last week.",
    "\u201cWhen everyone asked me to run for president in 2015, I said no and brought in the SLFP general secretary, with great expectations. He ruined the country and the party too. That mistake was corrected today,\u201d she said.",
    "She added that the party constitution is a mess, which she attributed to Sirisena\u2019s actions as SLFP chairman."
