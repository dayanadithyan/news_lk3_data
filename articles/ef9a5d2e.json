    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has seen good results under the International Monetary Fund program, but the country has to complete debt restructuring and continue on a reform path to ensure strong growth, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "\u201cA lot of good results (sadaneeya prathilaba resak) are coming from the IMF program,\u201d Wickremesinghe said. \u201cAn appreciating rupee has brought down prices of imported goods, including milk powder and gas. The falling interest rates are benefiting businesses.\u201d",
    "\u201cGoing beyond stability now we have to get on a sustainably path.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe are not paying all debt now, we have to start paying. For that we need to increase state revenues and our foreign reserves. We have to optimise our resources.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe have to do debt restructuring. We are drafting MoUs with official creditors including the Paris Club, the Official Creditors Committee (OCC), and China Exim Bank separately.",
    "\u201cBond holders and Lazard are joining these discussions. We hope to finish by the middle of this year.\u201d France-based Lazard as financial advisor and Clifford Chance LLP as legal advisor are supporting the country on debt restructuring.",
    "The point of the debt restructuring was to reduce the country\u2019s loan payments to 95 percent of the gross domestic product, from 125 percent, maintain the government\u2019s gross financial requirement at 13 percent annually and ensure foreign debt servicing remains below 4.5 percent annually, Wickremesinghe said. \u201cWe have to work towards this. If we meet these goals we won\u2019t fall back into disaster.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka needed to pay back its loans, and get new loans. \u201cThen we have to boost exports and modernize agriculture.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe said the government cannot give a salary increase to state workers this year although many had requested it. \u201cIn the past by being irresponsible in this regard we destroyed our economy and people\u2019s livelihoods. We can consider an increment only next year, that is the truth. If we exit this path, we will head back into disaster.\u201d (Colombo/May9/2024)"
