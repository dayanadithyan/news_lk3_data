    "However, the health sector trade unions are slated to meet with Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana on 01 March, as he was not present at yesterday\u2019s meeting, Dharmawickrama stated,",
    "A collective of 72 trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals \u2013 including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, public health inspectors, and entomology officers \u2013 have engaged in strikes time and time again over the past few months urging the government to provide them with an allowance similar to that of the DAT (Disturbance, Availability and Transport) allowance given to doctors.",
