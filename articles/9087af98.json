    "Kandy, Feb. 24 (Daily Mirror)- Renewing his pledge made during the 2019 Presidential election, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa today said he will focus on the maximum on women's health if elected as President of this country.",
    "\"I was called 'Pad Man' during the last Presidential election when I spoke of women's health. Talking of women's health is taboo only in Sri Lanka. However, Scotland and New Zealand provide sanitary pads to women free of charge. I will follow these countries and will do the same. You can call me Pad Man,\" Premadasa told a women's convention organized by SJB in Kandy."
