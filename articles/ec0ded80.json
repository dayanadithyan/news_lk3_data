    "In recent years, elections have been repeatedly postponed. Will that be the fate of the presidential election too?",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Election Commission\u00a0announced\u00a0recently that they will hold the much-awaited presidential election between September 17 and October 16. The presidential election is Sri Lanka\u2019s only scheduled election.",
    "Article 31\u00a0of the constitution says, \u201cThe poll for the election of the President shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office.\u201d However, in recent years there have been several instances of the government putting off elections for one reason or another.",
    "In 2023, President Ranil Wickremesinghe postponed the\u00a0local government\u00a0elections, citing insufficient funds. This decision stirred controversy and raised questions about the government\u2019s commitment to democratic processes.",
    "Similarly, in\u00a02017, during Wickremesinghe\u2019s tenure as prime minister, he spearheaded an effort to postpone provincial council elections. The move was effective in keeping elected representatives out of provincial councils for seven years. These election postponements have sparked criticism and fueled concerns about the\u00a0erosion\u00a0of democratic norms in Sri Lanka.",
    "Over recent months, several politicians,\u00a0high-ranking officials,\u00a0and\u00a0international\u00a0backers\u00a0aligned with Wickremesinghe and his IMF-supported reform agenda have been\u00a0vocal\u00a0about their concerns regarding the impact of elections and the potential rise of a new populist government. They argue that such developments could jeopardize the ongoing reform momentum and economic stability.",
    "Additionally, Basil Rajapaksa, the founder of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which holds a majority in Parliament, has been\u00a0advocating\u00a0for a parliamentary election to precede the presidential one. Historical\u00a0data\u00a0indicates\u00a0that following a presidential election, the party affiliated with the newly elected president typically garners a\u00a0parliamentary majority\u00a0in subsequent general elections. There are concerns that if Rajapaksa\u2019s proposal gains traction, it could result in a fragile government formation, especially amidst the country\u2019s economic, social, and geopolitical challenges.",
    "These statements, seemingly aimed at gauging public opinion, have raised suspicions that they may be laying the groundwork for postponement of the presidential election. Criticism has also been directed at the Election Commission for its perceived failure to declare that the presidential election will be held on schedule.",
    "In its statement on May 9, the Election Commission confirmed that the presidential election will proceed as planned. The chair of the Commission, Saman Ratnayake,\u00a0indicated\u00a0that the election will likely be officially announced in August. This timeline provides political parties with a window of opportunity to craft and refine their strategies for the upcoming election.",
    "Data from the Institute for Health Policy (IHP) and anecdotal evidence indicate that the left-leaning National People\u2019s Power (NPP) is likely to clinch the presidential elections. If this indeed happens, it will mark a sea change in Sri Lankan politics.",
    "For decades, Sri Lanka has been\u00a0dominated\u00a0by two major political entities: the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). While the\u00a0SLPP,\u00a0associated with the Rajapaksa family, and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), led by Sajith Premadasa, son of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa, became the two strongest forces in Parliament following the 2020 general elections, it is safe to say they are the SLFP and UNP with new names.",
    "Historically, while ideological disparities existed between the UNP and the SLFP until 1977, their economic policies\u00a0largely\u00a0converged\u00a0by the 1990s. Both parties embraced neoliberal principles, often neglecting the development of key industries and agriculture, and fostering a culture of corruption. By the\u00a0mid-2000s, the SLFP, under the Rajapaksas\u2019 leadership, rebranded itself as a majoritarian force, while the UNP, led by Wickremesinghe, positioned itself as the liberal alternative.",
    "However,\u00a0growing inequality,\u00a0mounting national debt, and\u00a0decline in state capacity\u00a0culminated in a severe financial crisis. The turmoil of 2022 served as a wake-up call for many Sri Lankans, prompting widespread disillusionment with the political establishment. Out of this chaos emerged the NPP. Tapping into mass yearning for substantive change, the NPP swiftly gained traction as a viable alternative, capitalizing on the collective desire for a new direction in governance amid economic and political instability.",
    "The primary appeal of the NPP lies in its clean slate, allowing the party to distance itself from the entrenched corruption of the political establishment. Notably, the party has championed the\u00a017th amendment\u00a0to the constitution, acknowledged by most as probably the only positive constitutional amendment.",
    "Moreover, the NPP has actively participated in Sri Lanka\u2019s anti-corruption crusade, further bolstering its credibility as a force for transparency and accountability. In a nation\u00a0plagued\u00a0by\u00a0systemic\u00a0corruption\u00a0within its leadership, these attributes serve as significant selling points, resonating strongly with a populace eager for integrity and ethical governance.",
