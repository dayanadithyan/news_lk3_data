  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s state pensioners will be paid 6,000 rupees in October after an increase of 3,000 rupees from September was shot down by the Elections Commissions, State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.",
    "The cabinet decided to pay the 3,000 rupee allowance to 700,000 pensioners effective September.",
    "But the elections commission opposed it as an election was declared, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.",
    "As a result, a 6,000 rupee payment would be made with arrears in October. From November 3,000 rupees would be added to the pension, he said.",
    "Earlier this year a 2,500 rupee allowance was given to pensioners.",
    "Unlike unemployed graduates who are hired without actual vacancies, many of Sri Lanka\u2019s current pensioners were in government service working for small salaries.",
    "In the 1980s and early 1990s when the central bank and macro-economists busted the currency incessantly without a credible anchor for money, they got very low real wages.",
    "After Sri Lanka\u2019s macro-economists mis-targeted interest rates up to 2022 to target potential output and inflation as high as 5 percent, busting the currency to 360, most Sri Lankan including pensioners were put into serious difficulties. (Colombo/Aug11/2024)"
