    "Sri Lanka\u2019s dollar bonds are drifting lower on investor concern that the completion of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors could be pushed back by next month\u2019s presidential election.",
    "The country\u2019s dollar bonds due in 2030 traded below 55 cents on the dollar on Wednesday, down from 59 cents in mid June. This month, Sri Lanka has the worst performing emerging-market debt following Lebanon, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg.",
    "Sri Lanka struck a preliminary deal with private investors in July to restructure $12.6 billion of bonds \u2014 an agreement which needs to gain backing of the International Monetary Fund and bilateral creditors such as China and France. A month later, the South Asian nation\u2019s government requested more details regarding the IMF\u2019s assessment of the proposed debt revamp.",
    "\u201cSri Lankan bonds have under-performed other defaulted bonds, probably due to uncertainty about the timing of the bond exchange and political uncertainty about the upcoming elections,\u201d said Carlos de Sousa, an emerging market debt portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management.",
    "A gauge of Sri Lanka\u2019s dollar bonds has dropped 1.6% this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. So far this year, however, the sovereign\u2019s debt has returned 9.7%, outperforming the flagship Bloomberg Emerging Markets Hard Currency Aggregate Index, which is up 6.2%.",
    "Sri Lanka is in \u201ccontinued discussions on the debt restructuring process,\u201d Junior Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said in a message to Bloomberg News. The government has received an initial assessment from its Official Creditor Committee on the comparability of treatment in relation to the deal signed with bondholders in July and is currently awaiting further details.",
    "\u201cOnce these have been received, it will be possible to engage further with bondholders on the basis of the information provided by these assessments and conclude the process,\u201d he said, without specifying any time period for the final agreement.",
    "The creditor group from the July agreement declined to comment.",
    "The Asian island nation of 22 million will vote in a presidential election on Sept. 21 as incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe seeks a mandate for his fiscal reforms as Sri Lanka seeks to shore up its economy after a default in 2022. The IMF is vetting the restructuring deal to ensure it fits into the debt parameters of its $3 billion loan to the country.",
    "There is much unclarity about the debt deal amid concern over whether it treats all creditors fairly, especially as bilateral lenders are often reluctant to make their borrowing details public. The deal with private bondholders envisaged a 28% nominal reduction on the bonds\u2019 principal, and the issuance of the so-called macro-linked bonds, whose payouts are linked to economic growth.",
    "Barclays Plc analyst Avanti Save said there\u2019s little time to prepare the debt deal before next month\u2019s ballot, although she doesn\u2019t rule out that an agreement could still be reached ahead of the vote.",
    "\u201cBonds are down as clear either the IMF or the official creditors don\u2019t agree with the deal,\u201d said Thys Louw, a portfolio manager at Ninety One UK Ltd. \u201cI think the deal doesn\u2019t get done until after the election.\u201d"
