    "Benjamin Netanyahu (left) and Hamas\u2019s leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar",
    "The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has applied for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas\u2019s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, for war crimes.",
    "Karim Khan KC said there were reasonable grounds to believe that both men bore criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity from the day of Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel on 7 October onwards.",
    "Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas\u2019s political leader Ismail Haniyeh, along with the group\u2019s military chief Mohammed Deif, are also wanted for arrest.",
    "ICC judges will now decide whether they believe the evidence is sufficient to issue arrest warrants - something which could take weeks or months.",
    "Netanyahu said in a statement that he rejected \u201cwith disgust The Hague prosecutor\u2019s comparison between democratic Israel and the mass murderers of Hamas\u201d.",
    "US President Joe Biden described the ICC prosecutor\u2019s move as \u201coutrageous\u201d.",
    "Israel\u2019s foreign minister Israel Katz called the move by Khan an \u201cunrestrained frontal assault\u201d on the victims of the 7 October attacks and a \u201chistorical disgrace that will be remembered forever\u201d.",
    "He announced that a special command centre would be set up to fight the decision, which he said was intended to tie Israel\u2019s hands and deny it the right to self-defence.",
    "Hamas demanded the \u201ccancellation of all arrest warrants issued against leaders of the Palestinian resistance\u201d and denounced what it called Mr Khan\u2019s \u201cattempts... to equate the victim with the executioner\u201d.",
    "The group also complained that the application for warrants against Netanyahu and\u00a0 Gallant had come \u201cseven months late\u201d, and that other Israeli political and military leaders had not been named alongside them.",
    "Khan accused the Hamas leaders of having committed crimes including extermination, murder, hostage taking, rape and sexual violence, and torture.",
    "\u201cThe crimes against humanity charged were part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Israel by Hamas and other armed groups,\u201d he said in a statement.",
    "\u201cSome of these crimes, in our assessment, continue to this day.\u201d",
    "Hamas, he said, had inflicted \u201cunfathomable pain through calculated cruelty and extreme callousness\u201d.",
    "He said Israel\u2019s prime minister and defence minister were suspected of crimes including starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, murder, intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population, and extermination.",
    "Mr Khan said his office had evidence that Israel had \u201cintentionally and systematically deprived the civilian population in all parts of Gaza of objects indispensable to human survival\u201d.",
    "Israel, he said, has a right to defend itself but not by \u201cintentionally causing death, starvation, great suffering, and serious injury to body or health of the civilian population\u201d which he said were criminal acts."
