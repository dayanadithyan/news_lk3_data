    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 National People\u2019s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake had support among 50 percent of 522 adults surveyed by the Institute for Health Policy (IHP) in December 2023 in a monthly voting intent poll for Sri Lanka\u2019s upcoming presidential election.",
    "According to IHP\u2019s Sri Lanka Opinion Tracker Survey (SLOTS) Multilevel Regression and Post-Stratification (MRP) estimates, support for Dissanayake in December among the surveyed adults was significantly ahead of 33 percent for opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and 9 percent for President Ranil Wickremesinghe. A generic candidate for the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) scored 8 percent.",
    "According to a separate general election voting intention poll also carried out by IHP among 522\u00a0 for December 2023, Dissanayake\u2019s leftist NPP was enjoyed the support of 39 percen, ahead of Premadasa\u2019s main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) at 27 percent, the president\u2019s United National Party (UNP) at 6 percent and the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) at 10 percent.",
    "With regard to presidential voting intent, support for the NPP leader has increased 14 points since mid-2023, with the December",
    "estimates suggesting a possible drop in that month, IHP said in a statement. Support for Premadasa has increased 3 points since September 2023 with a rising trend in that time, while support for President Wickremesinghe has declined in the same six months.",
    "\u201cThis update is for all adults and is based on a revised MRP model using data from 14,941 interviews conducted from Oct. 2021 to 7 January 2024, with 522 interviews during December 2023. IHP will resume reporting voting intent amongst likely voters at a later date. 100 model iterations were run to capture model uncertainty. Margins of error are assessed 1\u20134% for December,\u201d the institute said.",
    "\u201cThe SLOTS combines interviews from a national sample of adults (ages 18 and over) reached by random digit dialling of mobile numbers, and others coming from a national panel of respondents who were previously recruited through random selection. IHP estimates voting intent using an adaptation of Multilevel Regression and Post-Stratification (MRP), with multiple imputation to account for uncertainties in its modelling, exploiting data from all SLOTS interviews to estimate voting in a particular month.",
    "\u201cThe December 2023 MRP estimates are based on 522 interviews conducted in December 2023, and 14,941 interviews conducted overall from 1 October 2021\u20137 January 2024, with a margin of error assessed as 3\u20134 percent for Dissanayake, Premadasa and 1\u20132 percent for Ranil Wickremesinghe and the other potential candidate. All estimates are adjusted to ensure the sample matches the national population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, geographical location, and voting in the 2019 Presidential and 2020 General Elections.\u201d (Colombo/Jan31/2024)"
