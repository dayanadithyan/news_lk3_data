    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) cannot speak for the 20 countries and multilateral agencies that Sri Lanka has entered into agreements with, so there is no point approaching the IMF for renegotiation, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "\u201cWe have now come to some stability. We have entered agreements with 18 countries, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The first approval was given to the IMF. It didn\u2019t end there. We then had to talk to China and other countries. We have to work according to this,\u201d Wickremesinghe said speaking at an event in Colombo on Sunday August 25.",
    "Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka has to raise 5 trillion rupees in revenue in 2025.",
    "\u201cIf you promise to reduce taxes and give this or that free in your election campaigns, this agreement is broken,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou have to find money elsewhere. If you reduce value added tax (VAT), you have to raise income tax,\u201d he added.",
    "While the next government can change the source of funding for the five-trillion-rupee revenue target, said Wickremesinghe, it cannot deviate from that target.",
    "\u201cYou have to stay on target. If you don\u2019t meet this target, what will happen?\u201d",
    "\u201cThey say they\u2019ll talk to the IMF. There\u2019s no point talking to the IMF. It doesn\u2019t have the power to speak for the other 20. That power is over now. You have to go and talk to them again. Is it easy to talk to these countries? To Poland and Hungary. They have bigger problems than our debt. They have issues at the European Union. We have to talk to every country that gave us aid and they must all agree. Can this be done? How long will it take? Get ready with your gas cylinder to wait in line from February,\u201d he said.",
    "Wickremesinghe claimed that it would take four to five months for such a renegotiation.",
    "\u201cThis fight is not about who is president, it\u2019s about how do we live? No one in the other two camps can match this team. I know who\u2019s on those teams. Some of them were brought up by me. It is not about my future. Are you ready to hand over your future to these people? That\u2019s all you have to think,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Aug26/2024)"
