    "Colombo, Jan. 17 (Daily Mirror)- The main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) today urged the government to postpone the debate on the proposed Online Safety Bill scheduled for next week and initiate another round of discussion with the stakeholders.",
    "The suggestion came from SJB MP Eran Wickramaratne, who told a news briefing that more discussions are needed to address the issues pertaining to the legislation.",
    "\u201cThe On Line Safety Bill is a dangerous piece of legislation and therefore the government should not rush it,\u201d the MP said.",
    "\u201cThe Bill has defined posting false information on social media platforms as a criminal liability. This cannot be accepted as anyone including journalists and even a civilian can be arrested while using this clause. Even intermediaries such as Facebook, instagram or X can be dealt with in accordance with the Bill. Also, one cannot accept providing quasi status to the Online Safety Commission that will be set up. The Bill should not be passed without having a re-look,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI oppose the Bill though I have been a victim of false information that was published over the social media just after the Easter Sunday attacks,\u201d he added.",
    "The Online Safety Bill is to be debated on January 23 and 24 before the expected prorogation of Parliament."
