    "SJB member\u00a0Sujeewa Senasinghe says President criticised SJB throughout his speech at recent UNP rally",
    "Claims evident that SJB has emerged as a significant challenge to Wickremesinghe",
    "Notes President\u2019s speech bordered on being hateful, particularly comments directed at G.L. Peiris",
    "Says SJB does not perceive Wickremesinghe as a contender at upcoming Presidential polls",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) member and former MP Sujeewa Senasinghe yesterday claimed that the primary objective of the rival United National Party\u2019s inaugural rally was to target the SJB.",
    "Addressing a press conference in Colombo, Senasinghe remarked that President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who also serves as the leader of the UNP, directed criticism towards the SJB throughout his speech at the rally. Senasinghe noted that some of the comments made were unusual and not typical of Wickremesinghe\u2019s style.",
    "\u201cIt is evident that the SJB has emerged as a significant challenge to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The SJB is being targeted by everyone, and it is often observed that the group expected to win faces the most attacks,\u201d he remarked.",
    "Senasinghe pointed out that certain remarks in the President\u2019s rally speech bordered on being hateful, particularly comments directed at MP G.L. Peiris. \u201cNormally, the President does not attack G.L. Peiris. However, he went as far as to say that Peiris is carrying out the tasks of a \u2018Groom of the Stool\u2019 during his speech,\u201d Senasinghe expressed.",
    "\u201cPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe understands that the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya will bring significant strength and influence to the SJB. Consequently, he persists in his attempts to thwart the inclusion of the group of MPs, including G.L. Peiris, from joining the SJB. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is exerting considerable efforts towards this goal,\u201d he maintained.",
    "Senasinghe also responded to further remarks made by Wickremesinghe during the rally, particularly regarding the factors behind the UNP\u2019s disappointing performance in the polls.",
    "\u201cThe President attributed his failure to speaking the truth. However, in reality, it stemmed from the damage he inflicted on the UNP. The party\u2019s supporters merely responded to Wickremesinghe in the last election,\u201d Senasinghe remarked.",
    "\u201cDespite Wickremesinghe\u2019s announcement of contesting in the upcoming Presidential election, the SJB does not perceive Wickremesinghe as a contender,\u201d Senasinghe emphasised. He added that the SJB intends to hold rallies across the island in the coming months to underscore to the people that it is the SJB which holds the potential to revitalise the country."
