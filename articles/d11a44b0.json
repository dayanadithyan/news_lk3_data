    "The UN World Food Programme has welcomed Saudi Arabia\u2019s donation of 300 tonnes of dates for vulnerable children in Sri Lanka.",
    "Provided through Saudi Arabia\u2019s aid agency KSrelief, the dates will be given to primary grade children enrolled in the country\u2019s national school meal program.",
    "The contribution was acknowledged at a signing event on Tuesday between the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Sri Lanka and the WFP, according to a press release.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s children have been severely affected by the country\u2019s economic downturn which began in 2022, when lost jobs and reduced incomes made it harder for families to access nutritious meals.",
    "Through this contribution, Saudi Arabia joins international communities in supporting the nation\u2019s recovery, particularly in improving nutrition and building its human capital.",
    "\u201cIn times of crises, it is often children who are among those hardest hit,\u201d said Gerard Rebello, country director of WFP Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cWe are grateful for the support from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in diversifying the food children receive through the school meal program.\u201d",
    "The program is designed to fulfill up to one-third of a child\u2019s daily nutrients, making it a lifeline for many families. Substituting 20 percent of a household\u2019s cost of a nutritious diet, the meals provide real value to poor communities, leaving them better able to afford healthy food.",
    "The nutrient-rich dates will be served as a complementary fruit at the end of a hot meal comprising rice and curry. Packed with vitamins, fiber and protein, the dates help meet the energy requirements of children, needed for them to learn and play."
