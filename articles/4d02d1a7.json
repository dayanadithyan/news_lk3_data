  "original_body_lines": [
    "Maldives has sought Sri Lanka\u2019s assistance in medical evacuation services \u2014 mainly to transport patients to Colombo in air ambulances \u2014 amid a persisting strain with India.",
    "Maldivian Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Mohamed Ameen met his Sri Lankan counterpart Nimal Siripala de Silva in Colombo on Tuesday, and said on social media platform \u2018X\u2019, that Sri Lanka has agreed to help the Maldives with medical evacuation. \u201cWe have specifically agreed upon creating a framework for immediate approval process between Maldives and Sri Lanka on urgent requirements, specifically on med-evac flights,\u201d Mr. Ameen said in his post.",
    "\u201cThey [Maldives] will use their air ambulances, this is to help keep this channel open and easy for any emergency medical treatment that Maldivians might need in Sri Lanka,\u201d Mr. de Silva told The Hindu Wednesday morning.\u00a0 Sri Lanka and India are among the Maldives\u2019s closest neighbours, and Maldivians have always had close ties in Colombo, a city they frequent.",
    "The development comes amid President Mohamed Muizzu\u2019s apparent efforts to expand and diversify the island nation\u2019s partnerships in medical evacuation. In December, he announced setting up an air ambulance service beginning March 2024, and said it could help patients travel as far as Thailand. The need for prompt medical evacuation came into sharp focus earlier in January, when a Maldivian teenager died, reportedly owing to a delay in evacuation for emergency treatment.",
    "Mr. Muizzu\u2019s efforts also assume significance at a time when Male and New Delhi grapple with strained ties, following controversial remarks made by Maldivian Ministers targeting India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a \u201cBoycott Maldives\u201d social media campaign in India.",
    "India\u2019s two naval choppers and a Dornier aircraft stationed in the Maldives have been involved in more than 600 medical evacuations \u2014 often from the atolls to capital Male \u2014, search and rescue operations in the last five years, according to official sources in Male.\u00a0 Mr. Muizzu has set a March 15 deadline for New Delhi to withdraw its nearly 80 soldiers stationed in the country. New Delhi has said they were posted there chiefly to operate and maintain the helicopters and the aircraft.",
    "Further, India is the most popular destination among Maldivians seeking medical care overseas. \u201cAa Sandha\u201d, the government\u2019s universal health insurance scheme launched over a decade ago, has dozens of Indian hospitals empanelled, for Maldivians to access varied medical treatment."
