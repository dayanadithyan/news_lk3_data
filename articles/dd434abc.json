    "National People\u2019s Power (NPP) presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake vowed to create a government committed to eradicating the influence of drugs and the underworld.",
    "Speaking at a public rally held in Negombo, Dissanayake drew attention to the deep-rooted connection between local politicians and organized crime.",
    "\u201cDrugs and the underworld lie together in our country. There were never organized crime gangs in Sri Lanka in the distant history. Crimes happened, but there were no organized crime gangs. But how are there crimes now? Now they carry out murders while hiding in Dubai. You can conduct drug operations while sitting in jail. These organized crime gangs were created by local politicians,\u201d he said.",
    "Commenting further, Dissanayake promised that a government led by the NPP will take swift and decisive action against these organized criminal networks."
