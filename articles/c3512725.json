  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 The leftist National People\u2019s Power (NPP) in its election manifesto has revealed its approach to re-negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) if the party wins Sri Lanka\u2019s upcoming presidential election.",
    "The proposals made by the NPP with regard to IMF negotiations are as follows:",
    "1. Discussing again with the IMF the inclusion and implementation of a stronger and more correct programme to salvage people who have been subject to poverty and vulnerability",
    "2. Re-evaulate revenue-based fiscal consolidation proposals made by the IMF and present proposals for efficient tax administration and state expenditure management",
    "3. Preparing an alternative debt sustainability analysis (DSA) to be used in debt evaluations as needed aimed at maintaining debt sustainability and maintaining interest rates at affordable levels",
    "4. Rapidly conducting a comprehensive debt audit to ensure state financial transparency and government accountability and to take legal action against parties who have misused debt",
    "5. Improve fiscal discipline and government finances to raise the credit rating of both the country and the banking system",
    "Both the NPP and the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) have pledged to renegotiate Sri Lanka\u2019s agreement with the IMF. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that the benchmarks, revenue and expenditure figures agreed to with the international lender cannot be changed.",
    "At a Q&A with heads of media organisations held on Wednesday August 07, Wickremesinghe said the IMF has not changed their position on benchmarks agreed to with any country.",
    "\u201cWe have entered an agreement with the IMF, and we have to implement it. If we implement it as we go along, there won\u2019t be a problem for Sri Lanka,\u201d he said.",
    "Wickremesinghe was responding to a question about statements made by opposition parties that they would renegotiate the terms of Sri Lanka\u2019s IMF agreement.",
    "\u201cNow others are coming up with various proposals, that they want to change. Then they must tell what they\u2019re going to do. One thing about the IMF is that the benchmarks will not be changed. They have never changed it for any country,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe benchmarks are there. For instance, you want to give something free from some place and you want to increase VAT to 25 percent. If the numbers are agreeable, they will say yes. But you can\u2019t change the benchmarks and the revenue figures and the expenditure figures,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Aug26/2024)"
