    "Colombo, Feb 14 (Daily Mirror) -\u00a0 The healthcare services across the country have been paralyzed, inconveniencing patients as trade unions within the health sector have decided to continue the island-wide strike.",
    "Furthermore, long queues can be seen at nationwide pharmacies owned by the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation\u00a0since this morning as medications are not being dispensed from the medicine counters at government hospitals.",
    "The strike, which commenced from 6.30 a.m. yesterday (13) was launched following unsuccessful discussions with officials from the Finance Ministry.",
    "The focal point of the strike action is the prolonged and contentious disagreement surrounding the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance, according to the President of the Federation of Health Professionals Ravi Kumudesh.",
    "The health workers have so far resorted to three trade union actions this year over the failure to provide an allowance similar to the DAT allowance granted to the doctors.",
    "However, in response to strike action, the Sri Lanka Army has deployed troops at government hospitals to support operational activities."
