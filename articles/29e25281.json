    "Humane People\u2019s Alliance leader MP Dayasiri Jayasekara asserted in a press conference yesterday that Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa is currently leading in public opinion polls for the upcoming Presidential election.",
    "According to Jayasekara, National People\u2019s Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumar Dissanayake follows in second place, with current President Ranil Wickremesinghe trailing in third.",
    "MP Dayasiri Jayasekara commented on the President\u2019s plan to declare Sri Lanka free from bankruptcy on 27 June, emphasising that such an announcement should be made by international credit rating agencies. He pointed out that Sri Lanka remains in a crisis, grappling with both old and new debts, while sovereign bond holders have been reluctant to agree to the government\u2019s proposed debt reduction percentages. \u201cReports indicate they are only willing to reduce the debt by 10%,\u201d he added.",
    "Jayasekara criticised the Government for ongoing allegations of theft, fraud, and corruption. He accused those close to the President of embezzling national assets to safeguard their own interests. He stressed the urgent need for a political movement with a robust agenda capable of rebuilding the country. Jayasekara highlighted pervasive corruption across society, the public sector, and political circles, lamenting that these forces are collectively undermining the nation.",
    "\u201cWe require a Government with a fresh strategy to combat this,\u201d he asserted. The MP underscored the importance of the public remembering instances of theft and fraud during the previous government\u2019s tenure, even amid bankruptcy, and in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and former ministers. Jayasekara further stated that if a group responsible for plundering the country\u2019s resources seeks to return to power without regard for the people\u2019s welfare during times of financial distress it would spell doom for the country. He urged consideration of better alternatives for the country\u2019s future."
