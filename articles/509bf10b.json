    "People\u2019s Struggle Alliance\u2019s Wasantha Mudalige accuses President Ranil Wickremesinghe of engaging in discussions to prolong his tenure in power through potential election delays",
    "Stresses Wickremesinghe nor SLPP has a mandate to unilaterally decide on election schedules",
    "Seeks assurance from ECSL on its preparedness to conduct elections in accordance with constitutional mandates",
    "Reaffirms commitment to defending democratic processes to safeguard SL\u2019s electoral system against any threats",
    "Members of the People\u2019s Struggle Alliance (PSA) yesterday held a discussion with the Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) to address growing apprehensions regarding potential efforts by the Government to postpone upcoming elections.",
    "Represented by activists Wasantha Mudalige, Lahiru Weerasekara, Dharmasiri Lankapeli, and others, the PSA expressed deep concerns to the ECSL about what they perceive as a Government conspiracy to delay the electoral process. Mudalige emphasised the paramount importance of upholding democratic principles and ensuring elections are conducted on schedule.",
    "Speaking to the media, Mudalige highlighted recent remarks by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at a Matara rally where he indicated intentions to consult with all parties on the timing of general elections. While acknowledging the President\u2019s authority to dissolve Parliament and call for elections, Mudalige questioned his involvement in the election scheduling process as indicated by these statements.",
    "\u201cThe President and the Government are engaging in discussions aimed at prolonging their tenure in power,\u201d Mudalige alleged.",
    "He further underscored that neither the President nor the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has the mandate to unilaterally decide on election schedules. \u201cThe people revoked the SLPP\u2019s mandate on 9 July 2022. Therefore, we cannot allow any manoeuvres that compromise the democratic rights of the people,\u201d Mudalige cautioned, issuing a stern warning against any attempts to delay elections.",
    "During their meeting with the Election Commission, Mudalige and his delegation sought reassurances regarding the commission\u2019s readiness to conduct elections in compliance with constitutional obligations. Mudalige said the Election Commission assured the alliance of its proactive planning and utilisation of constitutional powers to ensure elections proceed as planned.",
    "\u201cWe remain steadfast in defending democratic processes,\u201d Mudalige reiterated, pledging the PSA\u2019s commitment to mobilise public support in safeguarding the integrity of Sri Lanka\u2019s electoral system against perceived threats.",
    "The PSA consists of activists, political parties and civil society organisations which were part of the 2022 Aragalaya movement in Sri Lanka."
