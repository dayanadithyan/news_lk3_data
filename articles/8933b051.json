    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Mothers of infants should avoid working abroad, Sri Lanka\u2019s Minister of Women\u2019s Affairs, Geetha Kumarasinghe, has said.",
    "\u201cA mother should stay with the child till the child is two years,\u201d Kumarasinghe said. \u201cTo whom are they going to give the responsibility? To the grandparents? To the husband? No, it is the mother who does that. You have to look after the child.\u201d",
    "At an event for International Women\u2019s Day last month, Kumarasinghe said she was in favor of requesting mothers with children under two to refrain from foreign employment.",
    "However, Minister of Labor and Foreign Employment, Manusha Nanayakkara has rejected this recommendation.",
    "\u201cParental responsibility belongs to both the mother and father,\u201d Nanayakkara told EconomyNext. \u201cWhy should restrictions apply to mothers and not to fathers?\u201d",
    "However, Kumarasinghe was adamant that Sri Lankan \u2018culture\u2019 dictated that women were the sole provider of childcare, or unpaid care work.",
    "\u201cOur society from those days, mother is always home looking after the children and cooking,\u201d Kumarasinghe said. \u201cThat is not their only duty; they also have to work but they must stay home with the babies and cook something in the morning.\u201d (Colombo/Apr2/2024)"
