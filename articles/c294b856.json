    "COLOMBO (News 1st) \u2013 Founder of the Pathfinder Foundation Milinda Moragoda called Sri Lanka to slash its overstretched network of overseas missions, citing outdated practices and resource constraints in a connected world.",
    "Moragoda advocated a \"zero-based budgeting\" approach, scrutinizing each mission's value and suggesting a 10-mission reduction.",
    "He said, \"At present, Sri Lanka has over 60, most of which are understaffed and under-resourced. In telling contrast, Singapore, with foreign exchange reserves of close to USD 325 billion, has around 50.\"",
    "He said savings could bolster remaining embassies, prioritizing functionality, affordability, and national interest.",
    "Empowering select missions for regional oversight, with ambassadors potentially stationed at the foreign ministry, is another proposal. He argued that this mirrors Singapore's efficiency and adaptability.",
    "Moragoda emphasized that the ongoing economic crisis presents an opportunity for Sri Lanka to re-evaluate its institutions, adding that adapting to a changing world is crucial.",
