    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s State Minister for Finance has called for a report to identify people who did not collect the free rice given by the government, hoping this would help identify fraudulent beneficiaries of the Aswesuma welfare scheme.",
    "\u201cSince there is a need to go to those places to collect the rice, if any party is fraudulently obtaining Aswesuma benefits, they may not have come forward to get it for fear of revealing their identity,\u201d Shehan Semasinghe said in a statement.",
    "Free rice was given to the poorest families in the country, which include Aswesuma beneficiaries, in April.",
    "Semasinghe said the government has called for a report on the people who are currently receiving Aswesuma benefits but did not come to get free rice. The relevant report is being prepared by the Development Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance.",
    "The minister said that he will receive the report by next week.",
    "\u201cIt is not the government\u2019s policy to continue working according to the old system, or the 30-year-old social welfare system. We are changing to a new system accepted globally. That it is essential to progress.\u201d",
    "\u201cAswesuma is not only a social welfare program, it contributes to the economic process. Sri Lanka should have implemented this about two decades ago.",
    "450,404 applications have been received for the second phase, of which 84 percent or 377,485 have been entered into the system. (Colombo/May15/2024)"
