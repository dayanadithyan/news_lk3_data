    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Anuradhapura district MP Uddika Premarathne resigned from his position as a Member of Parliament yesterday, submitting his resignation to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena citing frustrations at being unable to enact significant change as a young leader within the Government.",
    "In his letter, the MP expressed his initial aspirations to enter politics with the aim of instigating positive change and contributing as a youth leader, highlighting his disappointment at being unable to fulfil these ambitions.",
    "\u201cGiven the recent series of incidents that have led to disillusionment, despite my status as a Government MP, I have not been actively given the opportunity to contribute as a youth leader,\u201d he said.",
