    "Accordingly, all the striking Railway Station Masters and Railway Controllers are instructed to report for duty at their respective railway stations or at least to the nearest railway station.",
    "The Sri Lanka Railways Station Masters\u2019 Union had decided to launch a strike action from midnight yesterday (09) based on several demands including promotions.",
