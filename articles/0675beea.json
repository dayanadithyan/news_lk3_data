    "COLOMBO (News 1st); A woman was apprehended by the Sri Lankan Bureau of Foreign Employment for allegedly defrauding over Rs. 60 Million from individuals seeking overseas employment, primarily in Canada.",
    "The accused, a 37-year-old resident of Kudaedanda Road, Wattala, reportedly targeted a wide range of victims, including bank officers, lawyers, and other professionals, across the island nation.",
    "The woman allegedly took money from job seekers, promising them secure employment opportunities in Canada.",
    "However, upon failing to deliver on her promises, she left her victims empty-handed and financially distraught. This led to a fish trader from Peliyagoda lodging a complaint with the SLBFE, prompting an investigation.",
    "Based on initial investigations and 16 confirmed complaints, the Sri Lankan Bureau of Foreign Employment estimates the accused's fraudulent activities to exceed Rs. 60 Million.",
    "The suspect was subsequently presented before the Welisara Magistrate's Court and remanded until January 29th, facing charges of receiving money for providing Canadian jobs without a valid license.",
