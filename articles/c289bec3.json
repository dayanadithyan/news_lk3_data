  "original_body_lines": [
    "MP Prof. G.L. Peiris calls President\u2019s proposal asking Speaker to consult with CJ as preposterous and warns of severe legal consequences",
    "Stresses any attempt by Speaker to discuss an active case with CJ would constitute contempt of court",
    "Says although Speaker presides over CC it is not a functioning Parliamentary committee and thus subject to court intervention",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member MP Prof. G.L. Peiris has denounced President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s recent proposal for the Speaker of Parliament to consult with the Chief Justice regarding an ongoing Supreme Court case about the appointment of the Chief of Police. Peiris described the proposal as preposterous and warned of severe legal consequences.",
    "\u201cThe President\u2019s suggestion is unprecedented and highly inappropriate,\u201d said Peiris. \u201cThe case is still under review, with the Supreme Court yet to issue a final ruling. The interim order from the three-judge panel is pending, and the case will continue in November after the presidential election.\u201d",
    "Peiris emphasised that any attempt by the Speaker to discuss an active case with the Chief Justice would constitute contempt of court. \u201cThe Speaker would be breaching legal protocols and could face serious repercussions. There is no constitutional immunity in this matter, and the Speaker must adhere to the law.\u201d",
    "According to Peiris, the President should follow constitutional procedures to appoint an acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) for 14 days, after which the Constitutional Council must approve the appointment. \u201cThis process ensures that the appointment is not solely at the President\u2019s discretion,\u201d he noted.",
    "Addressing Wickremesinghe\u2019s concerns about potential election petitions, Peiris argued that the Constitutional Council\u2019s approval negates any grounds for such petitions. He suggested that the President\u2019s claims are baseless and intended to create unnecessary complications for personal political gain.",
    "Peiris also criticised the President\u2019s hasty action in filing his election deposit, suggesting it was a deliberate strategy to disrupt the election process. \u201cThe President\u2019s rush to deposit his funds on the first day indicates his intention to undermine the election and further his political objectives,\u201d he said.",
    "Peiris also condemned the President\u2019s challenge to court orders in Parliament under the guise of parliamentary privileges. He explained that although the Speaker presides over the Constitutional Council, it is not a functioning Parliamentary committee and thus subject to court intervention.",
    "Peiris also highlighted that President Wickremesinghe appointed former IGP C.D. Wickremeratne as Acting IGP on three occasions, contradicting his claims of having no power to appoint an Acting IGP. He further alleged that the President is attempting to create chaos and push the country towards anarchy. Peiris assured that the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya (SJS) will defeat any conspiracies by the President and emerge victorious in the elections, emphasising the importance of upholding the rule of law and the constitution."
