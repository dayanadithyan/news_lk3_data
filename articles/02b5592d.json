    "ECONOMYNEXT  \u2013 The International Monetary Fund has assessed that there has been \u201csufficiently strong progress on the debt restructuring\u201d for a review of Sri Lanka\u2019s program by its board on June 12, an official said.",
    "\u201c\u2026[T]he authorities have been holding extensive discussions with external official creditors regarding an MOU with the official creditor committee and the final agreements with the Export Import Bank of China,\u201d IMF Communication Director Julie Kozack told reporters in Washington.",
    "\u201cDiscussions with external bondholders continue with the aim of reaching agreements in principle soon. Negotiations with the China Development bank are also at an advanced stage.",
    "\u201cThere is a strong expectation that agreements with external commercial creditors consistent with program parameters will be reached soon.",
    "\u201cSo overall we assess that there has been sufficiently strong progress on the debt restructuring front.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka has also made progress on restoring stability and meeting IMF targets.",
    "\u201cIn Sri Lanka, we do see macroeconomic policy reform starting to bear fruit,\u201d Kozack said.",
    "\u201cCommendable outcomes include rapid disinflation, robust reserve accumulation, and initial signs of economic growth, while preserving stability of the financial system.",
    "\u201cProgram performance is strong with most quantitative and structural conditionality for the second review met or implemented with delay, and reforms are still ongoing in some areas.",
    "\u201cThe next steps on the debt restructuring are indeed to conclude negotiations with external commercial creditors and to implement agreements in principle with the official creditors.",
    "\u201cThe domestic debt operations are largely completed. Debt restructuring discussions are continuing.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka regained monetary stability around and inflation, as measured by the island\u2019s Consumer Price Index stopped its tracks.",
    "Since then, private companies have largely been engaged in deleveraging and the central bank has, in general runn deflationary policy to build reserves (selling sterilization securities into banks).",
    "Going against past practice, the central bank has also allowed the rupee to appreciate, while collecting reserves through an ad hoc pegging mechanism (under a clean float reserve collection is not possible).",
    "The central bank has so far not cut rates and enforced them by printing money on the claim that historical 12-month inflation is low (flexible inflation targeting), real interest rates are high (a frequent claim made by inflationists re-stating the same doctrine in a different way), or that there is a potential output gap that can be bridged by printing money.",
    "All rate falls so far has been done through actual domestic credit developments and the confidence created by the central bank itself by maintaining monetary stability, and the not engaging restructuring all domestic debt and spooking all government securities buyers.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s monetary operating framework, which has since legalized in a new law, is likely to lead to external instability in the future, as soon as private credit recovers, analysts have warned.",
    "In a series of currency crises since the end of the war the central bank has printed money saying inflation was low and busted the currency through \u2018exchange rate as a first line of defence\u2019 to avoid market pricing rates, critics say.",
    "The IMF\u2019s \u2018reserve adequacy metrics\u2019 and the \u2018exchange rate as a first line of defence\u2019 are directly contradictory doctrines, which are in collision course whenever short or long term rates are enforced with overnight term, outright injections or non-penal rate standing facilities, critics have said.
