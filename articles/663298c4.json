    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s State Minister for Social Empowerment Anupa Pasqual, said that he does not have the authority to explain the reasons for a request to pardon for convicted monk Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara.",
    "The monk was sentenced to four years in prison with hard labour for hate speech against Muslims.",
    "Minister Pasqual asked for a pardon for the controversial monk in parliament earlier this month. \u201cThe monk had spoken about the acts of Muslim extremists, not the Muslim people. We don\u2019t like the speech made by him about the Muslim community.\u201d",
    "But this week in response to journalists\u2019 questions on why he asked President Ranil Wickremesinghe to pardon the monk, he said \u201cAs a state minister, I do not have the authority to comment on this.\u201d",
    "The monk had previously been serving a six year sentence for contempt of court before he was pardoned by former president Maithripala Sirisena in May 2019.",
    "Pasqual\u2019s request for a presidential pardon came ahead of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, when there is a tradition of pardoning offenders.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday announced a Presidential pardon for 779 prisoners, granted in accordance with Article 34(1) of the Constitution."
