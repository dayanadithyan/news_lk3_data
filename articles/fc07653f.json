    "Yasha - once dubbed the \u201chuman calculator\u201d is keeping an open mind about what the future holds, saying: \u201cI\u2019m looking to maybe work in AI field or data mining, but I really don\u2019t know yet.\u201d",
    "On receiving the PhD he said: \u201cIt feels amazing to have achieved this feat. I am very happy and would like to thank all my lecturers for their help.",

    "Moussa says he is not surprised by his son\u2019s latest feat but said: \u201cTo be frank \u2013 I was expecting him to finish two or three years ago!",
    "\u201cWere it not for Covid I think he would have finished much earlier but I am over the moon.\u201d",
    "Yasha took both his GCSEs and A-Levels aged nine, and is fluent in French and Persian.",
    "It was then decided it was time for university - but it wasn\u2019t all plain sailing.",
    "Moussa, who came to Britain from Iran in 1979, said: \u201cI approached the uni and asked them to waive student fees, as I couldn\u2019t afford to just pay the fees upfront, I even approached my local MP.\u201d",
    "In the end, after months of back and forth, Moussa said Student Finance \u201cgave in\u201d and offered Yasha the student loan without the national insurance number.",
    "Yasha went on to achieve a first-class honours degree - aged just 15.",
    "And at the age of 13 he was offered a paid job by the university to run tutorials - beating adult applicants.The weekly sessions involved helping adult students who had trouble solving problems from lectures.",
    "Dad Moussa said: \u201cFrom his earliest days he was exceptional \u2013 everybody noticed he was exceptional",
    "\u201cHis primary school teacher realised early on that he couldn\u2019t meet his educational needs \u2013 so he was getting university standard lectures twice a week while attending school three days a week.\u201d",
    "Moussa added: \u201cI am grateful for what this country has done for me.",
    "\u201cI always did OK academically but was nowhere near as good as my son.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt was a lot to get him through university as a single parent, big sacrifices had to be made but it has all been worth it.\u201d",
    "Yasha says he is very thankful for his dad helping him along the way.",
    "\u201cI feel honoured and privileged - I am blessed with a caring dad who sacrificed his time in order to support and be with me for so many years and I will always be grateful for the opportunities he created for me.\u201d",
    "Prof Jeremy Levesley, who taught Yasha at Leicester University, said: \u201cIt has been a great pleasure to work with him.",
    "\u201cHe has proved to be one of the best students we have ever had here.",
    "\u201cHe is a great bloke and will go on to do really interesting things.\u201d",
    "It isn\u2019t all academics for Yasha though - he is also an avid gardener and Leicester City fan.",
    "It is thought he is the current youngest PhD holder in Britain - but not the youngest to achieve the feat.",
