    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Amid speculation over the possibility of an early dissolution of parliament, President Ranil Wickremesinghe joked to opposition MP Harsha de Silva that the chairmanship of a parliamentary committee the latter heads may not last much longer.",
    "Speaking in parliament Wednesday March 06 morning, MP de Silva asked President Wickremesinghe, who was present at the legislature, to discuss Sri Lanka\u2019s plans for the restructure of external debt with all political parties represented in parliament.",
    "\u201cRestructuring of foreign debt is now going on. There\u2019s only a few months left for the election. The next government will be obliged to continue the restructuring process. I propose to you that a consensus is reached with all parties that represent parliament upon some deliberation, because we can\u2019t say for sure how long you\u2019ll be there,\u201d said de Silva.",
    "\u201cWe expect to commence work under [incumbent opposition leader] Premadasa,\u201d he added.",
    "Responding to the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP\u2019s request, President Wickremesinghe said: \u201cBefore the question of how long I\u2019ll be there, how long you\u2019ll be the chairman is the question.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe\u2019s quip invited laughter from government MPs including Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe.",
    "MP de Silva chairs the parliamentary Committee on Public Finance (COPF).",
    "\u201cChampika Ranawaka also walked out,\u201d Wickremesinghe added, referring to opposition MP Patali Champika Ranawaka who entered parliament on the SJB ticket but now sits independently in the opposition. Ranawaka recently presented a \u201ccommon minimum programme\u201d to both Wickremesinghe and senior members of the SJB, leading to intense speculation over his own ambitions.",
    "\u201cWe agree that [debt restructuring] is something that impacts the whole country. After the initial discussion with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), I will convene party leaders. If there are alternative proposals, we\u2019ll discuss them all with the IMF too, at the conclusion of which I will present a draft bill to parliament,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Mar06/2024)"
