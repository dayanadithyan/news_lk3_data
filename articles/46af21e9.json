    "The suspect was placed behind bars on remand until March 21 after being produced before the Elpitiya Magistrate\u2019s Court.",
    "About a month-and-a-half ago, Hansika Nadeeshani, originally from Thalgahawatta area of Mandakanda in Karandeniya, had stayed with her sister for a while to help take care of her two kids. During her stay, she was purportedly romantically involved with her brother-in-law, according to police reports.",

    "Upon receiving summons from the police to hear the complaint, Nadeeshani, along with her mother and another sister, had been on her way to the Elpitiya police station on Friday morning (March 8) when her brother-in-law once again forcibly took her away by blocking the three-wheeler the trio was travelling in.",
    "Subsequently, Nadeeshani\u2019s mother had lodged another complaint with the Elpitiya police, but the girl\u2019s body was later located at a tea estate in Thalgahawatta on Saturday (March 9). She was found to have died of a cut-throat injury.",

    "The arrestee had told the investigators that he was merely a three-wheeler driver hired by the suspect for the ride, and admitted to dropping them off at Nanayakkara Mawatha, located adjacent to the said tea estate where the body was discovered."
