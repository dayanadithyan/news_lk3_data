    "Colombo, Feb 23 (Daily Mirror) - A contingent of Sri Lankan workers dispatched to Israel to work in the agriculture sector has encountered challenges, with some seeking alternative employment due to reported difficulties on the job, Daily Mirror learns.",
    "Israel's recruitment drive for foreign labourers was prompted by the deportation of thousands of Palestinian workers after the Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7, last year. It led to opportunities for workers from countries like India and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka which seized the opportunity sent workers to Israel to work both in the construction and agriculture industries.",
    "However, there are reports about some Sri Lankan workers expressing dissatisfaction with the working conditions in the agriculture sector. Complaints range from inadequate facilities to the strenuous nature of farm work. Several workers have reportedly approached the Sri Lankan mission in Tel Aviv, exploring the possibility of switching to different job sectors.",
    "Even government officials, such as Grama Niladharis and Samurdhi officers, who joined as seasonal agriculture workers, found the farm work challenging, according to sources based in Israel. Some workers are not ready to work for ten hours a day whereas workers from countries such as Thailand do so without any grumbling.",
    "However, Foreign Employment Promotion Minister Manusha Nanayakkara refuted allegations of mismanagement. He accused detractors, including Sri Lankan residents opposed to the government's worker deployment programme, of spreading misinformation. The Minister asserted that workers were sent successfully, and assistance was provided to those seeking job changes.",
    "Addressing concerns about unskilled workers being sent to Israel, Minister Nanayakkara said such an issue could not be raised because of the hurried recruitment drive encouraged. He clarified that the government is currently sending small batches of workers to Israel."
