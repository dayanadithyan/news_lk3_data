    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet has approved new feed-in tariffs for renewable power plants below 10 MegaWatts, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.",
    "Roof top solar below 500 kiloWatts will be paid a flat rate of 27.06 a unit for 20 years.",
    "The plants will get a 20-year flat rate and not a falling Tiered rate.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s feed-in tariffs for renewables, other than for bio mass plans which can be operated at any time of the day (dispatched) have been controversial due to administratively devised rates which are far above competitive rates in other jurisdictions.",
    "The tariffs compare with 4.88 cents for a 50MW wind plant in Mannar.",
    "Feed in tariffs were halted in favour of competitive bidding, but were brought back following heavy lobbying. \u00a0(Colombo/July02/2024)"
