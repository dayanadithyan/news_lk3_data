    "Colombo (News 1st) \u2013\u00a0The world\u2019s first execution by Nitrogen injection, a new method of putting a person to death, was carried out by the U.S. state of Alabama on Thursday (25th).",
    "Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, was executed by having nitrogen gas pumped into his lungs through a mask for several minutes. Authorities say the method is relatively painless, but his lawyers had argued that it was a cruel and unusual method.",
    "Smith and an accomplice were convicted of the 1988 murder of a 45-year-old woman. It was a hired killing for which they were paid USD 1,000 by her husband, a preacher, who later killed himself as police tried to arrest him.",
    "The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his case. Smith claimed he was present at the scene of the murder but did not take part in the attack.",
    "His accomplice was executed by lethal injection in 2010. Lethal injection has become a difficult process, since drug companies that supply the fatal drugs have become increasingly reluctant due to lawsuits filed by persons on death row.",
