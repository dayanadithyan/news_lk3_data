    "\u201cResponding to the Wickremesinghe government\u2019s proposed legislation; Anti-Terrorism Act and Online Safety Bill, a majority of Sri Lankans expressed that they are ignorant about both these proposed legislation,\u201d the Centre for Policy Alternatives\u2019 Confidence in Democratic Governance Index report found.",
    "The survey sample captured both men and women living in urban as well as rural localities in all 25 districts of Sri Lanka in November 2023, and was released in December.",
    "The report found that 61.5 percent of the population were not aware of the ATA. \u201cOf those who are aware, 40 percent of individuals across all age groups demonstrated awareness of the ATA, as opposed to the minimal percentage (20-30 percent) who exhibited awareness of the OSB.\u201d",
    "Among the offences listed in the draft bill were the communication of false statements on incidents within Sri Lanka, false statements causing defamation, disturbing religious assembly through false statements, communication of false statements with the sole intention of hurting religious emotions, communication of false statements with the sole intention for the abomination of religious emotions.",
