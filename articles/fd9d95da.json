    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) must inform the leftist National People\u2019s Power (NPP) in writing whether or not SJB leader Sajith Premadasa intends to debate NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, an NPP spokesman said.",
    "Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) general secretary Tilvin Silva speaking at an NPP said the SJB is now embroiled in its own debate about who should be sent to debate the NPP.",
    "\u201cThey may call us for debates, but they won\u2019t come. We know that it\u2019s just posturing,\u201d said Silva.",
    "\u201cHonestly, this became a nuisance. We tried to ignore it it, but then it got annoying with everyone asking if he wouldn\u2019t go. We said \u2018okay, fine, we\u2019ll come\u2019,\u201d she added.",
    "JVP and NPP leader Dissanayake is ready to attend the debate, Silva said, and Premadasa can represent the SJB.",
    "\u201cBut now it has come to a halt. Now there is a debate about who should go to the debate. There\u2019s a debate there whether Sajith or someone else should go. There\u2019s a debate now on how to do the debate,\u201d said Silva.",
    "\u201cThis makes no difference to us. If Sajith is coming, all he has to do is inform us in writing that he is ready. Then we\u2019ll get ready. If he doesn\u2019t want to debate, then inform that in writing too saying \u2018I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t come\u2019. We\u2019ll then see if we can have a second-tier group,\u201d he added.",
    "SJB member Chandima Weerakkody told reporters last week that the NPP should take up the SJB\u2019s challenge for a debate.",
    "\u201cWe have our economic team. The JVP says they have their own team headed by Sunil Handunneththi, who is said to be their finance minister. Come to a debate, and allow to be questioned before the people,\u201d the MP said.",
    "Handunneththi, who heads the NPP\u2019s economic council, said the party is happy to debate, but on the condition that SJB leader and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa debates NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissananayake.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re very happy. There is no issue. For the debate to truly be a success, we propose to them that, rather than talk to the media here and there, invite us in writing. We\u2019re ready to have this debate with Sajith Premadasa. Our leader Comrade Anura Kumara Dissanayake is ready for that,\u201d said Handunneththi. (Colombo/Apr08/2024)"
