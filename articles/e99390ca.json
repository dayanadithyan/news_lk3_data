    "The petition raised concerns over improper and irregular selection of private entities as authorized representatives for issuing visas, entering into agreements with private parties in a manner that could lead to severe financial losses and damage to the tourism sector, and an incident at country\u2019s main airport in May 2024 highlighted the problematic appointment of private entities for visa processing among others.",
    "The petition called for the respondents to be held accountable for their illegal, arbitrary, and unreasonable acts or omissions in the procurement process. (Colombo/August 2/2024)"
