By targeting the youth, COYLE aims to unlock opportunities for innovation and enterprise that will not only benefit individuals but also contribute significantly to the national economy. This initiative goes beyond mere encouragement; it seeks to actively cultivate a culture of entrepreneurship by providing mentorship, inspiration, and the essential training required to succeed in the business world.",

This approach ensures that the wisdom and experience of veteran businessmen are passed down to the next generation, offering invaluable insights that can help young entrepreneurs navigate the complexities of starting and growing a business.",

By equipping young people with the tools, knowledge, and support they need, COYLE is helping to shape a future where innovation and enterprise are at the heart of the nation\u2019s progress. As this program takes root, the Chamber looks forward to seeing the emergence of a new generation of leaders who will drive Sri Lanka towards a brighter, more prosperous future."
