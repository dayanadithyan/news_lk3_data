    "Working in extreme heat can double the risk of stillbirth and miscarriage for pregnant women, according to new research from India.",
    "The study found that the risks to mothers-to-be are significantly higher than previously thought.",
    "Researchers say hotter summers can affect not only women in tropical climates, but also in countries such as the UK.",
    "They want specific health advice for working pregnant women globally.",
    "Eight hundred pregnant women in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu took part in the study, which was started in 2017 by the Faculty of Public Health at the Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (SRIHER) in Chennai.",
    "About half of those who took part worked in jobs where they were exposed to high levels of heat, such as agriculture, brick kilns and salt flats. The others worked in cooler environments, such as schools and hospitals, although some workers were also exposed to very high levels of heat in those jobs too.",
    "There is no universal threshold for what level of heat is considered to be too hot for the human body.",
    "\u201c[The impact of heat] is relative to what you\u2019re used to and what your body\u2019s used to,\u201d says Prof Jane Hirst, one of the scientists who contributed to the study.",
    "She removes her thick gloves and stretches out her fingers. She has been picking cucumbers for the past two hours.",
    "\u201cMy hands burn in this heat,\u201d she tells me, gently caressing her fingertips.",
    "Summer hasn\u2019t even started yet, but already it is about 30 degrees here today and feeling hotter with the humidity.",
    "Sumathy has to protect her hands from the constant stabbing of the tiny spikes on the cucumbers, but the gloves make her sweat profusely.",
    "She comes to the cucumber farm before and after her main job, working as a cook in a school, and is paid about 200 rupees or just under \u00a32 for her efforts.",
    "\u201cI used to feel so exhausted being pregnant and working in the heat,\u201d she says.",
    "One day, as Sumathy was dropping off her husband\u2019s lunch, she suddenly started feeling very unwell. That evening, she went to see a doctor who told her she had suffered a miscarriage 12 weeks into her pregnancy.",
    "\u201cMy husband would lay me down on his lap and console me. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without him,\u201d she says.",
    "Sumathy talks about her husband with so much love but has had to learn to live without him. He recently died, and she is now the main breadwinner for the family.",
    "Sumathy will never know for sure if working in the heat during her pregnancy had anything to do with her losing her first child.",
    "But overall, the study found that women who worked in similar conditions as her were twice as likely to suffer a stillbirth or miscarriage than those working in cooler environments.",
    "The pregnant women in the study in India really are \u201cat the forefront of experiencing climate change,\u201d says Prof Hirst, who is a UK-based consultant obstetrician, and Professor of Global Women\u2019s Health at medical research organisation The George Institute.",
    "Earth\u2019s average temperature is projected to rise by nearly three degrees by the end of the century, compared with pre-industrial times, and the World Health Organization (WHO) is warning of \u201can existential threat to all of us\u201d with pregnant women facing \u201csome of the gravest consequences\u201d.",
    "Previous studies have shown about a 15% rise in the risk of premature birth and stillbirth during heatwaves, but these have generally been conducted in high-income countries such as the US and Australia.",
    "The latest findings from India are particularly stark and worrying, says Prof Hirst, and have wider implications.",
    "\u201cThe UK is getting hotter summers, and while it\u2019s not as hot as India, these adverse effects [on pregnancies] can be seen at much lower temperatures in more temperate climates, such as the UK.\u201d",
    "However, she adds, they do need to be \u201ckept in perspective\u201d. Even with a doubling of risk, experiencing baby loss is still going to be a \u201crare event for most women\u201d.",
    "There is currently no official international advice for pregnant working women in the heat.",
    "The main guidance that does exist for hot-weather working, is based on studies involving a man in the US military in the 1960s and 70s, weighing 70-75kg and with 20% body fat.",
    "Prof Hirst hopes this study, and further research, will change that. In the meantime, Prof Hirst and Prof Vidhya Venugopal, from the Faculty of Public Health at SRIHER, who led the research on India, say pregnant women working in the heat can protect themselves by:",
    "Avoiding exercising or sunbathing for long periods in the hottest part of the day",
    "For the study in India, the researchers used what is called the wet-bulb-globe-temperature (WBGT), which measures the effects of temperature, humidity, wind speed and radiant heat on human bodies.",
    "WBGT readings are often lower than the temperatures you might see forecast on the TV or a weather app.",
    "The safe heat threshold for people doing heavy work is 27.5C WBGT, according to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration.",
    "India is predicted to become one of the first countries in the world where temperatures will top the safe limit for healthy people who are simply resting in the shade, according to a recent study from the University of Cambridge.",
    "The number of hot days and hot nights (when the body struggles to recover from daytime heat) is also projected to double or even quadruple in India by 2050.",
    "In the sugarcane fields of Tiruvannamalai, Rekha Shanmugam, a former nurse and one of the SRIHER study\u2019s researchers, is measuring the daytime heat.",
    "Around us, a couple of dozen workers - about half of them women - hack down thick stems of cane with small machetes.",
    "\u201cThese women often have no choice but to work out in the sun - they need the money,\u201d says Ms Shanmugam.",
    "She pours water into a gauge and presses various buttons. It shows a WBGT temperature of 29.5C - that\u2019s above the safe threshold for doing this type of physically demanding work in the heat.",
    "\u201cIf the workers continue for prolonged periods in this level of heat, they are more prone to heat-related illnesses, and it\u2019s especially concerning for pregnant women,\u201d she tells me.",
    "Sandhiya, 28, tells me she has no choice but to do this type of back-breaking work for which she gets paid about 600 rupees, just under \u00a36 a day.",
    "Sandhiya also took part in the study - and lost her first child six months into her pregnancy.",
    "She had to take several months off work to recover and says she is still paying off the debts she racked up during that time.",
    "\u201cAll my desires centre around my children,\u201d Sandhiya tells me. \u201cI want them to study well and get good jobs. They shouldn\u2019t end up toiling here in the fields like me.\u201d",
    "The mechanisms around how and why heat impacts pregnant women and their growing babies in this troubling way are not well understood.",
    "A previous study in The Gambia found high temperatures could raise foetal heart rate and slow blood flow through the umbilical cord.",
    "One theory is that when the mother gets too hot, blood could be diverted away from the foetus, to help cool the mother down.",
    "Ms Shanmugam thinks a lack of toilets may also be playing a part.",
    "She says a previous study found many women didn\u2019t want to squat in an open field to relieve themselves and so would avoid drinking water, developing urinary problems as a result.",
    "\u201cThey worry about insects and snakes in the bushes, or men peeping to look at them,\u201d she says.",
    "\u201cThey often don\u2019t feel safe, so they\u2019ll just hold it in for the whole day and then finally go to the toilet when they get home.\u201d",
    "India has made huge improvements to maternal and baby health in recent years, but the stillbirth rate is still 12.2 per 1,000 births, according to data from the World Bank Group. In the UK the rate is 2.7.",
    "The findings of the study in Tamil Nadu are being taken very seriously, says Dr TS Selbavinayagam, the state\u2019s director for public health.",
    "\u201cWe already offer financial compensation to pregnant women, but maybe we need to look at options for giving alternative employment too,\u201d he says.",
    "The state government offers poorer women 18,000 rupees (\u00a3170) when they reach 12 weeks of pregnancy, to try to ease some of their financial pressures.",
    "However, much of the power to protect these low-paid workers rests with workplace bosses.",
    "On the outskirts of Chennai, Thillai Bhasker - a brick-kiln owner - has erected giant steel roofs with special heat-protective coatings on them, to provide his workers with much-needed shade.",
    "\u201cBusiness owners should be smart enough to know how to retain the employees,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you take care of them, they will take care of you.\u201d",
    "He also told us he was planning to build women-only toilets.",
    "Some organisations are also offering education sessions on the simple steps women can take to better protect themselves in the heat. Insulated bottles are also being made available to keep drinking water cool.",
    "Sumathy had no choice but to continue to work in extreme heat when she became pregnant again within a couple of years of her miscarriage.",
    "But she got specific advice from doctors and the SRIHER researchers on how to better protect herself. Sumathy gave birth to a healthy daughter and son.",
    "Tonight - after her long shift - she will return home to them."
