    "Hand over Health on Wheels and life-saving equipment and commodities",
    "UNFPA Asia Pacific Regional Director Pio Smith and Acting Ambassador of Japan Kotaro Katsuki yesterday ceremoniously handed over medical supplies to Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana.",
    "The medicines and medical equipment worth over than $ 2.1 million were donated under the project \u201cENSURE: Ensuring access to life-saving sexual and reproductive health and providing gender-based violence prevention and response services for women, girls and vulnerable groups\u201d. This project, which is entirely worth $ 4.6 million, has been funded by the Government of Japan, as part of a response to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka and is aimed to support women in vulnerable communities.",
    "The medical supplies that were donated include Female Pelvis Models, Perineum Suturing Training Models, Labour Beds, Biosafety Cabinets, Microscopes, Centrifuges, Male Condom Models, Neonatal CPR Simulators, Ultrasound Scanners, and Freezer Rooms for the storage of vaccines, HIV and STI related diagnostic kits.",
    "Solar-powered mobile clinics, called \u2018Health on Wheels\u2019, which will also run under this program worth half a million USD, represent a groundbreaking initiative to expand access to critical maternal and reproductive healthcare services, particularly for marginalised communities, both during current crises and in post-disaster situations. The Health on Wheels units will serve as lifelines for communities, delivering essential healthcare services directly to those in need, regardless of their location. These mobile clinics embody UNFPA\u2019s commitment to ensuring that every individual has access to quality healthcare, regardless of their circumstances.",
    "This event represents a significant milestone in our collective efforts to improve health outcomes and empower communities across Sri Lanka."
