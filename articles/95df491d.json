    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has slammed the sudden promises from presidential candidates Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake about reducing fertilizer prices and cutting farmers\u2019 loans, questioning as to where they were when farmers were struggling without access to fertilizers.",
    "The President highlighted that his efforts, including discussions with world leaders to secure fertilizer subsidies, were instrumental in getting farmers back to their fields and boosting rice production in the country.",
    "\u201cToday, promises are being made to lower fertilizer prices and erase farmers\u2019 debts. Yet, when farmers were in urgent need of fertilizer, those promises were not fulfilled. I ask Sajith and Anura, where were you then?\u201d",
    "\u201cI have worked to stabilize the country\u2019s economy through tough and often unpopular decisions. I reopened businesses that had closed, and now we have achieved economic stability,\u201d he said.",
    "President Wickremesinghe claimed that Sajith and Anura, who now speak about alleviating the people\u2019s burdens, offered no support during the economic crisis when the country needed it most.",
    "He charged that those who avoided responsibility during the crisis are now seeking power for themselves.",
    "President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during an election rally in Sainthamaruthu, Ampara yesterday (11).",
    "During his speech, the President emphasized the importance of trade and farming, which are vital sources of income for the Muslim community in the country.",
    "He warned that losing these sectors could lead to serious difficulties for the people. He urged attendees to seek out the SLMC for support in strengthening these crucial areas, and assured them that he has concrete plans to address these issues.",
    "The President also highlighted his commitment to conducting elections free from ethnic and religious biases.",
    "He affirmed that the legal right of Muslim citizens to be buried according to their customs is protected, contrasting his approach with that of other leaders who engage in divisive rhetoric on the campaign trail.",
    "Instead, President Wickremesinghe promised to fulfil his commitments and work towards the betterment of all communities."
