    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka plans to establish a national wealth fund using government assets, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.",
    "\u201cThere are plans to establish a national wealth fund using government assets, similar to investment companies created by countries like Norway, Qatar, and Singapore, where profits from government revenues are used for public welfare,\u201d Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by his media division.",
    "\u201cTraditionally, the funds from the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees\u2019 Trust Fund (ETF) were used to purchase bonds. However, under our current program, government spending has been reduced, and plans are in place to increase state revenues,\u201d Wickremesinghe said speaking at the launch of a retirement insurance system by Sanasa held in Colombo on Monday.",
    "\u201cAs revenues grow, the need to use provident fund money for bond purchases will diminish. We are in discussions to redirect these funds towards investment opportunities, and we intend to consult with trade unions and employers on this matter.\u201d",
    "New laws will be required to support these efforts, Wickremesinghe said, which would draw inspiration from existing legislation in countries like Denmark and Sweden. \u201cThese laws will also address investments and retirement plans.\u201d (Colombo/Sep3/2024)"
