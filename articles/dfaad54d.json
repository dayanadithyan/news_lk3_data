    "Colombo, April 29 (Daily Mirror) - Pope Francis will decide as to when Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith should retire, Director of Communications, the Archdiose of Colombo Fr. Jude Krishantha said today.",
    "\"It is the Pope who will decide as to when Cardinal Ranjith should go on retirement and the latter has no say in it,\" Fr. Krishantha told the media.",
    "\"Every Bishop is bound to inform the Pope that he has reached the retirement age when they become 75. Therefore, Cardinal Ranjith informed one and a half years ago that he had completed his 75th year. However, the Pope had told him to continue as the Archbishop of Colombo for some more time as he is still lively. In the meantime, a Cardinal can remain active and can vote at a conclave to elect a new Pope until he reaches the age of 80. This is the tradition of the Catholic Church,\" he added."
