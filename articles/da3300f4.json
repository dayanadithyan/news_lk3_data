    "AIA Insurance shone at the recently held 4A\u2019s Advertising with a remarkable five awards recognising the company\u2019s creative and engaging campaigns.",
    "AIA\u2019s \u2018Suwa Walan\u2019 was a campaign that emerged as a standout, securing three awards including two Gold awards. The campaign done in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Cancer Society and creative agency Loops integrated, was a unique campaign that tapped into local insights to drive awareness and education about breast cancer and the importance of self-examination. The campaign combined physical and digital elements to drive this education and awareness by leveraging the cultural practice of Sri Lankan women checking clay pots (Walan) for imperfections by which, the campaign effectively communicated the importance of self-examination in a culturally sensitive manner. The campaign addressed the hesitations Sri Lankan women have regarding regular checkups due to taboos, misconceptions about pain, and costs. By paralleling the practice of checking clay pots with self-examination for breast cancer, Suwa Walan resonated deeply within the cultural context, encouraging women to adopt regular self-screening practices. AIA Suwa Walan drew inspiration from timeless Sri Lankan art and incorporated these elements into the campaign, making the message of breast cancer self-examination visually compelling and deeply resonant with the target audience.",
    "This campaign won Golds for \u2018Best Use of Ambient Media\u2019 and \u2018Design (Environment & Experience) \u2019 as well as Bronze in \u2018Use of Cultural Nuance \u2013 Static Special\u2019.",
    "Celebrated for its insightful incorporation of cultural elements, The AIA Prarthana Kodiya campaign also yielded impressive results, with two awards including Silver in \u2018Best Use of Activation \u2013 Not For Profit\u2019 and Bronze in \u2018Best Use of Ambient Media\u2019. This campaign in collaboration with creative agency TBWA was carried down during the AIA Poson Safety Programme.",
    "Tapping into potent local insight, AIA rolled out an initiative to deter pilgrims from taking risks in the water. By using a traditional Buddhist \u2018wish flag\u2019 (Prarthana Kodiya) with the message \u201cMay the devotees not get into unsafe waters,\u201d AIA successfully conveyed the importance of safety. These wish flags were not just read by the pilgrims but also taken to heart, as seen by their effusive comments. They also went an extra mile to hang these wish flags on the sacred Bo tree in the holy city of Anuradhapura in a heartfelt gesture of imbibing it into their prayers.",
