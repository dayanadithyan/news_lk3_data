    "Sri Lanka said it failed to reach an agreement with bondholders to restructure about $12 billion debt earlier this week, raising concerns there could be a delay in the island nation receiving a third tranche of its $2.9 billion IMF program in June.",
    "The government said one of the main stumbling blocks had been that the \u201cbaseline parameters\u201d of the bondholders\u2019 plan had not matched those embedded in its IMF program.",
    "\u201cWe encourage both parties to continue their discussions swiftly,\u201d the IMF statement added.",
    "Sri Lanka will consult with the IMF to assess if the latest proposals discussed with bondholders were within the parameters of its bailout program.",

    "Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis since independence from the British in 1948 after its foreign exchange reserves fell to record lows in early 2022, leaving it unable to pay for essentials including fuel, cooking gas, and medicine."
