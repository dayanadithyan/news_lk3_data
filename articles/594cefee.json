    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2014 Proposed education reforms in Sri Lanka will involve not just education experts but will also welcome input from other professionals, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said calling for collaboration between all stakeholders.",
    "Politicising education would inevitably lead to Sri Lanka\u2019s downfall, said, calling for collaborations to devise the most effective education system for the country within the next two to three years.",
    "Wickremesinghe made these remarks at the 10th Biennial Conference of the All Island Professional Lecturers\u2019 Association (APLA), held at the Nelum Pokuna Theater in Colombo on Tuesday April 23.",
    "The government\u2019s forthcoming education reforms would not solely involve education experts but would also welcome input from school teachers, professionals in the economic sector, and organisations like the APLA, Wickremesinghe said calling for inclusive dialogue in shaping the future of education.",
    "Globally, he said, the traditional schooling system and supplementary classes are intertwined.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve gleaned valuable insights from the recent economic downturn and are steadily recovering. However, we must forge ahead with a new economic paradigm, one centered on exports and marked by fierce competitiveness. Simultaneously, we must strive for economic growth that alleviates poverty.",
    "\u201cIn addition to these considerations, it\u2019s imperative to craft an education system that aligns with our country\u2019s needs. We must delve into the dynamics between formal schooling and extracurricular activities, while also exploring the integration of technology and artificial intelligence into education. Presently, technology is driving significant changes in education, and it\u2019s crucial that we embrace and adapt to this transformation,\u201d the president\u2019s office quoted him as saying.",
    "Noting that Sri Lanka pioneered Western-style education in Asia and was among the first to implement free education, Wickremesinghe said that, over the next two to three years, the island nation must strategise on incorporating this new technology into its education system.",
    "\u201cWe need to envision a modern education framework tailored for 2050, rather than 2030,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThese educational reforms must not be confined to the domain of education experts alone. General educators, representatives from the economic sector, and organisations like the All Island Professional Lecturers\u2019 Association should also actively participate. The discourse on educational reform should be inclusive, with every idea given due consideration. Politics should not overshadow education; turning it into a mere tool for political maneuvering achieves nothing. Ultimately, it\u2019s the nation that suffers. Hence, it\u2019s imperative for everyone to transcend political divides and collaborate towards shaping the future of education collectively.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe said that, over the next two to three years, it is imperative that Sri Lanka engages in discussions to determine the optimal education system for the country by the year 2050.",
    "\u201cWe must also remain adaptable to ongoing technological advancements beyond that time-frame,\u201d he added. (Colombo/Apr24/2024)"
