    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) member Prof. G.L. Peiris yesterday accused the Government of merely acting out a facade while claiming to be striking a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "Peiris said that the Government\u2019s IMF-related actions have little tangible progress. He emphasised that the only notable action taken thus far is the misappropriation of working people\u2019s funds under the pretext of restructuring domestic debt. Peiris asserted that as a consequence, the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund and the Employees\u2019 Trust Fund were subjected to plunder. He further highlighted that despite the Government\u2019s commitment to the IMF regarding negotiations with foreign private creditors and reaching an agreement before April, no such actions have been taken. Accordingly, Peiris said the IMF has directed the Government to enact a bill aimed at curbing rampant corruption and fraud. Furthermore, the IMF has imposed a crucial condition, specifying that the third instalment of $ 334 billion will not be disbursed until this requirement is fulfilled.",
    "Peiris also noted that the agreements made with the IMF for the sake of the country\u2019s economic stability have not produced the anticipated results thus far. He remarked that the Government is even reneging on promises made to the IMF while simultaneously deceiving the people."
