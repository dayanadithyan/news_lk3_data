    "Sri Lanka\u2019s National Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force (NAHTTF) has issued a serious warning about a rising trend in forced criminality linked to cyber scam centers in Myanmar.",
    "Human traffickers are actively targeting young IT professionals through fraudulent job offers abroad, it said issuing a statement today.",
    "Investigations reveal that traffickers are luring victims with promises of high-paying IT positions in countries like Thailand.",
    "However, unsuspecting individuals are taken to transit countries such as Dubai for supposed job interviews before being forcibly moved across borders. Many end up in Myanmar, where they are coerced into working at cyber scam centers under brutal conditions, including physical abuse, torture, and electrocution, it said.",
    "\u201cWe strongly advise against illegal migration routes,\u201d the NAHTTF warned. \u201cJob seekers must avoid opportunities that require travel on visit visas, as this violates the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Act.\u201d",
    "The task force urges the public to pursue safe and legal migration options through authorized channels, remain vigilant, and report suspicious trafficking activities. Protecting vulnerable individuals from exploitation is a top priority.",
    "Reports of suspicious activity can be made to the NAHTTF via the following:",
    "The statement added that all reports will be treated with strict confidentiality and that public cooperation is crucial in dismantling dangerous trafficking networks and saving lives."
