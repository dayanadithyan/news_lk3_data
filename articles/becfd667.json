    "De-Zoysa, who was studying in Canada as an international student, is set to return to court next week where lawyers expect to set dates for a preliminary inquiry in his case.",
    "Investigators allege the young man is responsible for the deaths of 35-year-old Darshani Ekanayake and her four children, who were between the ages of two months and seven years old, as well as a family friend.",
    "They believe the family was attacked with a knife or \u201cother edged weapon.\u201d",
    "As neighbours and Ottawa residents learned the first details of the gruesome crime, staff at Algonquin College in Ottawa were investigating the possible connections to the school.",
    "The college\u2019s president asked his staff to look into it after Ottawa police Chief Eric Stubbs revealed at a press conference that De-Zoysa was an international student.",

    "The next day, Bruce Hickey, the college\u2019s communication manager, said they had asked a colleague \u201cto run the names of the two adult deceased from Barrhaven through our system.\u201d",
    "The exact program De-Zoysa was registered for was redacted in the documents, as was most other personal information like his addresses, birthdate and student number.",
    "In a statement on Thursday, Hickey said the emails show the work college staff did to respond to the \u201cmany media requests\u201d about the tragedy.",
    "He did not respond to questions about why the school searched the name of the adult victims or whether the school has been in touch with investigators about the information they found.",
    "The emails show that several members of the media, including The Canadian Press, pressed the college for more information in the immediate aftermath of the killings.",
    "In one email, Hickey said \u201cwe\u2019re still holding on our original lines. Pulling in as much detail as I can on this (college\u2019s) connections today. Will keep you posted.\u201d",
    "Emails show how the school was also dealing with international media attention.",
    "\u201cHad to send this one your way \u2026 the requests just keep coming \u2026 from everywhere,\u201d Hickey wrote when an NBC News reporter in Los Angeles inquired about De-Zoysa.",
    "All the victims found in the townhome except the youngest child were Sri Lankan nationals who arrived in the city within the past several years.",

    "He has since been released and requested privacy as he mourns the loss of his family.",
    "Ottawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe has called the killings \u201cone of the most shocking incidents of violence\u201d in the city\u2019s history."
