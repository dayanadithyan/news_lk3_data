  "original_body_lines": [
    "Whoever the rulers were in previous governments, they used to print money once a year when they were unable to get loans, Mass Media Minister Bandula Gunawardana said.",
    "While addressing the media at the Colombo Journalists Cricket League (CJCL), he said previous governments took loans locally and internationally.",
    "\"When the loans were not sufficient, they automatically turned to print money. Today we cannot get loans from any country, as we already announced that our country has gone bankrupt and cannot pay the loans,\" he said.",
    "\"Now we cannot even print money. If we continue to print money, the IMF has stated that the country would completely collapse and would not be accepted for their loan facility,\" he added.",
    "We used to get loans and print money continuously, but that practice has now come to an end. Whoever rules the country should face reality. Therefore, every person in the country has to face many difficulties, the Minister said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
