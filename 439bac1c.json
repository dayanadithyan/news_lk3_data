    "Opening up of the local fuel sales market is a welcome move, a Samagi Jana Balwegaya (SJB) MP said today.",
    "SJB Deputy National Organizer and official Spokesman S. M. Marikar was referring to Monday\u2019s cabinet decision to allow two more foreign companies to enter into the local fuel market.",
    "\u201cOpening up the fuel sales market is a welcome move as the consumers will benefit from it at the end of the day. Competitiveness will increase when there are several players in the market and thus pave the way for frequent price reductions,\u201d Marikar said.",
    "\u201cIt is advisable to open up the education and the health markets as well. Private sector should be allowed to open up more hospitals so that Sri Lanka will be able to attract people in countries such as Maldives to come to this island for medical treatment, he added.",
    "\u201cOne must not think that I am favourable towards the incumbent President and the government when I welcome the opening of the fuel market. We welcome any move to which SJB could agree,\u201d he also said.",
    "Further, he said there are different options when restructuring state owned enterprises. \u201cOne can follow the Singaporean model where an institution made up of both the state sector and the private sector could be set up to run government institutions while the private sector could be given the task of managing the institutions,\u201d he said in this regard.",
    "Whilst lauding the incumbent President for changing the ideologies of SLPP which opposed the IMF and the restructuring of state institutions, the SJB MP opposed the President at the same time. \u201cDemocratic Ranil Wickremesinghe has died and only Ranil Wickremesinghe the dictator is alive today,\u201d he said.(Yohan Perera)"
