  "original_body_lines": [
    "With the sharp declining in prices of fuel and coal in the world market, there is a possibility of reducing the electricity consumption charges this country by about 25%, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Chairman Janaka Rathnayaka said.",
    "He told the media that he had taken the necessary legitimate measures to reduce the charges for power consumption.",
    "The demand for electricity had declined by 20% with the electric tariff increases in August last year and January this year.",
    "\"One of the assumptions of increasing the electricity bill in January was to produce electricity to cater the demand during the drought season, which the country has to face every year.\" During the Advanced Level examination period, 8 GWh of electricity was produced, but I requested for 10 GWh. Currently, we are producing 13 GWh. All these are done by the ministry, not for the sake of the public. I do not know what the political authorities are expecting from working in this manner,\" Rathnayaka said.",
    "However, the activities relate to power generation is not done considering the benefit of the country.",
    "The recent electricity tariff must have been increased by 35%, whereas it was increased by 65%.",
    "Therefore, the demand has come down. He also said that the prices of fuel should have been reduced much earlier. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
