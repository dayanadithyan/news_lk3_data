  "original_body_lines": [
    "Preventive measures are underway to control Lumpy Skin Disease, which is currently spreading in several divisional secretariats in the North Central Province, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.",
    "This disease, which was widespread in the Northern Province, has now been brought under control in that province.",
    "Although the provincial livestock department has informed the farmers not to bring the cattle affected by the disease to the North Central province, the livestock department revealed that the disease spread in the province due to the fact that the farmers in the North Central province have ignored the instructions.",
    "The reason for developing and spreading of this disease is due to the increase in direct contact between cattle, according to the Livestock Division.",
    "Increased close contact between animals, especially due to reasons such as releasing the cattle into lakes and uncultivated paddy lands for grazing has a major impact on the spread of this disease.",
    "This disease is caused by a virus called Capripox, and due to ticks, flies, and other small blood-sucking fleas, the virus\u00a0 spread quickly among cattle.",
    "Especially due to the mental disorder caused in the cattle due to this condition, the ability of producing milk is impaired.",
    "The disease gets cured in about two weeks, and there is very little chance of cattle dying. But since milk production is impaired, the spread of this disease could be controlled if the diseased animals are separated from other healthy ones. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
