    "The United National Party (UNP) is to be reorganized as it does not want to depend solely on the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) when it comes to future elections, party senior Navin Dissanayake said yesterday.",
    "Mr. Dissanayake told a media briefing that the re- organization will begin next month. \u201cWe also intend to celebrate May Day in a grand way,\u201d he said.",
    "While denying the allegation made by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa that there is a move to buy over Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MPs, Dissanayake said the SJB MPs are expected to cross over on their own.",
    "\u201cSJB MPs could always work in accordance with their conscience .We expect them to join us. Most of them have realized that SJB has no future and that the Jathika Jana Balawegaya has become stronger. Also the economy has picked up. Interest rates are expected to be slashed by May while the inflation rate is expected to be reduced up to around 15 percent by the end of the year. Therefore, they are expected to join the UNP once again,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cMost of the SJB members have realized that there is a future with President Wickremesinghe,\u201d he added. (Yohan Perera)"
