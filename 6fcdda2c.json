    "The Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday said proposals and suggestions from the media on the proposed Broadcasting Authorities Bill will be welcomed by the Government.",
    "According to Rajapakshe, the Bill is yet to be finalised and it remains a mere set of proposals. \u201cTherefore media organisations can submit their proposals on the legislation,\u201d he said.",
    "The Minister said a Ministerial Sub-Committee led by him has been set up to regulate and ensure licences to broadcasters are issued in a standardised manner. \u201cThis committee has merely formulated a set of proposals. They will be discussed, and a draft bill formulated later,\u201d he said.",
    "According to Wijeyadasa, the Ministry of Mass Media has set up a discussion on 7 June with media organisations on the matter. \u201cThere is no point in discussing this matter now as it is still in the proposals stage. The media are welcome to submit their suggestions and proposals as well,\u201d he said."
