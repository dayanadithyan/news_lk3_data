    "It is essential to include sex education in the school curriculum, State Minister Diana Gamage proposed today.",
    "\u201cChildren of today are unaware of the real facts about sex. This is why they fall into various troubles. Some schoolchildren do not know what a social disease is. Some children may be infected with various social diseases without their knowledge as they are not aware of these diseases. They don\u2019t know even the symptoms of these diseases,\u201d the State Minister said.",
    "\u201cParents should spend more time with their children and I appeal to the parents to spend more time with them,\u201d she added.",
    "Taking a swipe on the comments made about her by SJB MPs, Ms. Gamage said everyone will be able to see the fate of these MPs soon.",
    "\u201cI was the General Secretary of the Ape Jathika Peramuna. I cannot run a political party if I am not a citizen of this country. Under such circumstances the agreement which I entered into with the MPs is not valid. Imagine what would happen to SJB MPs under such circumstances,\u201d she said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
