    "It is reported that there is a high spread of the third dengue virus strain (DENV-3) in the country, Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) consultant paediatrician Dr. Deepal Perera said.",
    "He said what was earlier prevalent was the second dengue virus strain (DENV-2), but what is spreading now is the third strain of the dengue virus.",
    "\"Dengue is the most significant mosquito-borne viral disease that affects humans. The DENV-3 virus is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes; for most people, this infection is either asymptomatic or dengue fever develops,\" he said.",
    "Mild dengue fever causes a high fever and flu-like symptoms, and a severe form of dengue fever, also called dengue haemorrhagic\u00a0fever, can cause serious bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock), and death, he said.",
    "If fever develops and continues for three consecutive days, Dr. Perera advises a blood test to check the platelet count. He requested children to be taken to hospitals if the blood count was below 150,000/mm3 (<150 G/L). He urged people to provide patients with all natural liquid foods except red and black foods and also to provide Paracetamol doses following doctor's advice. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
