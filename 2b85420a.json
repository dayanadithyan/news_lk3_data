  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has posted a balance of payments surplus of 211 million US dollars in January 2023, data shows, as the island\u2019s intermediate regime central bank operated peg with complementary monetary policy.",
    "Sri Lanka ended 2022 with a balance of payments deficit of 2,773 million US dollar, lower than the record 2,961 million dollars recorded in 2021.",
    "In 2022 BOP deficits were run after the central bank ran out of reserves, using borrowed Asian Clearing Union money given by India.",
    "The 2022 balance payments deficit peaked at 3,035 million dollars in August.",
    "In the next four months, the central bank ran a balance of payments surplus of 262 million US dollars.",
    "Sri Lanka began to run BOP deficits in the current credit cycle, from around July 2019 \u00a0when interest rate mis-targeting began with money printed for yield curve targeting and ended in August 2022 leaving the country in external default.",
    "It appears to be the longest period of deficit BOP in the history of the central bank.",
    "A BOP deficit is the result of running both monetary and exchange rate policy where interest rates are below the rate required to maintain external stability and banks give credit with money printed by central bank open market operations.",
    "A BOP surplus \u2013 as in January 2023 \u2013 happens due to rates which are higher than required to maintain external stability and banks give lower levels of credit than they get from deposits and debt repayments.",
    "From late 2022 an unusual situation has occurred where central bank Treasury bill holdings are rolled over at high rates.",
    "A draft central bank law proposed under an International Monetary Fund program, allows for both monetary and exchange rate policy and also output gap targeting or monetary stimulus, further intensifying money and exchange policy conflicts.",
    "Sri Lanka set to continue 73 years of monetary instability with pseudo inflation targeting law",
    "Under so-called flexible inflation targeting where money is printed to trigger inflation as high as 5 percent (a domestic anchor), Sri Lanka experienced serial currency crises and BOP deficits over the past decade due to operating a flexible exchange rate (a de facto external anchor).",
    "The external anchor had tended to break from open market operations, before the 5 percent inflation targeting was met. Ghana operated conflicting money and exchange rate policies with a 7 percent domestic anchor.",
    "Under an IMF program, where reserve targets are set (NIR floor), there is no opportunity to move to a single anchor regime (a clean float) where there are no anchor conflicts.",
    "A clean floating exchange rate has no BOP deficits or surpluses as the central bank\u2019s net international reserves do not change, except from earnings on legacy reserves.",
    "Due to the policy rate and aggressive open market operations encouraged under a monetary policy consultation clause with a high inflation target, there is no opportunity to operate a single anchor hard peg under IMF programs. As a result Sri Lanka missed reserve targets in the last IMF program.",
    "Analysts who watched flexible inflation targeting in action in recent years had warned that the country risked external default.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Weimar Republic factor is inviting dollar sovereign default: Bellwether",
    "Sri Lanka is not Greece, it is a Latin America style soft-peg: Bellwether",
    "A rising foreign reserve target (an NIR floor) requires a ceiling on domestic assets and a prohibition on open market operations to suppress rates which can spike temporarily due to domestic credit fluctuations.",
    "If the policy rate is mis-targeted when private credit recovers, currency crises tend to occur again and again, and such flexible exchange rate/soft-pegged central banks become repeat customers of the IMF.",
    "To avoid going to the IMF and also external default the central bank either has to abandon its policy rate, or the reserve target. (Colombo/Mar02/2023)"
