    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lankan exports are likely to see reduced demand this year and in 2024, to a top Central Bank official said, as a looming global recession could force the island nation exporters to reduce merchandise exports.",
    "Though Sri Lanka witnessed a 4.9% increase in exports to USD 13.1 billion compared to the previous year, the trend has reversed in the first quarter of the year.",
    "The merchandise exports, led by garments, fell 7.9% compared to the same period last year. These numbers come as a looming recession in the island nation\u2019s export destinations are taking the toll.",
    "\u201cOn the global front, if you see, maybe this year and first half of next year,",
    "you will see tight monetary conditions and financial conditions will have some dampening impact on our external demand,\u201d stated Director of the Economic Research Department at Central Bank, P.K.G. Harischandra.",
    "Sri Lanka has banked on its exports to boost foreign revenue in its process to get rid of the ongoing economic crisis. The island nation expects a 7.6 percent growth in its exports this year to USD 14.1 billion.",
    "Harischandra, however, said not everything is gloomy though geopolitics will also have some impacts on the exports.",
    "\u201cWhat we are seeing now is that our export reduction due to any drop in national demand will be recouped by the increasing remittances and tourism money,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThis is helping us to balance the overall balance of payment conditions. But the other geopolitical developments will also have some impact and we don\u2019t know the direction that they will go, globally.\u201d (Colombo/May10/2023)"
