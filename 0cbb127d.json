    "Projects economy to contract by 4.3% this year amid tepid demand",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s heightened fiscal, external and financial sector imbalances and its fluid political situation pose significant uncertainty for the country\u2019s economic outlook, said the World Bank in its twice-a-year update, underscoring the need to address the root causes of the country\u2019s economic crisis and build a strong and resilient economy to prevent future crises.",
    "Sri Lanka Development Update (SLDU) titled \u2018Time to Reset\u2019, released this week, projected the country\u2019s economy to contract by 4.3 percent in 2023, as demand continues to be subdued, job and income losses intensify and supply-side constraints adversely affect production.",
    "\u201cThe economic crisis in Sri Lanka has had deep impacts with over half a million jobs lost and 2.7 million additional people falling into poverty between 2021 and 2022,\u201d said World Bank Country Director for the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka Faris H. Hadad-Zervos.",
    "\u201cThe prolonged recovery from the scarring effects of this crisis in addition to a slow debt restructuring process, limited external financing support and an uncertain global environment pose significant risks to the country\u2019s economic growth.\u201d",
    "SLDU said the economy would continue to face significant challenges in 2023 and beyond. A lower-level external trade equilibrium could have contagion effects on domestic trade, economic activity, jobs and incomes.\u00a0 Combined with adverse effects from revenue-mobilisation efforts, which are essential for regaining fiscal sustainability, poverty projections could worsen, it warrened.",
    "It also stressed that the country\u2019s financial sector needs to be managed carefully, given rising non-preforming loans and large public sector exposures.",
    "Meanwhile, the development lender noted that mitigating the impacts on the poor and vulnerable remains critical during the adjustment and stressed that reducing poverty requires better-targeted social assistance, an expansion of employment in industry and services and a recovery in the real value of incomes.",
    "However, strong and effective implementation of the government\u2019s reform programme, supported by financing from international partners, could boost confidence and attract fresh capital inflows that are key to improve job prospects and restore livelihoods, the World Bank said.",
    "\u201cThe current crisis is not a temporary liquidity shock that can be resolved by external financing support from outside. Instead, the crisis provides a unique opportunity to implement deep and permanent structural reforms that may be difficult in normal circumstances,\u201d added Hadad-Zervos. \u201cSri Lanka can use this opportunity to build a strong and resilient economy.\u201d"
