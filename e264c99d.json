    "Chennai Super Kings and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni met Sri Lankan pacer Matheesha Pathirana's family after qualifying for the Indian Premier League final.",
    "Dhoni have always nurtured young talents and this year, Sri Lankan pacer Matheesha Pathirana is no different.",
    "It was Dhoni who spotted the 20-year-old early and brought him into the CSK fold. \u201cPathirana is an excellent death bowler. Also, with his action, it is slightly difficult to pick. He has got that slower one also. So you have to watch him very carefully. Which means when you spend those extra seconds watching the ball and he is bowling at a decent pace, it becomes quite difficult to consistently hit him,\u201d Dhoni had said.",
    "Now, after qualifying for the Indian Premier League final, Dhoni met with the young Sri Lankan player\u2019s family.",
    "\u201cNow we are sure that malli is in safe hands when thala said \u201cYou have nothing to worry about Matheesha, he\u2019s always with me,\u201d Pathirana\u2019s sister Vishuka said on Instagram along with photos of Dhoni and their family.",
    "Meanwhile, four-time champions Chennai Super Kings beat Gujarat Titans by 15 runs in the Qualifier 1 to enter final of the Indian Premier League.",
    "Defending champions GT will get another chance to reach the final as they play the winner of the Eliminator in Qualifier 2 at Ahmedabad on Friday. Sent in to bat, opener Ruturaj Gaikwad top-scored with a 44-ball 60 as Chennai Super Kings posted a competitive 172 for seven. (TIE)"
