    "Commenting on the visit via Twitter, Ambassador Chung said: \u201cTea production is key to Sri Lanka\u2019s economy and the region\u2019s success. I met with the Managing Director and Regional Manager of Hayleys Plantation to explore a business owner\u2019s perspective on challenges from the economic crisis and how to meet the needs of plantation workers.\u201d",
    "During her visit, Hayleys Plantations Managing Director Dr. Roshan Rajadurai and his team demonstrated the innovative technology and processes set in place at Kelani Valley Plantations (KVPL), including its implementation of digital weighing scales linked to personalised NFC cards to reliably track and reward employees on performance.",
    "The tour also included discussions on a range of initiatives undertaken by Hayleys Plantations to support the health and well-being of their workforce and address the challenges presented by the current economic crisis. These initiatives were showcased in detail during the visit, with the team providing an overview of the company\u2019s exceptional welfare programs implemented over the last two years.",

    "The visit follows that of Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka Hideaki Mizukoshi to the Pedro Estate late last year. \u201cIt has been a pleasure to witness how Sri Lanka\u2019s world-renowned tea is manufactured. We were privileged to visit the beautiful tea fields and experience the new innovations in sustainability and HR pioneered by Hayleys Plantations. Employees are at the heart of any enterprise, and this was clearly evident during the discussions I had with some of the employees. I wish the company all the best in their future endeavours and applaud the unique processes and systems they have put in place with the support of JASTECA,\u201d Ambassador Mizukoshi commented on his visit.",
