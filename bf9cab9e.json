    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s John Keells Holdings is continuing talks with international gaming firms to operate its casino in the Cinnamon Life integrated resort, shareholders were told in the annual report.",
    "\u201cA lot of groundwork has been carried out by the parties, including detailed site visits, evaluation of the business case and operating model, fit-out requirements, designs and timelines,\u201d JKH said.",
    "\u201cThe discussions are progressing well, where various commercial structures and arrangements are being negotiated.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe envisaged structure of the gaming operations is that \u2018Cinnamon Life Integrated Resort\u2019 will lease space to the gaming entity, while a third party will invest in the gaming fit-out.\u201d",

    "\u201cIn the event \u2018Cinnamon Life Integrated Resort\u2019 is unable to obtain favourable terms to our satisfaction, as an alternative, we will work on a model where the gaming entity sources the requisite international gaming expertise to operate at \u2018Cinnamon Life Integrated Resort\u2019, similar to how some other successful regional integrated resorts have established operations.\u201d",
