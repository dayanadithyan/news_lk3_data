    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s shares closed slightly higher on Friday, ending a three-day fall with buying interest returned to the banking and financial sectors, which had been dragging the market down over fears of domestic debt restructuring following the International Monetary Fund loan approval, brokers said.",

    "Top gainers were Sampath Bank, Melstacorp, and Commercial Bank. (Colombo/ March 24/2023)"
