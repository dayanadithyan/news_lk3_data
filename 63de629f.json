    "More than one third of agricultural areas in Sri Lanka are fed by canals networks linked to major irrigation projects. Those canals have their own hierarchy similar to electric power lines. The main canal of any major irrigation project which is about 50 km long is similar to high tension power lines. Then, there are distributaries, which are similar to low-tension power lines. There are about 100 km of distributary canals in a typical irrigation project. Field canals serving about 10 hectares are similar to the power lines along roads serving individual users. There are about 1,500 field canals in a typical irrigation project. It is necessary to rehabilitate these manmade canal networks equipped with thousands of concrete structures every 20 or 30 years. For an example, an irrigation system covering about 14,000 hectares in Uda Walawe Right Bank area is now in need of rehabilitation, the estimated cost of which is about 100 USD There are many similar major irrigation projects needing rehabilitation within next 25 years",
    "Usually, these cyclic rehabilitation programmes are implemented by borrowing funds form international donors such as World Bank, ADB, etc. However, in time to come, the dependency on such outside funding sources is questionable in view of the trends of current lending criteria for countries such as Sri Lanka. Therefore, it is very essential to plan such rehabilitation programs guarantying their self-sustainability beyond the implementation phases.",
    "One way to address this challenge is to introduce management tactics which would facilitate harnessing of human resource available within the users (farming community) for the future Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation infrastructure after the rehabilitation phases. If properly planned, rehabilitation phase of already deteriorated irrigation projects provides a good opportunity to introduce innovative approach to avoid our dependencies on Donors for future rehabilitation programs. For an example, the following paper describes a Water Management Program which was implemented in 2000 in System H of the Mahaweli Project with the objective of tapping the human resource available within the Farming Community strategically to address that challenge.",
    "Above programme was implemented during 1998-2003 as a parallel activity with a rehabilitation program under Mahaweli Restructuring and Rehabilitation Project (MRRP) in System H of Mahaweli Project. As a result of this effort the water consumption in the System H drops down with time. Within 4 Years period from 2000, average water usage was reduced by 30% & cropping intensity was almost doubled. Farmers were also motivated to diversify cropping patterns deviating from rice to high value export-oriented crops. Young generations of farming communities were also attracted to agriculture because of the reliability of water availability. Some Farmer Organizations even hired consultants independently to introduce High Tech on-farm irrigation technologies such as Drips and Sprinklers and Marketing Channels such as Cold Chains. Farmers also became aware of importance of maintaining good quality ground water acquirers to avoid kidney diseases caused by pollution by agrochemicals. Above approach was also recognized by the World Bank in 2003 as the best management approach suitable for farming culture in South Asian countries.",
    "Because of new management approach, the Farmers would be able to enjoy the Water User Rights in Volume Basis in addition to Land Rights in Area basis. Also, when water become available at their farm gates On-Demand basis like other public services similar to Drinking Water, farmer organisations would be able to start joint ventures with strong footing with private sector companies specialised in irrigated agriculture. Following News Paper article explains a strategy to initiate this effort jointly with Authorities responsible for managing Irrigation Systems.",
    "Main purpose of this note is to draw the attention of decision makers at political level to initiate the above concept using Uda Walawe Right Bank area as the Pilot Demonstration. As explained above, Irrigation System covering about 14,000 Hectares in the down south of Sri Lanka (Uda Walawe Right Bank area) is now in need for rehabilitation. Estimated cost for the rehabilitation is about 100 MUS$. A Feasibility Study report prepared for this rehabilitation project has also been approved by the Ministry of Finance to source funds from International Donors. In that report, above approach has also been specifically recemented as the right path to address the present food & $ crisis.",
