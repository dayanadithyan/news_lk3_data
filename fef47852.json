    "In October 2022, the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Sri Lanka (MMCA Sri Lanka) launched \u2018MMCA Afterschool\u2019, an initiative that provides children aged 6\u201310 with stimulating, fun, and collaborative learning experiences in the context of the country\u2019s first museum of modern and contemporary art. The programme has successfully completed two terms, with the participation of 20 children in Term 1 (October\u2013December 2022), and 30 children in Term 2 (January\u2013February 2023).",
    "MMCA Afterschool is a programme led by the Education Department of MMCA Sri Lanka and delivered with the support of the Visitor Educators (VEs) of the museum. Speaking on the conceptualisation and planning that led to the programme, Sanuja Goonetilleke, Curator of Learning and Training noted that, \u201cThe MMCA Afterschool programme began with the question \u2018how can a modern and contemporary art museum based in Colombo cater to a child?\u2019\u201d, adding that, \u201cObserving how children in Sri Lanka typically experience syllabi and assessment-based \u2018cramming\u2019 in schools, we felt that opportunities which make space for children to develop their overall life skills in formal educational settings are sporadic at best. MMCA Afterschool is hence offered as an educational, yet fun programme that contributes to a child\u2019s overall development and learning needs in Sri Lanka\u201d.",
    "The Visitor Educators of the MMCA Sri Lanka guide the children through all the activities that span across four two-hour sessions. Goonetilleke reflected on the learning and training opportunities that the programme opens for the VEs, noting that \u201cTo keep things novel and interesting for children, no two sessions of MMCA Afterschool are exactly the same. This means that behind the scenes, our VEs research, create, tweak, deliver, and evaluate activities on a weekly basis.\u201d She continued by adding \u201cI am incredibly proud of how our VEs\u2013some who have prior teaching experience and some who have none\u2013have taken on these responsibilities and new roles.\u201d",
    "These sessions engage the children in conversations, tours, discussions, creative writing, object/art-making, movement-based activities, treasure hunts, and much more. Speaking on the enthusiasm shown by the children and their parents/guardians/caregivers alike towards the programme, Pramodha Weerasekera, Assistant Curator of Education and Public Programmes said that, \u201cThe reception from parents has been wonderful. Many of them are excited about the creative freedom with guidance that the programme provides. The programme is also an opportunity for children to gather and socialise after almost three years of reduced social interaction.\u201d",
    "The MMCA Sri Lanka is an education-led initiative that aims to establish a public museum dedicated to the display, research, collection, and conservation of modern and contemporary art for the benefit and enjoyment of the general public, schools, and tourists. As a space that facilitates learning experiences at the intersections of education, entertainment, and creative engagement, the MMCA Sri Lanka is an ideal context for children to engage in learning through interaction with Sri Lankan modern and contemporary art. Parents/guardians/caregivers are invited to visit the museum with their children, at the Ground floor of Crescat Boulevard, Colombo 3, from 10am\u20136pm daily.
