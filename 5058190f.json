  "original_body_lines": [
    "One of Zimbabwe\u2019s most influential diplomats, Uebert Angel, offered to use his status to launder millions of dollars through a gold-smuggling scheme, during an undercover operation by Al Jazeera\u2019s Investigative Unit (I-Unit).",
    "Angel, appointed ambassador-at-large and a presidential envoy by Zimbabwe\u2019s President Emmerson Mnangagwa in March 2021, told reporters he would be able to carry large volumes of dirty cash into the country using his diplomatic status.",
    "The 44-year-old, who claims to be a prophet and heads a congregation \u2014 the Good News Church \u2014 with branches in 15 countries, said he would facilitate a scheme through which unaccounted cash could be exchanged for Zimbabwe\u2019s gold. Recipients of the gold could then sell the precious metal for legitimate money, effectively turning their cash clean.",
    "Angel and his business partner Rikki Doolan also claimed that their laundering operations had the approval of Mnangagwa, who has been in power since November 2017, when Zimbabwe\u2019s controversial former leader Robert Mugabe was ousted in a military coup.",
    "\u201cYou want gold, gold we can do it right now, we can make the call right now, and it\u2019s done,\u201d Angel told Al Jazeera\u2019s reporters. \u201cIt will land in Zimbabwe \u2014 Zimbabwe can\u2019t touch it too until I get to my house. So, there can be a diplomatic plan.\u201d",
    "Angel made the offer during an operation that was part of \u2018Gold Mafia\u2019, an investigation into several gold-smuggling gangs in Southern Africa, with Zimbabwe and South Africa as key hubs.",
    "The investigation reveals how these gangs have turned Western sanctions meant to target Zimbabwe\u2019s government into an opportunity to smuggle large quantities of gold and launder hundreds of millions of dollars through a complex web of companies and bribes.",
    "Al Jazeera reporters, posing as Chinese nationals who were looking to launder large sums of money, were offered several ways to remove all stains of corruption from their dirty cash.",
    "Among those mechanisms was the use of Angel\u2019s diplomatic clout. Officially, the pastor-diplomat is tasked with finding investors to come to Zimbabwe. However, Angel made it clear that he was willing to help smuggle gold and launder money.",
    "Zimbabwe needs dollars because the country\u2019s own currency has lost its value in international trade due to hyperinflation. A commodity like gold is a good way to earn dollars, but international sanctions imposed on the country make it difficult for the government to export gold because of the additional scrutiny on officials in power.",
    "\u201cSo you have to figure out other ways to do that,\u201d Karen Greenaway, a former FBI investigator who tracks international money laundering schemes, told Al Jazeera. One way around: individual gold miners, who don\u2019t face those restrictions.",
    "This scenario makes Zimbabwe fertile ground for money launderers who can help the country earn dollars in exchange for gold.",
    "Central to Angel\u2019s gold-for-dirty money operations is Henrietta Rushwaya, president of the Zimbabwe Miners Association. Rushwaya, who is also President Mnangagwa\u2019s niece, told Angel and the reporters on a phone call that smuggling 100kg of gold each week would be no problem.",
    "The scheme would need an initial investment of $10mn of dirty cash into the government\u2019s gold refinery, Fidelity. Of that, $5mn would be held in reserve by Fidelity for the duration of the scam, with the rest being used every week to buy gold.",
    "Once the gold is bought, another $5mn would be brought in to buy more gold until all the money had been laundered into the precious metal \u2014 which would then be sold internationally for legitimate, clean cash.",
    "\u201cThey can buy the gold directly in cash, because we are the only sector in the country that is paying in foreign exchange on a cash basis,\u201d Rushwaya said during the call.",
    "During the meetings, Angel and Doolan, also a British pastor and music artist, said everything they were doing had the blessings of \u2018number one\u2019, referring to Mnangagwa. Doolan even offered to set up a face-to-face meeting with Mnangagwa on the sidelines of the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow in 2021.",
    "The gang also offered to help launder money by building properties near the tourist town of Victoria Falls. This, Angel said, would be appreciated by Mnangagwa because it would allow him \u201cto cut a ribbon\u201d, and build his legacy as a leader who brought visible infrastructure investments into Zimbabwe.",
    "\u201cA politician wants to open something,\u201d Angel told Al Jazeera\u2019s undercover reporters. \u201cGold is easy, but there is nowhere to cut a ribbon.\u201d",
    "Tendai Biti, former Zimbabwe minister of finance, told Al Jazeera that although gold trade by law should be overseen by the central bank, the vast majority of gold is smuggled out of the country.",
    "\u201cWe have got world class deposits of gold, but we have nothing to show for it,\u201d Biti said. \u201cI think we are losing about a billion US dollars in illegal gold exports \u2014 which is a euphemism for gold smuggling.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe biggest challenge Zimbabwe now faces is the existential threat that comes from this mafia, the gold mafia.\u201d",
    "When asked for a response to Al Jazeera\u2019s investigation, Fidelity denied all involvement in money laundering or smuggling. Mnangagwa, Angel, Doolan and Rushwaya did not respond to our inquiries.\u00a0(Al Jazeer)"
