    "Cargills in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture\u2019s \u2018Hela Bojun\u2019 program is empowering women entrepreneurs through the \u2018Cargills Lak Bojun\u2019 initiative. This program aims to create sustainable incomes for women entrepreneurs by providing a marketplace to sell healthy and nutritious food items.",
    "Since its inception in May 2022 with two female SMEs, the program has now expanded to include 8 Lak Bojun carts, supporting a total of 15 SMEs. Through the Lak Bojun program, SMEs are provided carts, aprons, hats, and access to Cargills FoodCity premises to set up their carts, free of charge. The project focuses on locally sourced, authentic food items with high nutritional value, including \u2018Kola Kanda\u2019 and ready-to-eat foods made from root crops and grains and a variety of healthy choices. Operating on weekdays from 6:30 am to 9:30 am, with some carts expanding to include lunch and dinner options, Lak Bojun provides an affordable way for customers to enjoy these nutritious meals. Sustainable packaging options like paper cups, banana leaves, kanda leaves, and bio-compostable wraps are encouraged.",

Ms. Thanuja Jeewandara, District Agriculture Instructor from the Ministry of Agriculture, covered essential topics such as food quality maintenance, cart cleanliness, hygienic practices, and building strong customer relationships.",
