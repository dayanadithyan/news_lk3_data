  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Japanese government through the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is providing US$ 4.6 million to strengthen the production capacity of smallholder paddy farmers in identified districts of the dry and intermediate zones of Sri Lanka.",
    "Smallholder farmers are amongst the most vulnerable rural communities, predominantly cultivating rice for self-consumption. Lack of fertiliser over two consecutive seasons caused major yield drops forcing some farmers to undertake negative coping strategies such as pawning, buying on credit, dipping into savings, etc. to meet their food security and nutrition requirements.",
    "Through the initiative, approximately 250,000 smallholder paddy farmers cultivating paddy on land holdings up to one hectare in identified districts of the dry and intermediate zones will receive up to 50kgs of urea fertiliser each for the upcoming Maha cropping season.",
    "The fertiliser will be provided free of cost and distribution will be carried out with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agrarian Development.",
    "The project will also provide smallholder paddy farmers with sensitisation material on the efficient use of fertiliser to maximise production.",
    "Mizukoshi Hideaki, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka said, \u201cWe are pleased to announce that the Government of Japan has decided to provide additional humanitarian assistance to procure fertiliser, which is in short supply due to the shortage of foreign exchange. We hope that this support will improve food production capacity in Sri Lanka to pre-crisis levels, ensuring better livelihoods for smallholder farmers and stable access to essential food for all citizens across the country.\u201d"
