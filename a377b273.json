    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka is ready to adopt the IMF program within March 2023, said Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe on Friday (3) during the Monetary Policy Review.",
    "\"When we negotiated the staff level agreement with the IMF and finalized the agreement on the 1st of September, we had inflation projections from both the IMF and the Central Bank,\" he told reporters.",
    "\"At that time we were hoping to get the program unlocked somewhere in December (2022), and the end-year IMF inflation target was 70% and we had a little over that. That is where we raised policy rates and had an understading to raise by another high amount, depending on the inflation outlook and the actual outlook,\" he said.",
    "The Central Bank Governor said the IMF inflation projects and the trajectory are extremely high compared to the CBSL projections.",
    "\"Projections are basically projections. But, we are confident that our projections would be more closer, based on the experience from the last couple of months.,\" he added.",
    "\"We are close to implementing the IMF program, and for us to move forward we basically had to reach a consensus on the policy rates,\" said Dr. Weerasinghe.",
    "Given the necessity of fulfilling all the \u2018prior actions\u2019 in order to move forward with the finalisation of the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement, the Monetary Board and the IMF staff reached consensus to raise the policy interest rates, in a smaller magnitude, compared to the adjustment, which was envisaged during the initial stage of negotiations, said a statement from the Central Bank.",
    "The Central Bank Governor also said the $ 200 Mn obtained from Bangladesh will be settled in September 2023.",
    "\"All other repayment plans will come into play after the IMF program is in effect,\" he added.",
    "He said the decisions taken by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank are not popular decision, but policy decisions.",
    "\"These decisions cannot be made by elected people. It should be by unelected independent institutions,\" he added.",
    "Dr. Nandala Weerasinghe said the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is accountable to the people of Sri Lanka and the Parliament, while adding that the Central Bank must remain an independent institution.",
    "\"The Central Bank should be able to make decisions independently from the parliament and elected representatives. Because they basically have an incentive to make popular decisions. Central Bank cannot make popular decisions but the right decisions, be it popular or unpopular,\" said the Governor.",
