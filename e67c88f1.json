    "\u201cSCBSL\u2019s rating is underpinned by Fitch\u2019s expectation of a high probability of support from the head office of Standard Chartered Bank (SCB, A+/Stable/a), if required, subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka,\u201d rating agency said.",
    "\u201cThis expectation is driven by SCBSL\u2019s status as a branch of SCB, and therefore a part of the same legal entity.\u201d",
    "Fitch said, SCBSL\u2019s regulatory liquidity ratios were among the highest in Sri Lanka and it did not have any exposure to local-currency-denominated government securities at end of the third quarter in 2022.",

    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Colombo \u2013 29 Mar 2023: Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Standard Chartered Bank, Sri Lanka\u2019s (SCBSL) National Long-Term Rating at \u2018AAA(lka)\u2019. The Outlook is Stable.",
    "Strong Parental Support: SCBSL\u2019s rating is underpinned by Fitch\u2019s expectation of a high probability of support from the head office of Standard Chartered Bank (SCB, A+/Stable/a), if required, subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka. This expectation is driven by SCBSL\u2019s status as a branch of SCB, and therefore a part of the same legal entity.",
    "SCB\u2019s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is significantly higher than Sri Lanka\u2019s Long-Term Local Currency IDR of \u2018CC\u2019, and its support-driven credit profile is among the strongest of the Fitch-rated domestic entities. This results in SCBSL\u2019s rating being at the highest end of the National Rating scale for Sri Lanka. The high probability of support is underpinned by the alignment of SCBSL\u2019s and the group\u2019s strategic objectives and their strong operational integration.",
    "SCBSL\u2019s small size, at only about 0.1% of SCB\u2019s total assets, implies that support, if needed, would not be a burden to the head office.",

    "The branch\u2019s excess local-currency liquidity is maintained with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, while its excess foreign-currency liquidity is mostly maintained at SCB\u2019s foreign branches.",
    "These balances accounted for 71% of its total assets at end-3Q22, covering nearly all of its deposit",
    "Capital Ratios to Recover: The branch\u2019s core capitalisation metric \u2013 the regulatory common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio \u2013 deteriorated to 14.8% at end-3Q22 (end-2021: 18%) on account of the",
    "That said, we expect the ratio to recover to around 20% in the rating horizon as the branch unwinds of some of its excess provisions.",
    "Rising Risks to Asset Quality: SCBSL\u2019s Stage 3 loans ratio rose to 11.1% at end-3Q22, from 6.3% at end-2021. We expect this trend to continue in the near to medium term on the back of a weak and deteriorating economic environment. Prudential provisioning in light of the adverse macroeconomic developments resulted in loan loss allowances/gross loans spiking to 22.9%, from 6.0% at end-2021.",
    "Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:",
    "SCBSL\u2019s National Rating is most likely to be downgraded on material changes to Fitch\u2019s expectation of support from SCB, such as a change in the branch\u2019s legal status or the branch being divested. A further downgrade of the sovereign\u2019s Long-Term Local-Currency IDR or other developments that affect the branch\u2019s ability to service its obligations could also lead to a multiple notch downgrade of SCBSL\u2019s National Rating.",
    "Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:",
    "There is no rating upside for the National Long-Term Rating, as it is already at the highest point on the scale."
