    "A Consortium led by GE T&D India Limited (GE) and GE Digital Services Europe recently signed a contract with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to embark on a project for the establishment of SCADA supported Distribution Control Centre for the Western Province South 1 (WPS1).",
    "Richardson Projects Ltd., as the local partner of GE, is pleased to be part of this transformative digital initiative.",
    "A SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) System is the heart of an ADMS (Advanced Distribution Management System). A distribution SCADA system\u2019s primary function is to support distribution operations through telemetry, alarming, event recording, and remote control of field equipment. SCADA performs automatic monitoring, protection, and control of various equipment in distribution systems with the use of Intelligent Electronic Devices (or RTUs). It improves the reliability of supply by reducing the duration of outages and also ensures the cost-effective operation of the distribution system.",
    "The project is funded under the Green Power Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement Program, Tranche 1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The benefits of the project focus on improving the reliability and availability of the distribution network by controlling and monitoring the distribution assets in the Dehiwala, Ratmalana, Kalutara, and Mathugama administrative areas of CEB WPS1.",
    "WPS-1 has nearly 295,000 retail consumers and 626 bulk consumers. Electricity sales in the province in 2020 were about 735 GWh. The province handles seventeen (19 in the near future) primary substations (33/11 kV), 1750 Nos. of distribution substations, 250 Nos. of load break switches, 20 Nos of auto reclosers, 1071 km of 33kV electricity overhead lines, 92 km of 11kV electricity overhead lines, and 4,485 km of low voltage electricity lines. This project scope involves the digitalisation of key assets of the above network across four (4) CEB administrative areas of WPS1.",
