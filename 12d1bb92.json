  "original_title": "Suspension of Govt-TNA Talks and the  Power Sharing Quest of Sri Lankan Tamils.",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "Talks are currently on  between the Government of President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Tamil National Alliance(TNA)led by veteran Trincomalee district MP Rajavarothayam Sampanthan. This round of  Govt-TNA talks commenced   on  9 Jan.Earlier  talks between the Govt and TNA delegations  were scheduled  for days four days at a stretch from Jan 10 to 13.  However the envisaged 4 day marathon talks  were suspended after the first day on Jan 10.",
    "It is leant that the proposed 4 day talks were called off after just one day due to the TNA\u2019s lack of faith in the Govt. Prior to the talks on Jan 10, the constituents of the TNA as well as some other Tamil nationalist parties  met in Colombo on Jan 9.l Representatives of Tamil political parties such as the ITAK, PLOTE,TELO,EPRLF and TNP who participated in the conclave  were rather doubtful about the Wickremesinghe Govt being genuine in its declared intention of seeking a political settlement. It appears that the meeting decided  that the TNA should  participate on Jan 10 and request President Wickremesinghe to guarantee that all outstanding issues would be resolved by Jan 31. If President  Ranil Wickremesinghe does not display any positive signs of his bona fides on the matter, the TNA should walk out of talks it was decided.",
    "Former President Mahinada Rajapaksa meeting T.N.A leader R.Sambandan, Jan 4, 2023.",
    "What happened on Jan 10 was that the TNA was dissatisfied with the Govt response to decisions taken earlier. Therefore the TNA stated that there was no point in continuing talks without seeing any concrete progress on ground regarding  the implementation of decisions arrived at. So the TNA  pinpointed three decisions reached at earlier meetings and asked the Govt to demonstrate its good faith by implementing these or at least show substantial progress in implementing these within a week.",
    "The  TNA  wants the full implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, the release of all lands belonging to Tamils in the North and East occupied by the military or other Government agencies and the release of all Tamil political prisoners.  TNA spokesperson MA Sumanthiran and Justice minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe will meet after one week on Jan 17 and review progress. If the TNA is satisfied the TNA will continue to engage in talks.Otherwise the TNA will walk out of the talks permanently. If the TNA is satisfied then President Wickremesinghe will  have a further round of discussions with the TNA. Wickremesinghe  is  also  likely to convene another All Party conference on Jan 26",
    "As is well known the current  Govt-TNAdialogue is due to a commendable political initiative by President Ranil Wickremesinghe himself.  With Sri Lanka\u2019s 75th anniversary of gaining freedom from British rule drawing near, the President  while addressing Parliament last year, expressed a desire  to seek an end to the protracted ethnic crisis or the Tamil National Question before 4 February 2023.",
    "This elicited a favourable response from most political parties represented in Parliament. Jaffna district MP and  TNA spokesperson MA Sumanthiran stated that they were always ready to negotiate and arrive at a potential political settlement. The premier political configuration representing the Tamils of Sri Lanka in the Northern and Eastern provinces is the TNA which has 10 seats in Parliament.",
    "Thereafter President Wickremesinghe convened an all party conference on 13 December 2022. A broad consensus emerged at the conference that discussions should commence without delay  with the objective of reaching an agreement by the 75th Independence anniversary. A tentative three-point plan  to be discussed and implemented was also devised.",
    "Firstlly  some of the outstanding issues  concerning Tamils such as the release of political prisoners, release of private lands seized by the armed forces in the North and East and concrete answers to the question of enforced disapearances and missing person.",
    "Secondly the full implementation of the 13th Constitutional amendment brought about by the 1987 Indo-Lanka accord.",
    "Thirdly reaching agreement on envisaged Constitutional reform to provide an effective  power  sharing scheme.",
    "While the first point stipulated a need for   immediate results, the second and third points required only a blueprint outlining the contours of agreement at present.Imlementation either in the form of Provincial Council elections or promulgating a new Constitution does not seem possible at the present juncture.",
    "Keeping the Feb 4 deadline in mind,  the three tasks of resolving  outstanding issues, full implementation of 13 A and  constitutional reform  were to  be achieved by having three parallel tracks  instead of a sequential approach.What President Wickremesinghe\u2019s Govt and the TNA  are  aiming for is to resolve as many outstanding issues as possible by 31 Jan 2023 on the one hand and reach an agreement on Constitutional issues and the Provincial councils on the otherIf all goes well, this would enable President Wickremesinghe to announce on the 75th Independence anniversary that a political agreement has been reached on the Tamil National Question.",
    "Two informal meetings of a  preparatory nature were held on 21  December 2022 and 5 January 2023 between the Govt and TNA. The three day talks from Jan 10 to 12  will address the key issue of power sharing. It is likely to be extended to Jan 13 also if necessary.  Thouigh the discussions would  be mainly between the Govt and TNA, it would be part of a general all party conference.",
    "The Govt and TNA hope to reach a broad understanding on a  power sharing political settlement by  \u201cThaippongal\u201d on Jan 15. The \u201cThaippongal\u201d  is the unique harvest festival of Tamils. President Wickremesinghe will be celebrating Thaippongal as a national festival in Nallur on Jan 15. If the contours of a power sharing settlement could be reached by Pongal,  the knitty-gritty details would be worked out by Jan 31.",
    "Even as hopes of a political settlement loomed large on the political horizon there was a strong note of discord too. Rumblings of discontent began emanating from the TNA. A news report filed by \u201cThe Hindu\u201ds Colombo Correspondent  Meera Srinivasan stated as follows \u2013",
    "\u201cCiting the \u201clack of any action\u201d by the government on Tamils\u2019 urgent demands, Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said it would \u201crethink\u201d its decision to engage in talks with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, unless his government reports \u201cactual progress\u201d at the next scheduled discussion on January 10.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe have been highlighting three specific areas for immediate action \u2013 the release of political prisoners, answers to families of [forcibly] disappeared persons, and the persisting land grabs in the north and east. Despite making promises, the government is yet to take any action,\u201d TNA spokesman and Jaffna legislator M.A. Sumanthiran told media on Thursday, following the third meeting between the Alliance and the President.\u201d",
    "Even though the TNA has articulated its disappointment and doubts over the lack of positive progress, the party is not likely to exit from the talks hastily.Earlier on while addressing the Tamil media in Jaffna, Sumanthiran  stated that they were entering the talks without any faith in a positive result. He said we are  engaging in talks to avoid being blamed for missing an opportunity to reach a political settlement by default.",
    "Hence the TNA  is not  likely  break off the dialogue arbitrarily. But it is preparing the Tamil people to not expect too much and be ready to expect the worst. Also the TNA wants to protect itself from criticism from its Tamil extremist rivals if  the talks end in failure. The worst  political nightmare from a TNA perspective is one where the Tamil party continues  to participate patiently in the talks until Jan 31 and realise too late that they have been taken for a ride.So the TNA is cautious and is telling its constituency beforehand that everything is not  hunky-dory. The suspension of the 4 talks after just one day must be viewed against this backdrop. day",
    "A  significant developments within the sphere of Tamil politics also casts doubts about the positive progress of talks. What is worrisome is the sharpening of differences within the TNA. The chief constituent of the TNA,the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi(ITAK) wants to contest the forthcoming local authority polls alone without forming a common list with members of  the other two TNA constituents namely the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) and the Peoples Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam(PLOTE). The ITAK says all three constituents should contest separately but remain together as the TNA.",
    "The TELO and PLOTE reject this and threaten to isolate the ITAK by registering the TNA under a new formulation without the ITAK. The TNA is currently a loose configuration and not a registered political party. The TNA contests polls under the ITAK symbol of house. It is too early to predict whether the current intra-TNA controversy is a serious crisis that would result in a break -up or peter down as a tea cup tempest.",
    "The pessimism in Tamil political circles about the Government being genuine in seeking a power sharing political  settlement is rooted in recent history. Attempts to  reach a political settlement through negotiation  ended in failure. Agreements signed  by the ITAK with Sinhala dominated Governments were honoured  in the breach.. The   intransigient conduct of past governments was a major factor that contributed  to the  separate state demand and consequent armed struggle. It is against this backdrop therefore that this column  briefly outlines the  Power sharing quest of Sri Lankan Tamils from independence  to  the watershed year of 1977 where the North -Eastern Tamils voted overwhelmingly for a separate state called Tamil Eelam.",
    "The acknowledged leader of the Tamils at the time of Independence was  well known lawyer G.G.Ponnambalam called \u201cGG\u201d.",
    "The All Ceylon Tamil Congress(ACTC) led by him advocated \u201cbalanced representation\u201d as its policy before Independence from the British. After independence Ponnambalam adopted \u201cresponsive cooperation\u201d as his policy and joined the D.S. Senanayake Govt as a cabinet minister. This caused a split in the ACTC.",
    "The breakaway group led by S.J.V. Chelvanayagam formed the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi(ITAK) called the Federal Party in English. It was the ITAK led by Chelvanayagam which introduced  the demand for federalism into post-independence political discourse . Within a decade Chelvanayagam  of the ITAK displaced Ponnambalam of the  ACTC  as the accredited leader of the Tamils.",
    "The ITAK under SJV Chelvanayagam adopted the strategy of non-violent agitation cum  negotiation. This was the method of Mahatma Gandhi during India\u2019s struggle for Independence. The Tamil leaders of that era were greatly influenced by the \u201cahimsa\u201d concept of non-violence  and Chelva himself was referred to as \u201cEezhathu Gandhi\u201d (Gandhi of Eelam)by his followers. Eelam was the ancient Tamil name of the  entire Island and did not carry any \u201cseparatist\u201d connotations in those days.",
    "was for federalism in principle. The party clamoured for a \u201cThamil Arasu\u201d or Tamil State comprising the Northern and Eastern provinces. The demand however was for a federal state within a united country. In practice Chelvanayakam was prepared to compromise for political arrangements falling far short of the federal ideal.",
    "A  tactic on which the ITAK relied on was power brokering and political bargaining.The expectation was that Sinhala dominated political parties would not be able to command clear majorities in Parliament and would require assistance from a third party to form governments. The ITAK was to be the \u201cking- maker\u201d third force capable of making and unmaking Colombo governments. Therefore the ITAK appealed to the Tamil voters that they elect party candidates as a \u201cbloc\u201d to broker and bargain.",
    "1956 was a watershed year  with SWRD Bandaranaike riding to power on the crest of a \u201cSinhala only\u201dwave. The ITAK led by SJV Chelvanayagam won most  of the Tamil and Muslim  majority seats in the Northern and Eastern provinces. Despite the  clear political divide and  the prevailing volatile  situation both leaders attempted to arrive at  some form of settlement by signing a political pact.",
    "The  Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam  pact of 1957(known as B-C pact) was the first instance of Sinhala and Tamil leaders in post-independence Sri Lanka (or Ceylon as it was then) attempting to resolve the Tamil national question through appropriate political arrangements.",
    "In 1957 the B-C pact was for setting up regional councils. The North was to be one region while  the East  was to be two regions to accommodate Muslim interests.Three major grievances affecting Tamils in the spheres of language, land settlement and regional autonomy could have been addressed and redressed through the B-C  pact had it ever been allowed to work.",
    "PRIME MINISTER S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike (left) and S.J.V. Chelvanayagam, leader of the Thamil Arasu Katchi, shake hands after signing what came to be known as the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam Pact on July 26, 1957-Pic via: The Hindu",
    "The chief opposition United National Party(UNP) led by JR Jayewardene and Dudley Senanayake opposed it strongly.JR led a protest march against the pact  from Colombo to Kandy.It was however aborted at Umbulgoda by SD Bandaranayake who was thereafter dubbed as the \u201cImbulgoda Verraya\u201d. Several ministers and MPs  within the SWRD Bandaranaike Govt exerted pressure on the PM to dishonour the agreement. Members of the Buddhist clergy were mobilised by Eksath Bhikku Peramuna leader  Mapitigama Buddharakitha Thero  against the BC pact. Members of the Buddhist clergy and laity mobbed Bandaranaike\u2019s residence. Faced with this three-pronged opposition, Bandaranaike capitulated and  in a symbolic act  tore up the pact in public.",
    "The  jettisoning  of the Banda-Chelva pact by  SWRD Bandaranaike led to further deterioration of ethnic relations resulting in massive communal violence in 1958.",
    "1960 saw two elections to Parliament being held in March and July. A significant outcome of both polls was the re-iteration by Tamil voters in North-East that the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Kastchi (ITAK) or the Federal Party was their chief political party. The ITAK won 15 comprising 10 seats in the North and 5 in the East in March. In July it won 16 including 10 in the North and 6 in the East.",
    "If the proportionate representation system was prevalent in those days, the ITAK could not have won so well. But the first- past- the -post- winner system enabled it to reduce  its chief rival the Tamil Congress to one in both polls. The left parties too could not make much headway.",
    "In March 1960 the UNP under Dudley Senanayake had 50  seats and the SLFP under C.P. de Silva had 46. Both sides wooed the ITAK but Chelvanayagam opted not to support the UNP and arrived at an understanding with the SLFP. The Senanayake Govt could not command  a majority  in Parliament and elections were held again in July.  The SLFP and ITAK/FP arrived at an understanding.The Federal Party called upon Tamils in the south to support the SLFP. The SLFP got 75 seats and with the six appointed members had a razor thin majority. It had no need for Tamil support and the understanding with the ITAK was not honoured.",
    "This resulted in the ITAK conducting a satyagraha campaign which virtually paralysed civil administration in the North and East.The ITAK even printed stamps, postcards and envelopes and ran its own postal service. The Govt clamped down by deploying the Army. The unarmed Satyagrahis were bodily assaulted and key leaders arrested. A curfew was imposed. The Tamil leaders were detained without trial at the Panagoda army camp for many months.",
    "The ITAK had its revenge when it voted with the opposition over the Press Takeover Bill in 1964 and helped bring the  Mrs.Bandaranaike led Govt down.",
    "1965 March saw the UNP coming to power with 66 seats. The SLFP (42) LSSP (10) and CP (4) had 56 seats. If the ITAK which won 14 seats supported the SLFP coalition then Mrs. Bandaranaike could have formed a Govt with the help of some independents and the six appointed MP\u2019s.",
    "There was frantic lobbying by both parties for Tamil support. The ITAK smarting from SLFP betrayal in 1960 opted for Dudley this time. The Tamil Congress with three seats also supported the UNP. Dudley Senanayake formed what was called the \u201cNational Government\u201d then. Eminent queen\u2019s counsel and Chelvanayakam\u2019s confidante Murugeysen Tiruchelvam became the local government minister.",
    "The ITAK extended support to the UNP after protracted negotiations. Just as Chelvanayakam signed a pact with Bandaranaike in 1957, he signed one with Senanayake too in 1965. This was called popularly as the Dudley-Chelva (D-C) pact. A key element of the D-C pact was the setting up of district councils. Tiruchelvam was made local govt minister to steer the district councils  scheme  through. Interestingly all  four persons, Bandaranaike, Senanayake ,Chelvanayakam and  Tiruchelvam were old Thomians.",
    "Unfortunately the district councils scheme became a non-starter. In a nutshell the situation was something like what happened in 1957. Then in the late fifties the UNP under JR Jayewardene and the Sinhala-Buddhist extremist forces found common ground in opposing the regional councils. Now in the late sixties  the UNP was opposed by the SLFP and Sinhala Buddhist elements. \u201cDudleyge Bade Masala Vade\u201d (The Tamil delicacy masala vadai was in Dudley\u2019s stomach)was the slogan.To their eternal shame the Trotskyites and Communists went along with this chauvinist line.",
    "A white paper on the district councils was presented in Parliament. The floodgates were opened for torrential waters of opposition . Within the UNP a \u201cginger group\u201d of 16 MP\u2019s under Festus Perera opposed it. People like Cyril Mathew resigned from the party in opposition. Dudley even suspected JR of instigating protests from within the party. Senanayake lost his  nerve..He did not want to go through with the district councils.",
    "Unable to honour his pledge Dudley offered to resign but Chelvanayakam did not agree. The ITAK pulled out of the Govt some months later when Tiruchelvam resigned over the  Trincomalee Koneshwaram Temple sacred zone issue.",
    "Interestingly the sixties of the 20th century had seen the ITAK reaching the high watermarks of its agitation cum negotiation strategy. The 1961 satyagraha was the zenith of its non-violent agitation; the 1965-69 period where it formed part of the Govt was its peak in terms of the negotiation strategy. Both had  now  been tried  and exhausted.",
    "The 1970 electoral verdict delivered a shattering blow to Tamil ambitions of making and unmaking Governments.",
    "The United Front of SLFP (91) LSSP (19) and CP (6) had 116 seats in Parliament. The ITAK had 13 and Congress 3 but they were of no use as this steam-roller majority needed no props. SJV voiced Tamil frustration at this turn of affairs by proclaiming  that \u201cOnly God can save the Tamil people now\u201d.",
    "One of the new regime\u2019s first tasks was converting Parliament into a constituent assembly to formulate  a new republican constitution.The LSSP veteran Dr. Colvin R de Silva was constitutional affairs minister.Initially the ITAK or FP participated in the constituent assembly and tabled a proposal seeking to set up five autonomous units in the country. This was summarily rejected and the Federal MP\u2019s walked out. This constitutional exercise provided an opportunity to make a fresh start in forging justice and equality through power sharing.  But it was lost. Furthermore the situation worsened.",
    "Though the Soulbury Constitution was unitary in nature it had not been explicitly stated so. But the new constitution proclaimed itself  as \u201cUnitary\u201d. It was an entrenched clause. The Country became a repu The Island\u2019s name \u2018Ceylon\u2019 was changed to Sri Lanka. Buddhism was given foremost place.",
    "Section 29 of the earlier constitution that  had provided limited protection to minorities was no more. It was Colvin who pithily summed up the future in 1956 during the Sinhala Only Bill debate  by saying \u201cOne language two nations;two languages one nation\u201d. Ironically the same Colvin\u2019s constitution by ignoring  Tamil aspirations was now making the ground fertile for seeds of secession to grow.",
    "There was however a silver lining. The need to de-dentralise administration for greater equity, productivity and efficiency was beginning to be felt. The district was becoming the unit of de-centralisation.The Dudley Senanayake Govt  had started this process by setting up co-ordination committees at district level to boost agriculture and food production.Mrs. Bandaranaike\u2019s UF govt introduced a special de-centralised budget for districts. Divisional development councils were set up. A district political authority for each district was also appointed. Thus de-centralised activity at district and grassroots level became official.",
    "The overall situation  however was gloomy with the threatening spectre of separatism dominating Tamil politics. Any visionary Govt would have adopted political means to contain this trend and through political concessions  tried to pull back the Tamils from a secessionist precipice. No such attempt was made though at the tail end of her rule Mrs. B held informal talks with the ITAK about getting support in a situation where further extension of Parliament was being explored. This came to naught.",
    "The political course of events  took a new turn. The Tamils became disillusioned with the quest for federalism. It was seen as futile. On the ground there was broader Tamil unity with the Federalists and Congressmen coming together as the Tamil United Front (TUF). Youth power too came to the fore. The cry for a separate state called Tamil Eelam gathered momentum. Some youths became enamoured of an armed struggle to achieve this.",
    "The TUF re- named itself as the Tamil United Liberation Front in May 1976. A formal demand for Tamil Eelam was adopted. The TULF contested the 1977 elections on a separatist platform seeking a mandate for Tamil Eelam and swept  the  polls winning 18 of 19 Tamil  majority seats in the North-East.",
    "The UNP under Junius Richard Jayewardene won 141 seats out of 168 in 1977. The SLFP was reduced to 8 and the TULF with 18 sears became the  chief opposition party . Appapillai Amirthalingam became the leader of opposition.",
    "The TULF had contested seats in the North and East in the 1977 July elections  on a separatist  platform. It sought a mandate from the Tamil people to establish a secular, socialist Tamil Eelam comprising the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. Earlier the Tamil political quest had been for a power sharing arrangement based on federal lines within a united but not necessarily a unitary Sri Lanka. The 1977 Elections and TULF Victory was a significant departure from the past.It was a historic turning point!",
