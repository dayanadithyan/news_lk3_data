    "Claiming that Sri Lanka has come to a decisive juncture and a power struggle in its history, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today that they would definitely win that struggle.",
    "Speaking at the JVP May Day Rally in Colombo, he said the present crisis situation in the country cannot be resolved through mere reforms or laws and that it could only be done by passing power to the people from the corrupt rulers.",
    "He said the JVP had been able to bring together people across the country from north to south and east to west, whereas other parties have been restricted either to the north or the south.",
    "\"Wherever we go, people talk about us. They trust us. Sri Lankans living overseas also support us as never before,\" he said.",
    "Dissanayke said people do not believe that these rulers would take this country even an inch forward from this crisis and added that the most important aspect of taking the country forward is the trust and the bond between the people and the government.",
    "\"People of all sectors have lost faith in this government today. Farmers, fishing community, professionals and the public reject this government. They trust us the most. We can take this country forward with the strength and blessings of the people,\" he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
