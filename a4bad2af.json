    "Al Jazeera: Hundreds of thousands of people have rallied in cities across Israel for a 10th consecutive week, protesting against plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right government to curb the Supreme Court\u2019s powers.",
    "Organisers said a record 500,000 people attended Saturday\u2019s rallies, making them some of the \u201cbiggest in Israeli history\u201d.",
    "Media in Israel put the turnout at 250,000 to 300,000 people.",
    "The demonstrations come as Netanyahu\u2019s government prepares to press on with its legislative agenda next week, shunning calls for a pause to allow for negotiations on the divisive judicial reforms.",
    "Some 200,000 Israelis rallied in Tel Aviv, while 50,000 people protested in the northern city of Haifa and 10,000 in Beersheba \u2014 the biggest yet in both \u2014 according to Israeli media.",
    "The rallies broke up without major incident, although police arrested three protesters who were blocking traffic on Tel Aviv\u2019s ring road.",
    "The uproar over the legal changes has plunged Israel into one of its worst domestic crises. Beyond the protests, which have drawn tens of thousands of Israelis to the streets and have recently become violent, opposition has surged from across society, with business leaders and legal officials speaking out against what they say will be the ruinous effects of the plan.",
    "The legislation would give more weight to the government in the committee that selects judges and would deny the Supreme Court the right to strike down any amendments to so-called Basic Laws, Israel\u2019s quasi-constitution.",
    "These provisions have already been endorsed by legislators at first reading.",
    "Another element of the reforms would give the 120-member parliament power to overrule Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority of 61 votes.",
    "Critics say the changes will destroy the country\u2019s system of checks and balances and concentrate power in the hands of the prime minister and his allies.",
