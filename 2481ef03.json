    "Public Security Minister Tiran Alles has been summoned by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) over the violent crackdown by the Police on protests conducted by university students led by the Inter-University Students Federation (IUSF) recently.",
    "Alles has been asked to appear before the HRCSL on 13 March to answer questions about the Police conduct on 7 and 8 March when dispersing protests held near the University of Colombo and the University of Kelaniya as part of an inquiry launched by the Commission on the day's events.",
    "In a statement, the HRCSL said the subject Minister was summoned to explain the procedures followed by the Sri Lanka Police on the said days. The actions of the Police on both days have been widely criticised after the tear gas attacks also affected school students, teachers, residents and pedestrians in the areas. Video footage showed the Police firing tear gas into the University premises during the protests even as students retreated.",
    "The IUSF held a protest on 7 March based on seven demands while it held another protest the next day against the violent crackdown on the protest held the day before. A protest was also held at the University of Kelaniya on the night of 8 March against the arrest of two student activists who are currently in detention.",
    "The Police dispersed the protestors with tear gas and water cannons after claiming the demonstrators were blocking the Kandy road. They also proceeded to arrest six students who took part in the protests.",
    "However, Government ministers and MPs are encouraging acts of violence against protestors. Speaking in Parliament yesterday, State Minister of Tourism Diana Gamage said protests around the city of Colombo must be stopped.",
    "She claimed the people are tired of protests and tourists are afraid to step out of their hotels as a result of the demonstrations. \u201cThese people must be beaten. The country\u2019s people must beat them. It is your money that is being spent on water cannons and tear gas to disperse these groups. Stop these protests immediately. Let us rebuild this country,\u201d she said.",
    "Government MP Nimal Lansa also lambasted the protests in Parliament yesterday. Calling the protesting students \u2018good for nothing\u2019, he said they are acting as terrorists and attempting to destroy the country. He called on the President to not allow for such actions.",
