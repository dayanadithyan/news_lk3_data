    "MP Ali Sabry Raheem has engaged in a political game by voting against the resolution to remove the chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, SJB MP Field Marshal Sarath Fokseka charged today.",
    "\u201cAli Sabry Raheem who was charged with smuggling gold was made to vote against the government to show that he was not being safeguarded by the government. The MP was made to vote against the resolution as a political game. We vehemently oppose the presence of MP Ali Sabry Raheem in this House after smuggling gold,\u201d Field Marshal Fonseka said.",
    "He said the incident of Pastor Jerome who made provocative statements is also being used to gain political mileage.",
    "\u201cWe would like to tell the people not to be misled by these kinds of episodes,\u201d MP Fonseka said.",
    "Also the MP defended the Aragalaya and said a peaceful unarmed revolution is needed to put the country on the right track.",
    "\u201cI know some MPs are scared of the aragalaya. This is why they blame the Aragalaya members for rape of minors and running brothels,\u201d\u00a0 he alleged. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
