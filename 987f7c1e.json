    "Says her parliamentary privileges breached by leader of the house who used an obscene word against her",
    "Claims it has been shared widely and has affected her public image as a mother and female",
    "Requests Speaker to submit issue to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges and to take appropriate action against Premajayantha",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Rohini Kumari Wijerathna in a letter to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena has requested him to take disciplinary action against Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha who is also the current leader of the house for allegedly using obscene language against her during a parliamentary debate.",
    "Claiming her parliamentary privileges have been breached by the Minister, Wijerathna said his comments have been shared on various platforms and has now affected her public image as a mother and a female.",
    "She questioned if it was morally right for the Minister of Education to address her in such a manner when she was raising a matter of concern in parliament as a woman and a teacher.",
    "The incident occurred on 24 February when the SJB MP raised the assault and arrest of two teachers attending a meeting on teacher transfers at the Education Ministry on Thursday by policemen suspected to have been in an inebriated state.",
    "While Premajayantha volunteered to answer the question, he appeared to be irked when Wijerathna did not find his answer satisfactory and instead persisted with the matter. A visibly angered Premajayantha was then heard using a Sinhalese obscenity referring to the female MP which was also caught in the live stream of the proceedings. Schoolchildren were also seen in the public gallery when the incident took place.",
    "In her letter, the SJB MP asked the Speaker to decide what the reaction of the public would be towards the parliament and its MPs if such incidents take place within the house. Wijerathna has further requested that the Speaker submit this issue to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges to take appropriate action against the senior Minister."
