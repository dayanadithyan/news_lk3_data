  "original_body_lines": [
    "Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar questioned the Gujarat Titan's decision to select Dasun Shanaka over Matthew Wade for Qualifier 1 against the Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday, which the Titans lost by 15 runs.",
    "The Super Kings sealed their 10th final appearance in 16 tournaments -- the most for any IPL franchise.",
    "\"Dasun Shanaka's inclusion has been a strange one if he wasn't ever going to bowl. Today was an excellent opportunity to use him as a bowler if they had that in mind,\" Manjrekar told ESPNCricinfo.",
    "\"So, if that was the case, you would think Matthew Wade would have been a better choice, a left-hand batter at the top. Then what would have happened is that Ravindra Jadeja would have bowled his three overs with such ease.\"",
    "Shanaka scored 17 off 16 balls in the defeat to the Super Kings.",
    "Shanaka was brought in as a replacement for New Zealander Kane Williamson, after he was injured in the opening game of the tournament.",
    "Shanaka was unselected for much of the group stage, and has managed just 26 runs in three innings."
