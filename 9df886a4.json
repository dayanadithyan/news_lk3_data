    "Maybe it has always been like that. But these few years spent away from Sri Lanka, the longest stretch I have been away, makes you look at your own country differently. The loss of opportunities is just mindboggling.",
    "Several friends have returned after spending time in Sri Lanka and their recent memories are laced with despondency. Being let down by those that we elect is a universal feeling, but Sri Lankan politicians have made an art of fattening their own lot at the expense of millions of fellow country men, women and children.",
