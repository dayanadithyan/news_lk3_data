    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank is seen keeping its key monetary policy rates steady and maintaining a tight stance at the second policy rate review for this year, analysts said, amid mounting public pressure to reduce the rates.",
    "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka will announce the key monetary policy rates at 1630 hours on Friday (3). The apex bank last raised the policy rates in July, 2022 by 100 basis points.",
    "The Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) is at 14.50 percent since then while the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) stands at 15.50 percent. However, the market interest rates have touched above 30 percent in the last seven months, resulting in expensive borrowing.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s government is under pressure to reduce monetary policy rates, but the central bank has not agreed to cut the rates so far due to higher inflation.",
    "\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything the Cabinet can do regarding the bank Interest rate,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardena told a weekly cabinet briefing on Tuesday.",
    "\u201cMost of the time I have seen various political party leaders and politicians promising in front of the public on reducing interest rates. It is a statement made without proper knowledge.\u201d",
    "The cabinet spokesman\u2019s comments came in response to a demand by some protesters to reduce the interest rates among many others including slashing higher taxes and electricity tariff.",
    "The government is struggling to manage finances due to its inability to borrow from the foreign sources after it declared sovereign debt default in April last year.",
    "\u201cIf the protestors can protest in front of the central bank, it will be more fruitful,\u201d he said.",
    "The central bank changed its stance to hawkish after reducing the interest rates to record low in mid 2021 to boost the COVID-19 hit economy while printing billions of rupees, which later resulted in high inflation and also contributed to an unprecedented economic crisis.",
    "The inflation has started to ease after the central bank raised monetary policy rates while the rupee has stabilized against the US dollar after depreciating more than 60 percent last month.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t see a reason for the central bank to reduce the policy rates,\u201d Danushka Samarasinghe, Chief Executive Officer/Director at Nation Lanka Equities (Pvt) Ltd told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cThe rupee is yet to stabilize against all other currencies. Also it would be prudent for the central bank to reduce policy rates with some foreign inflows. It could consider reducing the policy rates when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) executive board approves the $2.9 billion loan.\u201d (Colombo/March01/2023)"
