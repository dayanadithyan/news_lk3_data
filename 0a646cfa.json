  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Supreme Court today (09) gave the Attorney General a period of four weeks to file objections pertaining to the Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed by two persons involved in the protests near former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s residence in Mirihana last year.",
    "The petition was filed by the protesters seeking a court order affirming that their fundamental rights had been violated when they were arrested by the Police during the protests near the former President\u2019s residence in March 2022.",
    "Appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, senior State Counsel\u00a0 Shaminda Wickrema informed the court that they intend on filing initial objections stating that the relevant petitions cannot be maintained.",
    "Thus, the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising of Justices Vijith Malalgoda, A. H. M. D Nawaz and Janak de Silva ordered that the petition be reconsidered on 17 July, while the Attorney General was given four weeks to submit his objections."
