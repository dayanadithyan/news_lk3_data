    "Police from Pakistan\u2019s capital of Islamabad attempted to arrest former Prime Minister Imran Khan in the city of Lahore after a court order, but said he evaded their efforts.",
    "The team arrived at Khan\u2019s residence to arrest him but he wasn\u2019t in his room, according to a post on Twitter by the Islamabad police.",
    "\u201cAll operations are being completed with the cooperation of Lahore Police,\u201d the Islamabad police said on Twitter. \u201cLegal action will be taken against those obstructing the execution of court orders.\u201d",
    "A Pakistani court issued an arrest warrant against Khan last month after he did not appear in a hearing for a complaint filed by the Election Commission.",
    "Khan has been mostly confined to his home in Lahore since being shot and wounded in the leg during a street protest in November. He has blamed Premier Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, and a general in the country\u2019s powerful spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, for the attack.",
    "The Islamabad police\u2019s insistence for arrest is illegal since the court order is only to appear before it, Khan\u2019s party spokesman Fawad Chaudhry said on Twitter."
