    "The Government of Sri Lanka has assured that the policy decision taken pertaining to the privatisation of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) will not compromise national security.",
    "Responding to the report compiled and presented before the Parliament today (09 June) by the Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on National Security, it was noted that the report \u2018lacked a logical or scientific data analysis pertaining to the subject matter\u2019.",
    "While the Government has focused its attention to the report which highlighted the concerns surrounding the potential risk to national security resulting from the privatisation of SLT, despite its factual content, the Government believes that it lacks a logical or scientific data analysis pertaining to the subject matter, the President\u2019s Media Division (PMD) said in a press release issued in this regard.",
    "The SOC on National Security issued recommendations against the privatisation of SLT today (09 June), in a report titled \u201cThe Effects of Privatization of Sri Lanka Telecom on National Security\u201d. citing the possible leakage of matters sensitive to national security.",
    "The Government has focussed its attention to the Sectoral Oversight Committee report, which was presented to Parliament today (09), emphasizing the concerns surrounding the potential risk to national security resulting from the privatization of Sri Lanka Telecom.",
    "While acknowledging the factual content of the report, the Government believes that it lacks a logical or scientific data analysis pertaining to the subject matter. To address this deficiency, it is necessary to examine the operation and regulation of information and communication technology service providers in Sri Lanka, analyse financial data related to the sector, understand Sri Lanka\u2019s national ambitions in this field, assess the available capital capacity, and conduct a comprehensive study of global trends.",
    "Furthermore, the Government has reassured that the policy decision taken will not compromise national security, contrary to what is indicated in the report.",
    "Hence, the Government will take a final decision during an upcoming cabinet meeting, considering this report along with recommendations from the information and communication sector.",
    "Additionally, the President emphasizes that the current government\u2019s policy is focused on providing opportunities to the private sector, distancing it from direct government involvement."
