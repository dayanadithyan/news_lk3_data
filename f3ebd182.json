    "I had an interesting conversation with one of Melbourne\u2019s senior musicians \u2013 Esric Jackson.We touched on his early days in the Sri Lankan scene, with the group Pioneers, etc., and his rise to stardom, in Melbourne, Australia, with his late wife, Sandra, and hissolo projects.I know for sure readers would love to know more about Esric and, with that in mind, I got the man-about-town, in Melbourne, Trevine Rodrigo, to do the needful.",
    "Strength, resilience and a God given talent is what personifies Esric Jackson, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s outstanding vocal talent. And there\u2019s no sign of his love for entertainment waning \u2013 not in the near future, anyway.His sojourn into music began at a tender age in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka.Trying to help a stranded Colombo band to raise enough money to buy them return transport home, he related, in a television interview with Noeline Honter, in Melbourne, what eventually happened\u2026",
    "\u201cI felt sorry for the guys when I found out their plight. They had come to perform at a gig that was disastrous, hence no payment\u201d, he recalled.",
    "Esric spoke to some locals who said if he would sing at a political rally he could make enough to help his fellow musicians.Reinventing himself has been the history of his musical journey.He established himself as a musician, in Sri Lanka, the with famous dance band, the Pioneers, where he met his late wife, Sandra, in 1971, when she was accepted as the band\u2019s female vocalist.",
    "Esric was then a rhythm guitarist, and lead vocal singer, in a band that gained fame when they competed and won the famous Jaycee Show, which was a big draw at the time.They wed, in 1974, in Sri Lanka, and, a year later, migrated to Melbourne, in Australia.After finding their feet, in a new country, together they launched back into their passion for music. And with it was born the now famous Replay 6.",
    "Blessed with five grandchildren, from daughters Candice and Tatum, he now has the added role of being a doting grand dad, apart from overseeing his business of supplying and installing bathroom necessities, including superior quality wardrobes and shower screens, in, Melbourne.It\u2019s been over five years since Sandra Jackson departed, from the land of the living.",
    "Sandra was instrumental in promoting and mentoring many budding musicians here in Australia and from overseas. And her own contribution, which was indelible, left many in awe at her power packed performances. She was renowned for her incredible version of Tina Turner\u2019s hit \u2018Simply the Best,\u2019 which she was tagged to for most of her wonderful and unforgettable musical career.Esric is back with renewed enthusiasm, a second wind, and a determination to continue his journey which he and Sandra began over 50 years ago,",
    "His interaction and livewire contribution to music and musicians here in Australia, and around the globe, is no secret, as many, particularly in Sri Lanka, will readily testify to. He is widely known for his charitable contributions to many in Australia and Sri Lanka and is always on hand to help out when needed.Esric has earmarked several projects in the near future which will see his bands, Replay 6 and Ebony, led by Cameron Colombege, produce dances that will be much-sought-after for quality and musical class.",
    "A tireless contributor in his pursuit of perfection and blessed with a clever marketing brain, there is no doubt the music industry will benefit from his injection and creative mindset which has been instrumental in the success of his musical journey.Esric and Sandra\u2019s love for music has seen interaction with some of the best musicians in the world since their involvement in the Australian scene, in the early 1970s.",
    "Rubbing shoulders with the likes of The Village people, Dr. Hook, Smokey, Gloria Loring, Marcia Hines, Ricky May, Jade Hurley and Kamahl to name a few, is an incredible musical journey that they experienced with the band Replay 6, at its inception.He continues to work feverishly with an insatiable hunger for fresh avenues to enhance his musical commitments.It\u2019s an outlet that, at this stage, seems to have no bounds.Esric will be featured, as a guest artiste, at an exclusive gala dinner ball, on June 10th, in Melbourne, and with Replay 6, at The Walawwa, on June 20th, with more to follow.",
