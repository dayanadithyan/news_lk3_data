  "original_body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne has submitted a private member\u2019s bill in parliament to amend an asset declaration law so that its provisions become applicable to the president.",
    "Wickramaratne presented the bill in parliament on Thursday May 26 to amend the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No 1 of 1975 to make its provisions applicable to the executive president.",
    "The law, as it exists now, does not require the president to declare his assets and, if the bill is passed and enacted, the president will have to join members of parliament and other high ranking judicial and public sector officials who are required to declare their assets and liabilities annually.",
    "Provisions will also be made under the proposed amendment to establish an electronic automated asset declaration system which will enable electronic submission of declarations of assets and liabilities.",
    "The significant feature of this act shall be that all declarations of assets and liabilities shall have public access subject to redaction of specific information, an official statement said. All such declarations shall be published by the appropriate authority, on their respective official websites. (Colombo/May27/2023)"
