    "The Ministry of Defence says an investigation will be launched by the Sri Lanka Police together with the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRC) to identify the person or group of persons who disseminated false information over social media claiming the Ministry was in the process of recording and monitoring telephone conversations of citizens.",
    "Speaking to the Daily FT, a spokesman for the Ministry said the investigation will seek out who disseminated the posts and with what intention. The posts shared widely on social media platforms and messaging applications claimed that the Ministry was recording phone conversations and is also in possession of technology able to even trace calls made over platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook.",
    "The Ministry of Defence refuted the rumours being circulated accusing them of monitoring and recording all phone conversations between individuals, storing the information and tracing calls made over social media and messaging platforms. The Ministry said this information is entirely false and it does not under any circumstance record, monitor or trace phone conversations of citizens."
