    "The Philippine Coast Guard said search and rescue operations were ongoing and there were no signs of overloading on the ship.",
    "The initial death toll amounted to less than a dozen people - these were thought to have drowned as they jumped into the water without life jackets.",
    "However authorities then discovered another 18 bodies on the vessel that were \u201ctotally burnt\u201d, said Commodore Rejard Marfe of the Coast Guard.",
    "He added that \u201cchaos\u201d resulted when the fire broke out, as most of the passengers were sleeping at the time.",
