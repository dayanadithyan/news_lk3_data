    "Senior DIG Priyantha Weerasooriya, who was transferred from SDIG Central Province as SDIG Crimes & Traffic, also requested the National Police Commission to take appropriate steps to rescind his transfer order given by the Public Security Ministry and IGP without mentioning the reason.",
    "In a letter to NPC Chairman Chandra Fernando, the Senior DIG said that being Officer in Charge of the Province, they are not able to uphold the rule of law situation properly, and they are unable to plan out strategies to maintain Law & Order situation in the respective area of responsibility, as the majority of SDIG's are frustrated and \u201calways on pins.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhilst I was performing duties as SDIG Support Services, I received the same class of posting on April 15, 2022, as Officer in Charge, Central Province, and within 48 hours it had been changed twice as Officer in Charge, North Western Province and subsequently ended up as Officer in -Charge of Northern Province.",
    "\u201cAs a disciplined officer I carried out the orders given by the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Security, and later submit an appeal to the IG Police having shown my graveness and unsatisfactory in which way of transferring me.",
    "On January\u00a0 06, 2023, I was again posted as Officer in Charge of Central Province by the Minister in Charge of Ministry of Public Security, and completing nearly three months to date, and again I was subjected to another transfer order as Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police in-Charge of Crimes and Traffic with short period of time from my previous posting,\" he said.",
    "\u201cRecently, I noticed that Senior Deputy Inspector Generals of Police are being given transfers with immediate effect without showing cause, merely mentioning that the transfer is on \u201cExigencies of Service\u201d and cover approval of NPC.",
    "\u201cThis ad-hock system has created frustration among many officers to perform their duties free and fair to general public.
