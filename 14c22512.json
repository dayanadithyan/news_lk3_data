    "Former Vice President Mike Pence formally announced his presidential campaign in Iowa on Wednesday the 7th of June. When asked of the controversial incidents of the\u00a0January 6, 2021 Capitol Hill riots, Pence portrayed Trump, America's former President as unfit for the presidency by condemning his values and character. Pence added with regard to the Capitol Hill attack that his former boss had asked him to choose between him and the American constitution;\u00a0 \"I chose the Constitution, and I always will\u201d Pence concluded.",
    "\u201cAnyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd anyone who asks someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president again.\u201d",
    "Mike Pence's bid for the 2024 presidential race has been based on distinguishing himself from his Trump whom he previously shared a Presidential ticket with; Pence's campaign honed in on 3 key issues, abortion, foreign policy and fiscal conservatism. In his speech in Iowa,\u00a0Pence clarified that unlike other Republican candidates he wouldn\u2019t be afraid to cut spending on Social Security and Medicare in order to confront the nation\u2019s debt crisis. He also reiterated that America was the leader of the free world and democracy, criticizing Trump for being soft on Russia."
