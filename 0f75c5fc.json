    "\u201cWe are always \u201cproviding free charcoal in the snow\u201d instead of \u201ccollecting rented-umbrellas in the rain\u201d,\u201d China Merchants Group Chairman Miao Jianmin said in a statement released by the Chinese Embassy in Colombo on Sunday.",
    "\u201cWe will further strengthen cooperation with local and foreign companies and make more contributions to\u00a0Sri Lanka\u2019s\u00a0economic recovery.\u201d",
    "During his visit, Jianmin met President Ranil Wickremesinghe and discussed further port-related investments.",
    "President Wickremesinghe on the same day emphasized that the government\u2019s intention to make Sri Lanka an air and sea hub in the region.",

    "Investor sentiment has turned positive since a $3 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan was signed on March 20, but other foreign investors have yet to commit to any substantial projects due to uncertainty over both external and domestic debt restructuring, analysts say.",
    "China\u2019s latest investment comes after it was blamed by the United States and its allies that Beijing had been dragging the IMF deal by not committing itself to bilateral debt restructuring. The IMF approved the loan soon after China agreed to the debt restructuring within IMF parameters.",
    "China Merchants is operating a key terminal which it invested $500 million in Colombo port on build-operate-transfer (BOT basis since 2014. It has also secured the China-financed Hambantota port on a 99-year lease for $1.12 billion in 2017. (Colombo/April24/2023)"
