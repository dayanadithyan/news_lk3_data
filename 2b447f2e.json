    "Wine stores in the country should be open at least from 10 am to 10 pm so as to increase the excise levy, Parliamentarian Diana Gamage said today.",
    "She told Parliament that some billions of rupees of excise levy was lost as the wine stores are closing at 9 pm.",
    "The MP said even though the government impose excise duty, no method was in place to collect this duty.",
    "\u201cWe impose excise duty but no method is in place to collect the duty. We can collect excise duty only if we sell alcoholic products. Wine stores and restaurants should be kept open at least from 10 am to 10 pm. We lose billions of excise tax just because wine stores are closing at 9 pm,\u201d she said.",
    "Gamage said even if wine stores were closed at 9 pm, people who wanted to purchase liquor know how and where they can buy them after 9 pm. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
