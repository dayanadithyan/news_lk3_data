    "The university teachers have decided to take part in the evaluation of answer scripts of 2022 Advanced Level examination with effect from today.",
    "Addressing a press briefing this evening (May 04), Federation of University Teachers\u2019 Association (FUTA) chairman Prof. Shyama Banneheka said its members would not be subdued by the political pressurization.",
    "Prof. Banneheka said the FUTA has called off its trade union action, however, vowed to continue their fight.",
    "The evaluation of answer scripts was delayed by at least two months due to the trade union action launched by the FUTA, in protest of the new tax policy. They urged the government to scrap the recently-imposed excessive taxes.",
    "Last week, FUTA called for an urgent meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe to discuss the issues that prompted them to resort and prolong their trade union action.",
    "Against this backdrop, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) and the parents of the students appealed to university lecturers to put off its trade union action until the answer script evaluation of the 2022 Advanced Level examination is completed."
