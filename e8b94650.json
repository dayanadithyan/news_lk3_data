  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Examinations Department has received adequate applications for evaluating answer scripts of 52 subjects of the 2022 G.C.E. Advanced Level exam.",
    "Meanwhile, the deadline for accepting the applications for 11 other subjects has been extended until midnight tomorrow (May 04), the Commissioner-General of Examinations said.",
    "The evaluation of answer scripts was delayed by at least two months due to the trade union action launched by the Federation of University Teachers\u2019 Association (FUTA) in protest of the new tax policy. They are urging the government to scrap the recently-imposed excessive taxes.",
    "Last week, FUTA called for an urgent meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe to discuss the issues that prompted them to resort and prolong their trade union action.",
    "However, on Tuesday (May 02), the association said it is still awaiting a meeting with the Head of State.",
    "FUTA\u2019s media spokesperson Senior Lecturer Charudatta Illangasinghe said the association intends to participate in the answer script evaluation process following the said discussion.",
    "Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) and the parents of the students too have appealed to university lecturers to postpone their trade union action until the answer script evaluation of the 2022 Advanced Level examination is completed."
