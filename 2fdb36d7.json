    "CNN: Twitter\u2019s free blue \u201cverified\u201d checkmarks for notable users may finally be coming to an end.",
    "Ever since Elon Musk took control of the company in October, he\u2019s been threatening to remove the \u201clegacy\u201d checkmarks that confirmed the identities of users like government officials, corporations, journalists, celebrities and other high-profile tweeters.",
    "Now Musk may follow through: \u201cOn April 1st, we will begin winding down our legacy verified programme and removing legacy verified checkmarks,\u201d the company wrote in a tweet Thursday.",
    "A caveat, however: Twitter says this policy will go into effect starting on April Fool\u2019s Day. Musk in particular has been known for April 1 trolling, including in 2018 when he falsely tweeted that his electric vehicle company Tesla (TSLA) had gone bankrupt.",
    "\u201cTo keep your blue checkmark on Twitter, individuals can sign up for Twitter Blue,\u201d the company\u2019s tweet continued.",
    "Twitter Blue is a subscription service that Musk relaunched late last year that costs individuals US$ 84 a year or US$ 8 a month. Charging fees provides a revenue stream for Twitter \u2014 and a needed one, as Twitter currently collects virtually all of its revenue from advertisers, who have been fleeing the social media platform since he took over."
