    "The Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) spreading among cattle in Mullaitivu district these days is due to a virus spreading among cattle, the Agriculture Ministry said.",
    "Minister Mahinda Amaraweera today instructed the Livestock Development Division of the Agriculture Ministry to investigate the cause of this disease immediately.",
    "Additional Secretary Dr. L. W. N. Samaranayake explained that this condition was reported for the first time in Sri Lanka in 2019, and there were no such reports about\u00a0 this disease before that period.",
    "\"Cattle rarely perish by this disease, which is spread by a virus. Lumps that form on the skin cause wounds that fall off and heal with treatment,\" Dr.Samaranayake said.",
    "Also, said this condition is caused by a virus, a cow once infected with the disease has no possibility of contracting it again.",
    "Therefore, the Ministry requests that there is no need to be afraid of this disease and to follow the instructions given by the veterinary officers.",
    "He claimed that this disease does not spread among cattle such as foot and mouth disease. The only way to spread the disease is through direct contact with other animals. Therefore, the sick animals should be separated from the cowsheds.",
    "As this disease is currently reported to be present in four districts of the Northern Province, a special veterinary team is going to investigate it today.",
    "The transportation of animals and animal products from the Northern Province has been temporarily banned to prevent the disease from spreading to other areas.",
    "Minister Amaraweera mentioned that the ministry has already taken several measures to prevent diseases, in districts such as Nuwara Eliya, where animal husbandry is practiced well, by introducing outsiders into the farms where animal husbandry is being done, and by using only milk collection containers that have been sterilised.",
    "However, the Ministry emphasizes that there is no need to be afraid of this disease, because the death of cows is at the least level and because if the disease spreads, it will primarily affect the production of milk, so the people involved in cattle management should be vigilant.
