  "original_title": "182 Experts Call For Debt Cancellation But Private Investors Play Hardball",
  "original_body_lines": [
    "182 economists and development experts from around the world, in a statement released to the Guardian on Sunday, have observed that extensive debt cancellation was needed to give the Sri Lankan economy a chance of recovery and that Sri Lanka would be a test case of the willingness of the international community to tackle a looming global debt crisis.",
    "The group \u2013 including the Indian economist Jayati Ghosh, Thomas Piketty, the author of the bestselling book Capital, and Greece\u2019s former finance minister Yannis Varoufakis \u2013note that some of the world\u2019s most powerful hedge funds and other investors are holding up vital help for crisis-hit Sri Lanka by their hard-line stance in debt-relief negotiations after the country\u2019s staged default last year. Private sector creditors such as investment companies and hedge funds were preventing a deal at this time.",
    "\u201cDebt negotiations in Sri Lanka are now at a crucial stage,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAll lenders \u2013 bilateral, multilateral, and private \u2013 must share the burden of restructuring, with assurance of additional financing in the near term.\u201d",
    "Civil Society groups in Sri Lanka meanwhile note that there is need for a debate on alternatives to the IMF and Paris Club process for Sri Lanka and other Debt trapped countries of the Global South. There is need for a debate in Parliament on the issues raised in the Statement regarding the crisis in Sri Lanka. This statement suggests economic and development alternatives to the \u2018advice\u201d of the Washington Consensus and Colonial Club de Paris on Debt Cancellation and restructuring.",
    "Contrary to the widespread Disinformation on Sri Lanka\u2019s Debt crisis in the Corporate Media, at this time, the onus is on the EuroBond traders (\u0130SBs), like BlackRock and Hamilton Reserve Bank that caused Sri Lanka\u2019s Default and sued the Governemtn in the first instance, and their debt Collectors, including the Paris Club and Washington Twins (IMF and WB), to cancel the debt, and Not delay further.",
    "It is noteworthy that BlackRock got huge US Government Covid-19 \u2018bailout funds\u2019 to asset strip in vulnerable countries, while the world was kept in Covid-19 Lockdowns, economies destroyed and debt trapped in 2020-21.",
    "Non-OECD /PC bilateral Sovereign State creditors (India, China, Saudi Arabia, etc), who lend at lower and concessionary rates, have little reason to follow Washington\u2019s time lines for Sri Lanka\u2019s Debt restructuring. After all, these are Sovereign State Parties who do not charge the predatory interest rates that Paris Club creditors do.",
    "The statement also notes that there are many other lower and Middle Income countries in similar debt traps and raises fundamental questions regarding the relevance and utility of the current International Financial Architecture, particularly the Washington twins and related IFIs, at this time of economic crises in the Global South.",
    "Corruption clearly has a supply side and demaind side and pointing finguers at Sri Lanka\u2019s corrupt political and business elites is hardly adequate: There are 56 other countries in the Global South that are in Debt traps or near Default due to Eurobond (ISB), creditors who lend at Predatory interest rates.",
    "While successive Central Bank Bondscaming Ranil Rajapakse regimes are primiarily accountable for Sri Lanka\u2019s Debt trap and Default due to the oudious debt that they have accumulated though corrupt EuroBond deals, iis increasingly clear that the Washington Twins (IMF and WB), and OECD\u2019s Colonial Club de Paris and related accounting and legal firms like Lazard, Clifford and Chance which are part of the \u201cBailout Business\u201d (as the Transnational Insitutite calls it),\u00a0are also part of the problem.",
    "Hence, it is mysterious that the President of Sri Lanka, implicated in the 2015 Central Bank bondscams, thinks that the IMF is the Solution to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis, given that this is the 16th time that Sri Lanka has gone to the IMF! Other solutions are clearly necessary to ensure that Sri Lanka will not be going again for the 18th time to the IMF in a year or two!",
    "Given the odious nature of the Debt that caused Sri Lanka\u2019s first ever Default as it clocks 75 years of Lost Independence, and to ensure accountability and non-recurrence of debt default before any payment may be made to Eurobond (ISB), traders, the people of Sri Lanka have the Right to Information on:",
    "b) what the Bonds funds ($12 billion), borrowed were used for?",
    "c), the forensic audit reports of the CBSL bondscams be made public in the interest of transparency and accountability and there should be a moratorium and ban any future borrowing from Eurobond traders.",
    "Sri Lanka, along with many other low- and middle-income countries, has experienced a series of financial shocks due to both external and internal factors. Global forces have caused food and energy import costs to soar and interest rates to rise, even as the currency has devalued significantly. These shocks, along with a history of policy mismanagement\u2014and specifically the deregulation and openness that encouraged irresponsible borrowing, enabled illicit financial flows out of the country and assisted political corruption\u2014have intensified external debt and balance of payments crises.",
    "Over the last decade of liquidity expansion and low interest rates in the world economy, private lenders provided loans to low- and middle-income countries, at higher interest rates than for advanced countries. These higher rates were purportedly due to greater risk exposure that could make debt repayment more difficult in such countries. That risk has now materialised, firstly through a global pandemic, and then the price shocks and interest rate increases of 2022.",
    "Private creditors own almost 40% of Sri Lanka\u2019s external debt stock, mostly in the form of International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), but higher interest rates mean that they receive over 50% of external debt payments. Such lenders charged a premium to lend to Sri Lanka to cover their risks, which accrued them massive profits and contributed to Sri Lanka\u2019s first ever default in April 2022. Lenders who benefited from higher returns because of the \u201crisk premium\u201d must be willing to take the consequences of that risk. Indeed, ISBs are now trading at significantly lower prices in the secondary market. In this context, giving private bondholders an upper hand relative to sovereign debtors in the Paris Club and\u00a0the IMF\u2019s required debt negotiations violates the basic principles of natural justice.",
    "In addition, the lack of transparency of the debt negotiation process and accountability of the holders of ISBs underscores the concern that risky lending to corrupt politicians (leading to what is now recognised as \u201codious debt\u201d) was a significant element in generating the current debt crisis. Apart from revealing the identity of ISB holders, it is also important to disclose how ISBs were deployed, and the use of those funds.",
    "Debt negotiations in Sri Lanka are now at a crucial stage. All lenders\u2014bilateral, multilateral, and private\u2014must share the burden of restructuring, with assurance of additional financing in the near term. However, Sri Lanka on its own cannot ensure this; it requires much greater international support. Instead of geopolitical manoeuvring, all of Sri Lanka\u2019s creditors must ensure debt cancellation sufficient to provide a way out of the current crisis.",
    "The role of multilateral organisations, particularly the international financial institutions (IFIs), such as the IMF and the World Bank, is also significant. They were founded to assist sovereign nations, particularly in contexts in which financial markets would not deliver, to ensure financial stability and prevent or reduce the impact of financial crises, and to provide resources for crucial investments required to meet social and developmental needs.",
    "The IFIs are not currently living up to these responsibilities, at a time when they are most urgently required. In Sri Lanka they encouraged the very policies of more open capital accounts and deregulation that have led to the current crisis. They have been slow to respond to the crisis, and are apparently requiring onerous policy and fiscal conditionalities, such as moving to a primary fiscal surplus in a very short time, even as the economy continues to plunge.",
    "The implications are already evident in the recent Budget of the Sri Lankan government, which has unrealistic revenue assumptions that are unlikely to be met. Revenue shortfalls would then necessitate further \u201causterity\u201d and likely cuts in essential public spending. The Budget also proposes public asset stripping and privatization of strategic lands, marine resources, energy, transport and telecom infrastructure and public enterprises. These policies will harm the most vulnerable groups in Sri Lanka, exacerbate poverty and inequality, and lead to further economic decline. Instead the focus should be on legal and regulatory changes to stem the illicit outflow of capital through transfer pricing and trade mis-invoicing over the past 15 years, which is estimated to be far more than the aggregate foreign debt of Sri Lanka, and on taxation of wealth and consumption of the super-rich.",
    "The Sri Lankan case will provide an important indicator of whether the world\u2014and the international financial system in particular\u2014is equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent questions of sovereign debt relief and sustainability; and to ensure a modicum of justice in international debt negotiations. It is therefore crucial not only for the people of Sri Lanka, but to restore any faith in a multilateral system that is already under fire for its lack of legitimacy and basic viability.",
