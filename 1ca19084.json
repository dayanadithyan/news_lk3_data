    "U.S. Ambassador Julie J. Chung said yesterday that her country does not have any intention of setting up a military base in Sri Lanka.",
    "Responding to a query about the visit of a top U.S. defence official to Sri Lanka during an interview with Daily Mirror, she said, \u201cIn terms of the military base, I have said this repeatedly, we have no intention of building a military base.\u201d",
    "She also said her country does not have any intention of reviving or reassessing the SOFA Agreement.",
    "The SOFA was first signed in 1995. Earlier, a top-level US defence delegation led by Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Jedidiah Royal was in Sri Lanka in February this year for discussions with key security officials on matters related to regional security, reforms in Sri Lankan military and maritime domain awareness.",
    "The delegation, comprising high-level US defence officials, arrived in the country on two special aircraft of the United States Air Force. The visit sparked speculation that the U.S. will act for a military base in Sri Lanka. (Kelum Bandara)"
