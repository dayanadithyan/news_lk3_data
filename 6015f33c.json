    "Semi-luxury bus services will not be abolished by May 31, and directives have been received to take a decision on whether to convert the semi-luxury bus service to a super-luxury or normal service, the National Transport Commission said.",
    "NTC Director General Nilan Miranda said all semi-luxury bus owners have been informed of the matter.",
    "\"There are about 430 semi-luxury buses in operation. We inquired from the owners whether they preferred converting the bus service to a super luxury or regular service. The NTC has revised the services of 10 buses so far, and several requests have been received to revise the service,\" he said.",
    "The service amendment will be done without requiring any additional service or administration charges. As a result, the owners of semi-luxury bus services will have the opportunity to modify their service.",
    "However, certain semi-luxury buses will remain as they are by May 31, and later discussions will be held with them on amending the service.",
    "\"When converting the semi-luxury bus to a normal bus, there is nothing to be done for the bus. It is optional for the bus owners to remove the curtains or keep them. Only the blue color of the bus name-board will be removed, and the bus fare will be reduced. If a semi-luxury bus becomes a super-luxury bus, then it should be air-conditioned and have other related facilities,\" Miranda said.",
    "He said the requests can be made before May 31. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
