    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s new anti-corruption bill has not encouraged whistleblowers against bribery and corruption, refusing a cultural shift in tackling the financial misappropriations, a top official of the local Transparency International said.",
    "The new bill is expected to be brought to parliament and enacted by June this year.",
    "The new bill is silent on informants who speak out against bribery and corruption in the country.",
    "\u201cWe need a cultural shift,\u201d Sankitha Gunaratne, the Deputy Executive Director of Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) told a media briefing on Tuesday.",
    "\u201cWe need a country where public officers are transparent and the people are not afraid to speak up. We also need a country with unbiased law enforcement.",
    "Global and local rights groups have long demanded the island nation to take a tough stance on corruption and misappropriation of public funds.",
    "However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s administration has agreed with the International Monetary Fund to tackle the corruption issue and bring in Stolen Asset Recovery Law in return for a $3 billion loan.",
    "Majority of Sri Lankans believe some key politicians including former leader Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s family members had stashed money in foreign countries when they were in power. However, there have been inconclusive investigations into such allegations in the past and Rajapaksa has denied such wrong doing, analysts say.",
    "The unprecedented economic crisis also has forced the current government to look into leakages of state revenue and the latest anti-corruption bill is expected to address many of those issues, government officials have said.",
    "The IMF has urged Sri Lanka to reduce corruption vulnerabilities through improving fiscal transparency and public financial management, introducing a stronger anti-corruption legal framework, and conducting an in-depth governance diagnostic, supported by IMF technical assistance.",
    "\u201cThe new bill will highlight previously neglected issues such as bribery in private corporations and sexual bribery,\u201d Sankitha Gunaratne Deputy Executive Director of Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) told a media briefing on Tuesday (11).",
    "Related \u2013\u00a0Ahead of IMF approval, Sri Lanka govt promises anti-corruption bill",
    "The proposed new bill once enacted, along with the 21st\u00a0amendment to the constitution, increases the power of the bribery commission and gives them powers to conduct investigations.",
    "\u201cThe law on Bribery and Corruption at present has a provision on secrecy upon which even an officer who is authorized to give information to the public can be restricted by these provisions,\u201d Gunaratne said.",
    "\u201cThis is perhaps one of the positive aspects of the new bill.\u201d",
    "However, she also highlighted the proposed new bill including the possibility of new bill overruling the existing powerful Right to Information (RTI) Act and as a result, the TISL remains skeptical on how a cultural and social shift would be driven by the new bill. (Colombo/April12/2023)"
