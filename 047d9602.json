    "While both platforms are designed as ecosystems that create networking prospects across borders and within the country, \u2018Commercial Bank LEAP\u2019 developed with support from the IFC, is a comprehensive business ecosystem that will focus on elevating businesses through digitizing enterprises, and \u2018Trade Club\u2019 the Bank\u2019s own platform, is designed to empower importers and exporters by providing them easy access to the Bank\u2019s trade services.",
    "Commenting on the development of these platforms, Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Sanath Manatunge said: \u201cSupporting and empowering local businesses to grow and conquer global markets has been more than just a business goal for Commercial Bank. As the largest private bank in Sri Lanka, we consider it our national duty. Innovative, digitized methods are the need of the hour to boost export businesses to grow international trade and foreign exchange earnings. With the launch of these two platforms, Commercial Bank is taking its support for SMEs and corporates to the next level by offering them access to global networks, cutting-edge technology, and a wide range of business services that will help them stay competitive in today\u2019s rapidly evolving business landscape.\u201d",
    "Via Commercial Bank LEAP which is built in compliance with international standards and is powered by GlobalLinker, an international business enabling platform, SMEs and the Bank\u2019s corporate customers will be able to create online stores for free to sell their products and services, expand their network of customers, investors, and suppliers from across the world, improve business networking, tap overseas markets, access exclusive offers and benefits from partners, attract feasible business opportunities, and get discovered by a wider audience. As it is a secure platform for communication, it is also feasible for sharing ideas, collaborations and learning, the Bank said.",
    "Developed as a sustainable business model, Commercial Bank LEAP offers a range of business services, such as legal, financial, marketing, logistics and shipping services, and provides businesses with access to various business intelligence tools.

The Ministry of Finance had declared Commercial Bank as the largest lender to Sri Lanka\u2019s SME sector among all state-owned, private and specialised banks in the country in 2020, accounting for more than a fifth of all loans in terms of value and number. The Bank maintained this momentum in SME lending in 2021 too, during which it notably secured a US $50 million loan from the CDC Group, the UK\u2019s development finance institution, to further facilitate lending to SMEs and support climate projects in Sri Lanka.",
