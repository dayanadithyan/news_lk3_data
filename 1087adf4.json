    "\u201cGiven the ongoing economic challenges, it is now more imperative than ever to strengthen Sri Lanka\u2019s position as a vibrant export hub by developing local products to the highest global standards. As a leading global player in the protective hand wear industry and a member of the Hayleys Group, we take pride in DPL\u2019s continuing contributions to our nation\u2019s development,\u201d Dipped Products PLC Managing Director Pushpika Janadheera said.",
    "\u201cOur latest investments are part of our strategy to expand global reach, ensure supply chain resilience, and enhance service delivery to our key export markets. With our centralised warehousing facilities, we are also optimising our service capacity, speed, and customer value to help secure our next wave of growth,\u201d he added.",
    "Equipped with a state-of-the-art US National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) compliant safety system which covers 4,200 pallet racks, the new facility provides DPL with an extensive storage capacity.",
    "Combined with robust technologies including modern articulated truck technologies and product management systems, and an integrated data tracking system that streamlines DPL\u2019s logistical operations, that enables systematic tracing of containers from the loading point to the pallet rack. Moreover, the new central warehouse significantly reduces the need for internal transportation, reflecting a 30% decrease in inter-factory transport related Green House Gas (GHG) emissions."
