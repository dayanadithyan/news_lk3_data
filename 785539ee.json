    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka will review its expensive electricity prices and expected to revise by July, Energy Minister said, in a possible move to calm down the public who have protested against exorbitant tariff hikes in February.",
    "The move also comes as the government will have to face elections at least by next year.",
    "\u201cElectricity prices will be reviewed & revised by July 2023, keeping in line with the government\u2019s policy & cabinet decision taken in December 2022, to implement a cost reflective pricing mechanism and to review & revise electricity prices biannually in January & July of every year,\u201d Minister Wijesekera in a twitter message said.",
    "The state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has raised the tariff by 66 percent with effect from February 15 after a dragged\u00a0clash between the CEB and the power regulator, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL).",
    "The latest price hike comes as the CEB raised fixed costs for lower and medium level electricity consumers along with the electricity units.",
    "The tariff hike along with over 80 percent inflation has resulted in a chaotic market in the country as the authorities failed to maintain stable prices of goods and services. (Colombo/ May03/2023)"
