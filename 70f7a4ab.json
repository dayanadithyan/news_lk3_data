    "AICOA chairman Asela Sampath said they will do the same thing that they did to control the biscuit price hike.",
    "They warned the chicken meat traders to pass the concessions received from the dollar depreciation to the consumers.",
    "\"Do not try to gain more profit by using this current difficult situation,\" Sampath said.",
    "Meanwhile, he said although the US dollar depreciated, the prices of imported fruits have increased to unimaginable levels.",
    "\"A kilogram of grapes costs Rs. 2,690, and a kilo of apples costs Rs. 2,500. With the increase in the US dollar rate, the price of the local fruit varieties too has increased,\" Asela Sampath said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
