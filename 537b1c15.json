That is why the finance ministers of India, Japan and France said at a recent press briefing that if Sri Lanka moves ahead on this path, it won\u2019t persist in the difficulty of unsustainable debt. So, the country is on the right track in the direction of recovery. But let me say that the journey ahead is not a bed of roses. We may have to deviate from our traditional economic norms and practices,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cToday, we have been able to get the first tranche of assistance from the IMF and we are creating the background for obtaining the second tranche. We are not lost anymore.
