    "In approving the loan, the IMF has acknowledged Sri Lanka\u2019s capacity to restructure its outstanding debt, said Wickremesinghe.",

    "Sri Lanka\u2019s currency collapsed from 200 to 360 to the US dollar, as the central bank printed unprecedented volumes of money to target what was claimed to be a \u2018persistent output gap\u2019, crippling Treasuries auctions and botched an attempted float with a surrender rule.",
