    "Left-arm fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka, who was overlooked for the ODI series against Afghanistan, took four wickets as Sri Lanka 'A' bowled out South Africa 'A' for 175 runs in the second unofficial ODI in Pallekele.",
    "Madushanka took 4 for 33 in nine overs, accounting for the top four South Africa 'A' batsmen, Jordan Hermann, Zubayr Hamza, Kyle Verreynne and Matthew Breetzke, with the visiting team reduced to 20 for 4 in the 10th over.",
    "Janith Liyanage then took the wickets of South Africa 'A' captain Tony de Zorzi and Dewald Brevis, the visitors sliding further into trouble at 29 for 6.",
    "Pramod Madushan castled Beyers Swanepoel in the 16th over with the score on 42 for 7, before a 111-run partnership between Tristan Stubbs and Gerald Coetzee brought a semblance of respect to the South Africa 'A' innings.",
    "All-rounder Sahan Arachchige finally broke the partnership in the 39th over dismissing Stubbs for 59, taking the wicket of Lizaad Williams in his next over with the South Africa 'A' score on 157 for 9.",
    "Coetzee and Tshepo Moreki added 15 runs for the last wicket, before the former was bowled by Dunith Wellalage for a team high 77."
