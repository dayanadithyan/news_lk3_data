    "Assures his faction\u2019s fight against draft bill will commence before courts",
    "Claims it has many language and legal errors, proving it was drafted by Government stooges who are inexperienced and ignorant about drafting legislation",
    "Says his faction, Opposition parties, civil society and media will form broad platform to defeat Govt. efforts to curtail media freedom",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress (FPC) Member MP Prof. G.L. Peiris yesterday opined that the Broadcasting Authority draft bill will most likely be rejected by the Supreme Court due to its many legal errors.",
    "Peiris said his party will challenge the draft bill in court and he is confident it will be rejected by the Supreme Court.",
    "\u201cIt has many language-related mistakes as well as legal errors,\u201d he said. Peris also said he believed that a landmark judgement delivered by former Supreme Court Justice Dr. A.R.B. Amarasinghe in 1997 will also directly affect this draft bill. \u201cThe Supreme Court will not sanction this,\u201d the MP said.",
    "Peiris said his faction along with other parties of the Opposition, civil society and media organisations will prevent the draft bill from being passed in Parliament.",
    "\u201cThe citizenry is tired of this Government. In response, the Government attempted to bring the Anti-Terrorism Act but there was a local and international wave of opposition that arose against it. The Government was forced to bow to the pressure. Where is that act now?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat happened to the Central Bank Act? The Supreme Court found that one-third of it did not comply with the Constitution,\u201d Peiris noted. The MP slammed those drafting the recent bills calling them inexperienced and ignorant. \u201cIt is evident they have no basic knowledge about drafting legislation. The Government has outsourced the drafting process to those without knowledge or experience who are merely carrying out the work to please various persons in power,\u201d he alleged. \u201cGovernment stooges are drafting these bills,\u201d he added. The senior MP said his faction along with the Opposition will not allow the enactment of legislation that seeks to prevent elections and curtail media freedom in the country.",
    "\u201cOur fight to protect media freedom will commence from the courts. We will then bring the entire Opposition, media and civil society groups to a broad platform to defeat these condemnable efforts of the Government,\u201d he said. The MP warned that a \u2018Tsunami\u2019 of public opposition is on the rise and the Government will not be allowed to carry out its acts of suppression."
