    "SLC with a record profit of Rs 6.3 billion made in 2022 could easily allocate more funds for developing women\u2019s cricket.\u00a0 Times have changed. The gentlemen\u2019s game is not only meant for men; today it is the ladies\u2019 game too.",
    "The Ceylon Times headline on November 2, 1948 -- \u201cCeylon team goes down fighting.\u201d \u2018\u2026.a catch which any first-class cricketer would have been proud to make, a brilliant one-handed effort above her head with which Beverly Roberts ended centurion Hide\u2019s innings.\u201d",
    "Ceylon Observer same day wrote, \u201cCeylon\u2019s women cricketers though beaten decisively as anticipated, nevertheless made a decided impression not only on the large crowed that watched them play against the English women\u2019s team at the Oval, but also on the visitors who were amazed to hear that their opponents had had less than two months of practice together\u2026.The wicket-keeping of Leila Abeykoon and her correct style of batting and her good defence evoked commendation from visitors.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka women\u2019s cricket started way back in the 1920\u2019s. The girls of St. John\u2019s Panadura may be considered pioneers of women\u2019s cricket. Both Beverly and Leila were Johnians. They were coached by the master-in-charge, Gilbert Clyde Roberts, a man of cricketing virtuosity was a member of the Barbados [WI] cricket squad in the late 1910s who moved to England and in early-1920s took a ship to Ceylon \u2013 settled down in Panadura, after meeting Cyril Arnold Jansz, founder of St. John\u2019s schools, and joined the staff teaching English literature and coaching cricket.",
    "All searches for a girl\u2019s school team to challenge for a friendly match failed, as no girls school in the island had ever dreamt of playing cricket then.\u00a0 In 1933, a match was fixed between St. John\u2019s College and St. John\u2019s Girl\u2019s school as the first ever between two women\u2019s teams on the island\u2019s soil and was played on Panadura esplanade on July 12, 1933, exactly 90 years ago [to coincide with founder\u2019s day], which later became an annual encounter. Few other Colombo girls\u2019 schools joined the fray a decade or so later.",
    "When MCC announced English women\u2019s Australian tour in 1948, the usual stopover en route to Australia was an opportunity for the CCA to grab. By then a few \u2018big\u2019 girls\u2019 schools in Colombo were already playing Cricket. However, trials held proved that the Panadura girls were far superior in both talent and experience, hence three of them, Leila Abeykoon, Beverly Roberts, [Daughter of Roberts] and Phyllis de Silva were selected along with a combined nine from the rest.",
    "Extract from Premasara Epasinghe\u2019s interview with Leila at her Sister\u2019s residence in Edward Lane Colombo 3, in year 2000.",
    "Premasara:\u00a0 Did your parents object to your being active in sports, especially cricket?",
    "Leila: No, my parents really encouraged me. They were of the view that sports would build your character personality and help to discipline oneself. We were all under a much-disciplined human being-a cricket coach, a guide and philosopher G. C. Roberts. He was like a father to all of us.",
    "Premasara: When you heard that you were selected to represent Ceylon in 1948 in cricket, what were your feelings?",
    "Leila: I was very happy and delighted when I heard that I was selected to represent my country. Further, I was overjoyed as two other Johnians, Phylis de Silva (mother in law of Duleep Mendis) and Beverley Roberts were also included in the Ceylon Women\u2019s Cricket Team. --\u2018Sports\u2019 by Premasara Epasinghe- The Sunday Observer- June 25, 2000",
    "Gilbert Clyde Roberts and family migrated to down under in 1970s and Roberts passed away on April 7, 1981.",
    "The Sri Lankan women\u2019s cricket team for ICC women\u2019s T20 World Cup did perform fairly well beating South Africa and Bangladesh.\u00a0 It is a welcome move that SLC thought of appointing Susanthika Jayasinghe, the Olympic silver medalist as the \u201cConsultant-Mentoring and Development of Women\u2019s Cricket,\u201d to promote the game and also the raising of match fees for 2023. SLC should draw up a programme to develop Cricket in Girls schools to meet the current trends."
