  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Indian High Commission today denied reports which suggested that the Government of India has demanded compensation from the Government of Sri Lanka towards the assistance provided during the fire incidents onboard MT New Diamond and MV Xpress Pearl.",
    "In a statement, the High Commission said \u201cIt may be recalled that the Government of India immediately deployed ships of the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) in response to specific requests from Sri Lanka Navy for providing expeditious assistance to fight the fire incidents onboard MT New Diamond and MV Xpress Pearl. Rescue operations conducted by these ships were instrumental in curtailing the hazardous effects of the two fire incidents and thereby limiting the damage to the maritime and marine environment of Sri Lanka,\u201d",
    "\u201cIn line with \u2018Polluter Pay Principle\u2019 as per international norms, we have raised a claim for deployment, salvage activities and items/stores undertaken by these ships. The Government of Sri Lanka has been requested to join our claims with that of the Sri Lankan side in the respective forum. It is emphasized that the request has been for presenting these claims to the Insurer/Owner for settlement and reimbursing the compensation received through established channels,\u201d it added.",
    "Thus, the High Commission reiterated that India had not demanded any compensation from the Government of Sri Lanka and Government of India\u2019s immediate deployment of ships are in line with \u2018Neighbourhood First\u2019 policy and Security and Growth for All (S.A.G.A.R) doctrine."
