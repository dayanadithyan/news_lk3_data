    "ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka\u2019s state run water supplier has cut off water supply for 87,000 consumers who\u00a0have failed to pay their monthly bill after a tariff hike last year, an official said.",
    "\u201cUp to now, we have disconnected 87,000 connections as consumers are unable to pay their bills\u201d,\u00a0an official from the state-owned National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) told Economy Next.",
    "The NWSBD incurred a loss of 3.1 billion rupees in 2021 and the losses continued in 2022 as well due to lower revenue and higher wages of the employees.",
    "\u201cIf the consumers don\u2019t pay within the 30-day period, we are liable to disconnect. The issue is they are not prioritizing the due payment. Actually 50 percent of customers are not paying within 30 days but they are consuming water.\u201d",
    "A special gazette notification was issued by Water Supply Minister Keheliya Rambukwella to increase\u00a0the water tariffs with effect from September 01, 2022",
    "\u201cThe arrears for the disconnected customers are 1.7 billion. Normally we have 2 month bills that are 8 billion.\u201d (Colombo/April01/2023)"
