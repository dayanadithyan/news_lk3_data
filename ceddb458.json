    "Sri Lanka\u2019s limited overs captain Dasun Shanaka was confident his team could complete a series whitewash against New Zealand to claim an automatic spot in the Cricket World Cup later this year.",
    "Sri Lanka open their three-match ODI series at Auckland today, needing to win all three ODIs against the hosts to guarantee direct qualification to the World Cup.",
    "Sri Lanka could qualify with one or two wins, but that would depend on the results of South Africa\u2019s two match series against the Netherlands.",
    "Failure for Sri Lanka would result in them having to take part in a qualification tournament to gain entry into the World Cup.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s possible. It depends on the day. New Zealand is a good side and we aren\u2019t taking anything for granted. We need to do the hard work to win the series,\u201d Shanaka added.",
    "Sri Lanka will be buoyed by the inclusion of experienced former Test captain Angelo Mathews, who last played an ODI in March 2021.",
    "There was controversy on the eve of the first ODI, with reports suggesting that Dhananjaya de Silva had been dropped for the first two matches after refusing to bat down the order.",
    "De Silva took to Twitter to refute the rumours, stating that he always stands with the team.",
    "\u201cThe story circulating in social media saying that I have refused to bat at No. 7 during tomorrow\u2019s game is false, and I wish to state that I am a player who always stands with the team,\u201d he tweeted.",
    "Meanwhile, ex-South Africa Under-19 captain Chad Bowes and all-rounder Rachin Ravindra will make their ODI debuts for New Zealand. Bowes is set to open the batting for the Black Caps at Auckland\u2019s Eden Park more than a decade after skippering South Africa\u2019s juniors at the 2012 Under-19 World Cup before moving to New Zealand.",
    "Ravindra has already played three Tests and six Twenty20s for New Zealand.",
    "\u201cBoth guys have earned their spots through performances in the domestic white-ball arena, so we\u2019re really excited about the opportunity,\u201d said New Zealand captain Tom Latham.",
    "After whitewashing Sri Lanka 2-0 in the Tests, New Zealand have released several stars including Kane Williamson, Tim Southee and Devon Conway to their Indian Premier League teams.",
    "The sides are looking to break their ODI losing streaks -- New Zealand and Sri Lanka both lost all three ODIs on separate tours of India in January."
