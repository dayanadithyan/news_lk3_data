    "The Central Bank Governor and the leaders of the country must be mindful to work and not complain, former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said. \u201cI have done this job for the last nine years. Have I ever complained or cried for a single day? We did our work despite a war. That is what is required of a Central Bank Governor and leaders of the country,\u201d Cabraal said.",
    "\u201cThere is no point in talking to us anymore, or the leader of this country. You must ask these questions in Washington as they are now controlling our country and economy,\u201d he added responding to questions by journalists."
