    "Morison Ltd., a pioneer in pharma manufacturing with a solid footprint of over 60 years industry expertise, and a subsidiary of the Hemas Group, recently unveiled its exclusive CSR platform Suwa Deya, going one step beyond its purpose of \u2018Making Premium Healthcare Affordable\u2019.",
    "Being an exemplary corporate citizen in the industry, Morison firmly believes in taking the high road through uncompromised integrity across its value chain. Within this framework, Morison engages its stakeholders through a novel approach in its pharma brand building journey. With this emerged Suwa Deya the exclusive CSR platform of Morison, extending a series of meaningful and differentiated industry related activities to give back to society. Through Suwa Deya, Morison aspires to touch the lives of many by launching a spectrum of unique initiatives dedicated towards patients, employees, general public and healthcare professionals, being its key stakeholders.",
    "Patient centricity being its core footing, Suwa Deya commenced by acknowledging an unseen need of patients visiting Government Hospital diabetic clinics.",
    "Realising that the patients visiting the clinics arrive early without a proper morning meal, the first initiative of Suwa Deya attempted to address this by providing healthy breakfast snacks and beverages for such patients. Sensitive to the inconveniences patients undergo, particularly during the prevailing economic challenges, Morison has conducted 15 such programs at multiple diabetic clinics, including Kalubowila Teaching Hospital, Balangoda Base Hospital, Rathnapura Teaching Hospital and Negombo District General Hospital.",
    "Taking it another step further, the \u2018Ape Suwa Deya\u2019 initiative was launched as a distinctive extension of Suwa Deya, to serve the Morison team and their closest family members. Ape Suwa Deya offers EmpaMor (Empagliflozin 10mg & 25mg), MinMor (Metformin 500mg) and Ros-10 (Rosuvastatin 10mg), three of Morison\u2019s latest branded pharmaceuticals to treat Diabetes and Cardiovascular diseases, the two most prevalent non communicable diseases in the country. Morison employees and their loved ones who have been prescribed such products, are entitled to receive these completely free of charge on a monthly basis throughout their employment period, ensuring they do not shoulder the economic burden of chronic disease.",
    "Dinesh Athapaththu, Managing Director, Morison Limited commenting on the programme said, \u201cIn making our purpose a reality, our own team who enables it on the ground by moving on to uncomfortable territories and getting the ball rolling during the toughest of times, comes first. Therefore, in Suwa Deya, all of us at Morison undoubtedly deserve a special place. With that emerged \u201cApe Suwa Deya\u201d, to serve our very own team and their loved ones with our own medicine manufactured at our own premises, completely free of charge.\u201d",
    "Morison aims to further develop Suwa Deya into a comprehensive CSR platform to foster hope for all its key stakeholders with more differentiated interventions in the future, while driving the local pharmaceutical industry to the heights it deserves.",
    "In the recent past, Morison has come forward to progressively change the trajectory of the pharma manufacturing industry in Sri Lanka. The recent inauguration of its second pharma manufacturing facility at Homagama, a state-of-the-art worldclass facility built as per EU GMP specifications, was one major milestone towards embarking on its new journey.",
    "Being a truly Sri Lankan company, Morison takes pride in nurturing an exclusive homegrown pharmaceutical brand which is built upon a value blend that is uniquely unparalleled. The new branded pharma range of Morison stays true to its purpose of \u201cMaking Premium Healthcare Affordable\u201d, extending the best worlds of quality and price, assuredly a rare combination in the market.",
