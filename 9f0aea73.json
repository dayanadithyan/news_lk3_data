  "original_body_lines": [
    "Following failed discussions with the Education Ministry officials today, all teachers' trade unions have decided to gather at the Fort Railways Station on Wednesday (22) to take further decisions about their trade union actions, Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin said.",
    "He told the Daily Mirror that all teachers' trade unions, including the CTU, the All-Island United Teachers' Union (AIUTU), and the Joint Teachers' Service Union (JTSU), claimed that they would engage in trade union action if the government failed to provide solutions for the sudden decision to dissolve the National School Teacher Transfer Board.",
    "\"We came out of the meeting that was held at the ministry because the discussion failed,\" he said.",
    "\"The President had a discussion about these teacher transfers today with the participation of the Teacher Transfer Board director and another person. During the meeting, it was decided to double check the approved transfer before it is implemented,\" he said.",
    "The President cannot intervene to double-check the teacher transfers as they were completed by the team appointed by the ministry. We're wondering how presidents can get involved with this transfer board. A President cannot intervene in the democratic procedures of a separate ministry.",
    "The Education Minister and the Secretary are not aware of the decision taken by the President.",
    "Therefore, we have called all the teacher unions to gather in front of the Fort Railways Station to oppose the President's decision, Stalin said.",
    "\"Our trade union action will continue until our demands are met,\" he added. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
