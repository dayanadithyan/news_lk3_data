    "SJB national organiser Tissa Attanayake says the situation revealed by the charity is extremely dangerous",
    "Urges Govt. to seek support from international organisations to address the issue",
    "Says Govt. cannot reject these findings and must intervene to help the country\u2019s children",
    "The main opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has called on the Government to take into consideration the recent report released by the Save the Children organisation which revealed that half of Sri Lankan families are reducing the food intake of their children. SJB national organiser Tissa Attanayake said the situation revealed by the charity is extremely dangerous and highlights the plight of the country\u2019s children. \u201cWe cannot reject these findings though the Government appears to be displeased by it,\u201d he said. The opposition MP claimed the truth is that not even half of the country\u2019s families are now having three square meals a day.",
    "Relating a recent incident at a soup kitchen organised in Kandy for school children, Attanayake said one child was seen hiding away a boiled egg to take home for his siblings. \u201cThe developing malnutrition situation cannot be prevented. We ask the Government to take into consideration the issues raised by the Save the Children organisation and other international agencies and intervene in addressing the malnutrition that has arisen in the country,\u201d the MP said.",
    "He noted that food inflation has increased by 25% and people\u2019s lives are suffering as a result of this. He said people are now in debt and selling their valuables to purchase food. \u201cIf the Government fails to take action now the future generation will face serious nutrition-related issues which in turn affect their mental health,\u201d he noted.",
    "The MP urged the Government to seek solutions through the support of international organisations such as the World Food Program and others known to intervene in saving children from such dire circumstances. Attanayake warned that the consequences of the current situation faced by children will only be visible in a few years\u2019 time. \u201cIn the end, their intelligence, health and nutrition will suffer. We saw a recent report where a mother took her life along with her two children as she was unable to bear their medical costs. This is a pathetic situation,\u201d he said."
