  "original_body_lines": [
    "Says SJB members singing praises of President Wickremesinghe must be shown the door",
    "Accuses several SJB MPs over the age of 70 of vying Ministerial positions in the Govt.",
    "Asks those wanting to crossover to leave but not expect entire SJB to follow suit",
    "Claims SJB MPs and members will take matters into their own hands about the Ranilists in party if Premadasa fails to take action",
    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Deputy National Organiser S.M. Marikkar says party leader Sajith Premadasa must take action against the Ranilists within the party ranks.",
    "\u201cThose who are singing praises of Ranil while remaining in the party must be shown the door. A decision must be taken about them,\u201d he said.",
    "Marikkar said if Premadasa fails to do so, the party members will be forced to take matters into their own hands.",
    "\u201cThere are those who have a foot on both camps. There are similar people within our party. They want to join Ranil and become Ministers. But they are afraid to contest with Ranil and instead want to face elections with Sajith,\u201d the MP accused. Marikkar said the party will take a decision on such members soon. The MP made these comments addressing a party pocket meeting held over the weekend.",
    "\u201cI was one of the few who took the risk to form the SJB. Those who had no political future in other parties joined us in order to be elected and are now attempting to bully us and sing praises of Ranil,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said those who wish to join Ranil can do so but warned them to refrain from attempting to get the SJB to join the Government. \u201cDo not discuss to take the entire SJB with you to the Government in an attempt to contest from the SJB later,\u201d he said.",
    "Marikkar said one of the main reasons the SJB parted ways with President Ranil Wickremesinghe was his inability to understand the issues faced by those in the lowest rungs of the society. The MP said if Wickremesinghe has not changed his ways, the SJB cannot come to any agreement with him. \u201cCan we join hands with Ranil who is protecting those who stole public monies?\u201d Marikkar asked.",
    "The MP said certain SJB members over the age of 70 continue to seek out Ministerial positions. \u201cOne such person is Welgama. Why does he continue to stay with the SJB? He should grovel before Ranil and obtain a Ministerial position. There is another MP with similar dreams,\u201d he claimed.",
    "The MP said real SJB members and supporters are not singing praises of Ranil Wickremesinghe. \u201cOnly those who voted for the pohottuwa last time around or remaining UNPers along with those vying for Ministerial positions are singing his praises,\u201d he alleged.",
