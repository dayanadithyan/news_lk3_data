    "I pen this article for those who seek the possible basis of Anatta from a scientific point of view. I\u2019m leaving out \u2018of the equation\u2019, the \u2018Soul theory\u2019 of an unchanging entity of theistic religions, as it is not pertinent in the \u2018dhamma of the Buddha\u2019, which refutes it.",
    "is at the core of the dhamma, preached by the Buddha 2,500 years ago. The belief in a \u2018self\u2019 is our everyday experience in life. One goes to sleep and gets up in the morning, as the same person with the same memories, within the same body. It needs some sound explanation, if we are expected to believe there is \u2018no-self \u2019. I will try to prove in this short article, that the concept of \u2018no-self\u2019 i.e. anatta, is true.",
    "The self is a protective product of the brain. The problem with the belief in a \u2018self \u2018is that it tries to protect itself\u2019. Man is built biologically to survive and procreate. Hence such reflexes for survival are automatic to his brain\u2019s inherent structure and psyche. It is reflected in the chronological stages of evolution of brains, of animal life-forms in nature. The evolutionary features of which (both structural and  functional), we also carry in our brains.",
    "They are (as seen in the Figure of the human brain above), in chronological sequence, the Reptilian brain, the Paleo-mammalian brain (Limbic brain) encompassing it, and lastly, the latest, the neo-mammalian cortex of the brain. The former two are involved with instinctual reflex and emotional behaviour for survival, respectively, much like that found in evolutionary lowly animals and birds. The emotional brain, is evolved when birth begins to be from a womb rather than from an egg. Because this entails living within a herd, it becomes a must, to ensure security of the mother, who has to be protected at all times to care for the progeny and ensure the survival of the genus (species-herd). The rules of the herd cause auto-regulation of the emotional brain by the neo-cortex. Much later, education or the fear of religious pronouncements like the five precepts will help mitigating the reflex emotional responses, of the emotional brain.",
    "The human brain carries within it, all three evolutionary brains with their inherent functions.",
    "The brain was once believed to be an unchanging entity. This myth was debunked several decades ago. The brain keeps adapting to the needs of the environment and the circumstance in which it is placed, to help the \u2018being\u2019, to tenaciously survive. This takes place from about the age of three to five years, as a child. The \u2018self\u2019 is built over the growing years, i.e. the personality, it becomes unique to the \u2018being\u2019 based on its experience and education i.e. nurture. This process occurring in the brain is neuro-biologically termed neuroplasticity, and is goes on all the time in the network circuits of the brain. They are encoded into the very networks of the brain at a tissue level (i.e. neuronal network).",
    "There are so far eight networks that have been imaged based on their activity, by neuroscientists as up to now. Two dominant networks concerned with the mind, are the Default mode network (DMN) and the  Central Executive Network (CEN). The DMN deals with self-referenced thinking. Thinking of the past, events etc. and worrying about the future. In contrast CEN is used when thoughts are of the present, are task oriented and positive. Human beings are considered to be in the DMN, most of the time (in Rumination). Training to live in the present moment, by intense Mindful-meditation, helps to encourage the gradual withering away of neuro-plastic change that has occurred in the DM Network (placed in many interconnected foci in the brain) by disuse (synaptic pruning). Since DMN which enhanced \u2018self- referenced thoughts\u2019 its attrition is salutary. Persisting with Mindful meditation, secures by neuro-plasticity changes in the CEN, the task positive  state and this then progresses to a trait, which permits the meditator to enter into the CEN the brain at will.",
    "; comes on only at three to five years, develops throughout life, being located at multiple foci of the DMN, its attrition by Mindful meditation and its impermanence with its dissolution as brain tissue at death, are four valid arguments that there is no locus for a \u2018Self\u2019 in the brain and its lack of permanence. These highlights the truth of Anatta. Then one can ask, what goes across with rebirth, it is Kammic energy, said the Buddha.",
    "is a core concept in the dhamma and is backed by current neuroscience.",
    "The Buddha, in deep meditation, had it revealed unto himself the natural laws that apply to forces dealing with life-forms i.e. that of Kammic energy. That this Kamma is a link in the law of causality (paticca sammuppada), which leads to rebirth and a Sansaric existence. The latter in turn leads to Dukkha.",
    "Atta or \u2018self\u2019, when provoked, responds emotionally as it always underlies the mindset of an untrained being, with its predilection for thoughts, words and deeds on self-preservation and procreation. This is due to the human brain harbouring both the Reptilian and Emotional components. Thereby leading to instinctual responses of a \u2018survival nature\u2019, like  clinging to self, i.e. Bava Tanha, it leads to other Kammic acts such as anger, hatred, envy, jealousy and greed (even altruistic acts are motivated, as seeking privilege and priority in the herd) with their kammic consequences.",
    "Hence the realization of Anatta as being true  in reality, and that the \u2018self\u2019 is simply neuro-plastically determined \u2018construct (fabrication)\u2019 to withstand the environment and the circumstances, for survival becomes clear. As all formations are impermanent (Anicca), in which this neuro-plastically developed construct ( i.e. the \u2018being\u2019) too is placed in, is not a permanent, but an ephemeral entity in true reality.The Buddha dharma states that it\u2019s only one\u2019s acquired Kammic energy seeks \u2018vipaka\u2019 and this results in the next lives.",
    "Awareness of the truth of Anatta, mitigates Kammic acts and de-links paticca samuppada i.e. Sansaric progression, and  dukkha that follows. This is the Buddha legacy to humankind.",
    "A more detailed exposition, will be presented in a book, \u2018Buddhist Philosophy and Neuroscience\u2019, I hope to publish in the very near future.",
