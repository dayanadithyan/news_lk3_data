    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Trade unions and professional associations in Sri Lanka have renewed a threat to go on strike if a promised meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe to discuss an interim solution to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed income tax hike issue does not materialise.",
    "Government Medical Officers\u2019 Association (GMOA) secretary Dr Haritha Aluthge told reporters on Monday March 27 that during a recent meeting held with President\u2019s Secretary Saman Ekanayake, the Professionals\u2019 Trade Union Alliance (PTUA), of which the GMOA is a key partner, was promised a meeting with President Wickremesinghe by the end of last week.",
    "The purpose of the meeting, said Alutghe, was to discuss an \u201cinterim solution\u201d to the professionals\u2019 grievances over the progressive income tax hike until a reported revision that\u2019s due in six months when the country\u2019s recently approved 17th IMF programme comes up for review.",
    "The response from the president\u2019s secretary to go for an interim solution based on recommendations made by the professionals was a positive one, said Aluthge.",
    "\u201cA meeting was promised with the president to discuss the interim solution proposed by the government and any reliefs provided to professionals through that so that a final agreement could be reached. That meeting was to be held at the end of last week, but still hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate and insult the patience and sacrifices of the professionals. We will not hesitate to go for serious trade union action including strikes,\u201d he added.",
    "The privately-owned English-language weekly newspaper The Sunday Times reported on March 26 that the IMF had indicated the possibility of revising some of the taxes imposed as part of the IMF\u2019s staff-level agreement with Sri Lanka when the programme comes up for review in six months.",
    "According to the newspaper, IMF officials had conveyed this to representatives of trade unions during a virtual roundtable held last Friday March 24. The virtual meeting was held on the initiative of the IMF and was attended by trade unions and professional associations representing the PTUA including the GMOA. (Colombo/Mar7/2023)"
