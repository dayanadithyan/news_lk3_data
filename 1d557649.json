    "The recent bus fare revision have been implemented on 90 percent of the buses and measures have been taken to implement the revision on 100% of the buses in the new year season, National Transport Commission (NTC) Director General Nilan Miranda said.",
    "Addressing the media today he said several incidents of the fare revisions not being implemented were reported.",
    "\"The NTC had revised the bus fares soon after the reduction of fuel prices. All the bus owners were advised to display the new bus fare revision sheet clearly visible to the passengers. According to the fuel price revision, the bus fare was calculated within six hours, and the new revision was implemented within 24 hours. But it was found that the revised bus fare was not implemented on several routes,\" he said.",
    "The NTC had assigned mobile inspectors and warned the buses which had not implemented the revised bus fares. Fines were imposed on the buses that had not implemented the new fares on Monday (3), Miranda said.",
    "However, stern action would be taken if the same incident was reported several times. A special program has been launched by the NTC in the Western Province in this regard, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
