    "The World Trade Centre Colombo celebrated 25 years in operation in Oct. 2022",
    "Overseas Realty (Ceylon) PLC said yesterday it has recorded a strong growth in Revenue and Profitability, primarily driven by the Havelock City Residential sales, to record a Group Revenue of Rs. 15,046 million and a Group Profit Before Tax of Rs. 7,025 million for year 2022. The depreciation of the rupee by 83% resulted in the group incurring significant exchange losses on the foreign currency loans.",
    "The Company Revenue of Rs. 2,112 million at the World Trade Centre, Colombo was 6% higher than the corresponding period of last year, with higher rental rates. Revenue of Rs. 12,391 million was recorded in 2022 from Residential Sales of Havelock City, compared to Rs. 5,144 million last year.",
    "\u201cThe strong growth in Revenue and Profitability was fronted by the robust performance of Havelock City Residential Sales during the first quarter of 2022.\u00a0 Since then, the steep depreciation of the rupee and increase in interest rates have significantly slowed down demand for residential property,\u201d stated Overseas Realty Ceylon Group CEO and Director Pravir Samarasinghe.",
    "\u201cFinally, after five years, since the groundbreaking, with many challenges due to the unfortunate pandemic and economic crisis, the construction of the Havelock City Commercial Complex was completed. The grand opening of the Office Tower at Havelock City was held in October 2022; while the World Trade Centre, Colombo celebrated 25 years in operations. The Group continues to dominate the office market bringing modern expertise, domain knowledge and experience to its developments and management to better serve our tenants and customers,\u201d added Samarasinghe.",

The Shopping Mall is expected to be opened in July 2023.",
    "The fourth and final phase of Havelock City Residential Apartments was completed in 2021 and a majority of units have been sold whilst a limited number of ready to move in luxury apartments in both Phases 3 and 4 are still available for purchase and immediate occupancy.",
