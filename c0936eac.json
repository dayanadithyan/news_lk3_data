    "More Gazette notifications similar to the one issued on Wednesday night under which several institutions were brought under the President's purview will be published in the future as more of the institutions have to be converted to profit-making entities, UNP MP Vajira Abeywardena said.",
    "\u201cMore institutions will have to be moved out of government control and converted into institutions which are more profitable. More state institutions will have to be made more efficient. They should be able to become institutions able to pay higher salaries,\" the MP told a media briefing.",
    "\u201cThe Road Development Authority (RDA) should be under a few companies if it is to become more profitable,\" the MP said, citing an example.",
    "He said the President needs the people's support to bring stability.\"",
    "\"The President has called for the united support of all parties in order to set up national policies. He needs the support of the people and he will ask for it,\" he added.",
    "\u201cPeople should not vote in anger this time but should think of future generations when casting their vote,\" he also said. (Yohan Perera)"
