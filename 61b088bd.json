  "original_body_lines": [
    "Disputing the grim forecast of Sri Lanka\u2019s exchange rate by Fitch Solutions by the year-end, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe raised concerns on the basis of the forecast while stressing that such long-term predictions on exchange rate are not prudent.",
    "Fitch Solution recently maintained its forecast for the rupee to weaken to a record low of 390 per dollar by the year-end despite the positive prospects of the country securing the US$ 2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout package.",
    "Dr. Weerasinghe noted that annual debt service obligation to the tune of US$ 6 billion until 2029\u00a0 has been one of the assumptions of this forecast. However, he stressed that such a high figure of foreign debt servicing is unlikely given that the country is engaged in debt restructuring negotiations.",
    "Further, he opined that such a long-term prediction on an exchange rate of a currency is not practical.",
    "Referring to the recent appreciation of the rupee, he remarked that the market will adjust to a new rate and if the need arises, the CB stands ready to intervene in the forex market in a limited capacity.",
    "\u201cWe have a small market, that\u2019s why the exchange rate fluctuates a lot. That\u2019s why the CB is required to intervene in the market to a certain extent. However, the CB would not act against the direction of market forces,\u201d he stressed."
