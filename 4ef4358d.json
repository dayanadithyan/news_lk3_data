    "When inquired by Ada Derana in this regard, Mr. Hapuhinna said that he is not aware whether he has been removed from the post of Secretary of Public Administration, but he had been notified to come to the President\u2019s Office today.",
    "However, the political sources state that Mr. Hapuhinna will be attached to the Presidential Secretariat with a new responsibility in that office.",
