  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Tuesday approved a proposal put forward by the Minister of Trade, Commerce and Food Security Nalin Fernando to amend the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, No.9 of 2003.",
    "Announcing the decision, Cabinet Co-spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena said the Government has recognised the need to revise the act to meet current market needs.",
    "He said the existing act was passed in 2003 to curb market monopolies, anti-competitive behaviours and unfair trade practices taking place within the country as well as to protect consumers from such acts. However, the Minister said many gaps in the law have now arisen with the lapse of over two decades.",
    "\u201cThe current act was passed in 2003. It is around 20 years old. With time various gaps and shortcomings have arisen in the law,\u201d he said.",
    "The Minister said these weaknesses have become glaringly obvious through the various difficulties faced by consumers when attempting to seek legal redress for offences committed by businesses. He said the Consumer Affairs Authority has faced legal limitations in extending its support to such legal action taken.",
    "\u201cMany revisions and amendments have been proposed. Accordingly, an initial draft has been formulated with amendments,\u201d he said. The Minister added that the Cabinet of Ministers this week approved the proposal presented by the Minister of Trade, Commerce and Food Security to instruct the legal draftsman to draft amending articles based on the preliminary bill prepared."
