    "\u201cBut there will be an immediate impact though petroleum. When there is a cost reflective pricing formula, the benefit that can come through exchange rate appreciation should definitely be passed through to the consumer.",
    "\u201cThat is where there will be a positive impact on inflation through faster than what we think as a result of this recent appreciation.\u201d",
    "The central bank has already predicted single digit inflation by the year end.",
    "Governor Weerasinghe hiked rates in April, curtailed private credit and saved the rupee, probably halting hyperinflation and a possible dollarization of the economy after two year of money printing and a surrender rule led to a collapse of the rupee from 200 to 370 to the US dollar.",

    "Interest rates are however high due to fears of domestic debt re-structuring.",
    "An appreciating currency will also reduce working capital needs of energy utilities, importers and exporters, and other private businesses, improving their bottom lines.",
    "Costs of imported inputs including fertilizer will fall, further improving margins of companies allowing them to cut prices faster and attract more business.",
    "An appreciating currency, a possible absolute fall in some prices can also reduce pressure to hike wages and social unrest as disposable incomes improve.",
    "As soon as the dry season is over currency appreciation may also improve finances of the Ceylon Electricity Board. (Colombo/Mar07/2023)"
