    "Gautama Buddha or his Dhamma cannot be subverted by anybody; but by the members of the Sangha community themselves; and today, a few among the Sangha community is quite enthusiastically engaged in this exercise; details are too shocking and appalling to pen; [for latest Ref. DM -19/05/2023], they are the worst conspiracies against the Buddhist order.",
    "Pastor Jerome, during a sermon to a large congregation of his followers, was alleged to have made several controversial utterings about other religions, specifically Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam. The President has already instructed the law enforcement authorities to investigate and prosecute him, if he had violated the law of the land.\u00a0 The investigators should focus their attention on multiple angles to ascertain any hidden objectives to deliberately insult religions causing a violent backlash, as part of an international or local political conspiracy, and also on; \u2018money laundering.\u2019",
    "There are books written by foreigners as well as local Buddhists espousing hypothetical theories on the life and times of Jesus Christ. \u2013 \u201cJesus Lived in India\u201d by Holger Kersten, speaks of a place on the Pakistan\u2019s border marked as the tomb of Jesus. Two \u201cSinhala-Buddhist\u201d have co-authored a similar text saying Jesus was a Buddhist disciple. Quite a few books on the hypothesis, \u2018Buddha a Sri Lankan, and a Sinhalese\u2019. According to the Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism, Buddha, is the ninth among the ten avatars of the God Vishnu. Some members of the Sangha, politicians, and lay \u2018Buddhists,\u2019 who castigate Jerome, do worship God Vishnu statues erected within temples. Speech and expression are rights; one can reject, accept or criticize them. No issues here; for issues are created by publicity-seeking monks and Politicians.",
    "The Panaduraa Vaadaya has taught us lessons on taking a harmonious approach to ideological differences in religion.",
    "The \u201csaviors of Buddhism\u201d who rushed to the CID office to make allegations, and another group of \u2018Buddhist\u2019 monks calling on the Mahanayake Theras of Kandy urging them to intervene to stop the campaign by Pastor Jerome against the Buddha Sasana, which usually maintain stoic silence over horrendous criminal acts committed by a few Buddhist monks. They must take up the numerous issues of sexual misconduct alleged to have been taking place within sacred walls involving little samaneras and underage girls.",
    "The Buddha did not show any hatred or deception, to Devadatta, Cincha, Nalagiri, etc. Eight stanzas in Jayamangala Gaatha, says, \u201cThe Lord of Sages defeated him by means of well-trained endurance: -- The Lord of Sages defeated him by sprinkling the water of goodwill: -- The Lord of Sages defeated her with peaceful, gracious means: - The Lord of Sages defeated him with the light of discernment: -- The Lord of Sages defeated him by means of his words of knowledge etc.",
    "Explaining how ICCPR applied in \u2018Pastor\u2019 Jerome Fernando\u2019s case, Gammanpila MP said that if found guilty, he could face a prison term of up to 10 years. The former minister urged the police to take a court order to ban \u2018prayers\u2019 at the Miracle Dome.\u00a0 Will any politician call for the imposition of stern punishment on the monk for the alleged crime he committed, just seven days after Pastor Jerome\u2019s statement?",
    "The religious dignitaries, instead of demanding tangible action or eye-for-eye against, Pastor Fernando\u2019s demeanor, they should educate their followers on the values of the anti-hatred, compassionate approach based on the teachings of sages. The laws against defamation and subversion became the British Empire\u2019s suppression tools in the subcontinent. Indian Penal Code 295(A), which was passed in 1927, at a time of strong conflicts between Hindus and Muslims became crucial. The cases that followed were protesting insults against Islam, and some defending Catholics\u2014that is, defending religious minorities against Hindus.",
    "Religious freedom is the foundation of independent conscience. Belief about the transcendent inspires backing for any political, social, or economic order. Regimes alone cannot bar people from responding to an intense and powerful spiritual call delivered with grandiloquent and rhetorical oratory using hypnotic powers.",
    "Our good Buddhists and Christians have taught us generous lessons on a harmonious approach to ideological differences in religions \u2014 the best example being the Buddhist-Christian debate conducted in Panadura, exactly 150 years ago [August 1873] popularly called by the press, \u201cPantura Controversy\u201d or Panduraa Vaadaya.",
    "The Dutch who arrived in the mid -17th century, were ardently Protestant - Calvinist\u2014they made an effort to restrain the activities of Catholic clergy and spread the Reformed church.\u00a0 Missionaries enacted laws banning the practice of Buddhism and Hinduism naming them as \u2018cannibal faiths. Roman Catholic clergy were deported; Calvinist pastors lead the congregations. Many Catholic priests received refuge from Buddhists and settled in Kandy.",
    "The Revivalist Movement gathered momentum in the mid -19th century. Migettuwatte Thera was joined by others countered missionary propaganda through leaflets, posters and other material. They challenged the Christian missionaries to open debates. The Church of England joined the Wesleyans during this time, while Catholics reintroduced their struggle against Wesleyans along with Buddhists.",
    "Saner counsel prevailed and they decided to meet \u2018face to face\u2019 and debate it to an end. The Christian party wrote in June 1873 to the Buddhists under the signature of Mathes Gunawardene (letter is preserved in Archives). The letter requested a venue and date and agreed to the proposal and recommended they meet to discuss the arrangements: The accord Signed on July 24, 1873 says,",
    "\u201cAugust 26 and 28 were fixed for the debate.\u00a0 \u00a0Nominated one from each party to record the proceedings of the verbal debate. All points raised had to be backed by references. A speaker allowed one hour at each turn, with the first hour restricted to a Christian speaker to make statements adverse to Buddhism, to which the Buddhist would reply at the second hour. There should not be any disturbances or interferences; maintenance of harmony, decorum and peace was the responsibility of the signatories.\u00a0 \u00a0Times - 8.00 am to 10.00 am and 3.00 pm to 5.00 pm.\u00a0 --Mathes Suwaris Gunawardene - On behalf of Christians: Kurukulasooriya Cornelis Perera - On behalf of Buddhists.",
    "A foreign Christian priest, who attended the debate, wrote,\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe most remarkable incident in my first three months of missionary experience and one of the most remarkable things I have ever witnessed was the great controversy, Christianity versus Buddhism. \u2026when we arrived at the place\u2026 we found that thousands had got there before us; as we sat on the platform\u2026the clock struck nine, the priest, Ven. Migettuwatte, [a Christianity and Latin scholar] arose and commenced his address on the Buddhist side. \u2026his manner as he rises to speak which puts one in mind of some orators at home\u2026 His powers of persuasion show him to be a born orator.\u201d- Father S. Longdon; \u2018Ceylon Friend\u2019 - September 1873 - [Nat. Archives]",
    "Main speaker for Christianity, Rev. David de Silva was a scholar in Pali and Thripitaka.\u00a0 Among those who converted to Buddhism, after reading Peables\u2019 booklet on the debate were Col. Olcott from America and Ms. Petrona Blavatsky and Prof. Evan Pavulavich from Russia. Dr. J. M. Peables, visiting from America during the debate, returned home and published a manuscript titled \u2018Buddhism and Christianity Face to Face,\u2019 in 1875, based on a text he borrowed from John Capper, the Editor of \u2018The Ceylon Times\u2019. It was titled \u2018A Full account of the Buddhist controversy held at Pan-tura in August 1873.",
    "The Dhamma, is not a doctrine, a philosophy or an ideology for scholarly or academic studies, or for that matter, for debate. In Kalama sutta, Buddha said, \u2018Do not believe just because something fits with the reasoning of logic.\u2019 It is to be realized by oneself through one\u2019s own efforts. A matter of \u2018proving or disproving\u2019 in a debate does not arise. In Cricketing parlance, what is important is not \u2018who won or who lost\u2019, but the exemplary manner in which the game was played. The debate was conducted under the highest standards, and more significantly the exemplary behavior of the 6000 crowd with only 30% literate was amazing.",
