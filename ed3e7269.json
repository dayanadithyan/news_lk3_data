    "Sri Lankan females number more than 51 per cent of the population. They have made significant strides in areas such as education and healthcare but their rights are still being violated, State Minister of Women and Children\u2019s Affairs Geetha Kumarasinghe said.",
    "\u201cDespite the current social and economic challenges faced by Sri Lanka, women continue to exhibit strength and resilience, earning respect and admiration, Kumarasinghe said at a media conference called to announce International Women\u2019s Day celebrations to be held on March 8 at Water\u2019s Edge in Battaramulla, under the aegis of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The press conference was held at Solis Hotel, Ethulkotte on Tuesday.",
    "Kumarasinghe added: \u201cPrivate sector entities are sponsoring the whole event and we are not using government funds to organize the event at Water\u2019s Edge. This year\u2019s Women\u2019s Day celebrations are themed, \u2018She is the Pride of the Nation\u2019 and are dedicated to honouring the remarkable achievements of Sri Lankan women.",
    "\u201cAt the event we will acknowledge and appreciate the immense contributions of outstanding women to Sri Lanka\u2019s development and we believe that recognizing them will serve as an inspiration to all women in the country. At the event we will recognize 25 outstanding female entrepreneurs on a district basis and present them with gifts and certificates.",
    "\u201cFurther, President Wickremesinghe had directed the ministry to prepare a long term strategy to improve the condition of women in Sri Lanka and it will be launched during the event.",
    "\u201cThe celebrations will also showcase Sri Lanka\u2019s rich cultural heritage, adding more colour to the occasion. It\u2019s worth noting that no government funds will be used on the event as we have received generous donations from the UNFPA and other external parties.",
    "\u201cWe remain committed to empowering women in Sri Lanka and will implement more strategies and regulations to support their advancement beyond this one-day event.\u201d",
