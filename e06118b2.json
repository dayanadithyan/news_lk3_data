    "President Xi Jinping ordered the coordinated search, CCTV said, but \u201cso far, no missing persons have been found\u201d.Teams from around the region are now at the scene and China has deployed two commercial vessels - the Lu Peng Yuan Yu 018 and Yuan Fu Hai - to help in the operation.",
    "\u201cIt is necessary to further strengthen the safety management of fishing vessels at sea and implement preventive measures to ensure the safety of maritime transportation,\u201d Premier Li Qiang said, urging relevant ministries to strengthen oversight of the fishing sector.",

    "The capsised vessel was owned by Penglai Jinglu Fishery Co., one of China\u2019s major state-run fishing companies.",
    "It was authorised to fish for neon flying squid and Pacific saury, according to data from the North Pacific Fishing Commission.It left Cape Town on May 5, en route to Busan, according to the MarineTraffic tracking website, which last located the vessel on May 10 to the southeast of Reunion, a tiny French island in the Indian Ocean.",
