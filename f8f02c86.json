    "While Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara said yesterday that MP Rajitha Senaratne had changed his mind on the crossover, the latter says that many have misunderstood him.",
    "\"Rajitha Senaratne will not crossover as anticipated,\" Madduma Bandara said in response to a query made by Daily Mirror on the outcome of the meeting the SJB MPs had with the Kalutara District Parliamentarian last evening.",
    "MP Senaratne too said he explained his stand to the group of SJB MPs including Madduma Bandara and Lakshman Kiriella he met, and they fully understood his position.",
    "\u201cI told them what I had to say, and they fully understood my position. I said most of the people including the media have misread me. They wanted me to issue a statement and deny the media reports, but I said I will only release the full video footage of my recent press conference,\u201d he added. (Yohan Perera)"
