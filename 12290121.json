  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Australian law firm, which is assisting Sri Lanka\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Department with the civil suit to claim compensation for the environmental damage caused by the shipwreck of MV X-Press Pearl, has advised that carrying out the litigation process in Singapore is favourable to the island nation, the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) says.",
    "This was disclosed during a meeting held at the Justice Ministry with the participation of the Attorney General and the senior officials of the department, the top management of the MEPA, and a group of lawyers with expertise in maritime law. The meeting was chaired by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.",
    "The Singapore-flagged container ship MV X-Press Pearl, only three months after being commissioned, was gutted in a fire that erupted off the western coast of Sri Lanka on 19 May 2021.",
    "Following the disaster, the MEPA appointed a committee of experts comprising professors and other relevant top public officials to assess the damage. The panel handed over its second Environment Damage Assessment Report to the Attorney General\u2019s Department on 13 January 2023.",
    "The MEPA says it has provided all necessary documents to the Attorney General\u2019s Department to prosecute the ship owner or the operator or the ship\u2019s agents in Sri Lanka under the Criminal Law, in terms of Section 26 of the Prevention of Maritime Corruption Act.",
    "As the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers is given to continue the litigation process in Singapore, the Attorney General\u2019s Department is proceeding with the legal matter accordingly. However, the committee of expert lawyers appointed to look into the matter has suggested that the prosecution be done in Sri Lanka.",
    "The decision to continue the legal proceedings in Singapore recently attracted criticism as it was deemed a very costly move.",
    "According to the Australian law firm\u2019s advice, with Singapore being a renowned international maritime hub and its up-to-date maritime laws, filing the lawsuit in the Southeast Asian country is advantageous for Sri Lanka, the Attorney General told the attendees of the meeting.",
    "In addition, the owner of the X-Press Pearl and all other major parties linked to the shipwreck are based in Singapore, and implementing a court order in Singapore or in the United Kingdom, where the main office of the vessel\u2019s insurance company is located, will be plain sailing for Sri Lanka, the Attorney General has explained further."
