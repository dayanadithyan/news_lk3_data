    "Managing the crisis by increasing the daily payments allocated for examiners to check the 2022 GCE Advanced Level (A/L) is the responsibility of the Education Ministry, Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) Secretary Joseph Stalin said.",
    "He told the Daily Mirror that the CTU had earlier requested a daily payment of Rs. 3,000 for A/L examiners.",
    "However, the Ministry has decided to grant only Rs. 2,000 as daily payment for examiners, considering the current expenses.",
    "The crisis that had affected the education sector during the past year has moved to this year. If this crisis is not solved, it will move to the next year, he said.",
    "\"The teachers used to engage in paper marking on a voluntary basis. However, we cannot expect free services during this economic crisis. Therefore, the government should take action to provide the examiners with what was proposed in the government,\" Stalin said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
