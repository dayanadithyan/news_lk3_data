    "A BOC press release explained: \u201cThe interest income of the Bank grew by 61% to Rs. 137.8 billion primarily due to the increase in AWPLR comparing to the corresponding period of the previous year. However, interest expenses grew by 162% as the funding mix has been repriced at higher rates, resulting high cost of funding and led to 53% decline in net interest income by Rs. 21.2 billion compared to 1Q -2022 since the Bank has not transferred the full impact of the increase in the market interests to its loyal customers in order to revive their businesses in this trying time despite many headwinds to the Bank\u2019s current operating environment.",

Meanwhile, all the liquidity ratios also improved given the positive market liquidity vibes conquered during the period under review.",
    "\u201cGeneral Manager/ Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, Russel Fonseka highlighted that, \u201cdespite never experienced challenges the Bank has been able to maintain its position and steering the Bank strongly and prudently in the next few years is of utmost importance and is on a pathway to stable growth with a growing market share and an increasing asset base made possible through scaling up of digitization, pursuit of operational efficiencies, and expert capacity of the cadre\u201d. Further he stated that, \u201cthe Bank has already identified key challenges yet to be faced by the banking industry due to contraction of the economy and slow growth, debt restructuring programme and other Government fiscal reforms. Based on these challenges, the Sri Lankan banking industry will have to face a never experienced operating context. BoC as the largest local commercial bank of the country, it is vital to carefully manage the banking activities to support economic recovery and revival at large. Hence, in next couple of years the Bank\u2019s key focus will be strengthening its Balance Sheet instead of short-term profitability. Similarly, the Bank has adopted the same strongly during last few years too.\u201d",
