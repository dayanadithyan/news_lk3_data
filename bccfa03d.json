    "Investors are not closing factories and leaving Sri Lanka, and other exporting countries are also experiencing, a fall in demand, he said.",
    "As the US Fed and European Central Bank printed money and inflated the money supply, during the Coronavirus crisis, effectively accommodating a real shock through monetary means, there was as surge in demand triggering supply chain shocks and inflation.",

    "\u201cObviously when companies have a sales decline of 20 percent for 7-8 months, maybe they are rearranging in some ways. But we have not seeing companies closing or pulling out from Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cBut factories there will be some adjustments in the head count and there will be one or two factories struggle but the industry will continue.\u201d",
    "The industry is expecting demand to recover in the second half of the year.",
