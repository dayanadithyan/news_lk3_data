    "\u201cWe have always been overly optimistic about the Tourism Industry in Sri Lanka which keeps bouncing back no matter what you throw at it and such is the case even now as we see signs and clear indications of a rapid rebound of tourism within the next few years. Stability and good governance is the need of the hour in this current environment and tourism in this small Island Nation will grow on its own and contribute immensely to the economy as it has done in the past.\u201d Ranil De Silva stated. The Amami product range has expanded exponentially from the manufacture of air fresheners at its birth to producing quality shampoos, shower gels, toothpastes, glycerin soaps, varied detergents, and a number of ayurvedic and herbal products which are now highly sought after by the leisure industry both locally and overseas.",
