    "Accuses President Ranil Wickremesinghe of\u00a0 quite connivingly obstructing the polls and enjoying it in the process",
    "Calls the country\u2019s leader a cruel and devious man and asks the people if the responsibility of the country should be handed over to such a man",
    "Says the NPP and the people now have a responsibility to save the country from the grips of such leaders who are uncensored about the welfare of the people",
    "National People\u2019s Party (NPP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake says President Ranil Wickremesinghe is gaining a cruel form of enjoyment by obstructing polls.",
    "\u201cPolitical parties presented nominations to contest, people prepared for the election campaign, and political parties went among the people to address them. But Ranil quite cunningly obstructed the polls. Not only did he obstruct them but he is now enjoying it in the most heartless fashion,\u201d Dissnayake said.",
    "Noting Wickremesinghe carried out this crime against the country\u2019s democracy while laughing in Parliament, Dissanayake said no normal man can act in this manner.",
    "He made these comments while addressing a rally in Ratnapura yesterday in response to the statement made by the President in Parliament on the Local Government polls claiming there is no election as the Election Commission had failed to declare it in a legally acceptable manner.",
    "\u201cWhat a cruel and devious man,\u201d the NPP Leader said, while calling on the people to understand the true nature of the country\u2019s leader. \u201cShould we hand over the responsibility of our children, the youth, the people and our motherland to such an inhuman and manipulative man?\u201d he asked. \u201cHe is not a President but a dictator,\u201d the NPP Leader declared.",
    "\u201cAll aspirations of the people and democracy is just another game of checkers to him,\u201d the NPP Leader said, adding that it goes on to prove that the country\u2019s leaders have never taken decisions with the people\u2019s welfare in mind. He said they only think about their power, luxurious lives and the existence of their cohorts.",
    "He accused Wickremesinghe of violating the Constitution and the laws as well as hampering the duties of the Election Commission in order to obstruct elections. \u201cHe has no mandate. This is the reason he wants to delay polls,\u201d he said.",
    "Dissanayake said therefore the NPP and the country\u2019s citizens now have before them the challenge of saving this country from the grips of such callous, cunning and devious leaders. \u201cWe will achieve this task,\u201d he said, as the crowds applauded."
