    "Says Speaker must seek advice from predecessors if he is unsure of how to carry out his duties",
    "Notes Speaker should have informed party leaders of ECSL letter on funding and convened parliament",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress member MP Dr. Charitha Herath says Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardane must seek advice from past Speakers if he is unsure of how to carry out his duties. Referring to the letter sent by the Election Commission of Sri Lanka to the Speaker, requesting that he intervenes in securing funds for the Local Government polls, Herath said its contents were only reported through the media.",
    "\u201cAccording to reports the Speaker merely made a note on it and forwarded the letter to the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance,\u201d he said, adding that it shows a lack of experience. Herath made these comments at a press conference held at the party office in Colombo yesterday.",
    "\u201cPerhaps he has a political opinion as he is the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna organiser for the Weligama electorate. But if he is unsure of his duties he must inquire into the experiences of other Speakers. Those such as Chamal Rajapaksa, Karu Jayasuriya and Anura Bandaranaike as Speakers faced similar situations. If it is apt he should inquire into their experiences,\u201d he added.",
    "Herath said if the Speaker had in fact received a letter from the ECSL, he should have informed the party leaders and convened parliament immediately. \u201cInstead he has done what a secretary should,\u201d Herath noted. \u201cI think he does not understand his duties. This is laughable,\u201d said Herath.\u00a0 Blaming the Police for the death of the National People\u2019s Party (NPP) supporter at the recent demonstration, Herath said President Ranil Wickremesinghe is up to his old tricks. \u201cHe worked to destroy democracy as a member of past United National Party Governments. There is no other who is better at doing this job. But we will not allow for this. We will bring together all democratic forces in the country and create a broad opposition alliance to bring an end to Wickremesinghe\u2019s rule\u201d he said.",
