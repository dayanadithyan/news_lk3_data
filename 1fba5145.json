    "As well, I think it is important for the Office of the Mayor not to in any way be tarnished and not to see the City government itself put through a prolonged period of controversy, arising out of this error in judgement on my part, especially in light of the challenges we face as a city.",
    "I am deeply sorry and apologize unreservedly to the people of Toronto and to all those hurt by my actions including my staff, my colleagues and the public service.",

    "I have made the Integrity Commissioner aware of the relationship and asked him to review it.",
    "I want to thank the people of Toronto for trusting me as Mayor.",
    "It has been the job of a lifetime, and while I have let them and my family down in this instance, I have nonetheless been deeply honoured by the opportunity to serve the people of this wonderful city and I believe I did some good for the city I truly love particularly during the pandemic.",
    "I\u2019m usually known for taking as many questions as you want, but on this occasion I\u2019ll let my statement speak for itself."
