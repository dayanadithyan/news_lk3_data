  "original_body_lines": [
    "While claiming that there is no debate over restructuring local debt, SJB MP Eran Wickramaratne said today the government should not go for a haircut on local debt for any reason and that it should ensure the stability of the banking system.",
    "Speaking during the debate on the IMF report, he told Parliament that the government must not create any instability in the banking system through the local debt restructuring.",
    "\u201cWe have no debate over restructuring local debt. The debate is on the way of doing it. The cure should always be better than the problem. If a cure is proposed by anybody, which is worse than the problem, we should resist it because we are going to get into a deeper problem. That is why we stand firmly on local debt restructuring. There are ways to do it. But, no way should a haircut be entertained,\u201d he said.",
    "The MP said foreign debtors have stressed that Sri Lanka should first restructure domestic debt and discussions on external debt could be discussed by September, 2023.\u00a0 \u201cWe urge the government not to tamper with the capital and aggravate the problem,\u201d he said.",
    "Wickremaratne said the SJB was ready to support the government to stabilize the banking system and urged the government not to take any decisions that are detrimental to the members of the EPF and ETF.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
