    "Paying down foreign loans of banks reduces domestic investments or consumption or both which in turn reduces imports, narrowing the external current account deficit.",
    "Foreign direct investments foreign borrowings by the private sector or the government will expand the current account deficit.",
    "Using central bank reserves for imports (which involve printing more money to fill liqudity shortages in  banks to maintain a policy rate) also expands domestic credit and the current account deficit.",

    "Mercantilists believe that depreciation of the currency will increase export competitiveness and not social unrest and poverty, triggering more capital imports as domestic capital is inflated away, eventually ending in sovereign default.",
    "The mis-understanding about the balance of payments, propagated by John Maynard Keynes involves the so-called \u2018transfer problem\u2019 of the 1920s linked to Weimar Germany\u2019s external deficits and default.",
    "Economists including Bertil Ohlin and Jacques Rueff tried to explain the phenomenon to Keynes ( Transfer difficulties, Real or Imagined) but failed.",
    "Sri Lanka debt crisis trapped in spurious Keynesian \u2018transfer problem\u2019 and MMT: Bellwether",
    "Sri Lanka to lend US$2.5bn to US and top-rated borrowers in 2023 under IMF deal: analysis",
