    "The program, which focuses on the Thelippalai and Velanai areas of Jaffna, was implemented in conjunction with the government\u2019s paddy procurement and disposal program for the 2022/2023 high season, with the Sri Lanka Army making a significant contribution.",
    "The distribution of rice to low-income families was carried out by Ratnayake.",
    "Expressing his views at the event Mr. Ratnayake said: \u201cI am proud to share with you the President\u2019s vision of providing 10 kg of rice to low-income people, which was started as a relief program for the poor and benefited paddy farmers by allowing them to receive the right price for their harvest.",
