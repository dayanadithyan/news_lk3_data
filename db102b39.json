    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Amnesty International Senior Director Deprose Muchena who is in Sri Lanka on an official visit will meet International Monetary Fund (IMF) representatives to discuss a 2.9 billion US dollar deal and its socioeconomic implications, Muchena said.",
    "Speaking to EconomyNext on the sidelines of Amnesty International\u2019s South Asia regional launch of its State of Human Rights Report for 2022/2023 in Colombo, Muchena said on Tuesday March 29 that he would be meeting IMF officials this week to better understand what is now Sri Lanka\u2019s 17th IMF programme.",
    "The international nongovernmental organisation is not seeking a partnership with the IMF but wishes to acquaint itself with Sri Lanka\u2019s IMF-backed reform agenda, said Muchena, to see if the government\u2019s objectives with regard to macroeconomic reforms align with Amnesty\u2019s own economic, social and cultural rights standards.",
    "The Zimbabwe-born human rights activist also called for transparency and accountability in Sri Lanka\u2019s dealings with the international lender and other agencies.",
    "\u201cPut people at the centre of any economic programmes that the government is embarking on.",
    "\u201cThe government also does not have a choice between development and human rights, because the pronounced absence of one materially affects the other,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka has to implement a human rights programme in parallel to the reforms, said Muchena, calling for a people-first agenda that seeks to protect the public and meet their expectations including the withdrawal of \u201cdraconian\u201d measures in response to protests.",
    "Sri Lanka has been on the receiving end of criticism from both local and international human rights groups for its handling of anti-government protests with special focus on its its repeated use of the Prevention of Terrorrism Act (PTA), a controversial counter-terror legislation whose repeal civil society and political parties, especially those representing ethnic minorities, have called for.",
    "The government, however, has maintained that any arrests of protestors have been of individuals perpetrating violence or otherwise breaking the law. Spokespeople for the government point to a wave of retaliatory mob violence that engulfed the country on May 09 2022 after pro-government elements launched an unprovoked attack on peaceful protestors. The offices and residences of several parliamentarians were torched and one government MP was killed by a mob that afternoon. The government has blamed ideologically extremist groups for hijacking what was until then a peaceful protest movement and using it to dismantle the state.",
    "Activists and opposition parties, however, contend that the space for dissent is shrinking in Sri Lanka and accuse the government of stifling peaceful protests. Critics of the government point to what they call reckless use of teargas, water cannons and other measures to crack down on peaceful protests.",
    "The mounting criticisms notwithstanding, there has been a notably muted response from the West concerning alleged stifling of protests by the government since President Ranil Wickremesinghe replaced his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa who was forced to resign amid last year\u2019s historic wave of protests.",
    "Some foreign policy analysts believe this is because Wickremesinghe is seen as an ally of Western powers and that any silence on their part may be motivated by strategic interests vis-\u00e0-vis Beijing whose influence on Colombo remains considerably high.",
    "Asked to comment on this, Muchena said Amnesty International has been consistent in its communications.",
    "\u201cWe have shared our findings in the annual report today. Its primary focus has been to call out double standards,\u201d he said.",
    "The central theme of the report launch event was calling out a purported hypocrisy on the part of the international community.",
    "Speaking to EconomyNext, Muchena highlighted Amnesty\u2019s past pronouncements on vaccine nationalism and other instances of alleged duplicity.",
    "\u201cWe have been calling out what we see as double standards [of the] leaders of the world have done on Russian aggression in Ukraine (sic). We have called out selective application of outrage, of the rule of law and of solidarity,\u201d he said, noting that the global community\u2019s silence on creeping authoritarianism and the stifling of protests in countries including Sri Lanka has not gone unnoticed.",
    "\u201cWhen human rights violations happen in Sri Lanka under this or the previous government, Amnesty International has consistently spoken out against such violations. We have consistently stood on the side of victims of human rights violations and will continue to do so,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka must ensure that any partnership or deal whether it\u2019s with the IMF, the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank, and consequent macroeconomic policy reform fulfills its obligations to the people.",
    "\u201cEnsure that any partnership, any deal, macroeconomic policy deal, IMF, ADB, implemented in Sri Lanka fulfills accountability to the people, transparency in terms of what\u2019s actually in the content and ensuring that the people and human rights are at the centre of advancing any of the economic reforms that are taking place. That is the Amnesty approach, and we believe that it is consistent in Sri Lanka as it is in Washington DC (sic),\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBut I can\u2019t speak for the broader west, except to call them out when there is a double standard,\u201d he added, noting that any observations Amnesty has made pertaining to the alelged double standards are backed by well-researched evidence.",
    "\u201cWe can tell you that the US, the UK and the EU opened their doors to Ukraine refugees but not for Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen refugees,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lankan authorities, too, cannot escape their obligations under international human rights law that they have to the people, said Muchena.",
    "\u201cPartners to Sri Lanka should call the government out if they veer off its human rights obligations, in order to avoid double standards,\u201d he said.",
    "Muchena was emphatic that the IMF, particularly with regard to austerity measures, must ensure social protection.",
    "Defenders of the IMF programme, however, say a strong social safety net to protect the most vulnerable groups is one of the key pillars of the deal.",
    "\u201cThe protection of people in a social way is so key, because we know that IMF programmes and World Bank programmes have in the past in different countries resulted in austerity. Austerity is about cutting expenditure. It is about reducing the fiscal space of the state to manipulate the budget in such a way that it can allocate resources for social spending,\u201d said Muchena.",
    "\u201cIf the government is not going to do that, then it\u2019s going to come stacked against its own people. The IMF and other partners will be held responsible and accountable for outcomes of what they support. We believe that aid must not diminish human rights, but must in fact enhance human rights protection,\u201d he added.",
    "Muchena conceded, however, that he had yet to study the IMF deal, hence the planned meeting with the international lender\u2019s representatives.",
    "Under the latest IMF programme, Sri Lanka will be the first country in Asia to undergo a comprehensive governance diagnostic exercise by the global lender. At the request from the authorities, the governance diagnostic will examine the severity of corruption in Sri Lanka and identify key governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities that are macroeconomically",
    "critical. Commenting on this, Muchena said: \u201cI have seen elements of tax reform and revenue changes and so on. All those things the government is responsible for doing, we must simplify our role as a human rights movement. At the end of the day, do diagnostics \u2013 all these issues that are big English words\u2026 austerity, etc \u2013 result in advancing human rights or in diminishing human rights?",
    "\u201cWould Sri Lankans have more access to water, food security, employment opportunities. Is this going to attack the triple burden of unemployment, poverty and inequality? If the answer is no, then it is a bad deal. If the answer is yes, then let\u2019s have reporting mechanisms for the government to account to people,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s have transparency of everything that is being discussed between the IMF and the government so that you enhance confidence in the manner in which economic policy reform is taking place,\u201d he said.",
    "\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bMuchena reiterated that human rights have to be prioritised in any macroeconomic reform policy.",
    "\u201cBut our principle, whenever there is economic reform, put human rights first to guarantee protection of ordinary people in a social way. But also avoid austerity, because it is the very problem that <would lead to> protests in the first place.\u201d (Colombo/Mar29/2023)"
