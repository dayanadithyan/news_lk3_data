  "original_body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka has a difficult road ahead irrespective of how much funding it receives from multilateral and global financial agencies, a senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics told Reuters on Tuesday.",
    "Moody\u2019s Analytics is independent of Moody\u2019s Investors Service, the rating agency.",
    "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a nearly $3 billion bailout for Sri Lanka on Monday and the country\u2019s presidency said the programme will enable it to access up to $7 billion in overall funding.",
    "\u201cIt (the IMF support) is definitely not like the silver bullet they think,\u201d said Katrina Ell, senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.",
    "\u201cThe exuberance that has been reflected in the financial markets will really fade unless we see some significant improvements from the government as also in Sri Lanka\u2019s growth prospects\u201d.",
    "The economist said all additional funding that the country receives in coming months is good news but fiscal prudence and debt sustainability will be key.",
    "\u201cWe need to keep in mind that it\u2019s still going to be a difficult road no matter how much potential funds or support is being thrown at Sri Lanka,\u201d Ell said."
