  "original_body_lines": [
    "Uganda\u2019s President Yoweri Museveni signed one of the world\u2019s toughest anti-LGBTQ laws, including the death penalty for \u201caggravated homosexuality\u201d, drawing Western condemnation and risking sanctions from aid donors.",
    "Same-sex relations were already illegal in Uganda, as in more than 30 African countries, but the new law goes further.",
    "It stipulates capital punishment for \u201cserial offenders\u201d against the law and transmission of a terminal illness like HIV/AIDS through gay sex. It also decrees a 20-year sentence for \u201cpromoting\u201d homosexuality.",
    "\u201cThe Ugandan president has today legalised state-sponsored homophobia and transphobia,\u201d said Clare Byarugaba, a Ugandan rights activist.",
    "United States President Joe Biden called the move \u201ca tragic violation\u201d of human rights and said Washington would evaluate the implications of the law \u201con all aspects of U.S. engagement with Uganda.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe are considering additional steps, including the application of sanctions and restriction of entry into the United States against anyone involved in serious human rights abuses or corruption,\u201d he said.",
    "A presidency photo of Museveni showed him signing the law with a golden pen at his desk. The 78-year-old has called homosexuality a \u201cdeviation from normal\u201d and urged lawmakers to resist \u201cimperialist\u201d pressure.",
    "A local organisation, Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum, and 10 other individuals later filed a complaint against the law at the constitutional court, one of the petitioners, Busingye Kabumba, told Reuters.",
    "Museveni had sent the original bill passed in March back, asking parliament to tone down some provisions. But his ultimate approval was not seen as in doubt in a conservative country where anti-LGBTQ attitudes have hardened in recent years, in part due to campaigning by Western evangelical church groups.",
    "Uganda receives billions of dollars in foreign aid each year and could now face adverse measures from donors and investors, as happened with a similar bill nine years ago.",
    "The bill\u2019s sponsor, Asuman Basalirwa, told reporters that parliament speaker Anita Among\u2019s U.S. visa was cancelled after the law was signed. Among and the U.S. embassy in Uganda did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
    "In a joint statement, the U.S.\u2019s flagship HIV/AIDS programme PEPFAR, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) said the law put Uganda\u2019s anti-HIV fight \u201cin grave jeopardy\u201d.",
    "Dominic Arnall, chief executive of Open For Business, a coalition of companies that includes Google (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), said the group was deeply disappointed and the law ran counter to Ugandans\u2019 economic interests.",
    "Uganda\u2019s move could encourage lawmakers in neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania seeking similar measures.",
    "\u201cWhat a leader we\u2019ve in Africa!\u201d tweeted George Kaluma, a Kenyan member of parliament who submitted an anti-LGBTQ bill in April.",
    "\u201cKenya is following you in this endeavour to save humanity.\u201d",
    "The inclusion of the death penalty for offences like transmitting HIV has drawn particular outrage internationally.",
    "Existing Ugandan law calls for a maximum 10-year sentence for intentionally transmitting HIV and does not apply when the person who contracted the infection was aware of their sexual partner\u2019s HIV status.",
    "By contrast, the new law makes no distinction between intentional and unintentional transmission and contains no exception based on awareness of HIV status.",
    "The amended version of the bill, adopted earlier this month after Museveni returned it to parliament, stipulated that merely identifying as LGBTQ is not a crime and revised a measure that obliged people to report homosexual activity to only require reporting when a child is involved.",
    "LGBTQ Ugandans called those changes useless, saying law enforcement regularly exceeds its legal authorities to harass them. They said passage of the bill in March unleashed a wave of arrests, evictions and mob attacks.",
    "A less restrictive 2014 anti-LGBTQ law was struck down by a Ugandan court on procedural grounds, after Western governments had initially suspended some aid, imposed visa restrictions and curtailed security cooperation.",
    "In 2009, a bill dubbed \u201ckill the gays\u201d for initially proposing executing homosexuals was introduced after a conference in Kampala drew representatives from the United States including prominent anti-gay evangelical Scott Lively.",
    "As well as religious campaigning, Africa\u2019s anti-LGBTQ attitudes also have their roots in the colonial era, including an anti-sodomy section of Britain\u2019s penal code. By the time the UK legalised same-sex acts in 1967, many former colonies were independent and did not inherit the legal change.",
    "\u201cTo reduce any kind of human being, irrespective of their sexuality, to a death sentence based on who they identify as and how they choose to live their lives is something that we should all feel very ashamed about as a continent,\u201d said South African filmmaker Lerato."
