    "Undoubtedly, children, particularly from low-income families, have borne the most significant hardships due to the unprecedented economic crisis that has beset our country. The single biggest challenge has been the skyrocketing food prices of even essentials, resulting in many families adopting coping strategies from reducing the number of meals consumed to eating less preferred meals lacking nutrition. As a result, the impact on schoolchildren has been a double whammy from constant hunger to skipping school, thus impacting their education.",
    "The WFP situation report in October 2022 said, \u201d Even before the economic crisis and the pandemic, malnutrition rates across Sri Lanka were already high. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Sri Lankan women and children suffered from far higher rates of malnutrition than most other middle-income countries:\u00a017 per cent\u00a0of children aged under five were too short because of stunting, and\u00a015 per cent\u00a0were too thin for their height (wasted). The current economic crisis will likely aggravate this further.\u201d",
    "However, the statement made in September 2022 by the SLPP Anuradhapura District Parliamentarian K.P.S Kumarasiri in parliament that he had received reports of instances where 20 students fainted in three schools at the Vilachchiya Divisional Secretariat division caused a media storm and highlighted the problem. He went on to name the schools where the fainting of the students had occurred. He also highlighted media reports of a student bringing coconut kernels as her midday meal to the school in Minuwangoda.",
    "True to form, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said he was unaware of such incidents in Vilachchiya. However, he assured that he would look into the matter and denied the occurrence in Minuwangoda. Chief Governmen Whip Prassana Ranatunga, also got into the act by saying that Minuwangoga was his electorate. Having inquired from the principal about the media reports, Ranatunga attributed them to lies fabricated to instigate people!",
    "The government reacted to continued social media posts citing incidents of schoolchildren fainting by extending a ban on public servants speaking to journalists to include social media posts. In addition, the order said, \u201cExpressing opinions on social media by a public officer shall constitute an offense that leads to disciplinary action.\u201d This was after certain provincial health officials, and teachers claimed students were fainting in schools because of a lack of food. The government also suspended the former Hambantota Regional Director of Health, Dr Chamal Sanjeewa, charging him with \u201ccausing inconvenience to the government\u201d by presenting \u201cfalse\u201d information to a media briefing about child malnutrition in Sri Lanka. One hopes that he has now been reinstated and an apology tendered to him.",
    "Why the government denied the existence of the problem is a mystery because several months before that, the World Food Programme (WFP), the world\u2019s largest humanitarian organization, stated in a release, \u201cAn estimated 4.9 million people\u00a0\u2013 22 per cent of the population \u2013 are currently food-insecure and require humanitarian assistance. Reduced domestic agricultural production,\u00a0scarcity of foreign exchange reserves and\u00a0depreciation of the local currency\u00a0have caused food shortages and a spike in the cost of living, limiting people\u2019s access to healthy and affordable meals. The economic crisis will push families into hunger and poverty \u2013 some for the first time \u2013 adding to the\u00a0half a million\u00a0people who the World Bank estimates have fallen below the poverty line because of the pandemic. The latest WFP assessment reveals that\u00a086 per cent\u00a0of families are buying cheaper, less nutritious food, eating less and, in some cases, skipping meals altogether.",
    "Similarly, in its 2022 report, UNICEF said, \u201cChildren are disproportionately affected by the rapidly unfolding economic crisis in Sri Lanka. Rising food and fuel prices, frequent power cuts, and shortages of life-saving medicines are particularly impacting the poorest and most marginalized. More than 5.7 million people, including 2.3 million children, require humanitarian assistance. Sri Lanka is among the top ten countries with the highest number of malnourished children, and the numbers are expected to rise further.\u201d",
    "Save the Children Sri Lanka released in March 2023 their \u201cRapid Needs Assessment Report \u2013 Phase 2,\u201d a comprehensive report based on a country-wide survey done in December 2022. Some of the critical findings were:",
    "Food was a significant contributor to household expenses, which increased by five percent from 44% in June 2022 to 49% in December 2022.",
    "33% of households reported they still cannot meet their food needs.",
    "30% of households could not provide adequate nutritious food for their children, and six percent could not provide any nutritious food.",
    "50% of households have reduced the quantity of food consumed",
    "27% of households have reduced the frequency of food intake (three times to twice or once)",
    "Almost 90% of households adopted some coping strategy to meet their daily food demand. The most cited report of coping strategies adopted was relying on less preferred and less expensive food.",
    "The manual on the School Nutrition Program published in 2020 by the Ministry of Education states, \u201cMany surveys reveal that school-going children\u2019s physical, physiological and nutritional status directly or indirectly impacts the students\u2019 attendance, participation in learning and performances. Therefore, improving the nutritional level of children of school-going age is essential\u201d.",
    "I reached out to Dr B. J. C. Perera, Specialist Consultant Paediatrician, for his observations on the importance of nutrition for children. He sent me a short note \u201cIt is abundantly clear that optimal nutrition is of seminal importance for children and adolescents. Right from the time the baby is in the womb, where adequate nutrition for the foetus is provided by the mother, to the time after birth, where the golden elixir of mother\u2019s milk provides all necessary nutrients to the baby during the first six months of life on earth and then afterwards to the time during early and late childhood as well as adolescence where a well-balanced diet provides adequate nutrition, the young ones of our land are totally dependent on the parents for the provision of optimal nourishment. All essential nutrients such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals have to be provided for children and adolescents for physical and mental growth. Physical growth in stature leading to satisfactory weight gain and an increase in height depends to a great extent on the provision of adequate food.",
    "On the other hand, the inadequacy of essential nutrients leads to a reduction in height or stunting and poor weight gain, leading to different types of malnutrition states. Moreover, the inadequacy of certain essential nutrients leads to the development of well-documented diseases and increases the susceptibility of malnourished children to catch various infectious diseases. Many believe that the inadequacy of food leads only to disturbances in physical growth. However, it must be pointed out that optimal nutrition is also crucial for cognitive and mental development. There is accumulating evidence from research studies that inadequate nutrition has significant effects on intelligence as well as the proper development of all types of mental skills\u201d.",
    "The Sri Lankan government has funded a school meal programme for several decades. According to the Ministry of Education manual on school nutrition, in 2017, a total of 1,105,605 students of 7,871 schools benefited from the meal programme while 112,088 students of 414 schools benefited from the programme of providing fresh milk.\u201d But unfortunately, one of the economic crisis\u2019s consequences was the reduction in the 2022 budget allocated for the school meal programme. Nevertheless, according to recent media reports, the cabinet has approved a proposal by the President to extend the school meal program to benefit an additional one million students, resulting in nearly 50% of school children benefiting from the program.",
    "Several international organizations have come forward to help with the school meal program. For example, the October 2022 WFP report stated that 556,929 schoolchildren had received school meals prepared with rice supported by WFP. In addition, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and in partnership with Save the Children, the United States donated 3,000 tons of food to nourish school children across Sri Lanka. The U.S. Ambassador Julie Chang said, \u201cThis donation from the American people targets the most vulnerable Sri Lankans \u2013 children \u2013 and enables them to focus on their schooling rather than on their hunger.\u201d Furthermore, UNICEF was planning to raise U.S. $ 28.3 million for various initiatives in the country, including providing nutrition to children.",
    "The\u00a0Chinese government\u00a0donated 8,862,990 metres of cloth to the Education Ministry as\u00a0school uniform material\u00a0for the 2023 academic year. The donation amounts to 70% of the country\u2019s school uniform material required for this year.",
    "Several charitable organizations and corporates have also gotten involved in supporting the school\u2019s meal program. For example, my former employer, the John Keells group, has taken 12 schools and seven preschools under their wing, supporting 2,415 children with daily meals under their \u201cPasal Diriya\u201d program. The supermarket arm of the group is also supporting an initiative to feed 1,000 preschool kids aged between 2.5 and five years for over six months. The customers of Keells Super primarily fund this program contributing 80% of the cost and the company the balance. I have also read media reports of a donor-funded project called \u201d Rise Up School Meals\u201d, supporting 12,000+ children in 81 schools with meals and a glass of milk. The Roshan Mahanama Trust of the former Sri Lankan cricketer too is doing excellent service helping children with school books, among many other initiatives. No doubt, many other organizations and charities are doing their bit.",
    "In addition, in a personal capacity, many assist with meals and purchasing school books, bags and shoes for school children individually or as a group coordinating with school principals and teachers.",
    "All these initiatives are genuinely commendable, and no doubt go some way towards helping children, particularly from low-income families. The smile that you get from a child after providing a wholesome meal is indeed something that will make one happy and fulfilled. However, whilst international organizations, corporates, charitable organizations, and well-intentioned individuals can support the initiative to feed a child for some time, the primary responsibility lies with the government.",
    "Therefore, it is incumbent on the government to allocate the necessary funds and ensure the program\u2019s success. It should not remain only a slogan. UNICEF, in their release, stated, \u201d In tackling the current crisis in Sri Lanka, put children first. As the situation evolves, Government efforts must include closely monitoring the impact on Sri Lanka\u2019s youngest citizens\u2014the future of the country, but currently the most vulnerable.\u201d No one can disagree with that.",
