    "National People's Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today they would win the battle to obtain the Local government election by hook or by crook for the betterment of the people.",
    "He told a protest rally at Lipton Circus in Colombo today that their battle to force the government to hold the LG polls could not be turned back by firing tear gas or water cannons.",
    "\"We will win this battle for the sake of the people who are dying without medicine, youth who are without jobs, farmers, fishing community and the working people who are suffering. We will win this battle to create a country free of corruption, drugs and looting public money and to create a lawful country. This is the responsibility of the generation. We will win this struggle by hook or by crook ,\" he said.",
    "He requested all the professionals, security forces, farmers, fisherfolk and Woking people to rally round the NPP to ensure that their democratic right is obtained.",
    "He said the government was plotting to postpone the LG polls as they are perturbed and frightened by the massive people's force joining with the NPP to eliminate the family rule in the country.",
    "\"The power was exchanged among a few families in Sri Lanka so far. For the first time in the country, people have come foward to form a government of the down-trodden people. That is why, they are so perturbed. If the power was to transit beween Rajapaksa's, Wickremesinghe's and Premadasa's, they will never postpone the election in this manner,\" he said.",
    "Dissanayake said Ranil Wickremesinghe would not be able to suppress the people's force by postponing the election by a month or so and added that more and more will keep joining the NPP. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
