    "More than 20 rivers have burst their banks in Italy, leaving 13 people dead and forcing thousands from their homes after six months\u2019 rainfall fell in a day and a half.",

    "Her home of Botteghino di Zocca, south of Bologna, was hit by a torrent on Wednesday. Streets, houses and gardens were inundated and Roberta said she was still scared.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that here. We were stuck and didn\u2019t know what to do. I just hope it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",

    "\u201cOur community is broken,\u201d said Roberta\u2019s daughter, Ines, who runs the local cafe in the central square. \u201cWe felt completely cut out, isolated, some of us were truly terrified.\u201d",

Already, the world has warmed about 1.1C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will continue to rise unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.",
