    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition party the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) appears to have all but sided with President Ranil Wickremesinghe in a standoff with protesting teachers with the party taking a position against trade union action that \u201cholds children\u2019s future to ransom\u201d.",
    "SJB parliamentarian Nalin Bandara told reporters in Colombo on Thursday April 20 that teachers can resort to alternative forms of agitation to win their demands.",
    "\u201cWe are against trade union action when it comes to marking papers. Unions may have their concerns, but union action must be taken without holding children\u2019s future to ransom. This is a serious situation.",
    "\u201cThese children have a lost a year or year and a half of their lives due to exam delays. This is unfair by the children who sat for their exams. Their goals are being delayed,\u201d said Bandara.",
    "President Wickremesinghe in a controversial statement made on Wednesday issued a one-week ultimatum to education sector trade unions who have been protesting against an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed tax hike. The union campaign has resulted in paper marking of students who sat for university entrance being delayed.",
    "A total of 331,709 candidates sat for the GCE Advanced Level exams held between January 23 and February 17, but the marking of examination answer scripts has yet to be commenced due to a protest campaign organised by the Federation of University Teachers\u2019 Associations (FUTA) together with a number of teachers\u2019 unions.",
    "The two-month delay has already seen the schedule for releasing results being disrupted, which has also delayed this year\u2019s exams.",
    "President Wickremsinghe at a meeting with Education Ministry officials on Wednesday warned that he would make education an essential service under emergency law and initiate legal action against teachers who did not comply with the law.",
    "\u201cAll those marked the papers last time, must be available for service now. If not, I will prosecute them and take their property also,\u201d Wickremesinghe told the officials.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t stop the education of children. What nonsense is this? By next week, I will tell the AG (Attorney General) to be ready with the emergency regulations.\u201d",
    "Under emergency regulations, the country\u2019s normal laws would not be applied, with the security forces given wide powers.",
    "While the SJB has not indicated that it supports the call for making education an essential service or for using emergency regulations, MP Bandara\u2019s remark that they do not support the teachers\u2019 chosen course of action is a notable departure from the party\u2019s sustained opposition to President Wickremesinghe since his appointment in July last year.",
    "\u201cWe request teachers and university lecturers not to use this as part of their trade union action. That is the SJB\u2019s position., because our children is more valuable us. Trade union actions must be fair.",
    "\u201cThe government too must not be lazy and come to a middle ground and resolve this issue quickly,\u201d he said.",
    "Asked what choice trade unions are left with, Bandara said: \u201cThere are many alternative courses of action they can take. Exam paper marking is a sensitive matter. We as the SJB don\u2019t approve of this game being played our youth. There are other forms of agitation they can take. Resort to those.\u201d",
    "The MP was almost echoing Wickremesinghe, the leader of the United National Party (UNP), which the SJB broke off from in 2020, when he said teachers\u2019 unions should not hold children\u2019s future to ransom.",
    "Wickremesinghe said at Wednesday\u2019s meeting: \u201cTell them if you don\u2019t come and want to have a confrontation, we are willing to come for a confrontation, but no one is going to hold the education of the children hostage.\u201d (Colombo/Apr20/2023)"
