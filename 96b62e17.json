    "Declares Presidential election can only be held if a proposal receives two-thirds majority approval in Parliament",
    "Claims successor President cannot call for Presidential election at the lapse of four years",
    "Says Govt. is unstable as it has not won the trust of people",
    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress member Prof. G.L. Peiris says the Government will have to hold the local Government polls prior to conducting a presidential election. Addressing a press conference at the party Head Office yesterday, Peiris said under the existing legal provisions, the opportunity for a presidential election will only occur between 18 September - 18 October 2024. \u201cThere is no room for a presidential election to be held this year or early next year under the current law,\u201d he said. The MP said a successor president cannot call a presidential election after four years and will need a two-thirds majority in Parliament to do so. \u201cOne cannot change the constitution for narrow political gains. One must seek the public approval to make such changes,\u201d he said.",
    "Peiris said the current \u2018dictatorial\u2019 Government facing intense displeasure from the people is attempting to suppress democracy. Peiris said the Government is unstable and is far removed from the people of the country. \u201cFor a country to be stable there must be a close relationship between the Government and the people. The Government must win the trust of the people. The current Government has failed in this task,\u201d he said. According to the MP, the current Government is in fear of the people. \u201cAny such Government is an unstable Government,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWhy do I say they are afraid of the people? They have not held polls for over four years because they are scared, and they are aware of what the people\u2019s response will be. Today no one knows when the election will be held,\u201d he noted. The MP also claimed that the current Election Commission of Sri Lanka (ECSL) today only exists by name. \u201cIt serves no purpose as it is unable to declare a date for polls and conduct it on the date as scheduled,\u201d he said.",
    "He also accused the Government of using the proposed Anti-Terrorism Act to suppress the media. \u201cIt will quash media freedom,\u201d he said. Commenting on the Government\u2019s agreement with the IMF, Peiris said there has been no transparency in the discussions and proposals. Noting that the IMF agreement is to be tabled in Parliament, Peiris said it has not been translated into Sinhalese and Tamil yet either. Peiris said no MP from the Freedom People\u2019s Congress will support the IMF agreement in Parliament."
