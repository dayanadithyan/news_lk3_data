    "Foreign Media confirmed that a gunman shot and killed nine people at a mall in Allen, north of Dallas, Texas. Eyewitnesses described the shooter as firing indiscriminately at passers-by, leading to the evacuation of hundreds from the mall. Police reported that they shot the gunman dead and believed he acted alone. Some of the victims were children, and at least seven people are being treated in the hospital, with three in critical condition.",
    "Governor Greg Abbott of Texas called the shooting an \"unspeakable tragedy\" and offered to provide any assistance necessary to local authorities.
