    "According to reports coming my way, it was a commendable effort and it turned out to be an enjoyable evening for all those present at this \u2018sold out\u2019 event.",
    "There is now a strong possibility that we, too, would soon be seeing Melantha as a solo artiste, provided he has time on his hands, as this multi-talented artiste is involved in several other projects.",

    "Melantha indicated that he plans to tie up with a few music teachers, Down Under, so that they could operate the outlets concerned, in Sydney and Melbourne,",
    "\u201cI would then be in a position to be in touch with them, on a regular basis, giving them my expertise\u201d, added Melantha.",
    "His learning application, MelaNota, is now reaching out to the blind, as well.",
    "Says Melantha: \u201cMelaNota is not only for you and I, who could read music, but for the visually impaired, too.\u201d",
    "He went on to say that he met up with a few school principals and had a meeting with the head of the institution \u2018Next Sense\u2019.",
    "\u201cDuring the meeting, lots of questions were answered and one person wanted to experience it. So I asked her to get a guitar and she played an easy melody, within two minutes, with the notation system that I\u2019d invented\u201d.",
    "Melantha is now looking forward to launching MelaNota in Australia, and across the globe, as well.",
    "Referring to Desmond de Silva\u2019s tribute concert, he said it was a great success, adding that had worked on a song with the late Desmond and Sunil Perea, who are no more with us, and that it was video recorded and completed, in 2019, and yet to be released.",
    "\u201cRotarian Delwyn Pereira has taken the initiative to launch it when I\u2019m back from my Aussie tour and I\u2019m enthusiastically looking forward to it\u201d.",
