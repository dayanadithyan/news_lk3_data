    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Vadivel Suresh who is on a collision course with the party is to decide on his political fate tomorrow after meeting a representative of President Ranil Wickremesinghe and also Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa.",
    "Mr. Suresh told the Daily Mirror he will be attending two meetings tomorrow, one with a representative of the President and the other with Mr. Premadasa.",
    "\u201dI was approached by both leaders after I made some critical comments on the SJB leadership and the government. I am fed up as the Opposition Leader has completely neglected the estate sector people and did not even tender an apology for not attending a meeting which was organized at Madulsima Estate one-and-a-half months ago. Also the government has done nothing to ensure that a daily wage of Rs. 1000 is paid for the estate sector workers. Both leaders have approached me after I made the critical comments. I will attend both meetings and then decide on my fate,\u201d he said.",
    "Earlier, Suresh said he will leave the SJB if the Opposition Leader fails to tender an apology for not attending the meeting one-and-a-half months ago in Badulla.",
    "Meanwhile, SJB National Organizer Tissa Attanayake told a press conference that a separate May Day rally was allowed as there was a request for such a rally for the estate community in the hills.",
    "\u201cWe allowed a separate rally as there was a demand for such a rally in Badulla. I have also attended some party meetings in Badulla and there were some negative comments. However, we can assure that this issue will not lead to a division of the SJB,\u201d he said.(Yohan Perera)"
