    "Matheesha Pathirana took 3 for 37 to help Chennai Super Kings to a 27-run win over the Delhi Capitals on Wednesday.",
    "The win meant Chennai extended its gap over third place Mumbai Indians to three points, though having played one more game.",
    "Gujarat, who have eight wins in 11 matches, are still atop the table.",
    "Chasing a target of 168 to win, Delhi were restricted to 140 for 8 in their 20 overs, Pathirana breaking a dangerous 59-run partnership between Manish Pandey and Rilee Rossouw in his first over.",
    "The chase derailed from there, with Pathirana taking the wickets of Axar Patel and Lalit Yadav, though his four overs cost more than nine runs an over.",
    "For Chennai, a handful of 20s helped them reach 167 for 8 in their 20 overs, while all-rounder Mitchell Marsh took 3 for 18 for the Capitals."
