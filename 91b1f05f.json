    "My happiest moment is that moment when my parents teared up with joy after I called them, from Malaysia, after winning Man Of The Globe International Charity 2022. Seeing my parents crying out of joy was the happiest moment, more than winning the title.",
    "It doesn\u2019t matter what you do in life as long as it makes you happy. For example, I was born in Kuwait, living a lavish life, a great job and an awesome salary, but I was still unhappy and that\u2019s because I wasn\u2019t doing what I wanted to.",

    "There no points looking beautiful if you can\u2019t keep up a conversation, so \u201ccommunication\u201d comes first for me; a woman who respects and loves my parents; loyalty and understanding; her voice should be attractive, and she doesn\u2019t have to be someone in the same field I\u2019m in, as long as she trusts me and respects the work I do.",
    "My mom and dad are my role models, because the man I\u2019m today is because of them. They went through a lot in life to raise me and my siblings.",
    "My piano, my first and only friend that was there for me, to make my day. I was a bullied kid in school, until Grade 10, so playing the piano was the only thing that kept me going, and made me happy.",
    "12. If you were marooned on a desert island, who would you like as your companion?",
