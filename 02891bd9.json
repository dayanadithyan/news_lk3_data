    "Leader of the House Susil Premajaynatha, on behalf of the government, proposed that the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) should be asked to carry out a special probe on the import of organic fertilizer from China and Nano Nitrogen from India from which the country has lost more than Rs. 08 billion.",
    "Mr. Premajayantha made this proposal when the opposition questioned on the failure to probe into this issue.",
    "\u201cWe are not blaming China and India for this scam as only those from\u00a0 Sri Lanka are involved in it. Sri Lanka has lost Rs. 2.5 billion from imports. A payment has been made for this consignment but Sri Lanka has not received a proper stock of organic fertilizer,\u201d Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said.",
    "Mr. Premadasa questioned why there are no audit reports on the problematic transactions.",
    "MP Dayasiri Jaysekera said a minister in the Hambantota District is involved in the scam pertaining to organic fertilizer which was said to be imported from China.",
    "Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapaksa who was on the Chair said it is not possible to carry out a probe overnight and penalise those who are responsible.",
    "\u201cA probe will take time so one has to be patient,\u201d he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
