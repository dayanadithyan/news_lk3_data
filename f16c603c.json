  "original_body_lines": [
    "Demands IGP to ensure Peiris\u2019s professional duties are not hindered and safety assured",
    "Says Peiris was only conducting his professional duties as a lawyer in representing a particular client",
    "Family members of victims of drug kingpin Harak Kata say it is unjustifiable for outgoing BASL Chief to represent him in court",
    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has written to IGP C.D. Wickramaratne demanding that he takes action to ensure that the professional duties of its outgoing President Saliya Peiris PC are not hindered in any way.",
    "The professional body also asked the Police Chief to ensure the senior lawyer\u2019s safety.",
    "The BASL\u2019s communique with the request comes after a protest was held against Peiris for representing underworld drug kingpin Nadun Chinthaka alias Harak Kata\u2019s father in courts recently. \u201cWe are of the view that the said protest seriously hinders his right to represent a client, a professional right which has been safeguarded by law,\u201d the BASL said. It said Pieris was only conducting his professional duties with regard to a particular client.",
    "On 20 March Peiris representing the underworld figure\u2019s father filed a writ petition on his behalf seeking an order directing the authorities to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of the detainee in accordance with the law. This representation has since been under fire on various social media platforms and political circles including the Parliament recently while the legal fraternity was seen standing up for Peiris\u2019s right to represent any client who wishes to obtain his services.",
    "The protest referred to in the letter was held outside Peiris\u2019s law chambers in Rajagiriya yesterday by those claiming to be family members of Harak Kata\u2019s victims.",
    "The protestors claimed that Harak Kata murdered their relatives and that justice had not yet been delivered to them by the Police or the courts. Therefore they said it is unjustifiable for the BASL Chief to represent him in court.",
    "Harak Kata, believed to be a drug kingpin was repatriated from Madagascar to Sri Lanka after which he was arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department at the Bandaranaike International Airport. He is currently being held in detention for questioning regarding several criminal cases. Harak Kata was wanted by Sri Lanka Police for his involvement in five murders, six robberies and transnational drug trafficking."
