    "The government of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa actually decided to go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for financial assistance, but an invisible force prevented the move, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry told Parliament.",
    "\u201cEveryone in the former President\u2019s cabinet agreed to go to the IMF except MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara. However, an invisible force prevented us. This is why there was a delay in seeking IMF assistance,\u201d the minister said.",
    "\u201cThe IMF is like a doctor. It prescribes medicine, recommends a diet and provides other advice. We have sought IMF advice, but that does not mean we are following all the advice provided by the IMF,\u201d he added.(Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
