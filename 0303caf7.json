    "A discussion was held yesterday regarding the distribution of this fuel under the patronage of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and officials from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) as well as the Agricultural Development Department.",
    "The Chinese government had donated 6.98 million liters of diesel free of charge to the farmers who cultivate paddy in the country.",
    "However, the distribution of the fuel to the farmers was delayed due to several administrative issues. The minister instructed the ministry officials and the Agrarian Development Department to take steps to arrange for the free distribution of fuel from the received fuel to the farmers immediately.",
    "The farmers who cultivated paddy on half-an-acre to two and-a-half acres are entitled to this fuel concession. 15 liters of diesel will be issued per one hectare.",
    "Once the fuel is issued, the token card will be nullified. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
