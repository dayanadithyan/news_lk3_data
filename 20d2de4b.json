    "The bowling coach Chaminda Vaas spoke about the team's strategy for acquiring a good bowling unit, \"We have seen over the years that local players make a big difference in franchise cricket. We have shortlisted a few names that we would like to acquire in the Auction. It will be about constructing a well-balanced bowling unit and hopefully, we will be able to do so in the Auction.\"",
    "\"The auction is always tricky. We have to stay calm and composed. We will set budgets for each player we want to go for and stay within the budget. We will look for superstars, but our main interest will be young local talents,\" the team's assistant coach Jerome Jayaratne was quoted as saying.",
    "The owner of the Colombo Strikers, Sagar Khanna also spoke about the LPL Auction, \"In order to get off the mark on a strong note, we have to be on the money in the Auction. We have a good set of coaches and analysts in our team and our franchise is preparing really well for the auction.\"",
