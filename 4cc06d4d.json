    "Dasis Manchanayake became the first Royal College captain in 27 years to score a century at a Royal-Thomian encounter, as he continued to frustrate the S. Thomas' College bowlers on the first day of the 144th Battle of the Blues.",
    "Royal College were comfortably placed 240 for 4 after 57 overs, midway through the third session, with Manchanayake and Ramiru Perera extending their fifth wicket parntnership to 173.",
    "Machanayake reached the three-figure mark with his 11th boundary, getting there after facing just 120 deliveries.",
    "The frustration continued for S. Thomas' College who had had the Royalists on 83 for 4 at lunch but have since gone wicketless with Manchanayake holding strong after his team were reduced to 19 for 3 in the first hour of play.",
    "Akash Fernando struck in the first over of the day, finding the edge of Rehan Pieris, caught down the leg side for four, before Nathan Caldera accounted for the key wicket of Sineth Jayawardena, three overs later.",
    "The Royalists lost a third wicket when a mistimed heave off Kavindu Dias' first ball was caught by Caldera, and were reduced to 19 for 3.",
    "A 44-run partnership between Manchanayake and Ovina Ambanpola ensued, as Royal staged a recovery of sorts, before Ambanpola was bowled by Fernando for 30.",
    "From there however, Manchanayake slowly took the initiative away from the Thomains, looking largely comfortable in his partnershup with Perera.",
    "Royal College 240 for 4 (Dasis Manchanayake 111*, Ramiru Perera 80*)"
