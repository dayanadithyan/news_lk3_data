    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Foreign Minister Ali Sabry summoned the Canadian envoy to the Ministry on Friday and condemned the statement issued by the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a day before, the Foreign Ministry said.",
    "Prime Minister Trudeau said tens of thousands of Tamils lost their lives, including at the massacre in Mullivaikal, with many more missing, injured, or displaced and explained the reasons for the Canadian Parliament adopting the motion to make May 18 \u201cTamil Genocide Remembrance Day\u201d.",
    "\u201cMinister Sabry stated that the politically motivated statement was divisive and was issued for domestic political consumption in Canada,\u201d the Ministry said in a statement.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka vehemently rejects this unsubstantiated allegation of \u2018genocide\u2019 relating to the country\u2019s almost 3 decades of terrorist conflict perpetuated by the LTTE,\u201d it said referring to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).",
    "\u201cHe observed that the inaccurate and provocative allegations in the statement will lead to polarizing Sri Lankans at this particular juncture when the Government is working towards economic stability, peace and reconciliation for all.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s successive governments have rejected the alleged war crimes and deliberately targeted unarmed civilians in the final phase of the 26-year war. Sri Lankan government forces have been alleged of indiscriminately killing civilians, mainly ethnic minority Tamils in a no fire zone the government announced earlier.",
    "Minister Sabry emphasized that arbitrary and erroneous use of \u2018genocide\u2019 on Sri Lanka is driven by a small section of the politically motivated anti-Sri Lanka elements in the Diaspora with a separatist agenda.",
    "\u201cAs a long-standing bilateral partner, Sri Lanka would urge the co-operation of the Canadian Government and encourage a mutually supportive relationship between the two countries, whilst constructively engaging the community of Sri Lankan heritage in Canada to work towards realizing our common objectives of inclusive development and sustainable peace.\u201d (Colombo/May 20/2023)"
