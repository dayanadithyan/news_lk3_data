    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Muslims in Sri Lanka\u2019s central town of Akurana started checking devotees who came for mosques from Tuesday (18) after top police officials had informed them to beef up security due to an unverified information of a possible attack to Islamic religious places during the prayers in the holy month of Ramzan, officials and people in Akurana said.",
    "Police officials at a meeting with the mosque committees in Akurana have said they have got information on possible attacks on mosques in Akurana. The Police Spokesman was not immediately available for comment.",

    "\u201cThe police told that they could assist in the security at the Akurana town area and requested mosque committees to help them at individual mosques to ensure the security. So mosque committees have come up with some recommendations.\u201d",
    "Two other sources said the recommendations include body check on both men and women devotees.",
    "\u201cThis could be a conspiracy theory by anyone. But when government officials who are in charge of law and order tell us we\u00a0can\u2019t neglect,\u201d one of the two sources said.",
    "\u201cIt could be due to high businesses in the town or some differences in ideologies of the people.\u201d",

    "The latest threats come before the 4th year anniversary of Easter Sunday attack on Friday (21). (Colombo/April19/2023)"
