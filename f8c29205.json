    "Daglo has said the coup was a mistake that failed to bring about change and reinvigorated remnants of Bashir\u2019s regime ousted by the army in 2019 following mass protests.",
    "Burhan, who rose through the ranks under Bashir\u2019s three-decade rule, maintained the coup was necessary to bring more groups into the political process. \u2014 AFP"
