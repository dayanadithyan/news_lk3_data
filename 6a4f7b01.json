    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Chairman Janaka Ratnayake promised to withdraw a court case against the recent tariff hike if the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) provides immediate tariff reliefs that will pass on the benefits of rupee appreciation and fuel price reduction to the public.",
    "\u201cThe CEB should reduce 50 percent of the 65 percent tariff hike that was implemented in mid-February this year,\u201d Ratnayaka told EconomyNext on Monday April 03.",
    "\u201cWith the rupee appreciating about 15 percent or around 40 rupees, fuel price reducing in the international market, and the world coal price dropping to 130 US dollars from 240 dollars per metric ton, that benefit should go to the customers immediately.\u201d",
    "If that happens, then the court case that was filed against the illegal electricity tariff hike will be withdrawn, he said.",
    "In January 2023, the cabinet approved a proposal by the Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara for a tariff hike of 66 percent, which was sent to the PUCSL for approval.",
    "Even though the proposed tariff hike was rejected by the PUCSL, the regulator started public consultations and,\u00a0 upon review, a 35 percent tariff hike was approved.",
    "However, PUCSL members excluding Chairman Ratnayake later gave approval for a 66 percent increment mid-February.",
    "Ratnayake, who was abroad at the time, later filed a court case against the tariff hike, claiming the approval did not follow the procedure outlined in the PUCSL Act. On March 10, Ratnayake filed a fundamental rights application at the Supreme Court challenging the hike.",
    "The Court granted the respondents permission to file limited objections by April 20, and the petitioners to file counter-objections by April 28.",
    "\u201cThe tariff revision was to recover the cost, and now the diesel price has increased by 80 rupees, the rupee has appreciated, and the demand for electricity usage has also reduced,\u201d Ratnayake said.",
    "\u201cTherefore, that benefit should be given to the general public immediately.\u201d",
    "The tariff hike was proposed by the CEB, with the assumption of facing a drought season in 2023, which was also wrong due to the occasional rain the reservoir areas have been receiving, he said.",
    "\u201cLast year we did not have any rain in the months of March and April, and based on that, they assumed we would not have rain this year as well.\u201d",
    "Currently, one-third of the daily power supply is generated through renewable energy, mainly hydro. According to Ratnayake, the CEB is generating around 14 gigawatt hours (GWh) a day, up from the 8 GWh in January 2023.",
    "\u201cI asked to give permission to generate two more GWh during that time to provide electricity for students facing Advanced Level exams at that time, but it was rejected,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI asked them to generate 10 GWh per day at that time, they denied it, but now they are generating 14 GWH per day.\u201d",
    "\u201cThese vicious politicians concentrated on increasing the tariff, disregarding the future of the children,\u201d he added.",
    "Ratnayake said the public should not wait till the price revision in July as promised by Minister Kanchana and demand immediate relief, not allowing the government entity to make profits when prices and demand have decreased. (Colombo/April 03/2023)"
