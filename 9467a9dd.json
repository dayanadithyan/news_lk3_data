  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Police Crime Division requests people to refrain from entering parents' data when setting up e-mail accounts for school children and also to enter the correct age of the children.",
    "The officials said if parents' data were provided when using smart phones and setting up e-mail accounts, the children will have the opportunity to access any website.",
    "They said if the information including the correct age of the children is provided, the internet system itself will control the ability and access of the children to view inappropriate contents and websites.",
    "The officials issued these warnings when the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Reconciliation and National Unity met to discuss the programme to be carried out in collaboration with the National Reconciliation and Children's and Women Bureau.",
    "The officials of the Police Crime Division stressed upon the need to check whether the phone used by the child is approved by the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) as this will enable the tracking of phones used for any criminal acts.",
    "\"This means, when a SIM card is inserted into a mobile phone registered with the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC), the Commission receives the relevant information. Therefore, when buying mobile phones, make sure to buy such phones with the registration of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC),\" they said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
