  "original_body_lines": [
    "There is a possibility of reducing electricity tariffs by 27 per cent but the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has submitted a proposal to reduce the tariffs by only 3 per cent, concealing the correct cost data, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, (PUCSL) Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said.",
    "Addressing a media briefing yesterday, he said that CEB had informed to submit the corrected data to reduce the electricity tariffs on par with the actual cost reduction.",
    "\"Compared to the decrease in electricity demand, the cost of providing electricity should also decrease. The CEB initially estimated an expenditure of Rs.392 billion for the period from July to December 2023. But the CEB now says that Rs. 285 billion will be spent for the next six months. According to our calculation, the actual cost of electricity supply will be reduced by Rs.107 billion. If that is the case, the electricity tariff should be reduced by at least 27 per cent as a whole for the upcoming period. Otherwise, by reducing tariffs by 3 per cent only for a limited number of customer groups based on fake data, will not do the justice for all electricity consumers. Also, the CEB would not get the expected income.\" He said.",
    "\u201cThe electricity tariff was increased by 66 per cent February this year based on fake data. At that time, the tariff should have been increased by only 35 per cent. In the last tariff revision, we pointed out that the electricity demand of 16,550 gigawatts estimated by the CEB was incorrect. Our estimate was that electricity demand this year would be limited to 15,050 gigawatt hours. In April, CEB realized that our estimate was correct and that their demand was overestimated. Accordingly, they informed in writing that the estimated demand for the coming period of the year is 15,264-gigawatt hours,\u201d Mr Janaka Ratnayake, Chairman of Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka said.",
    "Ratnayake pointed out that if electricity tariffs were set and implemented according to his estimates, the situation electricity consumers are facing today would not have arisen.",
    "In a revision of electricity tariffs, all the proposals should be submitted in accordance to tariff methodology (equation) approved under the Sri Lanka Electricity Act. According to this methodology, only the reasonable cost of supplying electricity can be charged from the electricity consumer. Mr Ratnayake pointed out that contrary to the approved method, CEB is trying to implement the tariff revision proposal even this time, by including proposals to recover the loans received by CEB from the electricity consumers.",
    "\u201cAccording to the tariff methodology, all data should be submitted correctly. Only approved costs recoverable from the customer can be included in the total cost. But this proposal has not been submitted with the data approved under tariff methodology. In calculating charges based on cost, the charges should be adjusted in such a way as to recover the actual and minimum cost, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
