    "The decision to export 100,000 toque monkeys to China would depend on the decision taken by the committee appointed by the Agriculture Minister.",
    "Addressing the media after an event in Colombo, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said a group of Chinese representatives had submitted a request to the Agriculture Ministry to provide Sri Lankan Toque monkeys to Zoological Gardens in China.",
    "According to their written request, they have requested the said number of toque monkeys for 1,000 zoological gardens in China to fill them up within a year.",
    "\"Three discussion rounds were held with a group comprising the Wild Life Director General and the Zoological Garden Director General. A Cabinet Proposal will be made from the proposals taken by the committee,\" he said.",
    "\u201cHowever, the decision depends on the decision taken by the committee. China requested only 500 monkeys immediately in the first phase of the program,\u201d he said.",
    "\"We cannot capture that many monkeys in a short period. The capturing, protecting, and process of taking them to China is done by China,\" he said.",
    "\"We pointed out the damage done by these monkeys following a discussion with the environmental organizations. About 93 million coconuts had been destroyed by Toque macaques, monkeys, and giant squirrels during the first half of last year. Now the report says that 200 million coconuts are being destroyed within a year,\" the minister said.",
    "\"We requested proposals from the environmental organizations, but many organizations did not submit useful proposals. Most of the proposals were not practical,\" he said.",
    "\"Therefore, we have taken this decision as the best solution according to the international methods,\" the Minister added. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama and Indika Sri Aravinda)"
