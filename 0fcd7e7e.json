    "Isipathana College, the kings of schools rugby, continued their dominance as they lived upto expectations and added another trophy to their collection when they clinched the Under 19 Schools Rugby 7s title with a comfortable 19 points to 10 win over St. Peter\u2019s Colelge in the Cup final played at the Royal Sports Complex in Reid Avenue today.",
    "The green shirts meant business as they gave the Peterites some torrid moments jumping into the lead within three minutes of play and then followed it up with another try to lead 12-0.",
    "The Peterites who last week bagged the CR & FC centenary cup of the schools segment was nowhere near that performance.",
    "Even though the Peterites succeeded to plant two tries it was not going to be sufficient as Isipathana sealed the game with another try which was converted to bag the title.",
    "Meanwhile in the other segments Wesley ran circles around the hapless St. Sylvester\u2019s College side to record a convincing 31 points to nil win to emerge Shield champions while Thurstan got the better of Piliyandala Central by 24 points to 12 to bag the Bowl title.",
    "Vidyartha pulled off a close 21 points to 19 win over fancied D. S. Senanayake who in the recent past was an improved side to bag the Plate trophy.",
    "Shahid Zumri from the champion Isipathana team was adjudged the best player of the tournament.",
