    "The Petroleum Dealers\u2019 Association (PDA) today said there is a fuel shortage in the country after the recent fuel price reduction.",
    "The co-secretary of the association, Kapila Naotunna, told the Daily Mirror that most of the fuel filling stations have not placed their orders due to the price revision.",
    "\"Due to their not placing orders, the filling stations have not received fresh stocks and hence currently there is a shortage of both petrol and diesel. Several vehicle queues can be seen at filling stations now,\" Naotunna said.",
    "\"There is no fuel shortage in the country. The current fuel shortage is only man-made, and it will return to normal in Colombo and the suburbs by this evening and in other provinces by tomorrow,\" he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickarama)"
