    "The incident occurred on Sunday about 12 km northwest of their camp in Tessalit, in the Kidal region, Dujarric said. When the blast occurred, they were in an armored vehicle providing security for a logistics convoy.",
    "\u201cAbout 40 minutes after the incident, a search of the surrounding area discovered a second IED which was successfully detonated,\u201d he said. \u201cEarlier in the day, the mission had detonated another IED discovered some 23 km northwest of the Tessalit camp.\u201d",
    "The spokesman said the attack on the peacekeepers was indicative of the continuing violence in Mali.",
