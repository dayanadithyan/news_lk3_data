    "Freedom People\u2019s Congress member Dr. Nalaka Godahewa says the Government is attempting to enact laws to implement certain conditions put down by the IMF agreement including on domestic debt restructuring and to quell any opposition against them. Commenting on President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s recent announcement on bringing in such laws, \u201cIt is as if we are making a promise in blood\u201d he said adding that it gives rise to certain doubts if the agreement contains any conditions that would draw strong opposition.",
    "The MP said he believes a seminar held in March 2023 by the Central Bank Governor for investor\u2019s hints at such contentious provisions where the Governor revealed that the IMF has suggested domestic debt must also be restructured.",
    "\u201cThis is on average ten times more than the Government\u2019s annual revenue. This is the terrible news the Government has not given the country yet,\u201d he said. The MP said the creditors of this debt are the country\u2019s banks, Employee Provident Fund and the Employee Trust Fund.",
    "\u201cIn other words, this is the money of the people,\u201d he said. The MP warned that yet another crisis will be created as a result of this. \u201cTherefore the Government is now attempting to bring in laws to ensure there can be no opposition,\u201d he said. He assured his faction will oppose such legislation and educate the public about the attempts of the Government."
