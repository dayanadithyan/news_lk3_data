    "Credit card holders of Commercial Bank of Ceylon can now automate paying their monthly bills of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) and Lanka Electricity Company (LECO) and enjoy uninterrupted services, following the addition of these two utility companies to the Bank\u2019s Automatic Bill Settlement facility.",
    "Prior to the addition of SLT and LECO bills the Bank\u2019s credit card customers could automate their payments to four of the most subscribed utility service providers in the country \u2013 Dialog, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Mobitel and the National Water Supply & Drainage Board (NWSDB).",
    "The addition of SLT and LECO to the Automatic Bill Settlement facility further enhances the versatility of the service provided to customers and the convenience offered by Commercial Bank to its cardholders. The extension of this hassle-free facility to include more service providers enables customers to conveniently manage all their utility payments through a single Commercial Bank Card at any given time and helps them to adopt digital payment habits, the Bank said.",
    "To avail of this hassle-free bill payment facility, ComBank credit card holders simply have to enter their credit card details via the Bank\u2019s website, accept terms and conditions and register a designated card, just once, the Bank said. They can complete this seamless online registration process without having to visit a branch. After successful registration for the service, each utility or any other entity will present the customer\u2019s monthly bill amount to the bank and bank will authorise the payment on behalf of the credit card holder and send the receipt of payment to the customer via e-mail or SMS.",
    "Commercial Bank Card holders can register their Visa, Mastercard, UnionPay and LankaPay/JCB Credit Cards to use the Automatic Bill Settlement facility. The Bank has been offering this facility for the settlement of bills to other entities since 2017. Besides ensuring that bills are settled on time without any involvement from the customer, the Automatic Bill Settlement facility prevents accumulation of arrears due to unpaid bills, saves customers from delinquency fees and prevents disconnection of utility services due to delayed payments. Furthermore, customers can earn Max Loyalty Rewards points that can be redeemed later on at many reputed merchant outlets island-wide.",
