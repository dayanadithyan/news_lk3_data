    "The IMF staff team\u2019s visit comes days after the first meeting of Sri Lanka\u2019s official bilateral creditors committee, during which the island nation\u2019s authorities formally presented a request for debt treatment. China, Saudi Arabia and Iran were in attendance as observers.",
    "The committee, co-chaired by India, Japan and France, consists of 17 members and includes Paris Club creditors as well as other official bilateral creditors.",

    "Sri Lanka had to secure assurances from official bilateral creditors that they would help debt relief and/or financing to restore debt sustainability consistent with the IMF-supported EFF program, as well as an assessment that the authorities are making good faith efforts to reach a private agreement with private creditors.",
    "As these requirements were met ahead of the IMF Board meeting in March, the IMF approved the 48-month extended arrangement of 2.286 billion SDR (Special Drawing Rights), which amounts to USD 3 billion, for Sri Lanka.",
    "Sri Lankan authorities are now working closely with its creditors to coordinate and make swift progress towards the debt treatment that restores debt sustainability under the EFF program."
