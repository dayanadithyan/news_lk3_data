    "Deputy High Commissioner Jacob remarked that India-Sri Lanka relations are excellent and form the highlight of India's \u201cNeighbourhood First\u201d policy. While both countries are working to deepen engagement across the board, five areas are of particular significance in the immediate short and medium term. First is the potential for economic and financial cooperation by building on the Indian support to the people of Sri Lanka in 2022 to the tune of USD 4 billion. He emphasized that focus could be laid on areas such as trade in national currencies, ease of investments and strengthening financial cooperation. Second, the two sides are working towards increasing air, ferry, digital and energy connectivity. Third, a new type of development cooperation partnership building on the existing multi-billion portfolio with special emphasis on vulnerable communities is required. Fourth, both sides need to enhance people to people exchanges, particularly in tourist movements. Fifth, it is essential to strengthen the cultural, religious, music, movie and sporting links for mutual benefit."
