Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis fixed the case to be heard on May 2.",
    "On 27 May last year, Shashi Weerawansa was found guilty to the first case and she was sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 100,000 for obtaining two passports including a diplomatic passport by submitting forged documents to the Department of Immigration and Emigration.",
    "However, she was released on bail upon filing an appeal in the High Court challenging the judgment of the Magistrate's Court.",
