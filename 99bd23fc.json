    "The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka yesterday questioned the Government\u2019s failure to investigate the self-proclaimed Christian Prophet, Jerome Fernando following the startling revelations about foreign personalities connected to him in recent times.",
    "Speaking at a press conference, SIGNIS Former National Director Fr. Cyril Gamini Fernando said it was shocking that these allegations were not looked into by the authorities. \u201cWhy have the authorities not probed those who corrupt the minds of the people by promoting false religious beliefs?\u201d he asked.",
    "Fr. Cyril Gamini was referring to Jerome Fernando\u2019s connections to yet another self-proclaimed Prophet, Zimbabwean Uebert Angel who has been mired in many controversies over the years. Most recently an investigation carried out by Al Jazeera delved into Angel\u2019s connections to international gold smuggling and money laundering activities.",
    "Commenting on the incident, Fr. Cyril Gamini clarified that Jerome Fernando is neither a Catholic priest nor connected to the Catholic Church of Sri Lanka. He said Jerome Fernando\u2019s recent comments are a threat to religious harmony in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cWe believe that his comments would also taint the views of his followers concerning other religions. We cannot disregard the fact that these comments would threaten religious coexistence and unity and could even lead to communal disharmony as well,\u201d Fr. Cyril Gamini added.",
    "While accepting the freedom to follow a faith of one\u2019s choosing, Fr. Cyril Gamini however said it does not give one the right to make derogatory or controversial statements against another\u2019s religion. Fr. Cyril Gamini added that the Archdiocese of Colombo further requests the public to be vigilant of people instigating racial and religious tensions in the country.",
    "Jerome Fernando found himself in hot water this week after a sermon by him made controversial remarks about other religions, especially Buddhism and the Lord Buddha causing an uproar among Buddhists in the country.",
    "The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) has now commenced an investigation into Jerome Fernando on the orders of President Ranil Wickremesinghe after the matter was taken up at a national Security Council meeting held on Monday. Several Buddhist organisations and groups including the New Buddhist Front and the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya have also filed police complaints against him.",
    "Meanwhile it was reported that Jerome Fernando has left the country prior to being summoned by the CID. Separately the Fort Magistrate issued an\u00a0 overseas travel ban on Fernando.",
    "He is well known for his connections to powerful and prominent figures in Sri Lanka. His congregation has been growing over the years allowing Fernando to construct a mega church called \u2018Miracle Dome\u2019 in Katunayake."
