    "With cash gifting reaching a peak at the \u2018Avurudu\u2019 season, the Commercial Bank of Ceylon has launched a promotion to encourage children to save the cash they receive in the Bank\u2019s popular savings schemes for minors.",
    "The Bank has announced that all customers who open new \u2018Arunalu\u2019 Children\u2019s Savings Accounts or \u2018Isuru\u2019 Minors\u2019 Savings Plans in April and May 2023 will be presented with an eco-friendly till, to motivate them to save conveniently without having to visit a branch.",
    "Children and parents who sign up for either of these savings accounts between 1st April and 31st May with an initial deposit of Rs 1,000 or more will receive a durable till made out of metal instead of the customary plastic, the Bank said.",
    "The flagship children\u2019s savings account of Commercial Bank, \u2018Arunalu\u2019 offers a higher interest rate for Children\u2019s Savings Accounts and can be opened at any of Commercial Bank\u2019s branches with a minimum deposit of Rs 100.",
    "The Isuru Minors\u2019 Savings plan includes both a monthly deposit and a lump sum deposit scheme and guarantees amounts up to Rs 12 million upon the child reaching 18 years of age. Under the monthly deposit option, Isuru accounts may be opened for children who are between one day and ten years old, and parents may choose to save between Rs 500 and Rs 20,000 in multiples of Rs 500 a month, for five or ten years. Under the Isuru Lump Sum Deposit Scheme, parents can make single lump sum deposits starting from Rs 5,000.",
    "In the event of the unfortunate demise of the depositor during the agreed period of deposit, the Bank will deposit the balance amount and assure the payment of the guaranteed amount when the child turns 18 years.",

    "Additionally, Commercial Bank conducts an annual online art competition titled \u2018Arunalu Siththam\u2019 under the Arunalu banner for children between the ages of four and 16 country-wide, and has in the past three years rewarded hundreds of winners with millions of rupees in cash prizes and merit certificates.",
