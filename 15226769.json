    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013\u00a0 Sri Lankan government has included trousers and skirts as legally accepted dress codes in courts for female judges and Attorneys-at-Laws through a new gazette published last week while removing the initially permitted frocks from the list.",
    "According to the new gazette, lawyers and judges are now permitted to wear a saree and jacket in white, black, off-white, grey or mauve, black trouser or skirt with white blouse, black coat and shoes.",
    "The length of the trouser should be to the ankle and the length of the skirt should fall below the knee when seated, the gazette said.",
    "The new gazette came into effect on March 30, has rescinded the earlier gazette that approved the frock as an attire for lawyers.",
    "\u201cWhile the choice of saree and frock has been given prior to 2018, female lawyers did not wear the frock with the exception of Muslim counsels,\u201d Swastika Arulingam, an attorney-at-law told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cOn one occasion when a counsel did wear a dress, she was harassed by male colleagues.\u201d",
    "The frock, which was permitted to female attorneys since the 2018 gazette, is no longer mentioned as acceptable attire for female attorneys.",
    "\u201cIn addition to the new supreme court rule introducing skirts along with\u00a0 to pants and sarees, strict instructions have been provided on the length of the skirt,\u201dArulingam said.",
    "\u201cThe new rule not only inconveniences women including pregnant women who are opting for the dress, but also strictly polices women on the length of the attire.\u201d",
    "Officials from Bar Association of Sri Lanka were not immediately available for comments with regard to the amended law.",
    "It was also not immediately clear if Muslim women lawyers would be allowed to wear abaya, an attire similar to frock which covers the whole body except the head, feet, and hands.",
    "The change in dress codes for female attorneys echoed the discussion on the changing of dress codes for female teachers employed in government schools, but the proposal was later rejected by education minister Susil Premajayantha citing the new dress code is not suitable for Sri Lankan culture.
