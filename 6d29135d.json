    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The United States has blacklisted Sri Lanka\u2019s war-time Navy Commander Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda for alleged violations of human rights.",
    "A US State Department in a statement quoting Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday April 27 morning that his government is designating Karannagoda for \u201ca gross violation of human rights during his tenure as a Naval Commander\u201d.",
    "Consequently, both Karannagoda and his wife, Srimathi Ashoka Karannagoda, will be ineligible for entry into the US, according to the statement.",
    "\u201cThe allegation that Wasantha Karannagoda committed a gross human rights violation, documented by NGOs and independent investigations, is serious and credible.\u00a0 By designating Wasantha Karannagoda, the United States reaffirms its commitment to upholding human rights, ending impunity for human rights violators, acknowledging the suffering of victims and survivors, and promoting accountability for perpetrators in Sri Lanka,\u201d the State Department said.",
    "Karannagoda was appointed as Governor of the Northern Province by then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in December 2021.",
    "He served as Navy Commander in the final phase of the Sri Lankan government\u2019s war against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) and also served as Secretary to the Ministry of Transport following the end of the war.",
    "Karannagoda was a defendant in an alleged abduction case over the disappearance of 11 youths in Colombo in 2008 and 2009, but charges against him were dropped in October 2021. The Attorney General\u2019s Department that some month informed Sri Lanka\u2019s Court of Appeal that the charges against the former commander would not be taken forward.",
    "The US, as a member of the core group of countries on Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), has been pushing for accountability for alleged violations of human rights during the final phase of the Sri Lankan government\u2019s armed conflict with the separatist Tamil Tigers.",
    "The US has also been largely encouraging of Sri Lanka\u2019s reform efforts as part of the island nation\u2019s ongoing 17th programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "Analysts say US interest in Sri Lanka has grown over the years since the war, particularly in light of increased Chinese influence.",
    "\u201cThe bilateral relationship between the United States and the Government of Sri Lanka is based on 75 years of shared history, values, and a commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d the State Department said.",
    "\u201cAs we continue to build our bilateral relationship, we are committed to working with the Sri Lankan government on advancing justice, accountability, and reconciliation, including promoting security reform that maintains human rights at the forefront while ensuring Sri Lanka has the resources and training to properly address emerging security concerns,\u201d it said.
