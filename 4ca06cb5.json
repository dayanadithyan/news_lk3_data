    "After my grandson Master Mohamed Hazim Shiraz was interviewed by the teachers for year 1 admission, his application was rejected by the panel conducting the subsequent interview on the basis that the postal address in the deed is incorrect and hence awarded zero marks. I am disappointed or rather frustrated that the interview panel has intimated that they cannot appeal in this case but to get the amendments to the deed done so that there will not be any issue when it comes to future\u00a0 admission of his (Hazim\u2019s) siblings. By the way, his two siblings are two girls.",
    "The D.S. Senanayake College where he had to face an interview a few weeks back awarded 50 marks only for the identical set of documents because each and every document is in my daughter\u2019s name, being the owner of the house. A few other government schools also awarded 50 marks! for your information.",
    "When I contacted my lawyer, he clarified that what is in the deed is not the postal address but the Condominium unit number. Therefore, the basis of rejection by the school at the interview held last Friday 20th morning is flawed.",
    "It is common that in the case of flats in Colombo and a few other places, the houses have 2 different numbers. (which no doubt creates some confusion!) viz. Postal address as well as Assessment Number. Consequently, I D cards, the utility bills such as the electricity and water bills carry the Postal Address whereas the Deed and the Statutory Notice of Assessment has the Assessment number.",
    "I do not know how many students would have got disqualified on the above or similar basis but I kindly request the school authorities to award the marks due to them so they may qualify for admission."
