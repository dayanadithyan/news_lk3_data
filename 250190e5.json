    "Ryuichi Sakamoto, a distinguished Japanese composer and producer, whose pioneering electronic music experimentation won him worldwide acclaim, passed away at the age of 71. Sakamoto was a celebrated artist, whose accolades included an Oscar, a Grammy, and a Bafta for his exceptional work both as a solo artist and a member of the Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). Despite battling cancer for the second time in 2021, Sakamoto continued to inspire his audience with his artistry and creativity until his death on Tuesday, according to his office.",
    "In 1983, Sakamoto acted in the movie Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence alongside David Bowie. His film score for The Last Emperor, released in 1987, earned him an Oscar, a Grammy, and a Golden Globe. He also acted in the epic film that tells the story of Puyi, the last emperor of China.",
    "Sakamoto's passion for music began at the young age of 10 when he started studying composition and was inspired by the Beatles and Debussy. In 1978, he co-founded YMO with Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, playing the keyboard. Their synth-pop innovations went on to influence techno-pop and hip-hop.",
    "In a 2018 interview, Sakamoto expressed his ambition to challenge the conventions of Western musical composition, stating, \"When I write scores, my thinking is limited to the forms of Western composition, which I learned when I was a teen. But I always wanted to break it, break the wall, or limits I am trapped inside. Sometimes using electronics or blending with electronic sound can help to break this wall.\"",
    "Sakamoto was also renowned in Japan for his activism for environmental causes, especially following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown. His diverse collaborations included working with Brian Eno, Alva Noto, and cellist Jaques Morelenbaum.",
