    "South Asia is home to highest number of child brides in the world as increased financial pressures and school closures due to COVID-19 forced families to marry off their young daughters, according to new estimates released by UNICEF on Wednesday.",
    "There were 290 million child brides in the region, accounting for 45% of the global total, the children\u2019s agency of the United Nations said, calling for more efforts to end the practice.",
    "\u201cThe fact that South Asia has the highest child marriage burden in the world is nothing short of tragic,\u201d said Noala Skinner, UNICEF\u2019s regional director for South Asia, said in a statement.",
    "\u201cChild marriage locks girls out of learning, puts their health and wellbeing at risk and compromises their future. Every girl who gets married as a child is one girl too many.\u201d",
    "A new study by the agency that also included interviews and discussions across 16 locations in Bangladesh, India and Nepal found that many parents saw marriage as the best option for daughters who had limited options to study during COVID lockdowns.",
    "The legal age of marriage for females is 20 in Nepal, 18 in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and 16 in Afghanistan. It is 16 in Pakistan except for Sindh province, where the minimum age is 18.",
    "The U.N. study also found that families were pushed by financial strains during the pandemic to marry their daughters young in order to reduce costs at home.",
    "The agency said potential solutions identified in discussions include enacting social protection measures to counter poverty, protecting every child\u2019s right to education, ensuring an adequate framework to enforce the law and making more efforts to address social norms.",
    "\u201cWe must do more and strengthen partnerships to empower girls through education, including comprehensive sexuality education, and equipping them with skills, while supporting communities to come together to end this deeply rooted practice,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Andersson, Asia-Pacific regional director of the United Nations Population Fund."
