    "Following are excerpts from new Chairman Fernando\u2019s speech at the AGM.",
    "\u201cBy no means shall we underestimate the current predicament of exporters. So far there has not been safe sailing for businesses, meaning that we are not totally out of the doldrums and not at all the business-as-usual environment set in. 2022 was an incredibly tough year, and while we have shown agility and resilience, we have not emerged from the doldrums unscathed. The magnitude of the conundrum is still to be determined, but we are acutely aware of the difficulties that lie ahead.",
    "Despite the apparent end of the pandemic, exporters are facing another global crisis, compounded by the crippling local financial crisis. The looming economic slowdown in Europe and the USA, our major export destinations, poses a severe threat to our exports. In addition, the increase in corporate and personal taxes, unfavourable forex rates, and the abnormal increase in the cost of commodities, particularly energy, have caused our production costs to skyrocket, eroding our global competitiveness.",
    "As a result, our export figures have taken a hit, and many major industrial exporters are downsizing, shutting down operations, or relocating. The SME sector has been particularly hard-hit, with the withdrawal of loan moratoriums and the contraction of large-scale enterprises having a cascading effect.",
    "We fervently hope that the authorities will realise the seriousness of the situation and take swift action to prevent mass-scale furloughing, job losses, and closures that will ultimately lead to dwindling foreign income.",
    "FTZMA strongly believe that our country will be able recover from the current difficult economic situation faced by our members and the present Government would formulate policies and take action in the right direction to foster the socio-economic progress of Sri Lanka and will bring back confidence of all investors. The Association ensures that continuous and smooth operation of the activities and most importantly sustain the industry by satisfying the Investor. Issues brought up by members are being dealt with efficiently by creating a conducive environment with officials of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and all stakeholders.\u201d"
