    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee opened stronger and was quoted around 330/338 to the US dollar stronger from Friday\u2019s close of 337/345 to the US dollar, dealer said.",
    "Trades were done as strong as 334 to the US dollar, dealers said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee is under upward pressure due to negative private credit, but exchange rate policy turned ad hoc from March 07.",
    "Meanwhile authorities have not yet repaid a dollar bond to banks in rupees, also reducing the requirement",
    "In January Sri Lanka posted a 200 million dollar BOP surplus, under a guidance peg (external anchor) indicating that monetary policy was deflationary (money is not printed but rupees from dollar purchases are withdrawn into a liqudity shortage) and the rupee was under upward pressure.",
    "However, under recent IMF programs, a central bank cannot operate policy consistent with a peg, or even monetary policy consistent with reserve targets (a performance criterion floor on Net International Reserves which is matched by a falling performance criterion ceiling or at least an indicative target on net domestic assets), unlike in the past, analysts say.",
    "Instead, pegged central banks are encouraged to print money to generate inflation as high as 5 percent or 7 percent (domestic anchor) leading to forex shortages and even sovereign default if there is a strong domestic credit recovery, critic say."
