    "The USAID\u2019s Sri Lanka Energy Project and the Asia Development Bank (ADB) have collaborated to launch the Sri Lanka National Chapter WePOWER to promote the advancement of women working in the country\u2019s local energy sector.",
    "The national chapter is affiliated with the regional South Asia WePOWER Network.",
    "In addition to promoting women in energy, this World Bank initiative also increases women\u2019s participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, the US Embassy in Colombo said in a statement.",
    "The launch featured a panel discussion and engaged power sector stakeholders including utilities, academia, and professional networks to raise awareness about the national chapter WePOWER and to encourage high-level officials\u2019 support to ensure its sustainability and success.",
    "Recent World Bank statistics show women represent only about 13 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s power sector employment, the embassy said further.",
    "\u201cThe power sector in Sri Lanka will greatly benefit from workplace diversity and increased participation by women, including in leadership positions,\u201d said Christopher Powers, Director of the USAID\u2019s (US Agency for International Development) Economic Growth Office.\u00a0 \u201cWomen will be needed to meet the growing talent demand in this sector.\u00a0 Their participation in technical and professional roles can greatly enhance the sector\u2019s effectiveness.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe launch of the WePOWER national chapter in Sri Lanka is a timely and exciting development for the country, as well as for its energy sector,\u201d said ADB Country Director Chen Chen.\u00a0 \u201cAs we witness a global shift towards sustainable and environmentally friendly sources of energy, Sri Lanka may capitalize on the trend in its economic recovery course.\u00a0 With more women joining the energy sector, we will create a more diverse and better equipped workforce to address the global and local challenges.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt is important to think outside the box and challenge ways of doing things in the power and energy sector.\u00a0 But to do so, we should cultivate a culture that celebrates and promotes innovation, critical thinking, and diversity in the energy sector in general,\u201d said Mapa Pathirana, the Secretary Ministry of Power and Energy.",
    "Among its first efforts, Sri Lanka WePOWER plans to conduct training in gender equality and social inclusion and a workshop in May to develop an action plan to create and monitor gender activities with targets and goals under its five pillars:\u00a0 STEM education, recruitment, development, retention, and policy and institutional change.",
    "USAID\u2019s Sri Lanka Energy Program is helping Sri Lanka transform its power sector into a market-based, secure, reliable, and sustainable system by mobilizing investment to deploy advanced technologies, increase flexibility, and enhance competitiveness.\u00a0 The U.S. commitment to help build a power sector for tomorrow is one of many elements of America\u2019s long, strong, and enduring partnership in Sri Lanka, a partnership that has been the foundation of 75 years of close relations and effective work together."
