    "$ 3.8 m initiative via home-based agriculture and energy security interventions",
    "58,000 women and youth will directly benefit from these projects, while indirectly impacting over 132,000 vulnerable community members from the North-Central, North-Western and Eastern provinces",
    "The Government of Japan and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) yesterday launched a new initiative to strengthen socio-economic recovery via home-based agriculture and energy security measures.",
    "The $ 3.8 million (Rs. 1.17 billion) initiative supports improvement of women\u2019s economic wellbeing for smallholder farmer families in Sri Lanka. It was launched in the presence of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Japanese Ambassador Mizukoshi Hideaki, UNDP Resident Representative Azusa Kubota, JICA Chief Representative Tetsuya Yamada, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, senior government officials and development partners.",
    "The ongoing socio-economic crisis has had serious impacts on the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka. The rising energy costs and evolving climate change impacts have further exacerbated due to the situation. The initiative launched yesterday aims at addressing these issues.",
    "It will support vulnerable smallholder farming families in the dry zone districts, namely North-Central, North-Western and Eastern provinces, with a focus on women\u2019s economic empowerment and adoption of green agricultural technologies.",
    "Funded by the Japanese Supplementary Budget (JSB) and working together with the Government of Sri Lanka and relevant stakeholders, the intervention aims to achieve its objectives through two projects; the first focusing on diversifying livelihoods and introducing entrepreneurship programs, targeting women-led MSMEs. The second aims to strengthen energy and food security, through the revival of the rural agricultural economy by providing access to innovative markets, value and supply chain improvements along with the adoption of modern, green agricultural technologies which will increase productivity and efficiency.",
    "A total of 58,000 women and youth will directly benefit from these projects, while indirectly impacting over 132,000 vulnerable community members from the North-Central, North-Western and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka.",
    "Prime Minister Gunawardena said: \u201cGovernment of Sri Lanka appreciates the continuous support extended by the Government of Japan and the United Nations Development Program towards the country\u2019s efforts to recover from the socioeconomic crisis. We believe this is a significant step towards creating a food and energy secure Sri Lanka, both vital sectors to the fabric of the country\u2019s economy.\u201d",
    "Highlighting Japan\u2019s commitment to the people of Sri Lanka in crisis recovery efforts, Ambassador Mizukoshi said: \u201cJapan has been working together with the Government of Sri Lanka and relevant UN agencies for economic and social empowerment of women in Sri Lanka, including the formulation of National Action Plan for Women, Peace and Security. These new projects will provide practical means to uplift the lives of vulnerable communities. Especially, we recognise the special needs of women-headed households in conflict-affected areas. It is a great opportunity to create positive synergy with UNDP\u2019s expertise and JICA\u2019s technical assistance for supporting livelihood and vulnerable communities.\u201d",
    "UNDP Resident Representative Kubota said: \u201cThese are times when multiple-solutions through multiple-partnerships are required because we are faced with compounding and complex challenges. I am grateful for the commitments demonstrated by a wide range of actors present today. We must join hands to address the needs of the most vulnerable and affected segments of the society \u2013 particularly women-headed households. And investing in them will have visible, long-term benefits for the families and communities.\u201d"
