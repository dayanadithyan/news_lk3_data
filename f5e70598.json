    "It is perhaps ironic that Amarasiri Kalansuriya joined the Second Volunteer Battalion of the Sinha Regiment the year he turned 18. Ironic, because it was this Battalion that the then government deployed against the JVP insurrectionists in 1971. Ironic, because Kalansuriya, who died last week aged 82, epitomised in film after film the anxieties and frustrations of the generation from whose ranks those insurrectionists sprang. Yet for what it was worth, his military stint was short-lived: once he left it, he found himself engaging in one job after another, trying to make ends meet. These experiences tempered him, humbled him, formed him, and brought him closer to those felt hard done by the establishment.",
    "Kalansuriya was truly the last of his generation. All his peers, including Wimal Kumara da Costa, Daya Tennakoon, Somasiri Dehipitiya, Dharmasena Pathiraja, and the great Vijaya Kumaratunga, have long gone. His passing, in that sense, signifies a transition in much the same way that Sumitra Peries\u2019s passing did two months ago. To those of us who knew him and cherished his performances, he was always Kalang. Indeed, at a certain point it seemed as though his life and his acting were fused in one, as though the one was inseparable from the other. In the end this became his signature, his overriding identity.",
    "His breakthrough performance was in Dharmasena Pathiraja\u2019s  Ahas Gawwa, in 1974. There he played an aimless drifter, one of the hundreds of thousands of unemployed youths who seemed to have no hope, no sense of direction, no real purpose, who dotted our country\u2019s social landscape no matter where they were. Early on in the film, a friend of Kalansuriya\u2019s character, played by Wimal Kumara da Costa, reads the government gazette in search of a vacancy.",
    "He does so after congratulating another friend, played by Wickrema Bogoda, who has just found a job. Though the job is modest \u2013 it\u2019s a security guard\u2019s post, presumably at a government institution \u2013 the friend\u2019s sense of elation at getting it makes us realise that this was an era when getting a job was considered infinitely preferable to having none. It was essentially an era that Kalansuriya found himself part of, an era which bore within it its own contradictions and tensions \u2013 an era which he eventually distilled.",
    "Writing on Vijaya Kumaratunga after his assassination, \u201cJayadeva\u201d quoted Marilyn Monroe: \u201cThe people made me a star \u2013 no studio, no person, but the people did.\u201d If this was true of Vijaya, it was no less true of Kalansuriya. Kalang\u2019s conception of the hero differed from the heroic type that had been immortalised by Gamini Fonseka. Kalang did not exude Gamini\u2019s heroic stature. In Apeksha, the film which cast him into the sort of stardom that Pathiraja\u2019s film did not, he is hardly a hero. Shy, effusive, and reluctant to talk, he has to be pushed into asking Malini Fonseka out. When the two of them do fall for each other, they must confront their class differences. For a while, Kalang manages to get into the good books of her father, played by Felix Premawardhana, by passing himself as her rich boyfriend. Eventually though, when his identity is revealed, her father has him ejected from their house.",
    "Almost 15 years before Apeksha, Gamini played this kind of lover in Getawarayo. But there was only one Getawarayo in Gamini\u2019s entire career. In every other film he was in, where he had to confront class differences, he always resorted to the easy way out. In Sahanaya, for instance, he plays a poor artist who makes his living painting portraits of the rich. When a rich heiress played by Malini Fonseka discovers that he has secretly painted her because he is so smitten with her, she strikes him. Later, feeling sorry for him, Malini invites him to her house. There the two of them talk with one another and discover their love for each other. Just as they are about to take off, though, the girl\u2019s father, played by Mark Samaranayake, discovers them. This forces the girl to elope with him, and for the rest of the film, through a maze of songs, dances, and fights, they stick with, and by, each other.",
    "If in the 1960s and 1970s Sinhala film directors resorted to that formula with despairing frequency, in the late 1970s a new generation of directors sought to challenge it. In 1979 Vasantha Obeyesekere fired the first salvo with Palagetiyo, the film which cemented his reputation as a radical, avant-garde artist. Much earlier, H. D. Premaratne blurred the line between artistic or \u201cserious\u201d and commercial or \u201cmainstream\u201d film by blending elements of both, a feat that challenged the codes of the mainstream Sinhala film.",
    "With his first three films \u2013 Sikuruliya, Apeksha, and Parithyagaya \u2013 Premaratne depicted a society on the cusp of a pivotal and unprecedented transformation. By casting Kalansuriya as the lead in two of them \u2013 Apeksha and Parithyagaya \u2013 he made him a leading face of that socie. In Apeksha particularly, with its medley of Clarence Wijewardena songs, Kalansuriya retained something of the heroic stature which these works demanded of him. At the same time, he remained the relentless radical, the outsider trying to get in.",
    "Thus, while pushing himself to the forefront of the Sinhala cinema\u2019s second wave \u2013 a wave led by the likes of Pathiraja and Obeyesekere \u2013 Kalansuriya did not repress his good looks, his bravado charm, his careless streak. This was true of Vijaya too. It helped both cement their careers: had they retreated to the radical iconoclasm of their directors, the two of them would have been dismissed as freaks. But they refused to do so, and in refusing to do so they remained attached to their people: to quote \u201cJayadeva\u201d, they did what they could to prevent \u201cthe erection of walls\u201d between themselves and the public.",
    "For his part, then, Kalansuriya remained an unabashed populist \u2013 though not to the same extent as Vijaya \u2013 because it was the only way he could be with his audiences. Moreover, by now Gamini Fonseka had reached the zenith of his career, and was dabbling in conservative politics. Vijaya and Kalang remained defiantly detached from all that.",
    "It would of course be wrong to pigeonhole Kalang into a particular political affiliation. Yet like Vijaya, he came from a Sinhala educated background. Kalang was not pushed into Left politics as a child or even a teenager: in this he differed from the earlier generation of artistes and intellectuals, who had absorbed Marxist politics at school or university. To quote Regi Siriwardena, that disability helped him imbibe \u201cthat humanism, generosity and compassion which are the better part of the Sinhala tradition\u201d, qualities which would be submerged by the tide of chauvinism and political authoritarianism. Kalang\u2019s circumstances on this front differed only slightly from Vijaya\u2019s: unlike the latter, who had the benefit of an education at an elite Colombo school, he jumped from one establishment to another, eventually settling at Dharmaraja College Kandy. There he excelled at sports, including boxing, activities which toughened him: in Lester Peries\u2019s Akkara Paha, as Douglas Ranasinghe\u2019s sidekick, he has his first encounter with the protagonist while playing soccer on the schoolground.",
    "From being Ranasinghe\u2019s sidekick, Kalang gravitated to Vijaya. In Sugathapala Senarath Yapa\u2019s Hanthane Kathawa, he distinguishes himself somewhat as a sympathetic friend of the protagonist, played by Tony Ranasinghe. Ranasinghe hailed from an earlier generation, and in Yapa\u2019s film he feels constantly threatened by Vijaya, who seeks the attention of the girl he happens to be hankering after. As his friend, Kalang tries to resolve these tensions, but in the end has no choice but to leave Ranasinghe to fend for himself. Perhaps one of the most underrated Sinhala films ever made, Hanthane Kathawa gives us a glimpse of university life that would be upturned and uprooted in the 1970s. It was in that decade that Kalansuriya underwent an apotheosis of sorts. As he did so, he found common ground with Vijaya in two landmarks: Ahas Gawwa and Bambaru Avith, both directed by Pathiraja.",
    "It is difficult to say what Vijaya would have transformed or evolved into had he survived his assassination. In Kalansuriya\u2019s case, the vibrant career he carried forward in the 1970s and the early 1980s flickered and dimmed: from averaging two films a year in the late 1970s, he slumped to a film a year, two years, and then three, before letting go completely. This is not to say he retired completely from acting: he did make the occasional appearance, in the occasional film or television serial. Yet these were mere replicas of the roles he had played at his peak. Perhaps that was his way of defying the passing of an era, an era he had been a leading face of. Whatever the reason may be, of course, there is no doubt that his death symbolises that passing, that transition, in a way his retirement could not. What makes his more poignant and regrettable is the simple, undeniable fact that he was not just the last of his kind or generation, but also, at one level, the last of us.",
