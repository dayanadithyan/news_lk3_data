    "Says the time when people voted for politicians due to their elite background, persona, donations or threats is now over",
    "Claims the change in the people has now alarmed rival camps consisting of those from elite political families",
    "Highlights that mudslinging and false accusations are all they have left due to the failure to come up with strong political criticisms",
    "Says NPP is the representation of the people\u2019s aspirations who are now looking for a new political force",
    "National People\u2019s Party (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake says the elitist political class in Sri Lanka has been shaken to the core by the political change taking place today.",
    "Noting that many rival parties of the NPP have become several agitated and distressed, Dissanayake said rightly so as their continued dominance in Sri Lankan politics is now under threat. He said while on one hand, a particular camp is attempting to delay the elections, another camp on its political stages is claiming they will reveal or strip down the NPP.",
    "\u201cThey, including Sajith Premadasa, have even taken to even imitating our voices,\u201d he said. The NPP leader said this is evidence of the fact that the party\u2019s rivals have no strong political criticism to level against it. \u201cAll they have is mudslinging, falsehoods and fallacies,\u201d he noted.",
    "Dissanayake made these comments while addressing a discourse titled \u2018Why this commotion?\u2019 organised by the NPP in Colombo yesterday. Dissanayake said it was organised to respond to the criticisms levelled by the Opposition and to explain to the public the reasons behind the Opposition\u2019s visible agitation and distress relating to the party.",
    "\u201cWe organised this because it appears many have become highly agitated. During our rallies, we do not spend much time speaking of these matters as we feel it is unimportant. However, there are members of society who are curious and may have doubts about what is being said about the NPP. This is why we decided to hold this in-depth discourse,\u201d he said, adding that however it will be a one-time event and the party will not travel across the country holding the same discourse islandwide.",
    "\u201cWe merely want to give those who have become agitated the message that we have understood and seen the nature of their distress,\u201d he added.",
    "The NPP leader said many political camps seem to be in distress with the entry of the NPP onto the political playing field of major parties.",
    "\u201cThroughout Sri Lanka\u2019s history, our country was ruled by corrupt and elitist families. Members of these families inherited the governance of the country,\u201d he noted. Pointing out that the same phenomenon was present in provincial politics as well, the NPP leader said a newcomer can only enter Parliament with the blessing of these families and based on the assurance they will remain subordinate.",
    "He said these families have neatly lined their own political pawns to inherit their positions in politics to ensure their hold on power. Presenting the current Rajapaksa family, Maithripala Sirisena and even President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the NPP leader said they are holding the fort down for their successors in politics.",
    "\u201cBut the entry of those who are not part of these elite families now has sent shockwaves among the group,\u201d he said. He said the politicians who once engaged in politics from their fancy terraces, a handful of corrupt bureaucrats and racketeers who support them are alarmed.",
    "Noting that the people once voted for politicians after being attracted by either the persona or fancy airs and donations or even because of threats have now changed and awakened due to the Aragalaya and the exposure to ideologies of progressive political camps.",
    "\u201cThe people have come forward against the elitist form of politics now. They have changed. They are determined and know they are powerful. There is stiff Opposition against these elite groups which has in turn now shocked them,\u201d he said.",
    "He said parties such as the NPP that once engaged in a micro form of alternative politics have now entered the playing field of major political parties and managed to get through to all social strata in the country including the legal fraternity, industrialists, businessmen and even the military.",
    "\u201cTherefore they are now worried about their future. Their luxury lives at public expense, their ability to act with impunity may be lost,\u201d he noted.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is at the brink of bringing in a rule where the law will be applied fairly and equally. People are looking for a new political force. The NPP is being built to fulfil these aspirations,\u201d he added noting that this is why now the rivals of the NPP have resorted to mudslinging and levelling false accusations against them.",
    "Dissanayake said the biggest political clash is now taking place in the country between the NPP ideology Vs the mudslinging of other camps. He also said the party is aware these groups will not give way and will do their utmost to prevent the NPP from coming into power.",
