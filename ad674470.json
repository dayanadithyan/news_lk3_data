    "Royal Nursing Home (Pvt) Ltd recently procured Sri Lankan made 100 Senaro GN125 motorcycles to be distributed among 100 staff members who have been with the company for over 10 years. Manuja Hewawasam, Chairman of the company, procured the bicycles at an event held at Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel where the GN125 was introduced to the market. The GN125 is assembled in Sri Lanka with a local value addition of up to 35 percent. Hewawasam said that Royal Nursing Home has a staff of 800 and that these motorcycles will be distributed among those with the longest service. \u201cThese will help their professional and personal life both. GN125 comes with a three-year warranty. I believe that all Sri Lankans must buy Sri Lankan to protect and promote our industries,\u201d he said.
