    "Sri Lankans are hopeful that a new employment scheme with Saudi Arabia will help ease their country\u2019s economic crisis, professionals and labor officials told Arab News, as they expect it to boost the nation\u2019s manpower exports to the Kingdom.",
    "Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka recently signed an agreement on the Skill Verification Program which aims to improve the professional competence of employees in the Saudi labor market and streamline the recruitment process of skilled workers from the island nation.",
    "Under the deal \u2014 which covers 23 professions, including electricians and auto mechanics \u2014 Saudi employers will recognize accreditations issued by Sri Lanka\u2019s Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission.",
    "\u201cThe TVEC has embarked on the assessment process where Saudi Arabia would tell us their manpower needs and Sri Lanka would choose the right candidates for the right courses,\u201d commission director, Dr. Lalithadheera K. Arachchige, told Arab News on Tuesday.",
    "For many years, Sri Lankan professionals have been working in Saudi Arabia without recognition of their professional certification and often enrolled in jobs below their qualifications. The new deal is expected to change that.",
    "Abdul Nazar, managing director of Colombo-based recruitment company Air Kings Group who used to work in Jeddah, said Saudi Arabia had previously not recognized professionals from Sri Lanka \u201cunless they have gone through the technical skill tests processed by the Saudi government.\u201d",
    "He told Arab News: \u201cThe new facility will enable the migrant workers to claim their salaries according to their professional qualifications which will help our country to earn increased volume of foreign exchange to our national coffers.\u201d",
    "The deal coincides with the Kingdom\u2019s launch of various megaprojects and its growing need for foreign workers.",
    "\u201cIn Saudi Arabia, because of Vision 2030, there is a dearth for skilled workers where we can creep in and get the needed foreign exchange to Sri Lanka,\u201d Nihal Gamage, president of the Sri Lanka Cultural Forum in Riyadh, told Arab News. \u201cThis is a God-sent opportunity.\u201d",
    "The program was also expected to encourage more Sri Lankans to look for jobs in the Kingdom, due to the extra perks they would receive.",
    "\u201cBoth countries will benefit. Saudi Arabia is getting more qualified people and at the same time we are getting the high perks,\u201d Senarath Yapa, spokesman of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, told Arab News.",
    "Only around 40 percent of Sri Lankan migrant workers departing for the Kingdom are recognized as skilled workers, Yapa said.",
    "H.P.A. Kumarasinghe, a Sri Lankan professional who works as a chief accountant at Riyadh-based ABV Rock Group, expected the agreement to help ease the economic crisis in his home country.",
    "Sri Lanka has been seeking foreign employment opportunities for its professionals as it is facing its worst financial crisis since gaining independence in 1948 and is in desperate need of foreign currency.",
    "\u201cI really believe this new program will help ease the crisis in Sri Lanka more broadly,\u201d Kumarasinghe told Arab News.",
    "\u201cThis was a long overdue deal, but there\u2019s a saying that it\u2019s better late than never, so in this point of view I believe it is a remarkable agreement between Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia.\u201d"
