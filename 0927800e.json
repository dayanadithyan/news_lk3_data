    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 New anti-corruption legislation in Sri Lanka proposed as part of its commitments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in exchange for a desperately needed loan has sparked debate over a clause criminalising false allegations of bribery or corruption.",
    "The proposed new anti-corruption bill, which is likely to be enacted in May according to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, includes a clause \u2013 Section 119 \u2013 that will allow for the prosecution of persons making an allegation that they know to be false.",
    "Various parties have criticised the inclusion of this clause over concerns that it could discourage potential whistleblowers, while a few defenders argue that it would prevent the weaponisation of corruption charges that they say can often be politically motivated.",
    "Among those questioning this clause, effectively calling for decriminalisation of false allegations, is Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL). TISL Deputy Executive Director Sankhitha Gunaratne confirmed to EconomyNext on Tuesday April 11 that the Sri Lanka chapter of the global transparency watchdog is indeed advocating decriminalisation of corruption allegations deemed false as failure to do so would \u201ccreate a culture that discourages complaints\u201d.",
    "Existing penal provisions are sufficient to take legal action against anyone who has made a false allegation, said Gunaratne, noting also that there is no record of a provision under the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Act \u2013 Section 21 \u2013 that deals with false allegations ever being used.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s then no need for such a provision to be carried on into the new law,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cEvery person who makes an allegation in any information or complaint made by him to the Commission under section 43 knowing such allegation to be false or having reason to believe that such allegation does not constitute an offence under this Act shall on conviction after summary trial before a Magistrate be liable to a fine not exceeding one million rupees or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or to both such fine and imprisonment and shall in addition, be liable to the payment to the person in respect of whom the communication was made, of a sum of money as compensation as the court may think fit.\u201d",
    "TISL in an official statement has flagged Section 119 as a cause for concern. The statement said the clause \u201cappears to send a negative signal to citizens willing to come forward as informants and whistleblowers to report corruption.\u201d",
    "Proponents of the clause argue that, in addition to discouraging the weaponisation of corruption allegations, it also provides a level of protection to public officials tasked with taking sensitive decisions that could be the target of corruption charges, real or fabricated. Prof Rohan Samarjiva in a recent newspaper column pointed to the wording of the clause \u2013 which is largely similar to that of Section 21 of the current law \u2013 that stresses that only the commission, an independent body, will have the authority to institute legal action against someone accused of making a false allegation and only a magistrate can issue a verdict.",
    "Responding to this argument, TISL\u2019s Gunaratne said: \u201cIf such a situation arises, it\u2019s CIABOC that\u2019s given the authority to carry out an investigation. They can carry out the investigation and let it lie.\u201d",
    "She added that there is no reason to introduce such legislation when the world is moving towards a culture of transparency and accountability and providing safety to whistleblowers.",
    "Though she conceded that the repercussions of false allegations can be devastating to those accused, Gunaratne said a false allegation can \u201cfound to be false anyway\u201d.",
    "\u201cCriminalisation doesn\u2019t stop that person from being dismissed of all charges,\u201d she added.",
    "Asked how weaponisation can be minimised without the help of some legal recourse those falsely accused could resort to, she reiterated that penal provisions already exist.",
    "\u201cOur argument, given the evidence we have, is that that has not happened. We had that law for several decades. On the face of it, it is clear that this is not really a problem that has arisen,\u201d she said.",
    "Asked again if TISL is effectively calling for the decriminalisation of false allegations, Gunaratne said: \u201cWithin the anticorruption sphere, yes. I would even go so far as to say we need a whistleblower protection act.\u201d",
    "\u201cThere is another provision that works in tandem in this law that actually protects whistleblowers to a certain extent but then subjects it to Section 119. So what we\u2019re saying is, do away with Section 119.\u201d",
    "She agreed, however, that whistleblower protection and criminalisation of false allegations could coexist.",
    "\u201cIn an ideal system, yes. But we\u2019re talking about a context where freedom of expression is stultified and stifled. People have a fear psychosis about whether speaking out will result in reprisals, death threats, allegations, water canons or tear gas aimed at them purely for expressing an opinion,\u201d said Gunaratne.",
    "\u201cThat is the context within which we operate. Especially given the level of attention that this section has received, the chance of weaponisation in the other direction is, I would say, higher \u2013 given the level of autocracy and state capture we\u2019re seeing \u2013 than the chance of false allegations being made to the detriment of the public,\u201d she added.
