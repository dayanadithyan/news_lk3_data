  "original_body_lines": [
    "Three-wheeler fare reduction cannot be considered even after yesterday's petrol price revision, the National Joint Three-Wheeler Drivers and Industrial Workers Association said.",
    "Association Secretary Rohana Perera told the Daily Mirror that reducing the Lanka Petrol 92 Octane price by Rs. 7 per litre would not affect taxi fares.",
    "A three-wheeler runs 25 kilometres per litre. With this Rs. 7 revision, the cost of a kilometre will be 28 cents. Therefore, the petrol price revision cannot be used to make a fare revision at this time. It is true that the cost of living is decreasing and the prices of three-wheeler spare parts and oil have also come down.",
    "\"We are still getting eight litres of petrol for the weekly quota, and on the remaining days we have to get sufficient fuel through various illegal ways. \"We are facing a critical situation when getting petrol,\" he said.",
    "Therefore, it is not possible to reduce the three-wheeler fares at this time, Perera said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
