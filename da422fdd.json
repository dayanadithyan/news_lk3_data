    "A decision on the venue for this year\u2019s Asia Cup could determine if Pakistan would participate in October\u2019s Cricket World Cup.",
    "Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), who are the hosts of the Asia Cup, had offered a \u201chybrid\u201d model where some matches would be staged in Pakistan, and matches involving India would be played at a neutral venue as a result of India\u2019s refusal to tour the country.",

    "A history of political tensions between India and Pakistan has meant a suspension in bilateral cricket ties between the countries.",
    "It has been reported that Pakistan have threatened to pull out of the World Cup in India in the event that their hybrid-model is rejected and they are forced to host the entire tournament outside of Pakistan."
