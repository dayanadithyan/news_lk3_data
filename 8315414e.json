    "Defending double world champion Max Verstappen extended his lead in this year's title race to 53points today when he completed a hat-trick by driving his Red Bull to a masterful victory in the Spanish Grand Prix.",
    "The 25-year-old Dutchman led from lights to flag to come home 24 seconds ahead of revitalised seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton and George Russell, in their much-improved Mercedes' cars.",
    "It was Verstappen's third consecutive win, his third in Spain, his fifth in seven races this season and the 40th of his career, achieved despite receiving three official warnings for exceeding track limits.",
    "\u201cIt's such a big pleasure to drive a car like this,\u201d said Verstappen.",
    "\u201cAnd it showed again today. We were on different tyre strategies out there today and mostly I was on the right one! And to win here is incredible.\u201d Hamilton's second place provided him with his 11th podium finish in Spain, where he has won six times.",
    "\u201cOh, man, what an awesome crowd and result,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cAnd I didn't expect that so hats off to the team and our factory for pushing us so close to the 'Bulls. We are chasing them down -- and George did a great job too today.\u201d Russell said he was surprised to finish third after starting 12th. \u201cKudos to the team for that,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a great car today.\u201d Verstappen's Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez battled through the field, after starting 11th, to finish fourth ahead of Ferrari's home hero Carlos Sainz, Lance Stroll and his Aston Martin team-mate two-time champion Fernando Alonso, who was unable to extend his streak of podiums on home ground.",
    "The race began in hot conditions with an air temperature of 25 degrees and the track at 42, but gathering clouds threatened. The risk of rain was 40 percent.",
    "Verstappen made a clean start and resisted Sainz into the first corner before, behind him, Hamilton swept round Norris, only for the McLaren to make contract under braking at Turn Two."
