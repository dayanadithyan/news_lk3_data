    "Minister of Tourism Harin Fernando said that he doesn\u2019t believe his statement regarding the Maldives was problematic, as he didn\u2019t make any wrong statement.",
    "\u201cI love Sri Lanka and I promote it. I only asked tourists who visit the Maldives to visit Sri Lanka after 5 days, as they are a small island. If I upset anyone, I have extended my apology,\u201d\u00a0 he said.",
    "Fernando faced backlash after a statement made at an international travel and trade fair held in Berlin, Germany, where he said that Sri Lanka had much more to offer tourists in comparison to the Maldives. The Minister's comment attracted anger from Maldivians including politicians and influential figures.",
    "He claimed that his comments were taken out of context and misrepresented. \"Everyone with a phone is now a journalist, therefore anyone can interpret my statement in whatever way they want,\u201d Fernando said."
