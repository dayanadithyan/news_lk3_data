    "The 104th birth anniversary of Sri Lanka\u2019s legendary and internationally celebrated film director, the late Dr. Lester James Peries, falls today 05th April 2023. He is also the best example of an enduring liaison with France, her people and her culture. We reproduce Chapter 49 from \u201cThe Bonsoir Diaries\u201d (2013), written by media personality Kumar de Silva who is also a Trustee of the Lester James and Sumitra Peries Foundation.",
    "In a cinematic career spanning more than half a century, France has undoubtedly been the only country with which Lester James Peries has had a long and fertile relationship, one that has enriched both his personal and professional lives.",
    "The story began when he took his first film Rekawa (The Line of Destiny. 1956) to the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. It was during this trip that he met the 21 year-old Sumitra Gunawardena at the residence of Ceylon\u2019s Charge d\u2019\u00c1ffaires to France, Dr. Vernon Mendis and his wife Paddy. Lester and Sumitra were later to wed at the All Saints Church in Borella, eight years later.",
    "Lester James Peries has the distinction of being the only Sri Lankan filmmaker who has had not one, but five of his films screened at the Mecca of World Cinema \u2013 the Cannes Film Festival. After Rekawa were  Beddegama (The Village in the Jungle. 1981) and Kaliyugaya (The Age of Kali. 1982).",
    "In 2003, Cannes screened Wekande Walauwwa (The Mansion by the Lake. 2001) out of competition as a special tribute to his lasting contribution to Asian and World Cinema.",
    "Then again in 2008 Gamperaliya (The Changing Village. 1964) was screened at Cannes as a part of the Classics of World Cinema.",
    "Over the years, France has hosted countless retrospectives of his films. During the summer of 1971 the highly respected and prestigious Cinemath\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in Paris held a retrospective of seven of his films. This august institution has been the spiritual home to a host of international film makers including Lester James and Sumitra Peries.",
    "In 1984 more honour and recognition were bestowed on him by France when the Festival de la Rochelle paid homage to him.",
    "In 1988 came more honours from the Cinemath\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in the form of a highly acclaimed joint retrospective of the entire body of work of Lester James and Sumitra Peries.",
    "They were both made honorary life members of this celebrated institution. Small wonder then that Nidhanaya (The Treasure. 1970) is today part of the Cinemath\u00e8que\u2019s collection of the classics of world cinema.",
    "The same year, the Festival of the Three Continents in Nantes, celebrating its tenth anniversary, heaped more honours on him. It recognised him as \u201cone of the few best film makers of the three continents\u201d (Asia. Africa. Latin America).",
    "\u201cThis was a very satisfying experience because Nantes specialises in Asian, African and Latin American cinema\u201d, he said. Here again it was Beddegama which took top honours.",
    "In 1992 the 45th Cannes International Film Festival invited Lester James to serve as a Member of its Jury, presided over by legendary French actor Gerard Depardieu. Fellow members of the Jury included John Boorman, Pedro Almodovar, Jamie Lee Curtis and Carlo de Palma among others.",
    "\u201cThat experience was one of great jubilation, one of real happiness, of being recognised at least to be worthy of being a member, it is in itself a great honour\u201d, he recalled.",
    "From 1995 to 1999 Lester James Peries was compulsorily (and he loved it) stationed in Paris when Sumitra was Sri Lanka\u2019s Ambassador Extraordinaire and Plenipotentiary for France and Spain. She was also Sri Lanka\u2019s Ambassador and permanent delegate to UNESCO during this period.",
    "It was during this time that the Government of France bestowed on him one of its highest national honours \u2013 \u2018Commander dans l\u2019Ordre des Arts et Lettres\u2019 \u2013 in recognition of his contribution to Asian and World Cinema.",
    "This was a great honour to be bequeathed on a Sri Lankan. The date chosen for the ceremony was 19 June 1997, their 33rd wedding anniversary and the venue was the BMICH. They made a special trip from Paree to be present at this glamourous event. The Sri Lanka film industry\u2019s glitterati were there in full force as was the media.",
    "Chandrika Kumaratunga was President at that time. I remember her discreetly slipping in and taking her seat that evening. She had wanted to be present as a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d and not as the President of Sri Lanka. Lester James was visibly touched. After all he had been attesting witness at her marriage to Vijaya Kumaratunge years prior.",
    "And as the Ambassador of France in Sri Lanka Elisabeth Dahan placed the ribbon and medal around his neck, there was thunderous applause. The entire audience rose to its feet in salutation. Lester bowed his head in humble acknowledgement.",
    "\u201cMy links with France have been spread over a long period of time. The most striking thing in my career is my relationship with France. If one goes through the co-incidences of what has been happening, one would not believe the many things that have happened. All have been like a recurring theme, a recurring motif in a musical symphony. And that is the strangest thing\u201d, he said that evening.",
    "Soon after and much to the couple\u2019s surprise a large cake bearing 33 candles was wheeled in. Being at the podium that evening I requested them to cut it. They were embarrassed but obliged. I then requested Mrs. Peries to feed him with the first piece. Madame l\u2019Ambassadeur Peries blanched in embarassment and refused. She finally had no choice but to concede since the mic was with me and everyone heard my repeated requests. Bonsoir was as usual there in full force to capture every moment and share it with our thousands of viewers across Sri Lanka the following Monday.",
