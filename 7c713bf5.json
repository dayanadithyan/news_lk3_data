  "original_body_lines": [
    "A group of religious leaders representing different religious faiths in the country today filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an order directing the IGP to immediately arrest Pastor Jerome Fernando over his hate comments against religious harmony in the country.",
    "The petitioners are further seeking an order directing the law enforcement authorities to cause a full investigation into the financial activities of Pastor Jerome Fernando and \u201cThe Glorious Church\u201d, in order to ascertain if any laws of Sri Lanka have been violated.",
    "The petitioners Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera, Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera, Ven. Angulugalle Sri Ginanada Thera, Rev. Father Nishan Cooray, Dr. Sivasui Ramachandra Kurukkal Babu Sharma and Al-Haj-As-Seyed Hassan Moulana AlQuadri filed this petition naming Pastor Jerome Fernando, IGP Chandana Wickramaratne, the Archbishop of Colombo, Mahanayaka Theros of the Malwatta Chapter of the Siam Nikaya, Amarapura Maha Nikaya, Amarapura Maha Nikaya, the All Ceylon Hindu Congress, the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, Attorney General and several others as respondents.",
    "The petitioners alleged that Prophet Jerome Fernando, during the course of a televised sermon at the \u201cThe Glorious Church\u201d before a large gathering of his spiritual followers, wantonly ridiculed, insulted, demeaned, undermined and Caricaturized three out of the four major religions in Sri Lanka (Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam).",
    "The Petitioners are of the view that there is delay in taking meaningful and adequate action for the arrest of Prophet Jerome Fernando and produce him before a Court. The Petitioners state that, on or about May 18, 2023, Jerome Fernando, addressed a large gathering of people, purportedly being a religious congregation, at which he made numerous statements that are derogatory of other religions, specifically of Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam.",
    "The Petitioners state that, no meaningful action has still been taken by the Respondents and that, without the intervention by the Supreme Court, this heinous act of Jerome Fernando is likely to be swept under the carpet, without any redress being afforded to the citizens of this Country.",
    "President\u2019s Counsel Sanjeeva Jayawardana with Counsel Charitha Rupasinghe, Lakmini Warusavitane, Milhan Mohamed, Ranmali Meepagala and Rukshan Senadheera instructed by Ashoka Niwunhella are appearing for the Petitioners. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)"
