    "Sri Lanka has rejected the U.S. decision to designate Admiral of the Fleet Wasantha Karannagoda and also expressed its \u2018grave concern\u2019 about the decision, the foreign ministry said.",
    "Issuing a statement the ministry said that Foreign Minister Ali Sabry expressed Sri Lanka\u2019s grave concerns associated with this decision to the U.S. Ambassador Julie Chung today.",
    "\u201cAs a longstanding bilateral partner of Sri Lanka, such unilateral action by the U.S. without following due process is counter-productive to the holistic approach that Sri Lanka has taken on addressing national unity and reconciliation, the ministry stated.",
    "\u201cIt is also unfortunate that the announcement emanates against the backdrop of tangible progress made by the Government in strengthening the country\u2019s democratic governance and reconciliation structures,\u201d it said.",
    "However, the statement also said that despite these challenges, Sri Lanka will continue in its ongoing efforts to achieve reconciliation, economic recovery and socio-economic development."
