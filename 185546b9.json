    "JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said yesterday that Sri Lanka was only enjoying an interval in the crisis which he termed an \"interval in hell\" at the moment.",
    "Speaking at the 'Il Maha Viru Samaruma' held in Kalutara to commemorate their fallen members, he said people should not believe that Sri Lanka was heading towards an economic revival by looking at the present situation and said the country would have to face an even more serious economic downturn shortly.",
    "\"We are passing through an interval within the crisis right now. This is actually 'an interval in hell'. If one thinks that the country is going to come out of the crisis, it is not so. This is only an interval. Everyone will have to revert to an even more serious situation than we experienced as the country was not taken in the right direction,\" he said.",
    "He said Sri Lanka had to face this crisis situation as Sri Lanka's expenses increased remarkably after 1971 without acquiring economic assets and developing a production economy.",
    "\"Instead of acquiring economic assets and developing a production economy, we obtained loans and sold off our assets. We have become a debt-ridden country now. Each person owes Rs.1.4 million now. Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Rajapaksa government have chosen the same old path to come out of the crisis by obtaining the IMF loan. The country is in crisis due to unbearable loans and the government is obtaining more loans as a solution,\" he said.",
    "Silva said no one would be able to take Sri Lanka out of this crisis without following the correct path of developing a production economy and acquiring economic assets instead of obtaining more loans.(Ajith Siriwardana)"
