    "Amnesty International officials will meet with representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today to discuss the terms under which the USD 2.9 billion bailout package is granted to Sri Lanka, Amnesty International's Regional Director for South Asia Yamini Mishra said.",
    "Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Mishra said the organization wishes to better understand the IMF\u2019s agreement with the Sri Lankan government while making clear the global human rights organization\u2019s position.",
    "Amnesty International in the past has raised concerns regarding human rights protection in countries that have received IMF assistance in times of economic crisis. Amnesty International will call on the IMF to prioritize the protection and promotion of human rights, including, economic, social, civil and political rights in its negotiations with Sri Lanka, Mishra said. \u201cWhatever deal is negotiated, it should adhere to the safeguards guaranteed under international human rights law,\u201d she said.",
    "The deals made with the Sri Lankan government should not result in cutbacks on social expenditure, Mishra stressed. \u201cAll creditors must adhere to human rights obligations and that the entire process must be transparent and accessible to the public,\u201d she added. Accordingly, the incorporation of human rights obligations into debt sustainability analysis will be another key demand the global human rights organization will address with the IMF.(Kalani Kumarasinghe)"
