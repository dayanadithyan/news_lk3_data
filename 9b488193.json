    "BANGKOK, AFP: Thailand\u2019s progressive Move Forward Party claimed victory in the country\u2019s election Monday after a stunning result that decimated military-backed parties, which have ruled the kingdom for nearly a decade.",
    "A massive surge for Move Forward (MFP) in Sunday\u2019s ballot left it on course to be the biggest party, followed by its rival Opposition \u2013 the Pheu Thai movement of billionaire ex-Premier Thaksin Shinawatra.",
    "Thai voters turned out in record numbers to deliver a brutal verdict on former coup leader Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha, who has been blamed for economic stagnation and a crackdown on rights.",
    "MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat said he would seek to build a six-party coalition including Pheu Thai, which said it was ready to join, though negotiations of the details have not yet begun.",
    "\u201cI am Pita Limjaroenrat, the next Prime Minister of Thailand,\u201d he told reporters at the MFP headquarters in Bangkok.",
    "\u201cWe are ready to form the Government,\u201d he added, vowing to be a \u201cPrime Minister for all\u201d.",
    "Pita said he had called Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Pheu Thai\u2019s leading Prime ministerial candidate to congratulate her on her campaign and invite her to join the coalition.",
    "Between them, MFP and Pheu Thai are expected to take 292 out of 500 seats in the lower house, with the two main army-allied parties mustering just 76 seats in total.",
    "But in a kingdom where coups and court orders have often trumped the ballot box, there are fears that the result may yet be thwarted.",
    "This election was the first since 2020 protests that demanded curbs on the power and spending of Thailand\u2019s king."
