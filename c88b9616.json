    "Responding to a question raised by Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa on the restructuring of SLT, the State Minister said this new institution will decide on how to restructure state institutions.",
    "\u201cThis institution will decide on restructuring patterns of state owned enterprises and would consider total privatization, building up of private public partnership and deciding upon what strategically\u00a0 important\u00a0 institutions should vested with the state sector,\u201d the State Minister said.",
    "\"The total losses incurred by more than 400 state run institutions have been Rs. 322 billion and it is not possible to put the burden on running these institutions on the people,\u201d he added.",
