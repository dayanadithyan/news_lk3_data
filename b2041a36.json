    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Ceylon tea prices fell 50-150 rupees per kilogram at an auction on May 3, due to increased offerings and strengthening of the rupee, data showed.",
    "Total auction volume was increased to six million kilograms and there was good general demand, Forbes and Walker tea brokers said in a report.",
    "\u201cThe lower trend in prices perhaps could be attributed to increased volumes, lower quality and a marginal strengthening of the Sri Lankan Rupee\u201d Forebes and Walker said.",

    "Quality of teas from the Western, Nuwara Eliya and Uda Pussellawa planting districts showed a slight decline particularly in the liquoring characteristics, whilst the Uvas\u2019 were barely maintained, Forbes and Walker said.",
    "BOP and PF prices fell by 150 rupees and the price of BOPF fell by 100 rupees while BP1 fell by 50 rupees per kilo.",

    "Leafy and Semi Leafy catalogues met with fair demand, whilst the Small Leaf categories were easier.",
    "\u201cIn the Leafy and Semi Leafy catalogues, OP1\u2019s, in general, were firm. A selection of BOP1\u2019s too sold on last levels, whilst the balance was easier,\u201d Forbes and Walker said.",
    "Select best teas in PEKOE/PEKOE1 together with full range of bold PEK\u2019s were steady while some were falling. Cleaner below best and the rest were irregular.",
