  "original_body_lines": [
    "The Supreme Court today issued a rule suspending a lawyer from practicing as an Attorney-at-law for a period of six months over a complaint made by a Second Secretary (Migration) of the British High Commission in Sri Lanka.",
    "Edward Megarry, Second Secretary (Migration) of the British High Commission in Sri Lanka had made a written complaint to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) alleging deceit and malpractice on the part of the Respondent Alwapillai Gangatharan. The complaint had been made for furnishing a letter dated 5th June 2015 falsely affirming the existence of a case in the Magistrate\u2019s Court of Colombo, along with documents purporting to be Summons to be served and a warrant of arrest issued by the Kotahena Police station against one Machado, in order to mount support for a claim for asylum in the United Kingdom for the said person.",
    "The manner in which the Respondent has conducted himself in the instant case cannot be treated lightly nor condoned. The only saving grace as far as the Respondent is concerned is the fact that at the first given opportunity, he admitted his errant conduct and expressed regret and remorse, Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare observed.",
    "The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprised Justices Buwanweka Aluwihare, S. Thurairaja and Gamini Amarasekara. Counsel Anura Gunaratne appeared for the respondent. Rohan Sahabandu PC with Chathurika Elvitigala, Sachini Senanayake and Nathasha Fernando appeared for the BASL. Senior Deputy Solicitor General M. Gopallawa appeared for the Attorney General.
