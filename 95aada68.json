    "The country's Cabinet Spokesperson Dr. Bandula Gunawardane said this legislation aims to ensure comprehensive regulation of electronic media.",
    "However, the country's political and civil circles have criticized this move, citing it as an attempt to clampdown on media freedom.",
    "Former Secretary to the Ministry of Mass Media and current member of Parliament, Dr. Charitha Herath says that the government, by introducing these new regulations on media, is trying to generate fear among the media institutions to fulfill their personnel political agendas by doing so.",

    "\"A similar bill was brought in 1997 more than 25 years ago. The government at that time brought a bill called Sri Lanka Broadcasting Authority Bill, identical by name.

    "\"We see this as an attack on democracy. We'd like to tell the government that if they try to do things like this, we will fight against it and defend the people's right to democracy,\" stressed the MP.",
