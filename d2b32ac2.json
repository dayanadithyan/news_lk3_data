    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka political parties will be tested by President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s government on their support to the country when the parliament will discuss the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the President\u2019s advisor Sagala Ratnayake has said.",
    "\u201cThe President has presented the IMF/EFF program to the parliament, and it will be debated during the week from the 25th April, where all political parties will need to decide whether they support their country or not,\u201d Ratnayake,\u00a0 Chief of Staff to the President and Senior Adviser on National Security, said during a discussion with Ambassadors and High Commissioners of Foreign Missions last week.",
    "President Wickremesinghe\u2019s government has promised tough reforms in return of a 3 billion US dollar IMF loan which became a must after the country\u2019s unprecedented economic crisis due to long neglected fiscal reforms.",
    "The IMF loan is expected to unlock Sri Lanka\u2019s borrowing ability from its bilateral and commercial debtors. However, the island nation will have to implement some tough measures for that.",
    "The Finance Ministry expects the IMF loan approval will help to tap 7 billion US dollars from multilateral agencies including the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB).",
    "Ratnayake said the World Bank and ADB programs are part of the structural reform program and compensate for the strength of some measures in the IMF program.",
    "\u201cUnder the World Bank program, there is an improvement in fiscal oversight and debt management, which involves two measures being brought in. One is the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office through a Parliamentary Budget Office Act,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe Budget Office is expected to be up and running by May 2023. There is a mandatory time period that allows for public consumption, after which it will be presented to Parliament and then referred to the Public Finance Committee, which in turn has to come back to Parliament. This is a process they have to follow, and they hope to finish it by the first Parliamentary week of April.\u201d",
    "Ratnayake\u2019s comments come amid a speculation over a shake in cabinet and President\u2019s invitation to form a consensus government that will agree to implement the key IMF conditions.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight target. Once Parliament ratifies the decision of the Public Finance Committee, we hope to finish by the first Parliamentary week of this month, which starts on April 25,\u201d Ratnayake said, referring to the establishment of a budget office.",
    "\u201cIn the third quarter of 2024, a new public debt management law will be introduced, covering various areas, including ones that are currently not covered by law,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThis includes processes such as providing Sovereign guarantees and on lending operations to SOEs (State Owned Enterprises), which will be restructured and commercialized. The law will also aim to improve tax administration, with a mandatory Income Tax Act already approved by parliament, and an emphasis on enhancing tax audits and compliance in the first quarter of 2024.\u201d",
    "Opposition parties have criticized the IMF deal saying that Wickremesinghe government has agreed for all the IMF conditions without considering the suffering of the public to fulfill the conditions. However, the opposition parties have failed to put forward alternative policies to solve the economic crisis.",
    "Ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is expected to back the IMF deal, though reluctantly after it resisted the global lender policies in public during the Presidential and Parliamentary elections in 2019 and 2020.",
    "The president can dissolve the parliament at any time now as per constitution and call for a snap poll. But Wickemesinghe has said he does not want to have any election this year until the economy recovers.",
    "The main opposition Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) has been in secret talks with Wickremesinghe on going ahead with the economic recovery plan and the IMF deal in the event the president finds lack of support from the SLPP, sources have said. (Colombo/April17/2023)"
