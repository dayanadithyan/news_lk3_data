    "He said this while attending the appointment of new members to the Religious Advisory Board at the Education Ministry.",
    "\"In most of the schools, students of all religions used to study without any religious issues. Under such discipline, the children who grow up in the school with discipline and mutual respect will live in harmony as good citizens in society and at work,\" the Minister said.",
    "In order to implement this situation in all the schools, a wide contribution should be made from all religious sectors, the minister added. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
