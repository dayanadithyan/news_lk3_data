  "original_body_lines": [
    "The trade unions that represent the extremist political parties are trying to sabotage the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan project, the Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) said.",
    "Addressing the media, LPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijerathne said the trade unions of the said political parties are trying to drag the country into a dark age and drag the country into an abyss once again.",
    "\"We will be exposing the details relating to the state-sponsored terrorist conspiracy in the country within two weeks. We know who is behind all of these. All the members of these trade unions who are getting ready to protest used to get their monthly salaries while staying at home during the lockdown situation in the COVID pandemic,\" he said.",
    "Therefore, I challenge all the state officials to engage in their trade union actions without getting their government salaries. If they do so, we will also shake hands with them, Wijerathne said.",
    "\"As a result, we have decided to run all of the buses normally and according to the schedule, allowing all students and office workers to get around,\" he said.",
    "Accordingly, we will operate at our maximum bus capacity of 15,000 during the protest days, Wijerathne said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
