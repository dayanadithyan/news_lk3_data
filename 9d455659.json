    "Charith Asalanka narrowly missed out on a second career ODI century with Sri Lanka bowled out for 268 in the first ODI against Afghanistan in Hambantota a short while ago.",
    "Asalanka was run out in the final over of the innings, having scored 91 off 95 deliveries, helping Sri Lanka recover from 84 for 4 to post a competitive total.",
    "A 99-run fifth wicket partnership between Asalanka and Dhananjaya de Silva, who scored 51 off 59, laid the groundwork for Sri Lanka's recovery having lost their top four for 84 in the 20th over.",
    "De Silva was dismissed attempting a loose sweep shot in the 38th over, but Asalanka kept steady with partnerships of 32 and 48 with Dasun Shanaka and debutant Dushan Hemantha respectively, as Sri Lanka headed into the final over on 264 for 7.",
    "Three wickets in the 50th over however stymied Sri Lanka's push to a score closer to 280, with the run outs of Asalanka and Matheesha Pathirana sandwiching the wicket of Kasun Rajitha.",
