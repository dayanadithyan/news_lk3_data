    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 More Sri Lankan tax payers have disputed tax claims and penalties\u00a0 decided by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), official data showed, as many taxpayers have not agreed to the tax authorities\u2019 calculations.",
    "By the end of 2021, the IRD data showed the island nation\u2019s taxpayers had not paid 368.3 billion rupees of their tax dues.",
    "The IRD had also imposed a total penalty of 251.5 billion rupees for delayed or non-payment of tax.",
    "The total overdue tax and penalty recorded by end 2021 was 620 billion rupees.",
    "However, out of the total tax claims, 77 percent or 283.7 billion rupee worth tax has been disputed. As a result, the collectable tax out of the total 368. 3 billion rupees has been only 84.6 billion rupees, the official IRD data showed.",
    "Out of the total 251.5 billion rupee penalty imposed as of December 2019, the taxpayers have disputed over 70 percent or 176.4 billion rupee worth penalty has been disputed. The IRD, as a result, has categorized only 75 billion rupees as collectable penalty.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s successive governments have attempted to raise the tax revenue, but failed mainly due to a cumbersome legal process to decide the taxes, political influences, and tax amnesties, analysts say.",
    "President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Finance Minister has raised the personal income tax up to 36 percent to raise direct tax and the total revenue. His 2023 budget is estimated to increase the tax revenue by more than 68 percent to move out of the current unprecedented economic crisis.",
    "However, the tax hike decision has been opposed by state-sector trade unions and professionals as many of them are forced to pay higher taxes this time. They have given an ultimatum of March 1 to the government and demanded to reduce the taxes before that. (Colombo/Feb17/2023)"
