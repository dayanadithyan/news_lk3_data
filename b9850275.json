    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) should be considered as IA (intelligence augmented), which we must use smartly as it has the potential to augment our productivity and creativity.",
    "This is, of course, easier said than done, Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said. He said this in his on-line address to the International Conference of Education held in Kazan, Russia.",
    "\"AI, of course, is easier said than done. Any change brings about a period of uncertainty and anxiety. \"While schools and universities may find it hard to keep their content and pedagogy up to date, they can play a huge role in helping learners find a supportive community, figure out how to learn new things and continually reinvent themselves. More than imparting knowledge, inculcating the right mindset towards work could be a more meaningful contribution of educational institutions,\" Minister Premajayantha said.",
    "\"Moreover, general-purpose technologies like AI will continue to grow exponentially. Instead of getting anxious or trying to halt progress, which is a futile attempt, the new workforce will have to learn to work with them.\u00a0 \"There is a danger in the development of knowledge and technologies without the control of humans. Already, the alarm bell is ringing against the potential dangers of AI. \"Future systems depend on responsible choices. The new knowledge and technologies emerging are enhancing the capacity of humans beyond our imagination. Irresponsible use of new technologies, including AI, may destroy our future. Consequently, education must assume a greater role in developing the morality of individuals,\" he said.",
    "\"The connections between primary education, secondary education, higher education and vocational and technical education must be worked out clearly and education financing must support these connections. More than imparting knowledge, inculcating the right mindset towards work could be a more meaningful contribution of educational institutions,\" the minister said.",
    "\"Thus, countries like Sri Lanka where education is free for all from primary to university, the perspectives of welfare systems may not hold for the future. We will have to consider education as an investment for which both the government as well as the learners should share responsibility,\" the Minister added. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama)"
