    "The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has refuted media reports which claimed the party has joined a new alliance formed by the main Opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) led by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa.",
    "Issuing a statement yesterday, the SLFP admitted it attended a meeting between the SJB, other parties and groups in the Opposition on 24 April but said at no time did it agree to join any alliance. \u201cThe meeting was held on 24 April in the Parliament committee room. A lengthy discussion was held on the Anti-Terrorism Act and the IMF,\u201d it read.",
    "However, as claimed in news reports and bulletins, the party said there was no forming of an alliance with Sajith Premadasa or any other party representing the Opposition in Parliament. The SLFP said therefore this news of the SLFP joining an alliance which is being disseminated by the Government is entirely false.",
    "Quoting SJB\u2019s Lakshman Kiriella, on 24 April many media reports said all parties of the Opposition had agreed to join an Alliance led by the SJB. Kiriella said that all political party leaders in the Opposition took part in the discussions and it was agreed to organise a program to oppose the upcoming repressive Bills.",
    "He was quoted as saying: \u201cToday we discussed forming a joint pposition alliance under the leadership of\u00a0 Sajith Premadasa. All the political party leaders in the Opposition expressed their agreement for that purpose. There are also some people who defected from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).\u201d",
    "\u201cThis alliance will last until the next presidential election,\u201d he had added. The meeting was attended by several Opposition party leaders including Dullas Alahapperuma, Prof G.L. Peiris, Mano Ganeshan and Udaya Gammanpila.",
    "However representatives of the National People\u2019s Power or the Tamil National Alliance did not attend. Premadasa speaking to the media afterwards said the Opposition parties had a fruitful meeting on how to act collectively against oppressive Bills."
