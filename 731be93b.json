    "Claims party will be combination of experienced persons and new faces",
    "A new political party led by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) parliamentarian Patali Champika Ranawaka will be launched today at the National Youth Center Auditorium. The party named the \u2018United Republic Front\u2019 will be launched to coincide with Sri Lanka\u2019s Republic Day. The chosen symbol for the new party is the \u2018pencil\u2019.",
    "Speaking to the media on Saturday about his motive to launch a new political party, Ranawaka said in the past year Sri Lanka has witnessed the simultaneous bankruptcy of the country\u2019s traditional form of politics and economy.",
    "The MP said the existing political parties in Sri Lanka have only presented simple solutions to the current crisis. Ranawaka also noted that the current IMF-sanctioned plan being implemented to rebuild Sri Lanka is one that will extend until 2028 and beyond.",
    "\u201cIn comparison, we are proposing a concise, three-year blueprint aimed at restoring Sri Lanka to its 2019 state. We will also seek to implement a plan to rebuild and develop the economy beyond that,\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cThis is not new wine in an old bottle. Instead, we are attempting to create an entirely new bottle,\u201d he added.\u00a0 The MP said his party will consist of experienced persons as well as some new faces in the field of politics. \u201cIt will be a combination of both,\u201d he noted.",
    "Ranawaka emphasized that 43 Brigade, a movement initiated by him, is strictly apolitical and will operate independently from the new political party. \u201cHowever, we have invited those from the movement who have an interest in politics to join us,\u201d he said."
