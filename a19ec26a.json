    "\u201cLalkantha seemed to understand the reality and the disruption caused by strikes and protests. This is why he said he is opposed to continuous strikes,\" Abeywardene told a press conference.",
    "\u201cThe general strike scheduled for tomorrow will push the country into a deep crisis and it will not be able to come out in 25 years if it succeeds. However, it is sure to be a failure,\u201d he added.",
    "He alleged that those who want to stage a strike and political parties who back them are used by some international forces.",
    "\u201cAround 125 political leaders have been killed since independence. The assassinations have been found but nothing has been disclosed on those who organized the plots. The fall of the government in 2001, the defeat of UNP government in 2004, the Easter Sunday attack, 53-day government and fall of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s government are part of conspiracies by international forces.\u00a0 Some political parties and trade unions have fallen into the trap set by these international forces,\u201d he added.
