    "Responding to the allegations related to the incident involving Ven. Ajahn Brahmawanso (Ajahn Brahm), where the Thera was held back at the airport for 12 hours, SriLankan Airlines clarified that the Thera was not originally booked to travel to Bangkok or any other destination on SriLankan Airlines but was booked on a different airline when the delay occurred.",
    "\u201cThe Thera has booked on a different airline, when the unfortunate delay occurred at Bandaranaike International Airport in the early hours of 31 May 2023. SriLankan Airlines, however, promptly stepped up and went beyond to help Venerable Ajahn Brahm to find an alternative flight.\u201d"
