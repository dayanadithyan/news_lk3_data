    "The month of May has logged a total of 9,290 Dengue cases, recording the highest monthly infections since January 2023.",
    "The previous highest was reported in January as 8,963 cases.",
    "According to the Epidemiology Unit, as of May 31, a total of 39,000 cases have been reported in 2023, with the highest number of cases being recorded from the Gampaha district as 8,692.",
    "Further, the Western Province has recorded nearly 20,000 cases, the highest in terms of provinces.",
    "Moreover, the Epidemiology Unit has identified 60 high-risk MOH areas where dengue breeding places have been found in abundance.",
    "According to health officials, the water that accumulates around homes and in small places like coconut shells, collecting trays of pots, air coolers, and tyres become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Hence, the water should always be drained out to reduce the risk of breeding these dengue-spreading mosquitoes.",
    "In this context, health authorities urge people to engage in cleanup programmes on a regular basis to destroy mosquito breeding places in order to control the spread of Dengue.\u00a0(Sheain Fernandopulle)"
