    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Deputy National Organiser S.M. Marikkar yesterday said the executive is now holding the country\u2019s independent commissions captive.",
    "\u201cTherefore, it is now doubtful if we need independent commissions based on the current Government\u2019s behaviour\u201d Marikkar said.",
    "The SJB MP said while the Election Commission of Sri Lanka is being prevented from holding polls to protect the democratic rights of the people, on the other hand, the Government is also attempting to remove the Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) for his efforts in protecting the rights of consumers.",
    "\u201cFollowing his appointment as President the current Government once again brought in 21A and re-established the commissions to ensure good governance. We too supported this effort,\u201d Marikkar recalled. However, the MP expressed his reservations regarding the government\u2019s current behaviour, leading to a growing uncertainty about the ongoing relevance and requirement of these commissions in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cThe current Government appointed the PUSCL Chairman. But if commissions are not acting as they please they are not being allowed to hold polls or stand against the increase of electricity tariffs on behalf of the people,\u201d the MP said.",
    "Marikkar warned that before long a similar fate would befall other commissions as well. \u201cThis is setting a bad precedent. The Government is pressuring current committee members to act in a manner that is favourable to them,\u201d he alleged.",
    "The MP said there is no use of independent commissions if they merely exist to do the bidding of the Government and are not able to take independent decisions.",
    "\u201cThere may be certain issues with the behaviour of the Chairman. However, he stood up for the people. If he acts in favour of the Government when it is seeking a tariff increase of 200% then what purpose would such a commission serve?\u201d the MP asked.",
    "He also confirmed that on 24 May, the SJB would vote against the proposed removal of the PUCSL Chairman. Marikkar also called on all other Commissions to be brave and not bow to the demands of the Government."
